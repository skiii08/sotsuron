Ford v Ferrari," Filled with Energy
","Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases.",9,198,257,10 September 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 - Movie Review: A New-Age Sci-Fi Classic
","For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling's character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling's character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let's get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982's Blade Runner. I don't say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it's one of the best films of 2017, and I'll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough.",10,975,1685,6 October 2017
First Man," Impressive in Scope, but a Little Light on the Drama
","When a story is brought to the big screen that practically every audience member already knows, it's hard to make a compelling film out of it. That being said, it's all about the execution and I believe First Man is definitely executed in the perfect way. After Whiplash and La La Land, director Damien Chazelle has been on every film lover's radar. While I personally don't believe this film is in the same league as his first two directorial achievements, it's definitely worth the praise it's been receiving. If you know this story already, you will learn very little from First Man, but if you're up to be swept up in a grand scope, then this one may just knock your socks off.Following Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) as he deals with family issues and the loss of good friends, this troubled, yet eager young man will do whatever it takes to lend a hand to his employers in NASA. Eventually given the opportunity to pilot the Apollo rocket that plans to land the first humans on the Moon, First Man is all about the build-up and execution. When watching a movie like this, you pretty much know how everything will turn out for most of these characters, so that particular portion of the movie was definitely a downside. That being said, the Moon landing itself is worth the price of admission alone.The way this crew captures the claustrophobia in the cockpit, down to the overall reveal of the Moon was absolutely breathtaking. I found myself sucked into this movie every time a pilot would fail at a trial run or actually accomplish what they've been setting out to achieve. Although not surprising, this movie is nothing short of fantastic when looking at the minute details of each and every aspect of filmmaking here. You truly feel as if you've followed these characters from their hardships, all the way up until they finally touch the Moon themselves. With that said, I feel the emotional core of this film could've been a little deeper.Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy deliver stellar performances in their respective roles. In fact, I believe Foy could easily receive nominations at every single one of the awards shows this coming year, but I felt slightly let down in terms of development. This film spans quite a few years and there are many significant plot details that seem to either be given very little screen time or talked about as if it has already happened in the past or is currently happening off-screen, simply because the movie doesn't have time to slow down for them. At a hefty 141 minutes, you'd think these aspects would have time to be explored further, but I never felt the emotional impact that I think director Damien Chazelle had intended.Overall, this film is riddled with things to love. From the terrific score, superb sound design, very solid performances from nearly everyone on-screen, and a climax that had me gasping for air (mainly due to the fact that this film needs to be seen in IMAX for the full effect), First Man deserves to be talked about as one of the better overall films of 2018. Although it probably won't crack my lists, I had a great time sitting in the theatre with this one. It does run a little long and it may bore some viewers throughout the second act, but I assure you that if you have patience with this one, the finale is more than worth the wait. In the end, I can confidently say, even with my nitpicks, that First Man is a great movie.",8,2,7,14 October 2018
Hereditary," A Dramatic Mind Trip Of A Horror Film
","Movies like Hereditary don't come around often enough, and that's sadly due to the fact that audiences usually don't flock out to see films that look abstract. Horror films have been on a very big high over the last few years, giving us thrilling films like Get Out or Don't Breathe, or more recently, the fantastic movie A Quiet Place. The latest wide release in this genre comes in the form of A24's Hereditary. This studio is known for releasing superb content but mostly goes under the radar. While this film surely isn't for everyone, the sheer originality behind it makes it well worth seeing in theatres. From its atmosphere to its creepy imagery, to the downright unnerving performances, here's why Heredity should be on your list of thrillers/horrors to see.The plot of this film itself is a spoiler, so I'm going to dance around that a bit here. The Grandmother of the Graham family has passed away and they're slowly trying to recover from that tragic event when surprises and secrets about their lineage come to light. That's about as simple as the plot can be put without having seen the film. The originality of the film comes in the form of the premise that has to be undisclosed until you see the film for yourself. I thought I knew what this film was going to be like when watching the trailers, but trust me when I say it's not and you're either going to love or hate the routes that this movie takes.For a film like this that relies so heavily on a family aspect, the performances need to be top notch in order to hold my interest. Toni Collette has been an actress that I've kept my eye on over the years, as I was positive she would eventually blow me away. Hereditary is absolutely that performance in my opinion. Yes, Milly Shapiro is great and Alex Wolff has his moments, but Collette acts circles around everyone throughout this film. She brought me to tears, had me gasping for air when she was monologuing, and frankly had my jaw on the floor with how realistic her performance was from beginning to end. Never breaking characters and truly making me believe I was watching a troubled mother, she sucked me right into the atmosphere of the movie.I've been hearing nothing but praise for this movie and while it definitely deserves to be talked about, I definitely had some issues with it. At times it does feel like a generic horror flick in the way that it presents certain spiritual elements or supernatural storylines, but if you can suspend your disbelief or just happen to believe in certain things, then you may be fine. I was easily able to attach myself to what was happening, but it felt like a tonal shift at times. On top of that, this movie asks a lot of you throughout the final act, which I absolutely loved, but I didn't feel quite satisfied. There is a lot of effort put into this film in terms of its cinematography and dark themes (which I have to commend), but I find myself continuously questioning certain things long after my viewing of the film. Normally I would love that, but the more I think about it just makes me wish for a slightly different ending. Hereditary is a very ambitious movie in the way that the story continues to surprise you and I personally loved watching every second of it, but looking back on the movie as a whole, I just find myself wondering if I'll ever want to watch it again. There are some very disturbing images spread throughout the film and I genuinely had goosebumps on multiple occasions, but where the film ends up throughout the conclusion left me slightly unsatisfied. This is a fantastically constructed film from start to finish, but it's not for everyone and I can see many people finding aspects of this film humorous if they're not buying into it. For myself, it's a great movie that deserves to be seen, but be ready for gruesome images, supernatural turns, and some bizarre and surprising moments.",8,9,23,9 June 2018
Rocketman," A Biopic that feels fresh and original
","When it comes to biopics, the majority of them follow a specific formula that will bring the audience from point A to point B in a way that feels very familiar. Most of the time that formula feels tired and makes for a very boring theatrical experience, so I was very excited to see that Rocketman would be taking a slightly different approach. Although it does follow many of the tropes that these biopics surrounding addicted artists follow, it does feel very fresh and presents a fun way to look at a downer story like Rocketman. Here's why it's absolutely worth your time.Telling you right off the bat that Elton John eventually developed addictions to many different substances, including emotional struggles, the film flashes back to begin with him at a very young age when he first touched the piano. Slowly going through his life until he reaches his breaking point (which is, of course, the climax), Rocketman is a very engaging film, due to the fact that it really is a musical fantasy at times, providing thought-provoking sequences that really dive deep into the meanings of a few of his hit songs. From the way certain things are presented visually to the spin that Taron Edgerton himself put on these classic songs, there was so much to love here.Speaking of Taron Edgerton, I've always been impressed by his acting chops. Whether playing a likeable crazy man in Eddie the Eagle or being a kick-ass action star in the Kingsman films, his career has been on an upward trajectory. Not in terms of box office returns, but absolutely within his performances. I've seen him improve over the years, but never did I expect to be as amazed by him as I was when watching Rocketman. Not only does he personify Elton John in a perfect way, but also brings a massive depth of drama to the role, solidifying him as one of the best actors out there today. If this movie doesn't get him any nominations by the end of this year, I fear it will be a long time before he delivers a performance this good.Director Dexter Fletcher was someone I was keeping my eye on after his work on Eddie the Eagle, which also starred Taron Edgerton in the title role. His direction on that film was very inspired and the overall movie was quite enjoyable, so I was hoping for at least another feel-good movie that he would sink his teeth into. Well, this is more than I could have ever asked for. His direction here and how the story is presented in general had me smiling from start to finish. Rocketman stands out from the crowd as being different in all the best ways.In the end, Rocketman is a fun, emotional, and at times deep ride from start to finish. From the insanely good musical numbers to Edgerton's incredible performance, from the emphatic soundtrack to the grand visuals, everything about this movie felt inspired. This will probably go down as one of the best, if not the best biopic of 2019. Rocketman deserves a large audience and I think those who seek this one out will find a lot to like unless for some reason musicals turn you off. If you're someone who doesn't find any enjoyment whatsoever when watching a musical, then this one may not be for you. For me, I loved watching this one.",9,2,3,3 June 2019
A Star Is Born," One of the Best Remakes Ever Made
","While I'm not particularly a fan of remakes, unless the original film was terrible to begin with, A Star is Born has been a film that's been remade numerous times since the original version from 1937. Upon hearing the announcement that this 2018 version would be coming along, I decided to revisit the previous three renditions of this tale, with the original 30s version being the standout version in my personal opinion. With that said, I was highly looking forward to this movie in particular, due to the fact that the cast behind this film has already proven themselves to be talented in the past and Bradley Cooper stepping in to write and direct only peaked my interest more. A Star is Born is one of the best films of 2018 and one of my favourite remakes of all time.Following Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) as he stumbles across a struggling artist in Ally (Lady Gaga), they form an unlikely bond that very quickly gives her fame and fortune, if not in the best ways. Jack is a very detailed character here, being a drunk, having family issues, and struggling with his fame, while Alley is pretty much the exact opposite of that. This made for some terrific drama and the third act of this film brought me to tears. Between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, I think you'd be crazy to believe this movie isn't going to give them both many awards in the coming months, but I truly believe Sam Elliot may give the best performance in the film. The way he subtly displays emotion here was absolutely brilliant and I think he deserves the most recognition for that. His character is fresh and has never been seen in any of the previous versions of this story, which was a pleasant surprise.When people reflect back on this film, they may remember it for the performances or where the story progresses from start to finish, but the music plays a very large role here. Although this isn't a musical, the original songs throughout this film are characters themselves. Throughout the film, you'll hear heavy Rock, Country, and even Hip-Hop, which caught me by surprise, but each song helps to deepen the characterization of either Ally or Jack and it was incredible to witness. Where I think some viewers may find issues, however, is in the fact that this film takes place over quite a long period of time.After the second act of this film concludes, it does speed up the pace and slightly jumps through time on multiple occasions, asking the audience to follow along without giving any definitive answer as to how much time has really passed, but I personally didn't find it necessary and the natural progression was felt by me, personally. The way this film is stitched together in editing was terrific in my opinion and only elevated the concert sequences, as well as the calm moments between characters. Sound and music drive this story and the editing around it all was very much present here and very well done.In the end, although the core story has remained the same through the years and the conclusion probably won't surprise those who have seen the previous versions of this story, there is enough of a fresh take here to please fans and newcomers. This 2018 version of A Star is Born takes the best elements from the past and injects new life that added many layers to these characters. Aside from a few jarring instances that come out of nowhere story-wise, I truly don't have many complaints. This movie worked for me on an entertainment level, as well as an emotional level and it's one of the best movies I've seen all year.",10,2,3,15 October 2018
Darkest Hour," See It For The Performance
","True Stories flood cinemas around the world all year long. Quite frankly, the majority of original content in terms of filmmaking all comes from a pre-existing story. Ideas are running out in terms of originality, but great films are still being made regardless and Darkest Hour is one of them. Depending on how you look at Darkest Hour, it's definitely worth mentioning when reflecting on the better movies of 2017. From performances to well-written dialogue, this is a film that transports you into this time period during the hard political times and keeps you intrigued throughout every moment. Although this experience may be a slow burn for some viewers, here's why I believe Darkest Hour deserves your time.Whether or not he's successful in the end isn't the point of this film, but Darkest Hour follows the recent appointing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he strives to find the best way to course correct during World War II. Having to decide whether or not to negotiate with Hitler, this movie treads on familiar historical accuracies, while also providing a few new pieces of insight that I was unaware of. The overall plot of this film is quite simple, but it's the intricacies of the dialogue and where the writers choose to take the character of Churchill throughout the film that truly makes it a worthy viewing experience.Gary Oldman plays the both loved and hated Prime Minister and I must say, after experiencing this performance for myself, it's going to take a lot for another actor to deserve winning all the lead actor awards this coming season. Whether he's being comedic for dramatic relief or going all out in one of his speeches, I was truly blown away by how he transformed himself into this historical figure. Yes, that's also due to great direction by Joe Wright and incredibly prosthetic work to complete his performance, but those are all elements that work toward creating a great feature as a whole. Direction and performances were pitch perfect here, but the pacing is where I'd have no make my one complaint.For myself, the dialogue kept the film moving at a very brisk pace, especially a specific sequence involving Churchill riding the subway. If you ever find yourself bored when watching this film, I believe this one scene will win you over. I was truly moved by the way that scene played out. That being said, Darkest Hour doesn't exactly have the action that a film like Dunkirk had earlier this year and that will definitely turn people off. Darkest Hour is more in line with movies like The Social Network or Steve Jobs in terms of letting dialogue drive the entire film. That's a hard pill for some people to swallow, but it really worked for me here, which is why it's such a mild complaint.In the end, Darkest Hour proves that a film doesn't need to be exciting in the conventional ways in order to please moviegoers. I was riveted by certain scenes, simply due to the context of the dialogue being spoken. The drab look and slow pacing would've normally wished for the film to end, but everything about this film was just so well done. From perfect musical cues to performances that will have many in tears, I think Darkest Hour is easily one of the best movies of 2017. Once again, I just have to stress how incredibly talented Gary Oldman is in this role. If you find yourself not enjoying this movie as much as I did, I can guarantee his performance will at least pique your interest in a few key scenes. I highly recommend this film.",9,1,7,4 January 2018
Captain Marvel," A Solid, If Not Spectacular MCU Entry
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been an impressive run of films, whether you have loved every one of them or not. In my opinion, ranging from mediocre to fantastic, this franchise has had its ups and downs like any, but nothing has really been a huge misstep, as producer Kevin Feige has been steering this ship in a safe direction from start to finish. Captain Marvel is the latest introduction to a character in this franchise and while it may not rank among the best films this franchise has had to offer thus far, it's a welcome addition to the family, so to speak.Following Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as she discovers her past and learns who she used to be on Earth, a relationship forms between her and a few familiar faces from Shield, mainly in Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). With a war between the two races of Kree and Skrulls, Carol finds herself caught in the middle of it all, while also discovering her past along the way. Filled with enough energy to keep you engaged from start to finish, this is a breezy addition to the franchise as a whole. Sadly, I don't feel that this film explored any of the characters enough and it really did feel like a stepping stone for a larger story to be told in the future.Feeling very much like the early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with movies like Thor or Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain Marvel has a very solid introduction to this universe, but there's a lot of room to improve. Brie Larson delivers a solid performance here and I look forward to seeing more from this character in future instalments, but I wasn't blown away by any means. Aside from an interesting backstory, she really isn't given anything to do and almost seems unbeatable, which is kind of a draw-back for future stakes that may arise. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson's chemistry is easily the biggest highlight of this film and will probably keep even the uninterested fans entertained.Captain Marvel gets off to a very messy start throughout the first 20 minutes. It finds its footing very fast, but I must admit that I was very worried when the movie first began. The way her past is quickly thrown in and jumbled around to set-up the rest of the film felt a little rushed, but the movie does slow down to a nice pace. It's not that I have a lot to complain about here, but there truly wasn't anything that wowed me about this film, which was disappointing, considering it's the final film that leads into the culmination of the last ten years with Avengers: Endgame.In the end, Captain Marvel doesn't do a whole lot to dazzle, but it works very well as a standalone origin for this character. I enjoyed myself quite a bit, but this formula has been done over and over again throughout the course of these 21 films and although the formula works, I feel something new has to be done once Avengers: Endgame brings this first segment of this universe to a close. I had a lot of fun with Captain Marvel, but it's by no means a great movie. I definitely recommend it to fans of this franchise (who will be the most impacted from it) and to those who are simply looking for a fun superhero flick. Captain Marvel delivered for me, but there was a lot that could have been improved upon.",8,2,4,9 March 2019
Last Flag Flying," Another Great Linklater Script
","I'll come right out and state the fact that I'm a huge fan of Richard Linklater. The way he writes and directs his performers mesmerizes me. By those standards, I feel that he's still one of the best in the business working today. From Before Sunrise, to Dazed and Confused, to even his recent works in Boyhood and Everybody Wants Some!!, I find myself liking his body of work more and more. So, please take this review with a grain of salt, but I truly feel that his latest film, Last Flag Flying, is easily one of the best movies to come out in 2017 and also one of the most underrated. This film has slipped pretty far under the radar, and that upsets me because this is just about the most sincere and honest piece of filmmaking to come from last year.Based on a true story, Last Flag Flying follows Richard (Steve Carell), a former United States Marine who is informed that his son (who's also in the Marines) has been killed in combat. Seeking the help of his old friends in Sal and Mueller from decades ago, they embark on a quest to bring Richard's son's body home, as he doesn't want him buried with the rest of his crew. This is literally the only major plot that's followed throughout the film, but there's so much going on under the surface for each character that I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It never hurts when you have a director that knows exactly how to work with actors and ends up getting lucky with some of the most talented actors in these roles.Linklater's films have always been about the characters first and foremost. If you don't buy into any of the characters, then it's highly unlikely that you'll end up enjoying the movie. That being said, each one of these characters is distinctly different, but Carell, Cranston, and Fishburne all do their utmost to truly embody these figures. Once again, I found myself invested in each and every scene, being moved along by the terrifically written dialogue from start to finish. The conversations between characters feel so natural, and that all comes back (once again) to writer/director Richard Linklater.His unique/natural writing always leaps off the screen and his directing isn't too shabby either, but I feel the true star of this film is the story itself. It really makes you take a step back and appreciate what you had in the past because the future isn't always sunshine and rainbows. Even through dark times, there's always light to brighten up certain situations. The final act of this film left me in tears, due to the fact that I had no clue who any of these characters were in the beginning, and found myself attached to whatever they were going to say next by the end.In the end, although very slow-moving, the dialogue moves Last Flag Flying along at a very brisk pace. This two-hour picture feels about 90 minutes long in my opinion and if you're into hard-hitting dramas, then I'd have to recommend looking no further than this. An older demographic will definitely get more out of this film than the millennials of today, but that's not to say that everyone can't enjoy this movie. Meticulously directed in terms of character, wonderfully written in terms of dialogue, and impeccably executed in terms of bringing the audience from point A to point B throughout long periods of time, this is a road trip movie that will have you laughing out loud and weeping all at once. I can't recommend Last Flag Flying enough.",10,5,9,29 January 2018
Us," Great Ideas with (Mostly) Successful Execution
","Ever since Jordan Peele shocked filmgoers around the world with his fantastic directorial debut in Get Out, it should've been no surprise that people would eagerly be awaiting his next project. Us marks his second outing as a feature film director and this time, he dives much further into the horror genre than he did with Get Out. I absolutely loved watching this film, but it's not without its flaws. Depending on the way you look at this film as a whole or how you see the ending itself, you may find yourself finding it flawless, but everyone views films differently, so as always, please take my review with a grain of salt.Following the Wilson family as they begin their summer vacation at a cabin on the lake, Adelaide (the mother) begins to recall moments from her childhood, as a family then invades their home. Realizing the family is actually themselves, a large sense of mystery begins to shroud the film. Personally, the overall premise of this film absolutely astounded me and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout nearly the entire runtime. If there's one thing this film does right, it's in keeping the audience engaged.Without giving anything away, the film slightly began to lose my grasp throughout the final act. Yes, the storytelling remained clever as everything was being revealed, but the way everything unravelled left a little more to be desired, at least to me. What saved it were the devoted performances by the entire cast from start to finish and a couple neat twists before the film truly comes to an end. There are some bizarre images that still have me thinking, but I believe that was the intention, so I will let them slide.Other than events in the third act, this is a very tight concept that was throughout engaging throughout. It's fairly early in the year to speak about Oscar chances for performances, but I'll just be completely honest with myself and state that an actress is truly going to have to pull off a miracle to have me believing someone will be more deserving than Lupita Nyong'o for best actress. Her performance floored me and I couldn't divert my eyes for a second.In the end, Us is the kind of film that gives you a fantastic set-up, presents a very enjoyable second act to back it up and is filled with a tremendously eerie score that sent chills down my spine. I do feel the movie falls into the territory of predictability throughout the third act, but at least it commits to the revelations and doesn't make any mistakes in going for it. I may not think this is a perfect film, but Jordan Peele has put together another great film, worth revisiting over and over again to dissect. I applaud every aspect of this film, even if I didn't quite love it. Definitely check it out, especially if you're a fan of the horror genre.",8,1,3,26 March 2019
Knives Out," A Fantastically Clever Whodunnit
","From Looper to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Arian Johnson has been a filmmaker on the rise for the last number of years. Although many Star Wars fans seem to not like his addition to the Star Wars franchise, I loved it and I believe him to be one of the greatest directors out there today. My love for him as a filmmaker alone had me excited for his newest release in Knives Out. He took a step backward since his last outing, writing a directing a very small movie with a very large feel. This move was the best thing he could have possibly done for his career, because he has made one hell of a crowd pleaser. Knives Out is terrific and here's why it's worth your time.Following the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), his entire family is questioned about his sudden demise. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) oversees this investigation and believes there to be a lot hidden under the surface of this story. This begins the story and classic 'whodunnit' feel. There is something that feels very tradition about this movie, with updated dialogue and very unique camerawork to make it a fantastic watch. This movie is pretty much as good as you can get with a story like this these days. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Knives Out.I can praise Rian Johnson for writing a clever screenplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is does, or I can gush about the precise cinematography that is incredibly well-done, but this film is held together by an insanely talented cast who are all having a blast. If not for this stellar cast committing to these wacky and hilarious characters, then Knives Out would have been pretty boring. This movie benefits from the comedy and I think this cast has a lot to do with that. With that said, this film isn't quite perfect.Even though nitpicking a movie like this is kind of ridiculous, due to the nature of it needing to contain twists and turns, I have to admit that the movie is slightly predictable, even though it leads you to believe it's not. Without ruining anything, it becomes fairly obvious where things will go after a certain point, so that was a detriment for me. Thankfully, the way everything is presented is very clever and definitely showcases the reveals in ways you're not expecting. Even if you figure out what happened, you won't be able to predict how it happened, and I really appreciated that aspect.In the end, Knives Out has a nice blend of suspense and comedy to keep almost audiences engaged. I found this blend to be great and would happily revisit these characters again in the future. With fantastic writing and directing by Rian Johnson and a cast that's giving their all in the funnest way possible, it's hard not to like this one. For fans of murder mysteries, comedies, or even any of these performers, I highly recommend checking out Knives Out.",9,1,9,1 December 2019
The Irishman," A Fantastic Piece of Filmmaking
","I may be missing one or two that have been released over the last decade, but the last time I remember really liking a film based around the mob was probably American Gangster back in 2007. Netflix has been on fire lately with their feature films. From last year's Roma winning Best Foreign Film and now The Irishman winning many awards, along with their upcoming release in Marriage Story, they are proving to be a genuine film studio. At a very lengthy 209 minutes, The Irishman has now finished its film festival run and is now streaming on Netflix. I'm not going to beat around the bush. This film is simply one of the best films of 2019 by far and possibly even the decade.Based on the true story, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is a recently fired truck driver who has stumbled his way into becoming a mobster, teaming up with leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Chronicling these events through the years, we get to see a large portion of the life of this man and how his past has now become his permanent present. With the addition of Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), this film is filled with rich characters. You definitely can't complain about the main characters being underdeveloped here, because their amount of screentime and endless dialogue make for a very fleshed out piece of filmmaking.Superbly directed by Martin Scorsese, I would say this movie is his best work since Hugo or The Departed, but this film is better than both of those in my opinion. Although I haven't seen his entire filmography, I would have to go back to Goodfellas from 1990 to find a better film of his. I found The Irishman (although slightly long) to be his best film in many, many years. Each frame of this movie screams filmmaking and I was glued to the screen from start to finish. This film deserves all the attention it's getting and Scorsese is a major reason for that.Writing films like Schindler's List and Moneyball, Steven Zaillian is no stranger to penning award-worthy screenplays, and while I believe he absolutely deserves all the attention in the world once again, it's really Charles Brandt who stands out to me. Having hardly written anything noteworthy before teaming up with Zaillian, I'm very impressed at his work here. I'm not sure who contributed more, but for a writer who is only just beginning to build a resume, it doesn't get much better than this. Bravo sir.I could gush about this movie for hours, but I'll wrap it up. The Irishman proves that Martin Scorsese will never lose touch as a director, seeing this trio of actors on-screen will probably never happen again, the cinematography is Oscar-worthy, the deserves to win many awards, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film takes home many of the top prizes this year. Yes, it's a little long, but it's incredibly engaging. The length is really my only minor nitpick. Other than that, this film is one of the best films in recent years and will probably be remembered as a Scorsese classic in the years to come.",10,4,10,5 December 2019
Aquaman," A Likeable Leading Man on a Wild Ride
","It's always a pleasure to see a studio recognize their flaws and do their best to correct the mistakes that caused them so much heartache in the past. With a very enjoyable Man of Steel setting a tone that would be completely overdone by the time Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice hit theatres, it was only a matter of time before they decided to change it up. Suicide Squad was financially successful, but admittedly a step in the wrong direction. Justice League was a mess of a movie, but the saving grace of the franchise will always be known as Wonder Woman. Loved by critics and fans across the globe, DC and Warner Brothers decided to steer the ship in a new direction, taking a step into the past and creating origin stories for the characters we've only briefly seen. It worked with Wonder Woman, and I'm happy to say that I believe it's also working with Aquaman.Being very, very loosely tied to the previous films (almost not at all), Aquaman sees Arthur Curry go from an infant to a full-grown man. Being a half-breed from both land in our world and the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, he comes to the realization that he's the rightful heir to the throne. Challenged by his only brother who despises his existence, this creates tension amongst the people. With some very likable side characters and others who will more than likely have repercussions in future installments, there's a lot to like about this film in terms of character and story, which is what I was expecting to find lacking.Jason Momoa once again demands the audience's attention as he completely invests himself in this wacky character. His charisma is easily one of the highlights of this film and his many journeys with Amber Heard's Mera are a blast to watch. This is a film filled with tons of adventure and I was on the edge of my seat throughout a lot of it. It's visually stunning (for the most part) and I found that made it the biggest looking film of the franchise in terms of scope. Although it does borrow from pretty much every movie you've ever seen, it mixes in enough new content to differentiate itself from others.As it seems from my review, I had a blast watching Aquaman, but it's by no means a perfect movie, even by the standards set by this franchise. Patrick Wilson plays King Orm, Arthur's younger brother and although his motivations are clear, his portrayal is quite over-the-top. I personally took issue with this, as he's in quite a bit of the film. The disposable villains of this film actually have quite a bit of depth and backstory but are highly under-utilized. I felt like they were part of a set-up for something bigger in the future. Without ruining it, the scenes where these characters are used are very well-done, so it's a very minor flaw in my opinion. There are many small issues I have with the movie as a whole, but in retrospect, they're all nitpicks.In the end, Aquaman embraces the fact that the premise of an underwater city is ridiculous and runs with that from beginning to end. From giant sea battles to genuine heart-to-heart moments between characters that stood out to me, this is a film that has every I like about good blockbusters. While it's not one of the best superhero films I've ever seen, it's a joy to watch and easily in the discussion for as one of the best movies of this franchise. If you're a fan of comic-based films, I'd definitely suggest giving this one a shot.",8,0,0,18 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Just as Good as Its Predecessor
","I'll start off and be completely honest in saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first Deadpool film, but wasn't blown away or busting a gut laughing from start to finish. The meta jokes were fantastic and the story itself was even quite engaging, but it wore thin for me by the third act. That being said, I found myself hoping that a sequel would be even better. Deadpool 2 has just hit the big screen, and while I can't say it's a funnier movie, I can say the film itself is a vast improvement when looking at the filmmaking alone. This movie does a good job of creating new jokes and even making old jokes funny again, but there's something about these movies that has me having a hard time falling in love with them. Here's why Deadpool 2 comes highly recommended for fans, but not at all for anyone else.Quite a few plot devices are used here, but without getting to any spoilers, Deadpool 2 follows Wade Wilson once again, as he feels the need to protect a young boy with superpowers, while a time-traveling mutant in Cable is one the rise, hunting this boy down. From realizing that he may just work better with partners, to realizing that he may love more than just himself, there are a lot of storylines and emotional aspects that elevate this from another average superhero comedy. I found myself shocked to see how much time was spent on action or drama, instead of the need to always joke around. Yes, this movie is riddled with humor from start to finish, but this felt like a more mature version of the previous film.As far as the humor itself goes, I mentioned that I quite enjoyed what they did with the first movie, but felt that it wore out by the end. This time around, the jokes felt a little more spread out, which is why I believe they worked better here, so I could catch a breath and not be hounded with excessive amounts of comedy. You may actually feel differently about that because there are jokes throughout certain dramatic moments, but I chose to see it as a dramatic moment, rather than a comedic one. So I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice blend of those two genres.Ryan Reynolds continues to prove that he was born to play this role. Not many actors/actresses can prove that they were meant to act in a specific role, but Reynolds is definitely one of the few who can. It goes without saying that his heart is in these movies until the very end, so how was the supporting cast? Josh Brolin delivers a solid performance as Cable, but I feel as though he comes out of nowhere during the beginning of the movie. I felt a little short-changed in terms of his development. His screen time vastly increases by the end and made his character worth it, but I still wished to see a little more from him.Everyone has been seeing images and footage in the trailers for the tease at the X-Force team that Deadpool recruits here, and I can say that their screen time is easily one of the highlights of the entire film. Looking back on the movie, the character of Domino (played by Zazie Beetz) is easily my favorite in the entire film. Her ability is hilarious and very unique in combat, and each of these characters just added another level to the movie, whether they were shining in an action sequence, or just there to make the audience laugh, or leave them shocked.In the end, I enjoyed this sequel just as much as its predecessor. I thought the first movie lacked a tone that this one presented, but the comedy will impress viewers more in the first film, so there is a balance that really has me debating which one I liked more. Deadpool 2 benefits from very solid direction from David Leitch and the fact that Ryan Reynolds joined writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick made it feel a little different from the first. The first movie was a celebration that a movie like this could be made, but this one dives a little deeper and I quite enjoyed that about it. While I don't love either of these movies, they are a blast to watch. Deadpool 2 has its issues, but it's a solid movie all around.",7,1,3,20 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Marvel Studios Has Done It Again
","The Thor films haven't exactly been my favorite additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but they've still been fun escapes at the cinema upon each release. That being said, Thor: Ragnarok has definitely righted that ship in a new direction, being one of the most enjoyably entertaining films that Marvel Studios has produced since maybe even the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes, that's saying a lot, but I haven't been this thoroughly entertained by this franchise in quite some time. Yes, there are far better films throughout this franchise, but this is a very welcome addition and definitely staples itself as the best of the three Thor films. Even if you aren't a fan of these movies, this film feels very different from the others, so if you can go into this movie with an open mind, then I honestly can't praise this movie enough. Here is why Thor: Ragnarok is such a fun experience at the movies.When it comes to the character of Thor (played impeccably well by Chris Hemsworth), he's probably been the least interesting character to be given a solo outing in my opinion, although still enjoyable. This film was able to change my mind on that, injecting eons of humor from start to finish and giving him a much bigger purpose after certain events go down throughout the first act. Chris Hemsworth's performance continues to improve throughout each film, becoming wittier and making you wish for more of him in the future.The plot of this film is as follows; Hela has invaded Asgard and wants to rule all nine realms, as well as everything in the cosmos that surround them. That's simple enough, but add in the fact that Thor and Loki are lost on an unknown planet and must deal with the fact that the Hulk is being used as a puppet in a wrestling arena, all while finding a way back to their homeworld in order to prevent devastation, and you've got one hell of a fun ride. This movie never lets up in terms of pacing, giving us new characters to either laugh with, mourn over, or be given a backstory to. The reason this movie works so well is easily due to the writing and direction by Taika Watiti.Watiti's vision is probably more present than any of the directors throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far. His wacky style and comedic tone makes you feel like you're watching a spoof of the Thor character, but in reality, it's just a fun spin, injecting new life into a portion of this Universe that has been slowly deteriorating. It's very gutsy to give nearly full control of your movie to a director when you have 16 other films to stay in line with and be slightly connected to, but it was definitely a risk worth taking. This is easily one of the funniest films throughout any of these movies, and that never seemed to be a negative throughout my experience. This movie is simply a blast to watch.In the end, although I won't find myself praising this movie for being as fantastic as a Captain America: Civil War, this is easily one of the best sequels that have come from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even though it's still connected and the formula of this series works like a television series that requires you to have seen the previous movies in order to fully understand every little detail, this movie still works on its own as an awesome action/comedy.Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Tessa Thompson, and Mark Ruffalo share some of the best chemistry I've seen all year and even though they're just having fun on set, sometimes that's all that matters when it comes to entertainment. There's just enough emotion to keep the movie going and giving the climax a purpose, and you really do care about who lives and who dies. The visual effects are beautiful to look at on the big screen and the action sequences are incredibly fun to behold. Yes, it follows the formula that most of the films in this franchise do, but it has a new spin that I just ate up. Aside from a few scenes that seem to drag or slow down, Thor Ragnarok really doesn't have a dull moment. This movie is a complete blast from start to finish.",9,3,11,3 November 2017
Ready Player One," The Definition of Escapism
","With all of the sequels and reboots as of late, it's hard to imagine a time when an audience wouldn't be sick of a movie based on pop culture. When watching the trailers for Ready Player One, it almost seems like a story that exists to put people in the theatre, solely based on the references alone. While that's definitely not an arguable statement upon leaving the theatre one the credits begin to roll, it's almost impossible to say that Ready Player One isn't at least a little bit of fun. In fact, if you're someone who has seen a lot of films, played some video games, or can appreciate a reference that's done in a fun and tasteful way, then this movie may just be the most fun you'll have at the movies this year. Here's why (even with its flaws) this is a movie worth seeing on the big screen.Set in the year 2045, Ready Player One follows Wade Watts, as he attempts to beat missions in a game called the Oasis. It's a virtual reality that people use to escape from the horrors that Earth has become. Filled with a wide variety of people and characters, this film represents what online gaming would be like if it took over the world. It's a scary thought to think that we may make it there one day, but nevertheless, the idea itself makes for quite the adventure of a movie. From pop-culture references to romance, to music that will have you tapping your feet and cheering for each and every hero, Ready Player One has it all.Directed by Steven Spielberg, whose many works are sprinkled throughout this movie, Ready Player One benefits from the care and meticulous effort put in, in order to make the most adventurous and fun film made out of blatant references. Spielberg is one of the best in the business and will always be. It's nice to see him breaking free of his string of dramas that he's been on lately, in order to go back to his roots of good old fashion adventure and magic. It's definitely a lot to take in and I can't see everyone seeing every reference or story point (which could be a big issue for some), but as someone who has seen, played, or could at least understand everything throughout the course of my first viewing experience, I had an absolute blast from start to finish.My biggest issue with this movie is that it tells you everything, leaving no room for you to figure things out on your own. While the first act has some terrific narration and I was into everything that Tye Sheridan was bringing to the character of Wade, Ready Player One continuously makes you feel like you're reading a novel or playing a video game, solely due to the narration or scenes where characters feel the need to explain everything. It's this aspect that makes this movie feel slightly long at times, due to the fact that you're left experiencing everything, instead of sharing that experience with a bit of mystery.In the end, my complaints about Ready Player One are far outweighed by my overall experience. From the fun nods to classic movies and blatant set pieces that come directly from classic film sets, I found myself in awe at times. The virtual world takes a while to get used to and the contrast from real to fake can be jarring at times, but its unique look quite frankly had me amazed. With a terrific score, solid performances, a fun premise with enjoyable side stories, and conclusion that feels earned and satisfying, Ready Player One is everything you could want from a blockbuster by Steven Spielberg. Yes, it has its issues, but I challenge you to explain a world where a movie like this could be perfect. For everything that it sets out to achieve, Ready Player One is a great ride to take at the cinema.",8,0,5,29 March 2018
"I, Tonya"," A Well-Acted Drama
","As I've said throughout countless reviews in the past, true stories are hardly ever completely honest. The quality of a film that's based on a true story has nothing to do with the fact that the true story was incredible or not because there's no way of knowing if everything's true unless you're the character it's based on. That being said, I, Tonya is one of the latest feature films (based on a true story) to receive a theatrical release. Gaining buzz for awards season, this is a very relevant story for today's climate. Yes, this film was made before all of these allegation stories made their way into the public eye, but I, Tonya deals with this particular notion in a very grand fashion. While I don't particularly like any of the characters throughout this entire movie, here's why I believe this to be a movie that people will love to hate.Following Tonya Harding, an unlikely figure skater, due to her foul mouth and horrific upbringing, I, Tonya is about her rise to power and continual falls from grace. Falling in love with a man who (deep down) is just as violent a cruel as she is, their relationship finds a way of working out, most of the time. This film asks you to applaud for a despicable woman and try to forget about how she treats the people around her. Yes, she's talented, but it's hard to root for a woman that acts like this, especially when the entire film revolves around her. I'm sure aspects of this story have been exaggerated or made up entirely, but there are clever editing and writing techniques to make certain dramatic sequences quite funny at times.Margot Robbie, Sebastien Stan, and Allison Janney are all terrific and believable as these characters, with the most notable one being Stan's portrayal of Tonya's husband Jeff. In my opinion, he was the standout of this film, because even though I've seen and enjoyed his performances in the past, most of them fell in comparison to everyone else in each film he appeared in. I'm simply stating that he's the standout to me, due to the fact that I've never seen him deliver a better performance than this and I don't think I ever will. The performances sell this film, but the true star of this movie is the editor (excluding the very off-putting visual effects of the skater's faces).From cutting seamlessly between scenes with the brilliant use of sound effects, to quick cuts to show the progression of time, to the long takes exploring a character breakdown, there are many technical aspects about this film to gawk at. I found myself enthralled by the way this film was put together in terms of its structure. It's very rare that I leave a movie and find the most interesting aspect to be the editing choices, especially when everything else about the movie is just as great. Quite honestly, aside from a few plot points being brushed over, this was a terrific film from start to finish.In the end, I, Tonya impressed me on many levels. From its use of fourth wall breaking to each and every performance seeming extremely committed to the use of unique editing, to the direction that seemed calm and focussed throughout the dramatic moments, this is a ride that I believe is worth taking. Although it doesn't quite offer the truth and literally states that certain things may or may not have happened, it's told in a perfect way for a feature film. This movie deserves its award buzz and I believe it's a great movie that people should check out.",9,8,15,17 January 2018
Molly's Game," A Fantastically Written Drama
","Adapted from the novel by Molly Bloom (the subject of the film), Aaron Sorkin has officially stepped up to helm his first film as both writer and director. Most notable for his screenwriting work on The Social Network, Moneyball, or Charlie Wilson's War (just to name a few), I've always had a love for anything he writes. His screenplays always place the dialogue in the forefront, making for a very intense drama on almost every account. Even if the material is dull, he always finds a way to pick up the pace and make it an interesting and engaging experience for audiences. Molly's Game is his latest film that's about to hit the big screen, and once again, his style is as engaging as ever. You should keep your eye out for the release of this film.Opening with a very stylish sequence involving her past as an Olympic skier, we quickly learn that her character has been through a lot and will be a very devoted person throughout the course of the movie. From then on, this film is a series if dialogue-driven scenes that never seem to stop until the credits roll. Throwing you into the life of Molly as a waitress, only to see her grow into a woman who assists in running a high-roller underground poker event, this film wastes no time on the small stuff. Whenever it seems as though a certain plot point is starting to drag, it jumps forward in time, either immersing you in an intense game of poker, an emotional moment with a family member, or simply a double-cross by one of the players.Characters state that everything going on is technically legal, but you'll still find yourself wondering, which is the beauty of such a well-written screenplay. This movie doesn't create an overdone conclusion because that's not the point of this film. This film exists to prove that this woman was innocent in what she had done and that everything was legal along the way. Sure, there are moments of tension between characters, but the film has much more heart behind it as well. This screenplay deserves a nomination of some kind, there's no doubt about that, but is the direction just as impressive as the script?When writers or even actors step into the director's chair, it's always a risk for the studio. They could be fantastic and make the right step for their career, or it could end up where they should've stuck to what they knew best. Happily, Aaron Sorkin is definitely worthy of making films in my opinion. No, the visceral imagery and camerawork that comes from a film directed by the likes of a David Fincher (who he has worked with in the past) are certainly not present here, but that's not to say he did a bad job in the slightest. Molly's Game is above average in terms of direction and I can see him continuing to pursue this area of his career and doing an even better job. He was clearly passionate about this particular story and I believe his choices paid off in spades.In the end, I believe Molly's Game will definitely be up for a few awards this coming season, due to its devoted cast and crew throughout the entire production. From its inspired editing by a trio of editors who have worked on some pretty large productions to its Oscar-worthy screenplay, to its intense moments of dialogue and surprise turns throughout each act, this is not a film to miss. Yes, I feel as though it may be about 10-15 minutes too long, but some of the greatest films of all time are nearly four hours and even those films feel unnecessarily long. Molly's Game is slightly drawn out, but it's a superb picture nonetheless. I loved my experience with this film and I highly recommend checking it out when it hits theatres.",9,2,7,22 December 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," One Of The Best Films Of The Year
","It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile.From the very first few frames of this film, you can tell the tone will be handled perfectly. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh with pure class, you can tell that he was very passionate when bringing this film to fruition. Every line of dialogue either progressed the story along, developed a character, made the audience laugh, or provided deep insight into the event of the murder itself. While not having the bearings of a conventional murder mystery, many viewers may not like the way this film concludes, but in the context of the movie as a whole and everything it's setting out to accomplish, it really does have a realistic and true finale.It's arguable that some of the law enforcement officers play just as significant a role as Mildred does throughout the film, being pretty much present every time a revelation occurs, but I gravitated the most towards Officer Dixon. I've always been a huge fan of Sam Rockwell, and his character here is one of the most essential to this story, set on being there from beginning to end, trying his absolute best to be of any help. While Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Chief Willoughby is by far the most important to the story at hand, it's the characters around him that drive him to his actions throughout the course of the movie. The characters are truly what make this film as likable as it is, and they're all wonderfully drawn.Overall, when looking back on my experience watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, I find myself not being able to wait until its official theatrical release to watch it again. I found this film to be stellar in every sense of the word. From a noteworthy performance by Francis McDormand, devoted secondary performances, a screenplay that will have you consistently laughing, while also being emotionally involved with the serious storyline at hand, and pulling the audience in with its subtly composed score, everything about this film is worth praise. This was a huge surprise for me and I can't recommend you checking it out enough. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a fantastic piece of modern cinema.",10,29,67,2 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Satisfying Conclusion to the Saga
","It's now the end of an era for yet another franchise in 2019. Love or hate where this franchise has taken you throughout the years, it really should still be thought of as one of the greatest franchises of all time. Spanning decades, this series of films has divided its fan base for years, starting most notably with Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. After the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I found myself incredibly invigorated, wanting to see where this new story was headed. Sadly, it's very obvious that there wasn't much of a plan from the beginning. With that said, here's why I still believe this movie serves as a fitting conclusion to this new trilogy and the saga as a whole.Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker picks up roughly a year after the events of the previous film. Emporer Palpatine is back without much explanation at first and the trio of Rey, Finn, and Poe are off on side mission with a very specific goal in mind. This film takes a while to find its footing, as the first act of the movie is all about trying to have a fun adventure, while also trying to give answers to burning questions. By the end of this film, I was completely invested in where it ended up, even if I did feel like certain aspects were rushed through or messy.I didn't see these films until Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith hit theatres in 2005. It was in that time period where I visited the franchise for the first time and really started loving it. Quite honestly, I look at this franchise very optimistically and Episodes 1 and 2 are truly the only films in the franchise that I dislike. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker falls somewhere in the middle of the franchise in terms of overall plotting and resolve, but I have to say that it might just have the best and biggest finale. Yes, there are head-scratching moments and this finale clearly going to please everyone, but it pleased me, what else can I say?Without getting into specific details, Daisy Ridley as Rey and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren/Ben are two of the franchise's best actors/characters in my opinion. Their arcs are taken to new levels here and I was incredibly satisfied with them, as well as how well Poe and Finn were incorporated into this film. There are returning faces and unique ways of bringing the entire saga to a close, so I really didn't find myself annoyed or bothered with too many things here, even with the twists. The one thing that was very apparent, however, was the fact that they didn't have a plan since Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This absolutely hurts certain portions of the film, as it struggles to tie the events together of the previous movies, while also trying to finish the saga.In the end, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is not a perfect movie by any means, but there are so many worse ways they could've ended this story. John Williams is at the top of his game with his score, the performances are all fantastic, there are fitting ends to classic characters, new characters, as well as story threads that have been completed. There are moments of this movie that took me out of the overall experience, but I would be lying if I didn't say that the majority of the movie is very, very solid. I believe J.J. Abrams did the absolute best that he could to finish this saga and I'm very satisfied with the end result. If you're a fan of this franchise, I would absolutely recommend checking out the finale.",8,1,5,21 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A Memorable Movie-Going Experience
","It's inevitable. Multiple biopics are now created on a yearly basis, and will continue to be made until the end of time. In my opinion, if not a single writer can come up with an original concept, then exploring the true story of someone or something is far more interesting than remaking a classic film. Bohemian Rhapsody is the latest in a long line of already released and upcoming biopics-and it's one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've had all year. Already thinking I knew a lot about this story before going in, I was pleasantly surprised by quite a few aspects of this story. Whether or not you're a fan of the band Queen or not, this movie has the makings of a film that can please many viewers. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and here's why.I knew Bohemian Rhapsody was a movie that was going to heavily focus on Freddie Mercury over the rest of the band, which I thought was going to feel imbalanced, but the way his story is presented here makes it seem like his life had the most story to tell. From working at an airport to performing one of the most memorable concerts in history, this film takes you on a decade-long journey that's well worth your time. I was never bored, because it either wows you with spectacle, engages you with its drama, or has you guessing about where the film is going to take you next. It's not a perfect movie, but I think I can go as far as to say it's a perfectly made film in terms of its presentation.I'm always looking for a movie to break out of the cliched way of telling a biopic, but I will admit this film slightly suffers from that at times. It does feel like it jumps from year to year, simply hitting the most important aspects of Mercury's life, which is fine, but we've seen that structure throughout numerous films in the past. With that said, that's truly the only complaint I can come up with here. If you don't like listening to the music of Queen, then I feel that will also be a detriment to the movie for you, but that would just be personal taste anyway. For the movie that it is, it works extremely well.What surprised me the most about Bohemian Rhapsody was the performance by Rami Malek as the leading man. I've seen him countless times in the past, appearing as comedic relief in films like Need for Speed or the Night at the Museum franchise, but I've never seen him shine in a leading dramatic role before. If this performance doesn't put him on the map, I'm not sure what will, because I was blown away by his portrayal here. Even if this movie suffered from lazy writing or a lack of energy, Malek's performance would've still held my attention, and that says a lot, especially for someone who I never expected to perform like this.In the end, Bohemian Rhapsody benefits from great editing (which hardly jumps out at me very often), some very solid direction (controversy aside), concert sequences that will impress many viewers, and an overall brisk pacing, even with the lengthy run time. I had a blast watching this movie and even with all of the depressing elements of this story, it's always well-balanced with happier or energetic moments. Aside from the lead performance, I can't see this movie receiving many nominations, but I will say that I can see it becoming a fan favourite movie of 2018. This is the definition of a crowd-pleaser. Bohemian Rhapsody is a great theatre experience from start to finish.",9,5,6,15 November 2018
Bird Box," An Effective Post-Apocalyptic Thriller
","When looking at movies like Avatar or even direct remakes of classic movies, it's a fair criticism to hate on it for being unoriginal, but in the same breath, there's also an argument to be made for why it also worked so well for audiences around the world. Familiar storytelling has been around since the beginning of cinema and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Netflix's Bird Box is another example of this but done in an effective way. Taking the world by storm in the online community, this film has received quite a bit of praise by fans, and while I don't believe it's particularly that great, I did have positive viewing experience with it. This movie does many things right, but it stumbles quite a few times along the way. Here's why Bird Box may be worth your time, but also why there are plenty of other movies worth seeing first.The world has been overrun by a disease that has turned people into zombie-like creatures. With weird, unseeable figures making people kill commit suicide, the survivors have turned to wearing blindfolds to stay alive. Survival movies have been around forever and it's very rare that one does something new for the genre, and while Bird Box doesn't really do that, it tries to. Sadly, this movie is going to be compared to 2018's A Quiet Place, due to the fact that instead of not being able to look, that film was about not being able to speak or make a sound. On top of that, the ambiguity of A Quiet Place has been lost here and it really does feel over-explanatory on quite a few occasions.Bird Box begins with the main event having already happened and follows Malorie (Sandra Bullock) and two unknown children characters. I would've loved to see a survival film with these three characters for the full two hours, but the majority of this film actually takes place in the recent past, showing how this situation came to be. While that may work for some viewers, this was the main aspect that almost had me disliking this film. If it was just going to keep cutting away in order to beat the audience over the head with an explanation I would've been upset, but it does focus on the past more than the present. For that reason, I ended up becoming a little more forgiving, as some of the characters leading up to the present were very likeable.Sandra Bullock delivers a great performance here and held this movie together even through its weak moments. Joined by incredible talents in performers like John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, and Jacki Weaver to name a few, the true standout of this film was Trevante Rhodes, in my opinion. Ever since his breakout performance in the Oscar-winning Moonlight, I have been rooting for him to become an A-List star. Even though that hasn't happened for him yet, I believe his time may still come. I think he's a very talented actor and his screen time with Bullock leapt off the screen.In the end, Bird Box isn't going to be remembered by most people as one of the best movies of 2018, but I can definitely see why people are loving it. It's a film that explores multiple genres at once and makes for a very enjoyable experience overall. I admittedly haven't seen the majority of Susanne Bier's work, which is mostly due to the fact that they're foreign movies that I have yet to seek out, but I have seen her previous American film in Serena, which was quite bad in my opinion, so Bird Box was a very nice surprise. I had a very good time with this film and I will absolutely be seeking out this director's previous works. I recommend a watching this on your free time, but it's not something demanding to be watched.",7,1,3,2 January 2019
Justice League," Does It Really Do The Franchise Justice?
","Whether or not you feel like arguing for DC or Marvel, a good movie is a good movie, regardless of who made it. The terms 'fun' and 'dark' are the two that get tossed around the most when comparing these two franchises, and while many people are wrong to like a movie based on its tone, I can gladly say that not much complaining can be done about the tone of Justice League. Meshing light and dark to form a solid mixture of the two, due to some unfortunate circumstances behind the scenes, may have actually made this a better film than it originally was, but who really knows. As I said, the tone of this film is great in my opinion, but the movie itself is quite the mixed bag. There is a lot of fun to be had with Justice League, but here is a weighing of the pros and cons of this highly anticipated addition to the DC Universe of films.The premise is quite simple. An evil force in Steppenwolf has arrived and needs to find three so-called mother boxes in order to take over the world. Using what little backstory that Bruce Wayne has on many super-powered people, he, along with the help of Diana, form a team to take him down. With the hope that Superman may also return, this team must do everything they can to hopefully save the day. Although these characters are all a joy to see interacting with each other, herein lies the biggest issues with the film as a whole.There isn't much to say about the villain here because his storyline is almost too simple to even want to describe. He's a generic bad guy that wants to take over the world, who really only exists in order to make this team feel the need to band together and save the world. When a villain is just a tool for a team to exist, the overall impact of your movie won't ever reach a high point. That being said, even though the villain ruins the entire film for me every time he's on-screen, the characters surrounding him and how they all come together was really the highlight of the movie, making the price of admission worth it.No, characters like Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash aren't given quite enough backstory to really feel for them, but the casting of them is terrific and the little screen time they're given is fantastic. Their interaction with one another was great and I can't wait to see more of them in the future. There's honestly nowhere to go but up from this messy installation.Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot once again bring everything they have to the table and they sure seem to be making these characters their own, so I really hope they stick with this franchise for at least a few more years, because I feel as though there are some entertaining stories to be told if the post-credits sequences have anything to say about it.Many people will be going into this film hoping for some exciting Superman action, and although I won't give anything away for fans, I'll simply state that his small presence is more than worth the wait. Like in Man of Steel, his character, along with Lois Lane and his mother Martha definitely adds some great emotion to certain elements of the film. In terms of entertainment, this movie held my interest from start to finish and I'm actually looking forward to seeing the future progression of these characters after these first rocky few films. I like these characters a lot. They just deserve better films.In the end, comic book fans will have their share of shrieks throughout the film, from cameos to world-building, but it really just comes down to whether or not this is a good movie for the majority of audiences to flock out and see. Upon reflection, I enjoyed much more about this film than I disliked, so I would warrant a recommendation, but only to those who've followed each installment since Man of Steel, because not knowing who certain characters are would be a detriment to your experience.The movie feels very rushed, but there are great character moments to make up for that. Even though there is some very obvious CGI work throughout the film, the action is exciting and a joy to see on the big screen. Even though the villain is terrible, the team is a blast to see interacting on-screen. I seem to be finding a pro for every con, but it just comes down to whether or not I had a good time, and that's a pretty definitive yes. Justice League is a mess, but it's a mess I had fun with and that shows promise for the future. I enjoyed myself for the most part.",6,22,44,17 November 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Possibly the Best Spider-Man Feature Film Ever Made
","Growing up, I grew an appreciation for the character of Spider-Man that I've never been able to develop for any other comic book character. It was Sam Raimi's original live-action trilogy that hooked me and had me scrounging for more. Watching countless episodes of every cartoon iteration, and even starting to read a few of the comics, I found myself becoming a huge fan of this generational icon. Once Spider-Man 3 hit theatres, the character had lost all hope on the big screen, until Andrew Garfield took the role from Tobey Maguire, which didn't last too long, and also crashed and burned. Finally, he found his footing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Holland, but none of that matters when watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not only is this the best that this character has been in a while, but I believe there's a real argument to made that this is possibly the greatest feature-length film based on this character, period.In this film, which is loosely based off of storylines that are very similar to how this movie plays out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales as he's bitten by a radioactive spider and develops the same (and more) powers as his hero, Spider-Man. After an event opens a portal, it's revealed that his universe isn't the only one. There are endless dimensions out there with parallel characters and creatures, all with similar backstories. From Spider-Gwen to Spider-Ham, this film explores the classics as well as the bizarre, which I fear will probably turn off some average moviegoers who haven't experienced these characters yet, but if you can't embrace a film like that, it's probably not for you anyways.From the very first teaser trailer, I was very intrigued by the look of this film and how different it looked from most animated films out there today. With only a couple of notable films in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Arthur Christmas, Sony Pictures hasn't had the best track record in terms of releasing animated movies theatrically. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has given new life to that notion, because this isn't only the best they've ever produced in my opinion, but it's the best animated movie that has come out all year. The unique style leaps off the screen and made me find another layer to love, on top of the fantastic storyline and characters surrounding it.Yes, the origin story of Peter Parker is the one that everyone knows. That is very much present here again, and nearly every one of these characters share similar backgrounds, but it feels as though the filmmakers expect the audience to be in on the joke of that. This movie is very meta at times, and it works very well if you're invested in the movie as a whole. At the emotional core of this movie is how these characters differ from one another and how certain circumstances can be worse than others. There are some fantastic life lessons to be learned by children here, and for that, I only loved this movie even more.In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse impressed me on many levels. It gives you the Spider-Man action that you've come to expect from this character, as well as giving new life to it. The character of Miles Morales has just as many layers to his story as the classic Peter Parker one, but the inclusion of each one of the side characters here fleshes him out even more. This is one of the best superhero origin stories I've seen on the big screen in years. Filled with heart, emotion, plenty of action, and eye-candy as far as the eye can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of my favourite films of the year.",10,40,93,11 December 2018
Yesterday," A Joy to Watch
","With all of the music-based biopics being released lately, I found myself much more excited for a film like Danny Boyle's directorial effort in Yesterday. There are so many films that take the formula of a band rising and falling and run with that as their premise. Although this isn't a biopic at all, it really is a celebration of the music, written and performed by The Beatles. It may feel a little uneven at times and it actually feels a little mean-spirited at times, but I believe it will win over many viewers. Here's why I believe Yesterday is worth your time at the cinema.Following a young musician in Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), as crazy circumstances have him being the only one on Earth who remembers The Beatles every existing, Yesterday is a film that explores how he re-writes their music to become famous. Yes, this film asks you to fall in love with a character who has stolen famous music (but not really?), which does make for a bit of a frustrating watch. With that said, it really does dive into those aspects and wins you over by the time the credits roll.Being the first time I have ever watched a performance from Himesh Patel, he has definitely proven that he can carry a film, because his devotion to this character, lept off the screen to me. Lily James also stars in the film as his best first, original manager, and possible lover. Honestly, I find her to be incredibly talented and she always elevates a film in my opinion, so for that alone, I may be a little biased when saying I loved a lot about this movie when watching it.Danny Boyle has helmed this film, which felt like a departure for him when looking at the marketing, but really does have his touch all over it. From dutch angles to beautifully composed shots, it was clearly a Danny Boyle movie from start to finish, which felt very refreshing. Where I think this film lacked the most was in the script itself. Although I don't have any major problems with the movie, there are many scenes that have comedy, that just didn't work for me. In particular, there are a couple of dramatic scenes that are broken up and played off as a joke, which had me scratching my head. Aside from that, this is a very enjoyable film, through and through.In the end, Yesterday meshes the style of Danny Boyle's direction with the great music that The Beatles have given the world, along with great performances by Himesh Patel, Lily James, and even the little screentime that Ed Sheeran has. With solid pacing, an enjoyably quirky story (albeit sort of dumb in retrospect), and a character that wins you over as the movie progresses, Yesterday was just a great time at the movies in my opinion. I absolutely recommend checking it out.",8,3,11,28 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A Near-Perfect Finale
","It has been eleven years and 21 films until this point and whether or not you have been a fan of each and every film or not, it's undeniable that what producer Kevin Feige has been spearheading all these years is unprecedented and will probably be at least another decade until something like this is even attempted again. Even though Avengers: Infinity War felt like every storyline was colliding last year, Avengers: Endgame is the true finale of what they are now calling the Infinity Saga. Beginning with Iron Man in 2008 and finishing with Avengers: Endgame in 2019, this is a franchise that was made for fans of this newfound genre in superhero filmmaking and Avengers: Endgame is a near-perfect conclusion in every way.Picking up shortly after the events of Avengers: Infinity War (and don't worry, I won't be spoiling anything from this movie), we meet the team at their lowest point in the entire franchise. The first act of this film is really just about them coping, but shimmers of hope begin to arise, giving them ideas and possibilities for a new future going forward. The journey this film takes you on is absolutely astounding and there are some moments that will have you thinking the franchise has officially peaked, but I feel that fans have earned those moments for being invested through thing many films. There's honestly only so much to say without ruining the experience, so I'll move on to some specifics here.Robert Downey Jr. has always been great as Tony Stark, but due to the circumstances left by the previous film, I truly don't think he's ever been as good on-screen as he is in this film. He carries the emotional weight of the film on his shoulders and I just wanted to applaud every second he was on camera. On top of that, everyone from Karen Gillan (Nebula) getting more Tod do than she has ever done, to Chris Evans truly earning back his character's name, to even Jeremy Renner, who hasn't exactly had many standout moments until now, every cast member brings their all here and I could go on for days about how Avengers: Endgame features the most devoted cast any of these films have seen. I would also like to commend Scarlett Johansson, as it has been years since I've seen her this committed to a character.Audiences will flock to this movie hoping for a lot of big-budget spectacle, and although there are some of the craziest sequences in the franchise thus far, I have to admit that fans of drama will also probably appreciate this movie more than most of the films in the franchise. The impact the previous film has on this movie is severe and it really shows throughout the first two acts. From some great cinematography and new visuals we've yet to see until now, this is the definition of a film that has it all.There's so much I would like to dive into here, but I'll just say this is the definition of a movie that people dream up when watching a franchise. Story threads are tied up nicely, the spectacle is dialled up to a million, the performances are probably the best that this franchise has ever seen, and the humour is absolutely still present and well-balanced with the drama in a way that feels needed for this heavy movie. Overall, Avengers: Endgame isn't a perfect movie, because really, no film of this size can truly be perfect, but this was one of the best theatre-going experiences I've had in years. This is a true finale that earns every second of it's three hour run time. Here's to a bright future for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10,1,6,27 April 2019
Toy Story 4," A Worthy Addition to the Franchise
","Like many movie lovers who grew up in the 1990s, Toy Story was one of the staples of childhood when it came to watching films. After the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, many believed the franchise had ended, until a third film came along over ten years later. Really putting a capper on the Toy Story story as fans knew it from the beginning, Toy Story 3 was a definitive conclusion. So why was a third instalment even in the works? Until the release of the movie, that was the question on many viewers' minds. Personally, upon the initial announcement a few years back, I was against this movie, but I've loved these films since the beginning, so of course, I was going to check this one out, and I'm glad that I did. Toy Story 4 has earned a worthy place in the franchise in my eyes.Picking up pretty soon after the events of the third film, we now see how our favourite, loveable toys have moved on from their previous owner (Andy) and how they've settled in with their new one in Bonnie. Without getting into the specifics of how or why a new toy (Forky) is introduced, I'll just simply state that Bonnie builds him at school and he miraculously comes to life, giving Woody a new job, so to speak. The plot really kicks into gear, However, when Forky is thrust onto the street during a family vacation, and the Woody/Forky excursion begins. Each toy has a moment to shine, but this truly is a film about Woody.I could immediately dive into negatives and say that Buzz Lightyear doesn't have enough screen time or that reference and lines of dialogue from previous movies are slightly repeated too much throughout the duration of the movie, but that would just be me complaining about an otherwise near-perfect animated film. I had nitpicks here and there while watching the movie, but I just have to be honest and say the overall movie surrounding those inner quarrels were just scratches on a canvas that was painted beautifully as a whole.As always, the animation is astounding and life-like at times, which feels a little funny when comparing it to how simple the animation was in the original film, so the movie was beautiful to look at. On top of that, this is a film filled with heart, that cares about its characters, and even takes the time to introduce many new, memorable faces along the way. From Ducky and Bunny to Duke Caboom, these new characters will actually remain in my mind as memorable side characters, which is what many sequels fail to do these days.In the end, fans of the first three movies are more than likely going to love watching this instalment, newcomers will get a fresh story now that a previous chapter has been closed, and fans of comedy will also get many clever laughs here as well. I'm not ready to call Toy Story 4 my favourite film of the franchise by any means, but in terms of character progression, emotion, and an overall extremely enjoyable film, I would be lying if I didn't say that I loved it. Yes, I have minor issues, but they are so small that I just feel like giving this one a perfect grade, which I haven't given to many films in 2019. Toy Story 4 is a wonderful time at the movies and I highly recommend it.",10,96,181,21 June 2019
The Favourite," A Well-Written, High-Energy Period Piece
","Whether you call yourself a fan of the films that Yorgos Lanthimos directs or not, it's without question that his movies aren't for everyone. They are pieces of art that not everyone can understand or are even willing to try understanding. So take my review of The Favourite with a large grain of salt because I'm someone who can get into anything, no matter what the subject matter is. That being said, The Favourite is one of the most unique films of 2018 and for that reason alone, will have me remembering it for quite some time. While I don't think The Favourite is perfect in any way, I do feel like certain film fanatics will eat this one up. There's a reason this film is circulating around awards season (deservedly so), but I personally believe it deserves the recognition and not a win.Set quite far into the past in England, The Favourite follows the servants of Queen Anne. As needy as she is invested romantically in her first hand servant, everything falls to pieces when a new one arrives in Abigail. Aside from a frowned-upon romance that does have a three-act structure throughout the course of this movie, my biggest complaint is that it felt a little light on story. There are other side plots and hints of backstory that are eluded to, but I felt a little short-changed when looking back on the film's story as a whole. As I mentioned, The Favourite will be remembered for many reasons by film fans around the world, but I believe the story will be remembered far less than everything else this film has to offer.From the very first shot of this film to the time the credits rolled, I was enthralled by how impeccably filmed this movie was. It should come as no surprise when you have a cinematographer like Robbie Ryan at the helm. While I haven't seen a lot of films that he has worked on, I absolutely loved his work on both American Honey and Slow West. He has a keen eye for camera work and I can't wait to see what he does next. On top of that, the score present throughout this movie is incredibly engaging, to say the least. This is a very tight screenplay, with not very many breaths taken between lines of dialogue-but when there is, the score takes over in a majorly memorable way.Since we're on the topic of things to remember about this film, the cast is near perfect in every way. I normally don't say that about many movies, because there's usually at least one casting choice that throws me off, but The Favourite is immaculate in that regard. From Emma Stone giving her all, to Rachel Weisz giving her best performance in years, to Olivia Colman as the Queen, I was either laughing hysterically or sucked in by a dramatic delivery. If for nothing else, this is a movie that's worth seeing for the performances alone. Don't be shocked if you see this cast sweeping many of the female awards categories in the coming weeks.In the end, The Favourite is nearly perfect on a technical level, but the substance itself felt slightly lacking to me. The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara packs a heavy punch in terms of the dialogue throughout and I found myself remembering moments in David Fincher films where the dialogue flies a mile a minute, which are my favourite kind of screenplays. Overall, I can't say this is one of the best films of the year, like many critics are, but I can recognize that certain elements absolutely are. I had a great time watching this movie and certain viewers will as well. If you're not intrigued by the trailer for this one, I don't believe the movie will do a good job of winning you over.",8,4,9,18 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A Crowd-Pleasing and Shocking Entry
","With many people speaking about superhero fatigue when it comes to watching movies on the big screen, you'd think that we'd be in a box office drought by now. Obviously, that isn't coming anytime soon, because as long as this Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to surprise its fans and become one of the longest-running franchises in film history, I can't see myself ever losing interest. The hype surrounding this film is massive and arguably the largest ever, due to the sheer notion that people have been watching this series for the last ten years. Nobody could've expected them to make it this far and be this grand, but have they ever done it with this one. Avengers: Infinity War marks the 19th film in this franchise and easily has the most storylines happening at the same time, but if I said I didn't have an absolute blast watching this movie, then I would be lying. From an emotional end to some very funny and exciting action sequences, here's why I loved my experience of this film.This is the type of movie that will be ruined for those who choose to know more about the core premise than they are given at first. Honestly, every ten minutes brings a surprise that leads into the next scene, so it's very difficult to discuss this movie in depth. That being said, Thanks has finally arrived and plans on wiping out half of humanity in order to bring balance to the universe. Pretty much at random, he will select the half that he wishes to live or die. To do this, his mission is to track down six infinity stones that will allow him to accomplish this with the snap f his fingers. Any other information would ruin this experience for you, so I'll leave it at that.As far as the characters go, that's probably consecutively the biggest positive and negative that this film has to offer. Yes, seeing everyone is amazing and some of the interactions were the most welcomed portions of the film, but there are times when the movie does seem a little overly ambitious in including everyone that it possibly can. There are a few members left out of the movie, and I personally feel they did that in order to leave room to breathe during this installment. With that said, I personally just enjoyed seeing everyone and didn't let the overload of characters bother me.Throughout the years, whether it was starting fresh with a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy or jumping into Iron Man 3 without having seen the rest of the movies, newcomers could've easily figured out the missing pieces. Avengers: Infinity War doesn't quite game that same effect, solely due to the fact that there are callbacks and blatant references to films at the very beginning of the franchise. So yes, my recommendation would be to see every movie in the series in order to be fully connected to the events of this movie. For fans of this universe, I don't believe they could've received a more satisfying climax.From Robert Downey Jr. to Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen to Benedict Cumberbatch, the spectrum of performances is on another level here. Everyone is devoted to these characters, but the true standout is easily the performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos. I have a feeling that everyone will be talking about him as the most fleshed out villain this franchise will ever see. His backstory and motivation definitely bring a needed layer to this movie and everyone else gets their time to shine as well. This is a crowd-pleasing movie that also takes risks that I don't think people will be expecting.In the end, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most satisfying theatrical experiences I've had in quite some time. From the running time being the longest one yet and feeling pretty fast, to the climax of the movie leaving me quite emotional, to wondering about where they could possibly go next, to the sheer notion of seeing this many characters on-screen at the same time and it not feeling too bloated, I loved my entire experience of this film. Aside from it feeling a little overstuffed at times, Joe and Anthony Russo have crafted yet another fantastic entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was also a joy to hear the score from The Avengers making a comeback as well. For fans of the franchise, I can't recommend this movie enough. For newcomers, make sure you've at least seen most of the movies. This is a wonderful blockbuster.",9,3,8,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Stellar Writing Is What Made This Movie So Good
","Well, Quentin Tarantino is at it again and has now graced his fans with his ninth directorial effort (if you're not including Death Proof). This time around, taking a step back from his usual tendencies in a way, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood actually felt like a breath of fresh air to me, and that's coming from someone who absolutely enjoys the violence he presents throughout his films. This movie is worth your time if you're a fan and also for those who are turned off by the excessive violence. Here's why I believe this film may reach a broader audience than most of his works.Almost completely devoid of a story at all, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fading Hollywood star, and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as his stunt double who no longer receives any work. Throughout a series of events and the introduction of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), this is a film that disobeys every rule that most films follow, making for a highly enjoyable experience. To really dive into details would be to ruin where the movie ends up, so the best way to describe this movie is to say that it consists of a lot of great scenes of people talking, which eventually slowly builds to a climax that you may or may not expect.Now, where I feel this film may be for more viewers than most Tarantino flicks is in the fact that the majority of this 161-minute feature doesn't have a lot of violence. It really did feel like Tarantino was trying to go for a more subdued film as a whole, which will please some viewers. With that said, there are absolutely some brutal moments that don't hold back, but they are few and far between enough to not have queasy audience members wanting to walk out of the theatre.As always, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood's very best aspect is the screenplay itself. Yes, Tarantino always works with a talented crew in order to make his films look fantastic, but the dialogue spoken by the characters in this film just felt so authentic. At nearly three hours, this is a movie that doesn't feel like it drags, simply due to the fact that these actors are bringing their A-Game as always and the screenplay they're working with is top-notch. Every performance here deserves some recognition, but I also believe the script has something to do with that.In the end, if I had to nitpick about anything, I would say that the lack of overall storytelling may hinder the film for people, and even though I was questioning where the film was going, I was always won over by everything else. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is simply one of the best movies I've had the chance to see so far in 2019 and I will continue to say that until the year's end. With stellar performances all around, phenomenal writing/directing, a visual style that feels different than most movies that will come out this year, and a pace that never feels too slow, given the slow nature of the movie, I can't really find many things to complain about. This film is fantastic.",9,18,39,28 July 2019
Aladdin," A Solid Live-Action Remake
","From Maleficent to Alice in Wonderland, even though those are films that have been changed the most from their original versions, it really does feel like Disney has now doubled-down on keeping their remakes familiar, down to replicating shots and songs. Many viewers may take offence to this or find it pointless to even watch a remake that doesn't take any creative liberties, but I feel that an updated version for today's kids isn't all that bad. Aladdin is one of the latest films to receive this treatment and I believe it's also one of the better ones they've done.Following Aladdin (Mena Massoud), a street thief who finds his way into the palace of Princess Jasmine (Noami Scott), eventually stumbles across a lamp that reveals a genie (Will Smith) who will grant him three wishes. The core premise of the original film is very much present here, but there are also a few welcome additions that don't feel forced or disappointing, at least in my opinion. Viewers seem to be complaining about the villain in Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) for being too soft-spoken and not threatening enough, but I thought this take on him felt very refreshing and more sly than overpowering.Like most of these remakes, there are many shots that just feel like replicas of the classic animated film and the songs are exactly the same for the most part, but for me, it all came down to how everything seems to jump off the screen and if I was able to buy into it all. The short answer for that is yes, I found myself invested in everything that was going on and Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, and especially Will Smith all deliver great performances. Will Smith doesn't ruin what Robin Williams did in the past, but rather makes it his own and I really appreciated that.Where this films biggest issue lies; However, is in its runtime. This version of Aladdin is nearly 40 minutes longer than the original film and while many of the scenes do add to the movie as a whole, it does feel its length at times. There are many fun aspects to this movie, so when a lot of time is taken to explore the dramatic side of these characters, it almost slows down to a halt at times. Luckily, the cast and story surrounding them are so likeable that I was able to forgive a few slow scenes, for the most part.In the end, this 2019 live-action version of Aladdin could have been better and should've probably changed the original premise a little more than it did, in order to feel fresher, but I really enjoyed what was shown to me. This is the same way I have felt about most of these remakes, where if you loved, or even liked the original animated movie, then there's really no reason why you shouldn't at least enjoy watching it at the very least. It has its issues, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the movies watching Aladdin.",8,3,6,6 August 2019
The Lion King," A Worthy Remake of a Classic
","Whether or not you're on the positive or negative side of Disney remaking their classic animated films or not, they're clearly full steam ahead on doing all of them, so buckle up for the ride or turn away for the next decade or so. Personally, I'm indifferent on the whole idea. Although I loved Jon Favreau's recreation of The Jungle Book and thought the live-action Cinderella was very solid, I would argue that with Dumbo, Maleficent, and Beauty and the Beast, even though enjoyable, felt very much unnecessary for the most part. Now, we have The Lion King, which is one of Disney's most beloved classics and it's going to absolutely divide fans, but gladly, I happen to fall on the positive side for this one.After the death of his father Mufasa, Simba (a young Lion cub) is forced away on his own. Learning the real lessons to know in life, his journey becomes one for the ages. I'll remain vague for the very few people who don't know this story, but it ultimately follows every single beat the original animated film presented over 25 years ago. This is the definition of a film that comes off as a cash grab, simply due to the fact that it seems like they made it for money, as all the same songs and images are used, but updated.I'm not going to be one of the reviewers out there that complain though, because I happen to love the premise of the original film, and since it's just recreated here, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this version. The visuals are truly something to wonder at. Not only do the animals look and feel realistic, but the scenery around them wasn't even filmed in-camera, and the movie feels the complete opposite of that. It truly feels like National Geographic went out and captured footage, only to add moving mouths on the animals in post-production.Yes, I can see where the criticisms have been here; Viewers have been adamantly complaining about the fact that this film doesn't do anything new and is pretty much retreading the original movie. While that statement may be true, nearly everyone loves that original film and even though many of the animals may not show deep emotions in their facial expressions, I find that to be one of the largest nitpicks in the history of cinema. This was an experiment in taking a story and making it feel as realistic as possible, and for that alone, it deserves all the credit in the world.In the end, I'm someone who will shout out on the rooftops about the fact that remakes need to slow down, but when a good one comes around, I won't shy away from calling it as it is. The Lion King (2019) is a very, very solid remake, with a few new admirable moments and great direction by Jon Favreau once again. Yes, the fans will complain that this movie took no chances, even down to the dialogue, but I walked out of the theatre with a big smile on my face, so I'm not going to lie to myself. The Lion King (2019) is a great movie, even if it's unoriginal and prevents it from being called one of the best films of the year. For fans and newcomers alike, I recommend seeing this one.",8,2,8,19 July 2019
A Quiet Place," The Genre At Its Absolute Best
","To say that the horror genre has been on a high note over the past couple of years would be an understatement. From genre-bending movies like Get Out to turning the terrible Annabelle film around and making a solid sequel, filmmakers have really been able to share their talents throughout this genre. For that reason, A Quiet Place was easily one of my most anticipated films of the years, also due to its fantastic trailers though. Upon leaving the theatre, I had to ponder the fact that I think it may be one of my favorite horror films ever. Yes, that's a bold statement, but everything about this film feels fresh and I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. If you're a fan of the horror genre or just like a solid piece of entertainment, then here's why I would highly recommend A Quiet Place.John Krasinski broke out as a fan favorite on the small screen in The Office, but ever since, he's resorted to romantic comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in the film 13 Hours and I was hoping for that to be a wake-up call for him and dive into some serious roles. Happily, that's exactly what has happened. Written and directed by Krasinski, A Quiet Place follows a family who must not make a sound, or they will otherwise likely be killed by creatures that have infested the Earth. The concept of this film alone is one reason to like it, but it's the intricate details that really make this film shine from start to finish.From the notion of loving your family to the point of planning out their future in the safest way possible, to the element of surprise, there are many thought-provoking aspects to A Quiet Place. Many of the surprising elements that make this movie work as a whole would be considered spoilers, so I will just leave it at that. What I will say is that there are many things presented throughout the film that builds up to a very intense moment, and the way it all came together, frankly had me in tears. When a movie can emotionally move me simply by being well-constructed, then it's an instant winner in my eyes.The way the filmmakers use sound to move this story along is genius and there are reasons as to why this family makes certain decisions. Everything means something even when you think it may just be a throwaway moment or sequence. At a mere 90 minutes, every second is devoted to either building characters, building tension, or describing certain story points that may have been confusing to certain viewers. As much as I'm praising this film (and I do think this is a nearly perfect movie in every way), no film is perfect.I found myself scratching my head about a few decisions made by certain characters, as well as the fact that something is present later on in the movie that should be making far more trouble for this family than the way they chose to present it in this movie. With these gripes aside, I must admit that the performances here easily cover up any minor issues I had, due to the fact that I was sucked into every second any of them were on-screen.In the end, A Quiet Place is a home run for the genre, for Krasinski's career, and for everyone involved. This is definitely a piece of cinema that I will be recommending and talking about for quite some time. From each quiet moment that builds tension, to each exciting moment that had me on the edge of my seat, to the fact that I was brought to tears by the way this film was cut together and how much thought was put into it through the screenplay, I walked out of this movie replaying it over and over again in my head. I loved A Quiet Place and it's going to be difficult for me to find a film this year that will surpass my experience of this particular one. If you couldn't tell from this review, please do yourself a favor and check this one out.",10,2,6,8 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," A Moving And Poetic Drama
","Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.Written by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer.Hammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.If I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.In the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",9,14,32,7 November 2017
Coco," One Of Pixar's Best
","Pixar, aside from a few weak entries with either Cars 2 or Brave, has always been the studio that places quality entertainment over making a quick buck. Coco is their latest outing, and I'd be absolutely lying to everyone if I didn't say that I loved every second of my viewing experience with this film. Coco is easily one of their best in years and possibly one of their best, period. Diving into themes that felt very risqué for this particular studio, I found that these particular elements only added to the overall story as a whole. Here is why I believe Coco is the must-see movie this year and why it will probably bring tears to many.Due to a tragic past that I won't discuss here, young Miguel (the main protagonist of the film) is forbidden to ever take up music as a profession. Looking up to the great Ernesto de la Cruz, he hopes to be like him one day (the greatest musician to ever live). As he borrows Ernesto's guitar to perform in a contest during the Mexican day of the dead celebration, he is sucked into the land of the dead, where he meets his ancestors. Discovering new things about life, death, and the importance of family, Coco is a film that will send you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.Throughout the first act of this movie, you feel as though it will be a touching story about a boy who's able to connect with the family he was never able to have met, but the hidden secrets will shock even the smartest of viewers. I hope you'll be as shocked with some of the reveals as I was because the writers have really outdone themselves in terms of making you care for these characters. Yes, the plot itself may have familiar elements, but what film doesn't nowadays?I believe that Coco found a way to spin the clichés on their head, injecting some very dark aspects into this movie, which I found to be quite the risk but also worth it in the end. There are times when adults will feel as though they're watching a mature film due to how certain circumstances play out, and while kids can still enjoy the spectacle of this movie, this really is a children's movie for adults. That being said, the spectacle of it all is still worth the price of admission alone.Disney/Pixar continues to impress its audience in terms of how detailed the majority of their films have become, and Coco is no exception. Not only was I sucked up in the emotional journey that Miguel goes through, but the visuals only added a level of depth to the story, due to the fact that the animators have really made these people feel realistic, not in a true-to-life way, but in the way they move or speak to one another. This film is everything you could possibly ask for from Pixar.In the end, Coco is the reason we go to the cinema. We want to be transported to a unique world that makes us forget about reality, but that also reminds us how important reality still is. The core essence of this film's existence is to remind everyone that even the biggest of dreams will have their issues and that family really is the most important thing in life. Whether or not you choose to buy into that aspect will probably make or break your enjoyment of the movie, but I was moved to tears by it. Pixar has created another masterpiece in Coco and this may just be the best film I've seen all year. I can't recommend this beautiful piece of filmmaking enough.",10,8,26,23 November 2017
1917," A Near-Perfect Cinematic Experience
","If you're ever in the mood to watch a war film, there's an over-abundance of them throughout history. You can almost always find one that you haven't seen before. For this reason alone, I find myself being very cautious when one is about to get a wide release. With recent releases like Hacksaw Ridge or Dunkirk, my faith in the genre is always rejuvenated. Well, 1917 is yet another war film to come along and surprise me. For all the technical reasons to love this film on top of the powerful story itself, here's why I believe 1917 is one of 2019s very best films.The premise is nice and simple. Two young soldiers are given the task of sneaking through enemy lines in order to deliver a message to their commander, which will, in turn, save thousands of lives if received in time. This premise makes for a very tense ride. On top of being an engaging story, this movie is filmed in such a way that it makes it feel like one continuous take, for the most part, which ultimately begs the core actors to deliver the performances of their career.Although I've seen him in great films like Captain Fantastic and Pride, George MacKay never really stood out to me as award-worthy, but I stand corrected. This may very well be the best performance he ever gives, but that's not a negative, because I'll always remember him for this role. Alongside him is Dean-Charles Chapman, who I've also liked in Game of Thrones and Blinded by the Light, so I knew to expect a solid performance from him. With that said, he also delivers one of the better performances I've seen in 2019, simply due to the devotion he has to his character.Now, this would absolutely be an incomplete review if I forgot to bring up how incredible the technical aspects of this film are. Roger Deakins is basically a god in the cinematography world, so his work astounds me every single time he brings his vision to a project, and 1917 is no exception to that. The way this camera seamlessly follows these actors in and out of small or big sequences was simply astonishing. Layered on top of this jaw-dropping cinematography is the superb score by Thomas Newman. The combination of being swept up in these performances, caring about the story, being impressed by the camerawork, and then finally being moved by how well the music was composed for each scene, I found it very difficult to criticize anything here.Overall, 1917 deserves a standing ovation for the technical aspects, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this movie also wouldn't have been as good as it is without the careful direction by Sam Mendes. Between his work on American Beauty or Skyfall, it should come as no surprise that he would make a great film, but the crew around him took it to another level in my opinion. I was sucked in from start to finish and the two-hour run time flew by. I can't recommend this film enough. Easily one of my favourite films of 2019.",10,8,12,11 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A New Direction Worth Exploring
","When it comes to the Star Wars franchise, I may have been late to the game in terms of when I became a huge fan, but I see myself as being pretty well-versed in the core saga as of today. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the latest installment in this universe, and while it's easily the riskiest and most daring of the series, it also ranks among the best, at least in my opinion. I rarely do this, but I felt the need to see this movie twice before writing this review. Having a very solid memory of this eighth installment, here's why I believe it's one of the best in the franchise, but also why it may not be for everyone.As I mentioned, this is a film that deserves multiple viewings in order to fully appreciate the routes it decides to take. The story itself is simple. The Resistance is being pursued by the First Order while Rey is off training with Luke Skywalker. Finn finds himself on a mission with newcomer Rose and the movie sets itself in motion. I'm keeping the plot ambiguous because this movie is truly an experience that needs to be seen with completely cold eyes. I feel as though certain elements will definitely catch people off guard though, so let's get the negatives out of the way.There are some moments of comedy that really work here, just like they did in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but there are also a few gags that fall completely flat upon first viewing, due to the fact that they feel jarring. Some of them are actually spoilers, so I'll just say that you should go into this film with an open mind and let the emotion, as well as the comedy, take you along for this epic journey.There are side plots that will definitely not please everyone, but I find myself appreciating everything this movie had to offer in retrospect. It didn't play it safe like its predecessor and it brought its viewers into new territory, as well as diving deep into certain things you've wondered about since the very beginning of the saga. Aside from some of the jokes or risks taken throughout the movie, those feel like minor nitpicks when looking back on the movie as a whole.For anyone who goes into this film hoping to see a great continuation for Rey, a fun ride with Finn, or to see Carrie Fisher or Mark Hamill deliver satisfying performances and character arcs, you'll be very pleased when walking out of this installment. In terms of character development, this movie has it all. On top of that, this movie has one of best third acts I've ever seen in a Star Wars movie to date.Although the pacing can seem daunting throughout the first act of the movie, it really just takes its precious time trying to invest you in this newfound territory that Star Wars has never explored before. Once the third act begins and the pace picks up, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is filled with so many satisfying surprises and memorable moments that I found myself in awe by the time the credits rolled.In the end, yes, this movie feels very different from anything that's come before it, but when you're on the eighth installment in a franchise you kind of have to start taking risks, even if it means not pleasing everyone. Personally, I found this film to be rich in its cinematography, deep in terms of character development, exciting and surprising in terms of its action sequences and reveals, and although simplistic in its story, moving within its devotion to certain themes. While I don't think this will be remembered as the greatest Star Wars movie, it's a damn good one. If you're a fan or just want to just escape at the theatre, Star Wars: The Last Jedi may just be the fix you need. Aside from a few nitpicks, I thought this movie was terrific.",9,0,3,17 December 2017
The Shape of Water," A Beautifully Shot Film
","Being praised around the world as one of the best films of the year from people visiting festivals, The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest venture into the strange and moving area of film. From Pan's Labyrinth to recent films like Pacific Rim, I've always enjoyed watching his films. While I won't be praising this film as much as some people have been, it will easily be receiving a recommendation from my end, but to the right crowd. The Shape of Water is a beautiful, yet strange tale of romance, and even though you've seen this particular story many times over, I feel as though there is enough of a fresh spin to win fans over. Here are my thoughts on The Shape of Water.To get this out of the way, people will surely be going into this film and receiving flashbacks from films like Beauty and the Beast, Splash, or even Shrek. Taking place in a fantasy world where men capture exotic creatures and use them to experiment on, Eliza discovers the creature after being tortured. Forming a very close bond with him, forming a plan to help him escape, and having him stay in her bathtub where he can have room to breathe, this very quickly becomes a very strange romantic tale that people will either buy into or find themselves wondering why they're watching this movie in the first place.Throughout the course of the film, certain characters will present themselves in order to provide fear to the creature or to make you side with him, so that the story may progress. There are definitely a few forced aspects about this film, but when everything is filmed and presented so wonderfully, it's hard to let that clash with your enjoyment of the movie as a whole. To add to that, it was clear that certain scenes or lines of dialogue were added to the film in order to give it a sense of realism, but some of the vulgarity actually took me out of the overall experience, due to the fact that it wanted to get you emotionally invested at the same time. You'll know what I mean if you choose to check out this film.Aside from appearances in Paddington or Blue Jasmine, I'd never really thought about Sally Hawkins as a leading lady of a major production, but sometimes you're proved to be severely wrong because her performance here floored me. I was incredibly invested in every single moment her character was on-screen and anything I didn't like about this movie faded away every time she interacted with someone and had to display her emotions through her sign language or by just simply tearing up or showing emotion through her eyes. I will be remembering this performance as one of the best of the year by year.In the end, where I think this film slightly fails is in its addition of human villains. The Shape of Water is a beautiful romance at its core, but I didn't feel the movie shows quite enough of it to really be a masterpiece, even though the production designers sure made it feel like a damn elegant piece of cinema. If for nothing else, the set design, along with the visual effects and art direction, will surely be included in the awards season to come, because it's some of the best I've seen all year (possibly even the absolute best). Overall, I can call The Shape of Water a damn solid film, but it's not quite as wonderful as I was hoping it would be. To fans of strange or unique films, I recommend you check out this movie. Many people seem to be adoring this film, and while I agree that it's impressive, it's just hard not to compare it to many similar concepts. A great, yet familiar experience.",8,56,116,27 November 2017
American Made," Tom Cruise At His Very Best
","Whether or not you choose to believe Tom Cruise is still an A-List star or not, people still flock out I droves when he makes a good film. While American Made isn't a film that's going to appeal to a mass audience, I believe that the addition of Cruise's charm will sell a few more tickets than if someone else had been cast in this role. This is a movie that unravels the harsh realities of a story line that's definitely too good to be true, and it's based on a true story. You've definitely seen this style of filmmaking many times throughout the years, but director Doug Liman brings a fun, as well as visceral accompaniment to this crazy premise. I can't say that I loved it, but here is why it's still a great film that's worth seeing in theatres. Not knowing the conclusion of the events that actually happened definitely helps when watching a film that's based on a true story, but I have to admit, this is a story that has enough twists and turns to keep you interested, even if you already know how the story ends. As Barry Seal leaves his day job as a pilot, he's recruited to work for the CIA, where he must deliver drugs and guns to cartels in the south. If that notion alone doesn't peak your interest, I'll just say that he's given opportunities that will have you either shaking your head and smiling about how things work out for him, or being scared and along for the ride due to his choices. There are surprises around every corner, which is why this movie works so well. When being a smuggler, no matter how hard or often you must travel, a family life is always going to be a struggle when you're dealing with the drug cartel, there's no way around that. What worked out for this film was the fact that the clichés of kidnapping family members never happened throughout the true story, so you won't find yourself rolling your eyes, thinking the film is coming up with a way to manipulate the story. Sure, there are other surprises that I won't spoil for you, but if there's one thing I can compliment this film on, it's the fact that it's original. That being said, hardly any film is perfect, and where I feel American Made may annoy some people, is its happy- go-lucky feel throughout 80% of its duration. I'm all for a film trying to have fun and lighten the mood, but when a film that should be taking itself seriously, fails to hardly ever do that, I found myself wondering if the consequences even mattered. Yes, Cruise delivers a noteworthy performance once again, and the secondary cast all play off him wonderfully, but I found myself wondering where the stakes were at times, due to the fact that Barry always seemed to make the best out of a bad situation. This isn't necessarily a flaw with the film itself, but it distracted me more than enough to slightly harm my experience with the movie as a whole. In the end, there isn't much to complain about here if I'm being honest, but like I mentioned, it's filmmaking that you've seen many times before, with some questionable editing choices in its quick cuts or fast zoom-ins, and the fact that the tone is a little too happy for the story at hand. Still, the premise is interesting throughout, the surprises are worth the price of admission alone, and Doug Liman directs this film as well as any other that he's put his touch on in the past. American Made won't be winning any awards this year, but it's a really enjoyable time at the movies and I highly recommend checking it out.",8,4,9,28 September 2017
Mudbound," A Powerful Drama
","Netflix hasn't had the best track record when it comes to original feature films, but there's always been that rare occasion each year with films like Beasts of No Nation or Tallulah (at least in my opinion), and I truly believe that they've just released their greatest feature film to date. Premiering in film festivals around the world, this film has been highly anticipated for film lovers and it didn't disappoint. Mudbound tackles many issues that have been explored throughout countless movies in the past or even in recent memory, but when a movie can captivate you with its characters and truly make you care when things begin to happen to them, then you've made a real gem of a film. Mudbound is no exception to that notion and here's why I believe it deserves all the attention it's getting.Although I'd say I loved every second of this film in retrospect, it does take a while to win you over throughout its first act. After returning home from World War II, a few men have to deal with the racism in their hometown that was absolutely absent while they fought overseas. Dealing with racism isn't anything new in terms of film exploration, but it's sold very well here. It's done in such a way that feels fresh and old at the same time. Many instances filled my eyes with tears at how brutal some of the imagery was, leaving me speechless. Yes, this film can feel a little long, but that's where the cast comes into play, giving the movie a much greater pace.Although casting talent like Garrett Hedlund, Jason Clarke, Carey Mulligan, and Jonathan Banks only added to the depth between characters here, Jason Mitchell is the true standout and I believe people will be talking about him for awards in the coming months. His portrayal of Ronsel literally had me in tears upon each climactic moment he was involved in. Watching his particular journey from war hero to being immediately degraded for having done absolutely nothing wrong, except for being a different color was quite awful to experience, but the arc that his character goes through is well worth the wait.As I mentioned before, the first act of this film can feel very slow and I was pretty bored, to be honest, but trust me, it's only that way so that it can take its precious time to give the audience a lay-up and have them settle into this world and care about the characters in it. By the time the third act kicks in, there are some truly emotional moments between characters and one standout scene that I'll be remembering for quite some time between Hedlund and Mitchell. Their chemistry was out of this world to me and their scenes had me completely forget that I was watching a movie.In the end, this is a well-shot, very well-scored, and wonderfully acted period drama that had me in tears by the time the credits started to roll. While it doesn't necessarily do anything new in terms of the emotional impact of racism back in the day, it finds a way to put a new spin on it and make you feel all kinds of emotions that even movies like 12 Years a Slave didn't. Yes, I know that's a bold statement, but Mudbound is exactly the movie I've been looking for in terms of this particular storyline. While the slow pace may not be for everyone, if you can invest yourself in a somewhat lengthy drama, Mudbound is now streaming on Netflix and I can't recommend it more.",9,2,6,21 November 2017
Joker," A Fantastic and Unnerving Character Study
","Films based on comic books have been the craze over the last decade or so, to say the least. From Iron Man launching a franchise bigger than any interconnected cinematic franchise in history to The Dark Knight being known as one of the best films of all time, we're currently living in the golden age of comic book adaptations, so it should come as no surprise that a few unexpected outings would be attempted as well. Joker has now hit theatres and while I can say right off the top that it won't be for all moviegoers, this is a fantastic piece of storytelling.Being alone his entire life and thrown to the side by society, Arthur Fleck still lives with his mother well into adulthood and has a full-time job as a street clown. Having a condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh, this character study is engaging from start to finish. Slowly realizing the truth about his life, things begin to devolve into chaos in his mind. Joker is simply a study of the mind of someone who has nothing left to live for or be happy about. For this reason alone, this is going to be a tough watch for certain viewers. Having a homicidal maniac as your core focus is not exactly an easy sell.Now, Joker shares quite a few similarities to other classic films, which is being criticized a lot throughout many reviews, but I didn't see that as a negative. There are so many formulas that have been emulated to create great works of fiction that calling this movie a rip-off would be an insult to the filmmakers. On top of that, this movie is held together by a performance by Joaquin Phoenix that's truly out of this world, so any minor issues I had were usually overshadowed by him.Phoenix's portrayal of this character, like every actor who has played this character in the past, is extremely committed, whether or not you like the outcome. Thankfully, I think his portrayal is completely different from anyone who came before him, making this movie one that will be able to stand on its own for a long time. From his quirks when the film begins to where he ends up during the final act, each and every moment was riveting.In the end, Joker does borrow a little too much from classic to really call it a masterpiece or perfect, but it's pretty close in my opinion, in terms of holding your interest for an unlikely anti-hero. It's directed very, very well by Todd Phillips and I was more than happy to see him evolve as a filmmaker here. This is something that I never thought I would see him do and, aside from the level of great comedy in a movie like The Hangover, this is probably his best work to date. I loved nearly everything about this movie, even though it will upset some viewers and make them feel very uncomfortable. In fact, for that reason alone, it has done its job very well. You're not supposed to root for him, but rather understand where his actions come from. This is a great film.",9,2,4,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A Solid Follow-Up, Even if it Falls a Little Short
","Back in 2017, the majority of audiences praised the fact that such a great Stephen King adaptation had been made in It. The television mini-series from 1990 was a very corny version of the story and it went without saying that it deserved a better treatment. Now, the second instalment of that great first film has hit theatres, and like the mini-series, the second portion of the story just isn't as interesting as the first. It: Chapter 2 does warrant a viewing though, especially if you liked the first movie because although it's not exactly great like its predecessor, there's a lot to like here.Picking up 27 years after the events of the first movie, Pennywise (the clown) has returned to terrorize the town of Derry once again. Reuniting as they promised each other they would, this cast of characters come together to face him one last time. Through various side plots that each character find themselves on, this film may feel slightly long for some viewers at a beefy 169 minutes, but I found that the events unfolding and the performances surrounding them was enough to keep me interested.Even if you find this film boring at times, it goes without saying that this is once again a stellar cast. Just as they brilliantly cast the kids in the first film, everyone here is on the top of their game. From Bill Hader stealing the show on multiple occasions to the star power of Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy leaping off the screen, there is an endless slew of great character moments. Where this film slightly fell apart for me was in the fact that this movie relies heavily on the past.Almost seeming to be afraid of letting the past go, this movie flashes back and forth from past and present, showing moments from their childhoods that coincides with current situations. It worked simply due to the fact that the cast of both films is great, but it really did feel like it unnecessarily made the movie longer than it needed to be. With that said, I feel that will be the complaint for most people, but I actually didn't feel the length of this movie. That might have been because I was just in the mood to watch it, but I digress.In the end, It: Chapter 2 has a great dramatic backbone to it and these performers are giving their all, but the sense of terror and tension is lost a little here in favour of the former. Still, I'm a sucker for a good drama and this film definitely delivers that tenfold. Both of these films feel like they have a sense of finality at the end of them, which is why they both work on their own. The fact that this movie constantly switches between past and present actually makes it easier to watch for those who missed the first movie, which is something I always love. While it's not going to be remembered as a great film on its own, I believe these two movies will work as a great double feature. It's absolutely worth seeing.",7,2,2,15 September 2019
12 Strong," A Solid Flick With A Great Cast
","Everyone knows that once the Twin Towers were attacked on September 11, 2001, soldiers went into battle and wars have been occurring ever since. That part is well-known by everyone around the world. These wars will soon be talked about in history classes if they aren't already, so it goes without question that films will be made about certain aspects of the war, due to the significant impact that it has left and continues to leave. The story that 12 Strong presents is something that has been classified until recently, so it should be quite the surprise to many. There are many aspects about this film that follow the standard war film formula, but as long as it's supported by a solid cast, great sequences, and solid direction, the premise itself should be enough to carry its audience, and I believe it does just that. Now playing in theatres, here's why I think 12 Strong deserves a watch, even if not immediately.Following the first twelve men that stood up to make the first attacks after the collapse of the Twin Towers back in 2001, this movie explores the true story of courage and ambition that these men displayed for the world. As a film, it does feel slightly formulaic, due to the fact that it pretty much takes you from one location to another in a fairly simple way, but I can also see this being exactly what went down in reality, so I was able to forgive that flawed aspect pretty quickly. This is a film about intensity and the characters surrounding that intensity and for that, it succeeds with flying colors.From Chris Hemsworth to Michael Pena, Michael Shannon to a fair newcomer in Trevante Rhodes (whom I loved in 2016's Moonlight), this is a stacked film. I always appreciate when a movie delivers crazy amounts of action, while also finding the time to slow down and give each character their moments to shine. No, the character development here isn't anything to write home about, but I have to admit that I was wrapped up in each of their stories. Simple moments of characters sitting by a fire and reminiscing gets to me if it's done well, and 12 Strong accomplishes these feats quite well.This movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart in terms of gore or being turned off by too much action, because when this movie wishes to display its reign of terror on the people who have some sort of involvement in the terrorist attacks, 12 Strong does it in a very visceral manner. From showing executions to showing towns being bombed, I found this movie to be a fresh dose of reality to people who seem to forget about the horrors that go on around the world on a daily basis. As I said, there's nothing spectacular about this movie, but I think it's a little more important than people are making it out to be.Although director Michael Bay hit a high point in his career with the film 13 Hours (at least in my opinion), I feel that 12 Strong is a film that shows real promise for director Nicolai Fuglsig. This is his first mainstream outing, and I have to call it as I see it and say that I believe this man knows how to portray action on-screen and I can't wait to see the progression of his career as a filmmaker. In terms of action, I would recommend keeping an eye on this name for the future. Overall, 12 Strong is a solid and important war flick when it comes to the core story and I believe everyone should check it out at some point, but I could also recommend quite a few better movies in the same genre. Impressive filmmaking, but just good as a whole.",7,11,25,8 February 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," A Tedious Viewing Experience
","When a movie revolves around a murder and makes you wonder who the killer is, it really needs to do a great job in getting you invested in the characters at hand. 2017's adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie novel may just be one of the most disappointing films I've seen all year because it fails to do the one thing that a murder mystery is meant to do, which is to keep you interested from beginning to end. There are many things to gawk at when watching this film, but the story itself definitely isn't one of them. This rendition of Murder on the Orient Express, even though I haven't read the original material or see the other adaptations, is quite the bore and here is why I just can't get myself to really recommend this movie to anyone.Without a doubt, this movie is wonderfully directed by Kenneth Branagh, but the screenplay for this film ranks pretty low on the scale in terms of Michael Green's previous works. Having written terrific films in Logan and Blade Runner 2049, his past works also include Alien: Covenant and Green Lantern, which were far less than stellar, so I could clearly see a mixture of good and bad throughout this particular screenplay. Focusing mostly on the character of Hercule Poirot, the rest of the passengers are left by the wayside, which is where I feel the film suffers the most.Getting to know Poirot, Murder on the Orient Express begins in giving the audience a bit of backstory into what is character is all about and once the train gets going, having his character slowly beginning to interact with each of the passengers, the movie seemed to be moving along at a brisk pace, but a certain event occurs, leaving a passenger dead, while also bringing the movie to a complete halt. Everything leading up to the eventual murder on the train was interesting to me, but for reasons that can't be explained here without spoiling, I truly found myself not caring who committed the crime and the movie ended up losing me quite early on.As far as twists and turns go, Murder on the Orient Express does its very best to trick the audience, but the outcome was very strange to me, making the rest of the movie sort of feel irrelevant. There are many characters to try and flesh out here, and I understand that's a very difficult task to accomplish in scripting a feature film, but when certain characters were given backstories, I felt as though I should begin to care about them more than the others, but in reality, the notion of not really caring about the outcome kept running through my mind. Nearly every aspect of this story was uninteresting to me, but I can't deny that it looks beautiful.From the sweeping landscapes to the way the camera angles helped move the story along, I found myself immersed in a film that I didn't really care about, which was a pretty frustrating experience. After the conclusion of each big scene, I was sucked back in my rapid-fire dialogue by Kenneth Branagh, only to be bored by overlong sequences of conversations, with only a handful of them being of any interest. This movie had so much potential of being great, but I can't even really call it a good movie.In the end, this rendition of Murder on the Orient Express tries to be classy and clever, and while the main character of Hercule Poirot is interesting and likable, the cinematography is beautiful, and many of the side characters curious enough to hold my interest, the story itself was sort of a dread to sit through. The conclusion felt odd and nothing felt like much of a revelation to me. I can't see this movie growing a large fanbase, and due to the lack of pacing and character development, I can't recommend that anyone rushes out to see this film. At best, I'd consider a home rental if you're curious, but I don't think you're missing out on much if you skip this. Personally, I disliked this film much more than the portions I enjoyed. Murder on the Orient Express is extremely disappointing.",4,18,38,10 November 2017
Parasite," A Masterpiece in Filmmaking
","Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today.",10,18,30,28 October 2019
Marriage Story," One of the Best Dramas of the Decade
","I've been trying to come up with a way of reviewing this film in a way that doesn't seem like I personally directed it or something, because movies like Marriage Story don't come along very often and I just feel like gushing about how incredible is. Netflix has been releasing tons of quality content this year and this may very well be the best of their entire catalogue of feature films. Alone with Roma and their recent release of The Irishman, I believe you'll be seeing Marriage Story in contention for many, many awards in the coming months. Here's why I believe Marriage Story is a must-watch.Not all relationships work out and if every single Romance film ever made had a happy ending, then that would just be a lie. It's nice to see a movie tackle this subject matter and stick with it from start to finish. Marriage Story is a look into the lives of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as they are clearly not able to keep a working marriage, but also don't want to ruin the family they have made. From gut-wrenching scenes of excessively honest dialogue and a conclusion that feels raw and true, this movie is one of the best dramas I've seen in years.Take your pick at who outshines who here, because it really is a toss-up as to who is more incredible between Driver and Johansson. It does help that writer/director Noah Baumbach gave them outstandingly good dialogue to work with, but the way these two play off each other is as if they were given a year to prepare for these roles and get to know each other. Everything about this film felt authentic, which made the overall impact so powerful. It's not easy to watch a movie about a love story that's about how marriage sometimes doesn't work out, but this movie does it in such a way that it doesn't feel depressing throughout the majority of the duration. This is all thanks to Noah Baumbach though.From Greenberg to While We're Young, Baumbach has been a director I've been keeping my eyes on, as I believe he has gotten better with each of his films, for the most part. It wasn't until The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) that I really started to anticipate his next movie, but now I'll be desperately awaiting to get another story from him. His talent as a director, especially on Marriage Story, is truly something else. He is best suited for movies like Marriage Story or While We're Young, where it's all about the characters because he very clearly has a knack at getting the best possible performances out of his cast.Marriage Story begins strong, easing you into what will be a very emotional film and concludes in a way that feels natural. Overall, from these award-worthy performances, superb writing and directing, a very minimal score, which lets you sit with these characters for extended periods of time, it's very hard to nitpick this movie. There is one scene that made me chuckle, purely because I felt uncomfortable, but this movie is otherwise perfectly done. By the time 2019 ends, I feel that I may have to say this is the best movie of the year. I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. I can't recommend it enough.",10,4,6,9 December 2019
Black Panther," A Rich And Welcome Addition To The MCU
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come. Sure, there are a few weak entries, but I don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore. This is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen a few times each year, that's had a few mediocre episodes along the way. Happily, Black Panther is their latest entry and not only is it far from mediocre, but it's easily the best film they've produced in quite some time. Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this review and call myself a fanboy who's blinded by the brand of Marvel. I genuinely thought this was a terrific entry and here's why.One of the best things about this film is that it stands on its own. Yes, seeing previous movies definitely elevates your experience, but it's been a long time since the Marvel Cinematic Universe released a movie that's not reliant on viewers having seen previous movies. That being said, Black Panther picks up not too long after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Don't let that be daunting to you or anyone who hasn't seen that film because this movie does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie. The king of Wakanda has passed away and his son T'Challa has taken the mantle. With looming threats to have his throne stolen from him, he must take any precautions necessary in order to reign supreme. Quite honestly, unless you want this movie ruined for you, it's hard to expand on the premise itself, especially when it comes to the villain in Erik Killmonger.Everyone will want to discuss how well Chadwick Boseman fits into the role of T'Challa (Black Panther), but Michael B. Jordan is easily the highlight of this film. Once again, I'm not trying to let a highlight cloud my judgment of the movie as a whole, but the villain is honestly something remarkable here, especially for the standards that have been set by previous movies in this universe. His purpose for wishing to take down the titular hero will have you hating him and sympathizing with him all at the same time and that's when you know this character was created and presented with care. The interacting with Killmonger and the secondary character and the final few scenes that he and T'Challa get to spend together are honestly some of the best moments from any of these films in a very long time.Yes, I can admit that I loved this movie from start to finish, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me. Normally when I watch a movie, I never let CGI affect how I feel about a scene as a whole, but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here. Now, that's really all I have to complain about here because it didn't take away from anything. They're definitely noticeable, but I also found myself invested and tearing up during a couple of the final scenes, even though someone's body or a background looked fake, so I have nothing but incredible applause for Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole on their fantastically written screenplay.In the end, superhero movies, in general, are hard to make these days, especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them. Personally, I think of this genre as any other genre. If you make a good film, then it's worthy of talking about, just as an indie drama that's up for Oscars is. This is a rich and wonderful world that's worth exploring. Superbly directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and easily one of the best solo outings for a superhero.Has there ever been romantic comedy fatigue? No. Has there ever been horror film fatigue? No. People let themselves think they're having superhero movie fatigue because there are many of them made nowadays, but as I said, it doesn't matter if people have powers. A great movie is a great movie if you have a story worth telling, and Black Panther proves that statement tenfold. I can't recommend checking this film out enough. For comics fans and average moviegoers alike, I feel as though this will be a movie long-discussed.",9,1,7,17 February 2018
Mother!," A Messed Up, Yet Powerful Experience
","Horror films have been on a roll lately, but if anyone can combine genres and flip his story on its head, it's director Darren Aronofsky. Films such as The Wrestler and Black Swan were some of my favourite films in their respective years of release, so I was naturally very excited to see Mother!. Although I will be talking very highly about this film for the most part, my initial viewing experience of it was slightly frustrating. Aronofky remains as talent as ever and I truly look forward to all of his works to come, but this was definitely on the lower tier of his resume, even though there are some incredible moments. Mother! will definitely have its audience that falls in love with its material, but a word of caution has to be presented to those who don't know what they're getting themselves into. When Mother! begins, it feels very much like a creepy romance that begins to spiral out of control once a few unexpected guests arrive at their home. Jennifer Lawrence plays an unnamed character, and while her husband seems a little off, things seem somewhat normal until the guests arrive. You may be draw in by its creepiness or the sense of mystery surrounding the events, but there's something that just doesn't seem right either. Steam surely picks up by the time the film reaches its final act, and I quite honestly loved where the film ends up, but it took a little too long to peak my full interest to say that I loved this movie overall. By the time the guests arrive, the core plot sets itself in motion, which definitely becomes more interesting than anything leading up to that portion of the film, but again, something still felt missing. The mysteriously written screenplay was very well-crafted, in that I found myself wondering what was going to happen next. You know a film is well made when it has you guessing throughout its entire duration, but it seemed as though it wasn't building to anything extravagant. That being said, the third act of Mother! gives you more answers than you could possibly have asked for (maybe even a little too much).From insanely brutal imagery, to some pretty terrific set design, to a revelation throughout the last 20 minutes, Mother! becomes a film that's far better than anything it sets itself up to be throughout its first two acts. This is why I find this film completely frustrating in retrospect, because it takes far too long to really become incredible with its storytelling. Yes, there are things set up within its first act, giving off the impression that it's just bizarre to be bizarre, except there is more to the film than meets the eye (which I truly can't explain with words here). This is a movie that's worth watching for its final act, and the third act has to be seen to really be believed. In the end, this is a very impressive film as a whole, but it takes a little too long to get where it needs to be in order to impress its audience. I found myself slightly bored or a little too excited to see what happens next, which slightly took away from the experience in my opinion, but it compensates with one of my favourite endings to a film all year. Mother! isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and I won't even be calling it one of the best films that 2017 has to offer, but if you're looking for a messed up roller coaster ride that leaves you breathless by the end, even if it's a little uneven, then I definitely recommend Mother! to you. With all of that said, here is a warning that some people need. Before going into this film, please be weary that there are some extremely horrifying imagery towards the end of this film. Some people will regret they watched it for these images, but if you're up for anything, then sit back and enjoy this crazy ride.",8,2,7,25 September 2017
Creed II," A Rock-Solid Continuation to the Rock/Creed Legacy
","When it comes to the films in the Rocky franchise, you can pretty much predict how each film will end when the set-up takes place throughout the first act. This is both a positive and a negative that this franchise faces, due to the fact that the formula of these movies is about as perfect as you get when telling a story like this. When Creed hit theatres back in 2015, I was blown away in thinking that it was in the discussion of best films in the entire franchise. This was a tall order to follow in Creed II and while it doesn't quite hit every stride it needs to in order to be classified as one of the greats, I have very few complaints about this follow-up. This is the way you make a sequel.Young Adonis Creed's past isn't all sunshine and rainbows. His father having been killed by Ivan Drago in the fourth installment has him hellbent on a revenge kick when confronted with the opportunity to fight the son of the man who has put so much pain into his life. While this premise may just seem like a way of pleasing fans of the cheesy sequels in the past, it really isn't that at all. While the boxing matches are worth the wait, the heart on both sides of the ring is present this time around. With new obstacles to face in his personal life, the arc that Adonis goes through here was fantastic in my opinion.Michael B. Jordan continues to astound me when it comes to his performances on-screen. Even though he hasn't always been in award-worthy films, his performances have always been out of this world. Once again, he embodies this character with enough emotion and energy to carry this movie from start to finish. His chemistry with Tessa Thompson has carried over from the first film and even digs a little deeper this time around. Their relationship reaches new heights, as well as new lows here, which is very reminiscent of the way Rocky and Adrian were in the second Rocky movie. The emotional core to this overall story hasn't been lost and I loved every bit of drama as much as I loved the boxing matches, which were incredible as well.After Ryan Coogler departed as both writer and director (having done the first film), I found myself slightly concerned that the first would become lightning in a bottle, but that's not the case. Placed in the hands of Sylvester Stallone to write and given to newcomer Steven Caple Jr. to direct made for a nearly superior sequel in my opinion. The flare of this character was brought to the screen in the first in a very captivating way and that's not exactly captured here, but further explored. Taking the characters you love and expanding them is what a sequel is meant to do and this one did that beautifully.In the end, Creed II's only true weakness is the fact that it does feel formulaic at times. You can see where the film is headed most of the time, but that really doesn't take away from the fact that it's extremely effective. I found myself on the edge of my seat during the matches and in emotionally invested in the surprises throughout the course of the film. This truly does feel like the conclusion of certain chapters in this franchise, but I wouldn't mind seeing a third if it can be as well-done as these first two were. Creed II is a fantastic follow-up in my opinion and if you're a fan of this franchise, I highly recommend checking it out.",9,20,38,30 November 2018
The Greatest Showman," A Fun Musical With Many Issues
","I've never been over-the-moon about musicals per-say, but any musical that has catchy songs will always have a special place in my heart. If a movie can make me smile through its music, regardless of the quality of the story at hand, then it's definitely doing something right. The Greatest Showman is one of the most recent musicals to hit the big screen and while I don't consider this one a masterpiece by any means, I can definitely see why so many people have hyped up the soundtrack. This is the pinnacle example of a film that works very well, solely due to the fact that it has fantastic musical numbers throughout its entire duration. If you haven't seen this film yet and you're not a fan of the musical style, then I would warn you to stay away, but if you're the opposite of that, then you may have found a new favorite to sing along to.The Greatest Showman follows P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) as his family suffers from him not being able to hold a job. Promising his wife a magnificent life at a young age, he hasn't given up on that yet. He decides to buy a museum that he would eventually turn into a musical circus, filled with people of all shapes, sizes, colors, and attitudes. This sparks a huge interest in the town and his rise to fame is quite rapid. Yes, I know the story is altered to suit a film because the actual P.T. Barnum wasn't such a nice person, but it works as a movie and that's all that matters when watching. Having said all that, this particular story has been told to death already, so if you're going in for something fresh, I wouldn't bother, unless you're able to ignore that aspect as I surely did.This is a film that you go to for the spectacle of the shows and visual storytelling (albeit brief) because the music is so well-written and catchy you honestly forget about the core story completely. Yes, that's a man to cover up something mediocre, but I would be lying if I didn't call this film remarkable in terms of choreography and music. I've only seen this film once, so I wasn't singing along with any of the music, but when the cues occur, I must admit that I had a few goosebumps appearing.As far as the performances go, everyone here was hired for their stardom. They can both sing and act very well. From Hugh Jackman to Michelle Williams, to the very likable chemistry between Zac Efron and Zendaya, I was grinning from ear to ear whenever any of them were singing on-screen together. Even though the story is basic, it put a huge smile on my face through the ways it let the music tell the story. Even though mediocre at its core, I had an absolute blast watching The Greatest Showman.In the end, this movie won't be remembered as one of the greatest musicals of all time, or even the last ten years, but this is a soundtrack that music lovers will be playing for many years to come, and that alone is a tough feat to accomplish. No, I didn't care all that much about the outcome of the story, but the music itself made me care enough to put a smile on my face, and there is a lot of music, so I was distracted into liking this movie enough to warrant a decent recommendation. Please take this recommendation with a massive grain of salt, though, because if you're not into musicals, this movie will probably have the exact opposite effect for you.",7,2,4,13 April 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," A Fine Conclusion, I Guess
","Look, I'm not going to be the person who says that they love the original Pitch Perfect film and let that cloud my judgment into thinking its sequels are just as great because they're not. The release of Pitch Perfect back in 2012 was an anomaly. I quite enjoy watching that film and when Pitch Perfect 2 hit theatres, I found myself mildly enjoying it for the musical numbers but ultimately seeing it as a retread. Pitch Perfect 3 is now playing in theatres around the world and I can't say much more about this addition either if I'm being honest, but at least it tried to be different. If you're a fan of the first two, here are the elements that may intrigue you during your viewing of this third and probably final installment.Pitch Perfect 3 follows the Bellas after they've graduated University and moved on to the real world, trying to start careers. When they all realize their lives are miserable without being a part of this team, they form together one last time to travel the world, performing for the troops. This leads them on a journey that will have them realize where they belong in life and possibly even sprout lifelong careers for them. Although incredibly uneven, this film intends to give a solid swan song to these characters in order to conclude a trilogy, and the result is satisfying for fans, but it's not enough to dig itself out of familiar territory.As I mentioned, this is a film that tries to be very different, injecting family aspects and action sequences, but it feels like too much of a departure from the first two movies in terms of story. Many of the jokes are funny for fans of this trilogy, but many of them are sadly just repeats from past films. The best part about these two sequels are easily the musical numbers. I can replay certain scenes from Pitch Perfect 3 in my head and remember having a good time in the theatre, but I very soon realized the inconsistent premise when comparing it to its predecessors.I will say that the third act of this film definitely does a good job in taking care of its characters and truly making you feel like this is the end of a trilogy, but it was a little too late for me by that time. Yes, I enjoyed the musical aspect of the movie, but the heart of the first film just isn't there anymore. Watching characters interact, fall in love, and build chemistry was truly what made me enjoy the first movie so much. Sadly, with many of the cast members mysteriously absent from this installment, it just felt off to me. It makes very lazy attempts to explain why they're no longer around, making me just want to watch the first two again.In the end, I can't say that I disliked this movie, but I didn't like it that much as an overall product either. Yes, the musical numbers and mash-ups are awesome to hear and see performed, but the story itself, along with the interaction of the cast is what made the original as good as it is, and that is the main thing I couldn't seem to find here. I would recommend this movie to hardcore fans of the first two installments, but this movie is surely not for newcomers. I enjoyed the aspects of this film that called back to the first and second and certain characters are given their due, but I just can't truly recommend that a theatrical experience is necessary. Pitch Perfect 3 is a fine conclusion for fans, but not a very good movie overall.",5,1,6,23 December 2017
Jojo Rabbit," A Wonderful Satire
","It goes without saying that today's generation doesn't take to offensive humour as much as they used to, or at least be as forgiving as they used to. For that reason alone I was surprised to see a movie like Jojo Rabbit even get made. After watching it, it also seems like a very necessary and welcome release for today's day. I'm so happy a film like this was made because the rich environment and characters Taika Waititi creates here are worth the price of admission alone. Although this humour absolutely won't be for everyone and may even be a little too off-beat for some, here's why I believe Jojo Rabbit is a fantastic satire, even if some may not enjoy it.In Nazi Germany, a young boy in Jojo Roman Griffin Davis) is oblivious to the horrors that Hitler represents, so he creates him as an imaginary friend to help him through his struggles. As the plot kicks into gear, he discovers that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding Elsa, a Jewish girl, in the walls of their house. This is a film that seems funny on its surface and does have quite a few great laughs, but the surrounding atmosphere and overall story are meant to be taken very seriously. This worked very well for me and I think the end result made for a fun, moving piece of filmmaking.Taika Waititi is definitely not new to the director's chair, but I always find myself impressed with his work. Whether it be in creating the fantastic Hunt for the Wilderpeople or the highly entertaining Thor: Ragnarok, his style is very unique. With that said, I think Jojo Rabbit is his best work to date. This is the most I've ever seen him juggle comedy and drama so well together and they never seemed to clash. I will always look forward to his upcoming projects because, at the very least, they will have some kind of entertaining aspect.From Roman Griffin Davis in the title role to Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, Scarlett Johansson as the mysterious Rosie to the absolutely hysterical Archie Yates as Jojo's best friend Yorki, this film is littered with talent. On top of that talent, these characters were written by Waititi with care, adapted from the novel by Christine Leunens. There was never a moment where I questioned if a certain performer should have been cast in any of these roles because although there is some great emotion, it's all played up as fun. I really enjoyed the ride this movie took me on.Overall, Jojo Rabbit suffers from the fact that the humour is quite dry and won't be for everyone, but if ultimately one of the better films I've seen all year. Filled with laughter, heart, a meaningful story with a terrific message and gut punches that you wouldn't expect, I think Jojo Rabbit is deserving of its praises. At a mere 100 minutes, this movie flies by, delivering a really enjoyable viewing experience. As long as you know what you're in for, I highly recommend this one.",9,1,4,21 November 2019
Midway," Exciting Moments in an Otherwise Mixed Bag
","Movies that make me unsure if I really liked it or not don't come around all that often, but Midway will be the film that fits that description for me when looking back on 2019's film offerings. If you've seen movies like 2012 or Independence Day, you should know what to expect from a Roland Emmerich directorial outing. That said, this movie feels like clash in management. Written by first-time feature writer Wes Tooke, it definitely shows that he needs to grow into his talent a little longer. Although filled with exciting moments and some great actors, here's why I believe Midway isn't really worth your time overall.After the attack on Pearl Harbour, Midway follows a group of U.S. soldiers as they formulate a plan to attack Midway. While this premise does make for some exciting battle sequences, it's undercut by side plots that feel slightly unnecessary to the overall arc of this movie. I understand that it was trying to cover all the bases during the events of this piece of history, but there is a specific portion of the film that feels rushed on top of having nearly nothing to do with the overall premise, so I was scratching my head on why it was even included in the first place. Other than that, this movie is fairly focused for the most part.I think the biggest weakness of this film, however, is the fact that I truly do not buy that Ed Skrein is a leading man. I've enjoyed him as secondary characters or as a villain in movies like Deadpool, but for the lengthy screentime he gets here, I don't believe his performance held this movie together very well. I'm usually in full support of actors breaking out with large roles, but I'm just not sure he is one to carry the weight of powerhouses like Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, Luke Evans, or Patrick Wilson. The entire secondary cast outshined him throughout the entire film and I really did think that was a detriment to the movie as a whole, which is a shame since he does have potential.Now, I don't want to make people believe that this film is a pile of trash because it's not, but the most enjoyable aspect of this movie for me was also a mixed bag. Midway's strongest suit is that it doesn't hold back on the action. From the Pearl Harbour attack to the final act of the movie, there is a significant chunk of this film that's dedicated to action, and most of it is well-done in many regards, but it's far too artificial to buy into most of the time. Much like Roland Emmerich's recent movies, this film heavily relies on CGI, but I just don't think the team who worked on this movie truly delivered on what the budget was. A lot of this movie looks and feels fake, which really took me out of the battle scenes. With that said, aside from feeling artificial, it is well-filmed nonetheless.In the end, Midway isn't going to be remembered as one of the year's best films by any means, nor as one of Roland Emmerich's better efforts, but it may please some action junkies or fans of the war genre. Other than that, it's pretty standard fare with some questionable lead acting, although it does feature some exciting moments. This movie is a fine watch in retrospect, but nothing really worth recommending and nothing I'll ever have the desire to watch again. Again, some viewers may get a kick out of the exciting elements, but it just wasn't enough for me.",5,0,2,12 December 2019
Green Book," The Feel-Good Movie of the Year
","Usually, when a film is made and has very little depth in terms of storytelling, it would be forgotten about, but if you have a unique take on a specific story and the point of the movie is to keep it simple and explore only one facet of history. Personally, I prefer when stories are a little more fleshed out, but I also believe this simple story in Green Book is one of the best films of 2018. This is a movie that cares about its characters first and foremost and we don't see many of those films hitting the big screen very often, so this was a pleasant surprise. Although there's not much meat to the story (which may bore some viewers), I found Green Book to be a fantastic piece of filmmaking.Fired from the downtown club and forced to take any job he can in order to support his family, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) decides to take on the role of driving pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) across the South, as he and his band perform for audiences. With the inclusion of the fact that Don is an African-American man in the 1960s and Tony being an Italian-American, many racial occurrences arise for these two. Being an unlikely pairing for that particular decade, these characters needed to be like-able and completely fleshed out in order for this film to work and those two aspects were absolutely astoundingly well-done in my opinion. This also stems from a particularly great turn by director Peter Farrelly.Although his earlier work on films like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary are very commendable outings, his recent comedies haven't exactly struck gold. Having his last few films being Dumb and Dumber To, Hall Pass, and The Heartbreak Kid, I was very worried about him taking on a more dramatic film. After watching this film, I felt ridiculous even thinking that, because not only has he shown maturity as a director this time around, but also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a more meaningful premise. If he sticks with this style of filmmaking, I can definitely see his name in the public eye more often in the coming years. The way he handles his performers here was truly something special.As I said, it truly is the character arcs that carry this film and without amazing performances, this movie would've been forgotten. Mortensen and Ali both give their all in these roles and it shows. There wasn't a single moment where I found myself scratching my head or not believing a decision they made or line of dialogue they spoke. In the vein of films like Driving Miss Daisy or even Before Sunrise, the conversations are the reason this film doesn't feel slow. There's hardly a single exciting scene and the movie clocks in at nearly 140 minutes. That's when you know the dialogue has been written very well by the trio in Nick Vallelonga, Brian Hayes Currie, and Peter Farrelly.In the end, I can't see everyone loving this film, due to the slow pace it has, but it's a breezy crowd-pleaser nonetheless. This movie has been generating major awards consideration and I think it deserves every bit of it and then some. I loved my experience watching this movie and I can't wait to revisit it and take this journey with these characters again. Funny, sad, and heartwarming, Green Book easily earns the title of being one of the best feel-good movies in recent memory (at least to me). I loved this movie and I can't recommend it enough.",10,1,4,1 December 2018
Da 5 Bloods," An Emotionally Riveting, Essential Piece of Filmmaking
","When it comes to Spike Lee films, I've now come to expect a film that's at least good. Do the Right Thing is one of my favourite films of all time and BlacKkKlansman easily made my Top 10 list of 2018. It's very clear when you're watching a Spike Lee joint (as he likes to call them). Da 5 Bloods is his most recent directorial outing and streaming seems to be the saving grace for a lot of movies this year. Netflix has recently released it for all subscribers to view, and although a lot of the subject matter may be a lot to take in, I believe, especially due to the timing of the release and how it relates to society today, it is an essential piece of filmmaking.After losing one of their own in war, four American veterans return to where they lost him in order to uncover his body, as well as try to find the gold that they hid away. After this film sets the overall story in motion, it becomes a long, slow journey from beginning to end, but it's very much worth the investment. Becoming close with what seems to be new allies, a new plot begins to unfold, adding a huge layer of reality to the movie as a whole. It was very hard not to compare the notions throughout this film to that of the ones we're dealing with today, and for that reason alone, I believe this film is even more impactful than it already was upon completion.This film begins with real images and footage that are incredibly impactful and eye-opening. Throughout the movie, real images are cut to in order to exploit the harsh realities of certain things. That small aspect of the movie alone will be too much for some to handle. There are some horrific images that are not recreated for the movie, but rather just blatantly displayed on-screen, conveying some of the most emotional messages I've seen in a film in quite some time. On top of that, this movie relies heavily on the characters at the forefront of the story and if you don't buy their chemistry and their history together, this movie would've been a mess. Thankfully, there are some award-worthy performances here from everyone involved.In particular, as most viewers have been proclaiming, Delroy Lindo as Paul delivers one of the very best performances I've seen in a while. His screen presence here is electric and if any of the awards shows were coming soon, I could even make the argument that he deserves to win. He truly brings his A-Game here and I've never seen him better. Granted, this is the most acting I've ever seen from him, so it left quite an impression on me. In addition, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Norm Lewis, Clarke Peters, and the eventual joining of Jonathan Majors, all played off each other as if they were real-life friends. The acting in this film is off the charts.Written by Danny Bilson, Kevin Willmott, Spike Lee, and Paul De Meo, it was very clear that this was a collaborative effort. This film came from the heart and I was most surprised to see Paul De Meo's name attached. He's had his hand in writing video games in recent years, but in terms of feature films, his last notable screenplay was for The Rocketeer in 1991. I really hope to see him return to feature film screenplays in the future. From the way each character interacts with each other to the long monologues given (particularly by Lindo), this movie had me glued to the screen.In the end, Da 5 Bloods is an eye-opening film, to say the least. The story itself is very telling in its own right, but when you compare certain elements to our daily lives, this can be a huge lesson for some viewers. As I said, certain imagery will be too much for viewers to take in, so be wary if you're either squeamish or know that certain things will be stuck in your mind forever. Filled with a stellar cast, backed by superb direction, and written with a lot of care, Da 5 Bloods is a must-see. It's now streaming on Netflix and I highly recommend checking it out. It's also quite possibly the best movie that will be released for a while as well.",10,2,9,18 June 2020
Annihilation," A Slow, Yet Powerful Story
","Writer/director Alex Garland has been in the game for quite some time. Writing fantastic movies like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, his knack for filmmaking has always been present but was taken to another level in 2014 when he wrote and directed his first feature film in Ex Machina. Being one of my favorite films of that year, I found myself extremely excited for his next directed project. Annihilation has just hit theatres and if you're not someone who enjoys a slow burn in order to reach a worthy payoff, then this movie may not be for you. If you're up for anything and can embrace any sort of sci-fi story, then here's why I think you'll probably end up loving this movie as much as I did.Going into detail about the plot of this film would truthfully ruin it, so I'm going to explain this premise as simple as I possibly can. After having to deal with a tragic personal incident, Lena tasks herself with a group of women who plan to enter a forcefield area that has been created after a meteor has hit. Learning that they may not all come out alive, they strive forward to find the answers. Yes, that sounds very vague, but it's hard to talk about this movie to someone who hasn't seen it. For a premise like this, you need a few key things to make it work; A great screenplay, a great cast, and a nice through-line of direction to hold the movie together.Annihilation is a film that places its characters first before anything else, and while that definitely works in its favor, if the story surrounding them doesn't work then the overall film will fall pretty flat. Although it takes itself very seriously and many of the scenes are very slow-paced, you can tell that Garland has created a film that will slowly reveal itself as it goes along, providing insight into the backstory of each character as well as providing answers as who what exactly they're trying to uncover. Flashing back and forth between the past and the future, answers are given at the most opportune times in order to benefit the film.Natalie Portman remains a powerhouse when it comes to dramatic performances. I've always been a fan of her in pretty much any dramatic role and this one was no exception. That being said, she's not the only one who shines here. From Gina Rodriguez to Tessa Thompson, each of the supporting members seemed to have their time to shine and certain inciting moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some truly thrilling moments sprinkled throughout this movie and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I know I'm a sucker for great sci-fi films, but this is just another one to add to the list.In the end, while I can't say everyone will love this movie because I'd be lying if I did, I believe that everyone can at least admire the attempt at being different and unique from most mainstream movies out there today. Annihilation takes risks and doesn't give itself up to a generic conclusion. It chooses to be different from most films and never lets its foot off that peddle. Wonderfully directed, very well-written, and beautiful to look at, I can't really come up with any huge complaints. Yes, some will complain about the pacing and few may even complain about it being too bizarre in its final act, but I found these aspects to be a great addition. Annihilation is a fantastic movie and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up in my discussion for best films of 2018 at the end of the year. The year is still very young, but I can't recommend this movie enough. Go in with an open mind and you may just love it.",10,6,16,24 February 2018
Incredibles 2," The Movie Everyone's Been Waiting For
","Pixar has been a company that everyone cherishes. From their classics like Toy Story and Monsters Inc., to even their solid attempts at sequels in Monsters University and Finding Dory, their heart is and always has been in the right place. The reason I don't include Cars in this discussion is simply due to the fact that the sequels were only made to make the studio sell more merchandise. I don't fault them for that, because their original content is usually always stellar. The Incredibles was a film that was beloved by the majority of audiences around the world and it left people wondering why a sequel wasn't being made. Incredibles 2 has been long overdue for fans and there was almost too much hype to really live up to it for some. Personally, although I don't think this sequel surpasses the original in any way, it sure does live up to the hype in my opinion. Here's why I believe this movie delivered on all fronts.Picking up immediately after the events of the first film, this film can easily be viewed as an extension of the original, rather than a sequel. The seamless transition between films was flawless in my opinion. The world still believes that superheroes are a potential danger to the world, so Helen is taken away to help prove their innocence and to reinstate their relevance once again. This ends up leaving Bob with a task he really doesn't want all that much; taking care of the kids. Having to deal with his baby (Jack-Jack) having very special abilities, this causes a lot of stress in his life, but also a lot of laughs for the audience. Helen's storyline is very solid and makes for some great additions in terms of storytelling, but this is where the film doesn't quite get to the standards set by the first movie.Yes, Bob taking care of the kids is cute, Dash and Violet (his older kids) both have amazing times to shine is incredible (pun intended), and Jack-Jack's misadventures are show-stealing moments of hilarity, but I found myself a little tied down by the drama involving Helen. Her storyline exists in order to further the plot of the villain, which is completely fine, especially in a film made for a younger audience, but there were times that felt slightly predictable and bogged down the film a little. That being said, the pacing and cutting back and forth between these two storylines are really the only complaints I had about this movie. I personally think the first movie is near-perfect, so this is why I can't quite say I loved it as much as its predecessor.Where Incredibles 2 does make things a little more interesting is in its surprises and heart. There is plenty of action/espionage throughout the movie to keep fans entertained, but the backbone of the movie is reversing everyone's role in comparison with the first movie and it really did add a layer that I felt authentic, which I was expecting to feel forced. The pacing in the middle of the movie is saved by a fantastic conclusion that had me grinning from ear to ear. Some people may find this movie to be a slightly slower burn than the energetic pacing of the first, but that's simply because the story required it.Incredibles 2 is a fantastic sequel and easily one of the best follow-ups that Pixar has ever done (excluding the Toy Story sequels obviously). Personally, I think this movie was well worth the wait. It went in a few directions that I wasn't expecting it to, its themes are very relevant to today's climate and adults will definitely see where that comes into play, and the score by Michael Giacchino leaps off the screen. Very well written and directed by Brad Bird (who also helmed the original), this movie is the definition of a film that warrants its existence and proves that the people who were demanding a sequel were doing the right thing throughout the years. Incredibles 2 may not become as beloved as its predecessor, but it's still a fantastically well-done film nonetheless.",9,3,13,15 June 2018
