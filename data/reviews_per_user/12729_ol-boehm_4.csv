The Avengers," Avengers pain in the brain
",I don't care that much about special effects or budget but the story and logic and fun is most important for any movie. This movie failed in many areas esp you need brain damage to accept the story. To put Hulk into a flying ship is just some example how fail the story is. Well to put Hulk into enemy flying ship is somewhat clever but put it into own flying ship WTF? Problem with all these superhero movies is that by definition no hero can die so actually you already know the end of the movie before it start. Ironman put off his armor 50% of the movie despite they are permanent in war and always contact with enemy. The movie was very slow too as it took about 100min to introduce all the 'new' characters and give them some fake glue to form a team. When the enemy finally arrived which was about 5min before the end of the movie I didn't even see how the high advanced enemy can win over the street NY policemen with hand pistols. For strange reason the us army didn't join the fight so NY policemen with some heroes did the job alone. Loki as the only villain in that movie acted like a joke and fitted seamless into that crap movie. I still don't get it how can you put a super hero as Loki with near unlimited god powers into a 'glas cage' and call that secure.,1,40,134,1 May 2012
World War Z," This movie is insult to intelligence
",technical after 5-10 you had to walk out of this movie as your jumping from one plot hole to the next plot hole basically I should vote 0/10 but i could see it for free so 1/10 is OK besides from the plot holes (this movie has no real story) the directing and camera movement is awful too you cant see anything with this shaking and dark mess you cant even see who is a zombie from 3m onward distance to make a zombie movie with pg16 is genius too I don't even know why they are called zombies i am surprised they didn't call-in the Prometheus scientist team again which has already proved it can handle such stuffabout the people you know that brad Pitt will survive and about the rest you don't carelol lol lol what a crap movie,1,28,56,1 July 2013
Avengers: Endgame," Timetravel madness
","Never ever use timetravel to resolve or fix anything, when you start to see or use timetravel to fix the past then you enter uncharted land where anything is possible if it make sense or not.So you killed my father I will timetravel to kill your father that you dont get born but hey cant you timetravel to kill my father so I dont get born but why you then want to kill my father?Can we sure that every change in the past will not split a new present so no matter what I fix in the past it wont change my present thus creating another present where I habe no access too.This can go on and on and on so even this movie could play 24h each solution for anyhing can be changed and unfixed with next time travel step.For this movie I can say only no matter how it ends who knows if in next movie some timetravel will unwind and we are square one or in just random mess.Because of timetravel you must disconnect to anything because no matter what happens it can be rewinded and changed with a complete different outcome.I am glad I didnt have to pay money for thiss mess.",1,107,207,25 April 2019
Alien: Covenant," You got it all wrong this is the real deal about Covenant!
",First I was thinking how it possible that Convenant was make such a crap with team such stupid way. I was sleeping over it and now I final found the solution. Ridley did know he screwed up Prometheus big time so he solved it in a way which I would only say its a masterpiece.First you must understand that fanboys always like Alien movies no matter how stupid it will be so the only important is to convince the non fanboys.So the genius move from Ridley is he made Covenant so bad and stupid it will look like Prometheus like an masterpiece of movie now. Even the stupid team from Prometheus looks now like a highly trained bunch of professional scientists.try guess how bad Conveant II will be now to make/fix Covenant then.About Conveant I don't write the plot holes or other stupid things as its 99% of the movie playtime.One thing 100% off all people missed is that why not the Convenant team weak up some of the 2000 frozen up dudes to replace the killed team members and other stupid thing is after 50 people from the 2000 frozen dudes already killed all people & robots still talking about 2000 when there are actually only 1950 left :)PS: Unlike most of you I didn't waste a single $ to watch this movie.,1,33,66,26 May 2017
