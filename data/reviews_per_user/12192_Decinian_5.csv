Requiem for a Dream," A wonderful masterpeice that'll shock you...
","This is one of the best movies ive ever seen and my personal favorite. Afronsky does a terrific job transforming the book into this classic movie. Afronsky's directing style is probally one of the things which makes this movie interesting and great. The acting is superb by everyone especially Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burnstyn. And i must say i was completley shocked by Marlon Wayans performance ( i didnt think he could act for beans , kind of like my spelling .) From the moment this movie begins to the very end you will be enticed and shocked by it. If you wish to see this movie i strongly recomend the directors cut, the edited version just doesnt show how horrible the scenes are and the extremities people will go to to acheive thier dream (thus the title). Now if your one of those people who think that this is one of those antidrugs movies only put out by the Gov. to try and convince you not to smoke drugs you are wrong. This movie really is a study of raw human emotion and compassion, though the drugs are the downfall of the people the intwined message is not 'say no to drugs'. This movie is simple a story of the people who try so hard to reach thier dream and fail. However i do not recomend this movie to children or conservative people. This movie contains violence, drug content, nudity, strong sexual content, adult lanuage, adult content ( basically everything ). I would also like to urge many people to watch this movie itll make you really think and reflect about you life. It made me cry the first time i saw it and think about everything i had done (no i didnt used to be a drugdealer, im only 15 , bet you didnt expect that). A great combination of writing, directing, and acting makes this a movie which will remain classic and my favorite for many years to come.'Mary!?'

Spider-Man," The perfect example of Hollywood...
","Money.  This is all Hollywood stands for, and all it really cares about. Spider-Man's main goals: 1. Money 2. Money. and 3. Money.  I saw this movie on it's opening weekend, and left the movie theater with a bad migraine, and several regrets.  I could not comprehend what people found so great about this movie.  Yeah it had some good action sequences, and some fancy camera angels ( which was the main cause of my migraine ), but aside from that nothing special.  The acting is simply the actors reading off of que cards, and occasionaly smiling.  Despite the fact that Kirsten and Toby did go out during this film there was no chemistry between them at all ( nor anyone else for that matter ).  The plot is just plane unoriginal, and moronic. 'Uh oh my uncle died well I better go become a superhero, and save the world.'    However it is not the movie I hate so much, but rather everything surronding the movie.  The hundreds of hours of advertising,  the thousands of stupid toys,  the fact that the companys had to slap Spider-Man's face on every coke bottle, candy bar, and happy meal.  If you have read my other reveiws you can tell I'm not too partial nor fond of Hollywood, which may or may not 'blind' my judgement.  Perhaps I have been a little too harsh.  The movie itself is entertaining, and you can easily sit through it many times over.  William Defoe ( I know that is misspelled ) is great, as always. Only he could act his way through the Green Goblin mask.  However I do not look at movies as just things to watch when I'm bored, I think of movies as contempary paintings, and the directors artisits.  That's why I did not like this movie, it had no real objective rather then $.  Over all it merits about 5 out of 10.",1,8,22,27 December 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," If this is 'art' what does that make pornography...
","Now i just want to say this upfront so the Kubrick fans do not become prejudice by the opening comment. I , myself , am i large Kubrick fan! I loved Space Oddyesy, The Shinning was very scary, and A Clock Work Orange was brillant... However we all make mistakes. I have read many comments for this movie, and i seem to meet in the middle. I do think there was a message, but whatever it was it was drowned out by senseless nudity, sex, and meandering scenes. All these elements seem classic in one way or the other in Kubrick films, however it seems akward in this film. Personally i think Kubrick may have just pushed the mantle on these elements too far. Now just because i didnt love this movie, or only watched this movie for the nude scenes means a have a short attention span, or am mentally challenged. Kubrick had not done a film in a good while, it turned out to be a dissapointment, the fans couldnt comprehend that kubrick had made a bad movie and there for call this movie brillant and listen to no body else. NO OFFENSE TO THE KUBRICK FANS, THESE ARE JUST MY OPINIONS, AND IM ONLY ONE GUY ! I think this could of been a very good movie however it wasnt. I understand the whole message of marriage and monogamy.Anyways i guess i'll wrap this up with something which well please both the fans and the people who hated it. Uhh.... this is more difficult then i thought how about Kubrick was a terrific director however may have lost his way on this one.

Cube," What a refreshing break from the normal hollywood tripe...
","It is always nice to see a new movie that is truly great and doesnt require 20 million dollar actors, over the top special effects, and over 200 diffrent action figures. My brother rented this movie without any knowledge about it or what it was even about. Needless to say we were all sceptical, however we gave it a chance. Now i dont know what our faces looked like afterwards but i know we were flabbergastered ( possible misspelled ). This movie was great! I mean all the actors did a fine job and the director certainly was good however it wasnt those things which made this movie what it is. It is a rare thing seen in contemporary hollywood its called a script, and trust me Cube had a great one. From the very beginning to the very end this movie left endless questions for the viewers to constantly ponder. ( POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! ) I mean how did they get on the cube? What was it for ? What was Kazzams deal? What happened at the end to Kazzam? Now i can understand how the fact that the end of this movie brings up more questions then answers can frustrate. But it was this fact that i loved about the movie, you had no idea what was gonna happen next. However you truly must watch this movie sevral times, each time you pick up on something you didnt notice or see the previous time. This movie is truly great and your looking for something that is original then this is most definatley your movie. However if you dont like movie that answer nothing, seem cheap, and dont follow 'hollywood standards'. This movie merits an 8/10.'No more talking. No more guessing. Dont even think about nothing that's not right infront of your face. That's the real challenge. You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves...'-The Rene, 'Cube'",8,0,1,1 August 2002
Gladiator," Hmmm... a plot...interesting...
","There is an ever more popular trend in Hollywood movies now-a-days. The trend is taking a substance, called plot, out of scripts by mass amounts and filling these gaping holes with another substance called action. Now dont get me wrong action is fine in the right amount of dosage and for the right movies however now thier seems to be an overflow of this stuff. As you can tell by the sarcasm in my comments that i like this movie and i like the fact that it takes the time to set up a story rather then jump into a bunch of bull. And becuase of an overdose of this plot this movie gets a bad wrap. I personally love this movie and was what turned me on to history. Now with that out of the way lets talk about the movie. I must say that nearly every aspect of this movie, from the extensive amounts of weaponry created to the acting and directing impressed me. Ridley is a fantastic director and does a phenominal job with this movie, using old techniques of movie making with modern day technology was a stroke of genius. The historical accuracy ( the armor, arms, and buildings. Not the story ) was amazing, from the blade of a sword to the grandure of Rome astonished me. Music! The music makes this movie and sets the mode so well it almost makes you weap ( well, not really but you get the picture ). Hans Zimmer is truly a god at music, i respect him a great bit now. All actors in this film do a great job, however Jaquin Pheonix really stills the show. Playing the very disturbed and conflicted Commodos, Jaquin does a great job expressing conterdicting emotions and facial expressions. Though the story is well told and petty solid ( with exception of some historical inaccuracies ) it is not that original, of course then again what is now-a-days. And.... geez i didnt realize how much i loved this movie well lets cut to the chase. Im not gonna insult you or call you an unitellectual if you didnt like this movie or thought it was boring, becuase i can understand what your complaints are. I just dont agree with them. But if you liked BraveHeart or Spartacus you will not be let down by this movie. I think this movie deserves a 9/10 ( sorry only Shawshank and Requiem get a 10 in my book ).'What we do in life echoes an eternity'<ul><li>General Maximus, 'Gladiator'</li></ul>",9,0,0,30 July 2002
