Ali," So when is the sequel?
","I watched this with my son and wife since he was doing a report on Ali for school.I normally enjoy Will Smith movies and he does a good job portraying my ideal of Ali.However, there is little substance in this movie, even though it is more than 2 hours long.For one thing, the movie ends just after the George Foreman fight. He had 14 more fights after that. Apparently, Ali's life wasn't very interesting after 1974.There is ZERO relationship building with his corner... Jamie Foxx's character is built up a bit, but not much. His wives??? I guess they didn't play much of a role in his life. There was one sentence about him having affairs on the side.What happens is that the audience is suppose to be an educated audience. They are suppose to know the whole story already (i.e. rope-a-dope)Even the boxing was in slow motion. No excitement at all. Writer/Director: Hey, since they know the outcome already, let's just fill in this part.The political commentary...well, if you're going to do it..do it right!I only give it a 5 because Smith played a convincing role. No one should be giving this a 1 or 2, but no way is it a 9 or 10 either. ...right down the middle. If you have 2+ hours of your life to waste..have at it.",5,0,1,18 February 2009
The Hunger Games," Running Man/LOTR meets every 'last man standing' movie
","First off, didn't read the books..get that out of the way. But my 11 y/o son did. I'll just mention that he said they missed a lot of important parts about the storyline.There is very little character build-up. You just kind of have to guess what is going on with these characters. There are 24 selected combatants who are give about two weeks to prepare. First off, it's insane to think a 12 y/o girl can compete against an 18 y/o (professionally trained) man. However, that seems fair to this 'advanced' government. So, after 2 weeks of preparation, their plans are to die instantly or run away. There are few battles and you get just a countdown of everyone dying off in the distance somewhere. There's a gang of 5 or 6 that KNOW only one can survive, but no one back-stabs (literally) anyone. The rules change and are very predictable. Somehow, without explanation, the controllers of the game can make fire bombs appear or mutant dogs, but for some reason 'sponsors' can help. Why do they need help when there's 10000 lbs of supplies at the start? It's really annoying to watch..I can't imagine reading the books without being annoyed as well. I give it a 3/10 to my son's dismay.",3,13,20,31 March 2012
District 9," Average Sci-Fi Flick
","Just because a movie is filmed in a Documentary format, does not make it a great movie. If you just go by what formulas movie makers go by, this movie has everything. They could have explained more about the Aliens so perceived plots holes would not annoy the audience. However, in general, no one really cares about the aliens because they look like walking lobsters. The film makers try to humanize them by having the parents protect a baby alien...but again, just because it's a small alien doesn't mean we have to like him.The main character is really a bad..bad person. We are to believe this guy, who looks like a low level manager, is going to be charge of a mass migration of the prawn to another camp. Except, there are 1.8 million of them and he's going door-to-door to evict them...ugh. He clearly has no morals when it comes to the aliens. I found it very annoying when is he asked to shoot one later in the film that he has a problem with it based on the fact he killed several baby prawn earlier in the film (in a quite nasty way). He's also a mass killer of government employees (his direct colleagues in some cases). Again, just not a guy you are going to root for too much.The actor who plays him is a nobody and that carries over to the character. He's actually hard to understand sometimes with his heavy South African accent.His infection with alien DNA is believable, but the fact what infected him is a fuel source that can power ships is not so believable. DNA cannot do everything and it's not silly putty.I do like the alien weaponry and the DNA on/off switch (ala Stargate TV series). Some pretty cool effects and those scenes are quite enjoyable to watch.Overall, I do like the action and pace of the film. I enjoy Alien visits Earth movies, but this comes off as Alien Nation meets The Fly. I give it a 7/10 because of its uniqueness. Remember that 7/10 in the real world is a C- ;)There is no way this is better than let's say, Alien or Aliens.Would I recommend it in a theater? Yes, a matinÃ©e priced showing.",7,2,6,21 August 2009
The Dark Knight," No way is this #1, but not too bad
","There were just too many 'what the ???''s in this movie for me. Like the hospital blowing up. Wouldn't anyone notice someone placing all the explosives...etc...there's lots of things like that in the movie where the Joker somehow comes out of nowwhere to be the most powerful villain in the city.His demise at the end is another worthless scene...I have no idea what happened.Batman's voice is very hard to understand at times.He has like 1 or 2 cool toys..that's it. James Bond out-does him there.Another love story...ugh. I had enough of that with Spiderman...not to mention that she looks EXACTLY like spiderman's girlfriend.The action scenes are good, but nothing extreme and there aren't a lot of them.Of course, you knew the commish was gonna get it when you heard the Lt.'s name was Gordon.I personally think Aliens or T2 should be #1, but hey, that's just me. There is NO WAY you will come out of the theater like I did when I saw Aliens or T2.Almost every scene is basically dark/and or wet. Typical batman movie. Kind of annoying.7/10 because it was a pretty good summer flick. It might be a while before I watch it again. I think the more you watch it, the more it 'might' get better...at least, that's what I hope.",7,2,4,27 July 2008
Elysium," Why can't Earth have MedBeds?????
","This is a pretty good movie..lots of action. But the whole STUPID medbeds thing where they regen ANYTHING for humans...why is it only on the space station?The whole point of a takeover was about money...think how much money a company would make with a medbed.One other minor point is the main character who seems to morph in and out of radiation sicknessoh yeah, forgot.. why can't they have Elysium on Earth???Other than those very annoying plot lines, it's a cool movie.Lots of action and District 9 look",7,0,1,16 November 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Straight to Star Trek V status
","I've seen the original movie probably 5 times and really like it. This one has little to do with the first, which is good. However, unlike other franchises where the second movie improves, this goes straight to Star Trek V status IMHO. There are way too many jokes. This may as well be labeled comedy-SciFi. Everyone likes comedies, but the jokes are repetitive and I was wondering when a fart joke was going to show up. The plot/logic is just 'poke you in the ribs' annoying. The first scene with the fight. Why? It's almost as if they had a purpose built arena to fight the bad guy with the batteries (which no one explains) there for the taking. The people who hire the Guardians clearly have defensive capabilities and somehow have knowledge of this bad guy coming and don't use them...even though throughout the movie, they are more than willing to.Ego..Death Star..'nuf saidLots of questions like why didn't Ego just take Starlord at anytime before his mother died. Ego clearly indicates that Starlord is very important to his plans.And then there's Yondu's arrow. This is clearly 100x more powerful than the entire Guardians' arsenal. Him and Peter's ascent into space was exactly like Peter's and Gamora's in the first movie, yet....Why does Ego have to sleep?The whole time, during any shoot out, you'll be wondering when it will end because no one can hit anyone else. If they do get hit and crash. No big deal, they'll just bounce right back and repair it.Little Groot is suppose to be cute and they over do that too...but that will get the kids into the movie.Anyway, If you've seen Star Trek V, then you'll get the references when you watch this movie.",5,2,6,15 May 2017
The Happening," War of the Worlds without the Martians
","Just a quick comment. I thought the movie was interesting, but the actresses in the movie are...terrible. The lead woman character is mind-numbingly boring to listen to. The 8-year old girl (looks older) has the personality of a fish.It's a pretty good horror-flick...as those go.There was no real(good) explanation as to why everything was Happening(sic).I can't imagine it cost very much to make this movie. Very little CGI and only a few shooting locations. This requires the story to carry the movie, but of course, unlike the sixth sense, there is no conclusion to the movie.5/10...wait for the DVD.",5,1,3,14 July 2008
John Wick: Chapter 2," Hit-man who can't hit
","First off, character development: NONE I could care less who lived or died in this movieThe gunfire scenes are laughable. None of the bad guys work together and they all come out of hiding and basically yell 'shoot me'. One after the other, they keep coming and yet can't seem to get the idea of hiding behind anything for protectionHe does meet up with a guy who seems to be (almost) his equal and of course, no baddies are around to helpAt least the female villain was dispatched of quickly.Lots of 'rules' that no one seems to obey.Morpheus and Neo together again...uhhh, NO",4,4,8,25 May 2017
