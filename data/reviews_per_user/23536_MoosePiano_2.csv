The Blair Witch Project," A testament to good filmmaking.
","I make amateur movies (in fact I'm working on a project right now called 'The McCarthy Witch Hunt Project'). I loved this movie. I think I know, though, how people could have disliked it...IT WAS DIFFERENT. Anyone who makes amateur movies for fun would probably enjoy it. Anyone else,however, well that's a different story. I enjoyed the way that the filmmakers took practically unedited footage and created such a sense of desperation at the situation presented to the three characters. For a low-budget movie, this was EXTREMELY well executed. No special effects, no music, this movie was raw emotion and chaos. It leaves a lot to the imagination, which is good. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you make movies.",Null,0,1,26 September 1999
12 Angry Men," A look at justice
","This movie is a masterful look into the workings of trial by jury. At the movie's opening all of the jurors are ready to send the defendant to the chair...except one (Fonda). He takes it upon himself to try to convince the other jurors that there is reasonable doubt that he committed the crime and thus potentially save an innocent man's life. Having never served on a jury, this movie made me think about how an innocent person can be saved by thoroughly examining all of the facts, rather then jumping to false conclusions. For anyone who hasn't seen it, it may boost your faith in the justice system and your fellow man.",Null,0,1,31 July 2000
