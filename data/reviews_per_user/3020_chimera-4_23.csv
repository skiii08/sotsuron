Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Entertainment...
","I saw The Phantom Menace last night and although I tried to ignore all the hype and expectations that this movie had to live up to (which was difficult as TPM has to be the most hyped movie EVER !!!) and go in there with a totally open mind, when I saw those immortal words came up on that screen at the beginning I found myself sat there thinking 'Please let this be good, please let this be good..'. And thankfully it was.Sure this movie isn't without it's flaws. The first 20 minutes or so seem very awkward and I was really thinking that if it carried on this way it was going to be the biggest let down in movie history. But seeing as George Lucas hasn't directed a movie in some time he obviously had to get into the swing of things again and I was prepared to let it go. The film did pick up immensely though and although there was very little background to any of the plot and practically no character development whatsoever, the film built up nicely to an absolutely blinding lightsaber battle finale. I'll go with most critics view that this film just opened loads of possibilities and then left them to be explored in later episodes which was a shame as I'm sure George Lucas could have stuffed enough in there to keep us satisfied, add a little more substance to the movie and have plenty more surprises for later installments.And I don't know if it's just me or not but considering the story is supposed to be set 40 years ago the technology of the age seems vastly superior to that seen in the other 3 movies which is strange...Of the acting I thought Ewan McGregor did a great job of playing Obi-Wan Kenobi. There were times when he spoke where I swear it sounded just like Alec Guiness. But unfortunately Liam Neeson gives the most wooden and uncaring performance I've ever seen for some completely unfathomable reason. Natalie Portman is good as the Queen AND her handmaiden Padme and the character voice are good if slightly cartoonish. I liked Watoo the owner of the junk yard who sounded just like Marlon Brando from the Godfather but the crappy dubbed sounding Japanese accents of those aliens at the beginning that worked for Darth Sidious. Pleeeeeaase!!! There are some nice humourous touches too like Jabba the Hutt introducing the pod race and then his aid waking him up when it's all over. And the botched heroics of Jar Jar Binks who, despite what you might have heard is not nearly as annoying as you might think. Still, with that said the action sequences are faultless and keep you on the edge of your seat, the FX are, as expected, stunning and although it doesn't quite have that Star Wars buzz (partly I feel due to the new mediums and technologies used in TPM.)there are still enough ties to the current Star Wars universe to give it good continuity.When I came out of the cinema I thought to myself 'was I satisfied with that as a part of the Star Wars Saga...?'. And I came to the conclusion that Yes I bloody was and I can't wait until Episode 2. Come on George, get your finger out, do you really expect us to wait until 2002..?",Null,0,0,18 July 1999
Fight Club," Not the film the hype made it out to be...
","I really wanted to see this film at the flicks but never got round to it. Having rented it on video I have to say I enjoyed it immensley BUT this movie is NOT the movie you think it is at all. All the trailers and articles you may have read make Fight Club out to be a testosterone fuelled macho fight movie with a few philosophical notions chucked in for good measure. While these elements are there, Fight Club is more a psychological thriller, an insight into the psyche of one man who on the outside is just as conforming as most of the rest of us but inside longs to express his chaotic primal instincts in a definitive and liberating manner.The twist towards the end took me totally by surprise but it also made a few scenes early on in the film make a bit more sense and overall gave the film a more powerful edge. David Fincher is fast showing himself to be a talented and very capable director with such films as Se7en and The Game to his name. His artistic and gritty direction also almost made Alien 3 good too.Acting is fine all round and Meat Loaf (in the first acting role I've seen him in (Spice Girls movie doesn't count)) proves to be a pretty good actor too. There are quite a few funny moments too although I'm sure some of the things I found funny weren't meant to be (the liposuction raid (ok maybe it was meant to be then)) and other people probably didn't find that amusing but thats my problem.All round a film worth seeing but don't be fooled by the advertising and hype. Thats not the movie you're getting at all.",Null,0,1,4 May 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Two parts boring, One part good.
","The title says it all really. I felt the first two hours of Worlds End were actually pretty dull but then things pick up for the last hour and thats when I thought things started to get better. The movie itself has some neat ideas but it's also clear that the writers didn't really know how to wrap up some of the ideas introduced in Dead Man's Chest which is a real shame. For example when we first see Captain Jack he's in Davy Jones Locker (presumably he's delivered there by the Kraken) which is supposed to be some kind of hell but basically just looks like a big desert which conveniently has a big ship in the middle of it. This part felt really awkward and a bit contrived as do many parts in the movie. The directorial style feels different from the first two and I wonder if Gore Verbinskey didn't just let 2nd unit directors have a shot this time round.There are only a few action set pieces, mainly the beginning and the end. The one at the start again felt contrived and was unnecessary and boring and only served to introduce us to Chow Yun Fats character who is basically just window dressing to the story and is mostly completely pointless. Characters don't feel right here either, they just don't feel like they did in the first 2 movies and in an effort to make the story a bit more exciting and unpredictable the characters are constantly shifting their allegiances for no good reason and sometimes with no good motivation either and that really got boring eventually.The second major action piece is the naval battle at the end centred around a huge whirpool (you might have seen it in the trailers). This was pretty spectacular and exciting and was really well done.Keith Richards is OK as Jacks Father with really cool costume and make-up, he makes for a really neat looking grizzled pirate although he took his role far too seriously and would have been better lightening up a bit.FX in this movie are pretty much phenomenal across the board, you can really see where the money went with huge naval battles and inventive duels galore.And then of course there's Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow who is as good as ever despite his material not being that great in some places.The movie in general is a lot darker than the first two and that seemed to have sucked some of the fun out of it for me although there are still some funny moments in the movie.Overall Worlds End really isn't as good as 1 and 2 but despite its misgivings it is fairly fun in quite a few places and does wrap up well. It even leaves room for a Pirates 4 so you never know.P.S. Since when could Davy Jones walk through walls? Another unessecary plot mechanic that insults the previously established mythology and serves no purpose whatsoever in terms of plot mechanics.",6,3,7,1 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Disappointing actually
","I don't get it. Same actors, same director, the writers I don't know about but I really felt this was a huge disappointment. It feels rushed, spread too thin with too many villains and the emotional content of the first two that gave them their impact is gone. The movie feels really uneven and they totally screwed up Venom which was the guy I waited nearly 2 hours to see. Venoms origin was handled OK but I HATED the way the actors face would pop through the CGI to taunt Spider-Man and basically deliver crap one liners. The first two Spider-Man movies were better than that. In the end I couldn't care less about Venom which I felt was a total missed opportunity though the look of the symbiote was spot on. Likewise Sandman, an OK origin scene, some totally lame subplot about his sick daughter thats supposed to make us give the guy some sympathy and then a totally unnecessary huge monster sandman of the week creature at the end. These guys should have admitted they'd run out of ideas and farmed the job out to someone that gave a sh*t.The actors all seem like they've really had enough in this movie and likewise the direction felt lazy and rushed. To be honest Venom should probably have been left for another day, or one of the bad guys anyway. I did like how the Peter/Harry/MJ story came to an end but again it felt rushed and kind of convenient for the rest of the plot. The action scenes though were well done and give the movie it's more memorable moments but without a good solid narrative you can get behind to gel them together they're just little more than empty spectacle.Why can't we have a live action spider-man series instead so we can flesh these stories and characters out a bit more.Anyway I hope they pull their finger out with Spider-Man 4.",5,2,5,3 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," A complete and utter joke!!!!
","OK let me first start by saying that I only watched the first half of this movie and what I saw turned me off enough that I really didn't care one bit how it was all going to pan out.What? How you can you slate it if you haven't even seen it all the way through I hear you ask? Well quite easily actually since what I saw was the most ineptly handled mess I've had the displeasure of subjecting myself to for quite some time and I doubt very much that anything could have redeemed it, a sentiment echoed by a lot of the people who've commented on this movie (feel free to jump in and correct me anytime) from what I've seen.So what's wrong with it then? Well for a start the acting is beyond poxy, there are very few decent actors here and even they are wasted due to really bad cheesefest and cliché style dialogue. Most of the characters are too stupid to live, I mean if you open a door and get bombarded by millions of flies who were chowing down on a hanging rotting corpse you close the freaking door you don't stand there for 5 minutes trying to swat a billion flies. You also don't sleep in the open when there's zombies swarming everywhere either.The scene with all the birds was embarrassingly laughable. I mean here's a thousand infected crows swarming everywhere yet despite people being outside and obviously in the firing line the birds remain in their crappy CGI swarm high up in the sky until the script calls for someone to cop it in which case a few suddenly appear on cue and attack someone while completely ignoring everyone else including people trying to help the victim, it's pathetic.The direction is really bad and the action is handled so awkwardly that boring and disjointed doesn't even begin to sum it up.I enjoyed the first Resident Evil for the guilty pleasure it was despite the fact that it really short changed us on the monster front. The second one as well although not as good as the first due to it's descent into C movie cliché was OK for what it was but this one is just totally pointless and could have been one of a million other generic zombie movies if it weren't for the R.E. branding. And unless I missed some huge money shot at the end, the FX were pretty naff as well although some of the Zombie make-up was good.I have to say as well that 90% of what I saw had me thinking that I was watching a fan-made remake of Day of the Dead since half the plot elements seem to have been lifted from that (far superior) movie including an underground complex in the middle of the desert where the science team are at odds with the suits (DotD it was the military) while trying to domesticate zombies since they've apparently given up on a cure. The excruciatingly painful scene where they present a supposedly domesticated zombie with relics from his life (cellphone, childs toy etc) featured some guy as a zombie that didn't seem to know what one actually was. Even if he'd watched Sean of the Dead he would have got some idea how to portray one. The scene really left me pining for 'Bubb', the trained zombie of DotD.Unless this film pulled some ballbustingly amazing sh*t out of the bag in it's final act then I thank the Lord that I had the good grace to see what was coming and not waste another minute on this poorly conceived piece of tripe.....Once again it's 'Thank You Drive Through!'",2,2,5,20 December 2007
Cloverfield," Cutting Edge Cinema
","Cloverfield is a mish mash of several ideas, none completely original but everything seems to gel together nicely giving the viewer what feels like a fresh experience.What we have here is the good old classic monster movie of old, you know, big man in monster suit (though the monster FX are awesome)up from the depths (although it could have been outer space, we never do find out for sure) because of some nuclear tests gone west. Monster proceeds to chew it's way through (insert major city here although this time round it happens to be Manhattan, big enough to give the creature ample stomping ground but small enough that if they have to nuke it there's plenty more America left to go around) and laughs off all manner of firepower in the meantime leaving the viewer wondering how the hell humankind's going to get out of this one (in other words which of the standard monster movie/invasion endings are going to save our butts, you know, micro-germs, superior firepower, monster gets bored and goes home etc). We've all seen this movie in one of a thousand iterations before.What makes Cloverfield unique though is the perspective through which we see the events unfold. The whole thing is presented as thought it were a leaked (although they couldn't really hush up events of this scale)clump of handycam footage taken by a small group of people affected by these happenings. There's no credits till the end, instead at the beginning we get a Department of Defence watermark along with some official blurb stating what this 'found' footage is. The movie then is this 'raw' footage in it's entirety from the testimonials at a surprise party through the events of the evening to it's conclusion (?!?!) which may or may not be the end of the story. Now because of this, there are bits which feel a bit disjointed. I mean we get everything throughout the evening of the main characters and these things sometimes cross over with the whole monster stomping scenario but there are times you want to see more of what's going on but instead our limited viewpoint denies us these things. This isn't as big a problem as it was with Speilbergs War of the Worlds though. Here you get to see lots of things you wanted to see in that movie but didn't. Massive military might up against this thing, I mean up close and personal (which you did see in WotW but it wasn't as satisfying as it is here)as well lots of convenient and circumstantial encounters with the creature which give you either some 'Did I just see that' moments or some real in your face OMG moments.The parts without the main plot (monster) are still interesting enough though that most of the time you don't mind not seeing what's going on elsewhere though and the film does a good job in the first 10 minutes portraying normal people in a real world situation that when stuff starts going down you think 'oh yeah, the monster stuff'.It's also testament that when the main event isn't on screen the story still continues off screen thanks to excellent sound design. One scene where our troupe are down in an underground station talking and stuff, you can still here stuff happening above. Explosions, gunfire, creatures roaring etc. You really feel like you're in the midst of this thing. Some of the jerky handycam footage might make some people a bit sick if you're sitting close to the screen but all up it really helped add to the 'in your face and personal' nature of the format.The look of the creature has been a closely guarded secret which was either because they wanted it be a total surprise or because it looked really pants. Well I'm happy to report that all monsters/creatures and things appearing in this movie looked really cool if a little bit derivative. You rarely see the big picture but you do see up close and detailed bits of the little picture. You're frantically trying to build a picture in your head of what the thing looks like, it's like trying to mentally piece together a jigsaw puzzle.My only gripe (and it's pretty small) is that due to the way the action is framed around the smaller more personal story of our small group of friends there's little room for exposition and when it does come it's a bit obvious and set up but I really don't know any other way they could have done it. Also there's little real plot or character development but since the movie takes place mostly over the course of one night and again due to the way it's presented I didn't really find it that much of a problem.J.J.Abrams and team did an admirable job giving the retro Monster Movie a solid reboot here. Some people might find the abrupt ending (which is realistic in light of how it's presented) a turn off but personally I think it's a good opportunity to load up the DVD with extras to fill in some of the blanks (like the Blair Witch Project did)...There's some real iconic moments in Cloverfield and while this movie is being hyped up to the high heavens so can't possibly live up to all it's expectations, there's definitely a top flight experience offered here that most will surely enjoy.",9,4,10,17 January 2008
Nacho Libre," Absolutely just plain terrible.
","I'm sure deep in the recesses of Jack Blacks mind the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't. You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy, slimy Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department.I just sat there through most of the movie thinking 'Is this supposed to be funny' and 'This is the guy from Tenacious D right?'. The truth is this film has NOTHING to offer. AT ALL! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. You'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't. I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. It didn't. 90 minutes later I'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.It's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. Yeah it's like that.I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man. If you do this to us again Jack I'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something. At the least give you a serious talking to.I know it's a cliché but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons....",1,6,13,20 April 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great movie but the flying, oh the flying.....
","A martial arts film with heart. And great acting and a fair bit of emotional content too. I found Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to be a highly enjoyable movie. A simple but engrossing plot, beautiful scenery and great fight sequences make this a martial arts movie for people who don't like martial arts movies.And for people who do.Although I did have one gripe with the film and it's either a minor or major one depending on how you look at it.The flying and leaping about looked absolutely PANTS. It was the worst wirework I have ever seen in a movie.Apart from that though, great movie.",Null,0,0,9 July 2001
2012," At best, totally by the numbers....
","I don't know what I was thinking going into 2012. I guess I hoped it wasn't as generic as the trailers made it seem. Every trailer I'd ever seen for the movie made it look pretty much exactly like The Day After Tomorrow and it pretty much was. Famous landmarks getting destroyed, mass destruction, hero outrunning/driving/flying mass destruction, family rifts that get healed up at the end, Inconvenient spouses offed and then completely forgotten about/ignored for the sake of reconciliation with exes. All the cliché trademarks are all present and correct, doing their duty by merely showing up. To be fair it's a competent enough, if silly, disaster movie which offers no surprises whatsoever while laying on more (admittedly impressive looking) empty spectacle for the sake of empty spectacle.It felt way too long at nearly 3 hours and at least half of that was the build up. Predictable and seen it all before buildup at that. We've all seen it before. Strange geological anomolies. Nerdy tech guys coming up with unbelievable numbers that mean bad sh*t is gonna be going down. Officials that don't buy it then eventually do, the crazy survivalist dude that everyone thinks is nuts that really knows what's going down (here played by a very entertaining Woody Harelson, probably the best thing about the movie) etc.You can pretty much go with your impression of the trailer for this movie. What you get here is what you expect to get from what the trailer shows you.At best 2012 is totally by the numbers and at worse absolutely ridiculous, cliché and even a bit insulting really.....",4,218,343,13 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Utter Crap.
","Oh man where to begin. How could they screw up a movie with a premise like this. I've not read any of the comics so don't know how faithful this movie is to the comics but I might seek them out since I like the idea behind the characters and the mythology itself....The acting and the dialogue was awful even with actors like Cage and Peter Fonda delivering them, and the set up was rushed, like most of the rest of the movie. The FX ranged from OK to GOOD with the first transformation scene of Blaze to Ghost Rider being pretty well done but every change from there on in is in cheap and nasty morphovision and the morphing motorcycle looked stupid even if the flaming bike itself looked cool. The bad guys were non-entities and although they were supposed to be really powerful etc they don't do anything threatening through most of the movie and Ghost Rider eventually offs them with ridiculous ease, even the main dude at the end.Honestly this movie has so many clichés you'll be bored less than half way in and after waiting about 30 minutes for Ghost Rider to appear you just want him to get off the screen straight away since apart from looking cool he comes across as a complete dork and his dialogue consists of really bad corny one liners. Every time he comes on screen you just hope to hell he doesn't say anything and when he does you'll be so embarrassed for the poor bloke...I guess Batman Begins and Superman Returns have spoilt us as far as comic book flicks being given the serious treatment go but even if those films weren't around then this movie would still be somewhat lacking..Lastly although I hesitate to say this there were a few scenes that reminded me of the name Uwe Boll, yes parts of it are that bad....After seeing the trailers (which wisely consisted of mostly FX shots)I really wanted to like this but those B*st*rds at Hollywood shafted us again....Go get the comics instead.....",3,3,7,19 March 2007
I Am Legend," Slow, Boring, with all new pointless ending! **MAJOR SPOILERS**
","Well, this is the third adaptation of Richard Mathesons novel and we are still left wanting something decent. The Omega Man though was a good movie (IMO) but it has dated a little and 'I AM LEGEND' was in need of a modern take on the story.Here we have Will Smith's Robert Neville, A military scientist who (it's alluded) had some role in a supposed cure for cancer that mutated into a virus that killed 90% of the planet and turned most of whoever was left into ravenous sub human creatures that skulk in the dark, feeding on the immune and being unable to expose themselves to the sun. Now this was the first mistake as far as I'm concerned. The infected in the novel (and the Omega Man) were still Human and had human intelligence. One of them was a friend of Nevilles who used to take great delight in taunting him nightly on his doorstep('Come out Neville, what's the point, you're the last' etc). There were still some human connections between the protagonist and the infected. Here the CGI creatures garner no sympathy whatsoever and there's barely any link between them and humanity at all.The flashbacks were totally unessecary although they did provide some contrast between the normal bustling streets, alive with human activity and the bleak empty post apocalyptic world Will Smith finds himself inhabiting. I found the film to be dull in a lot of places with very few scenes that contained any real meat or action and a lot of it especially early on was just tedious. The film just starts to heat up and then finishes which brings me on to my biggest problem with the movie. The ending.There's going to be some ****MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD so IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING STOP READING NOW****.In the novel the title 'I am Legend' had some meaning. I mean the whole story was about the last Human on Earth. When Neville dies at the end, normal humanity disappears into Legend. When I first picked up the book I thought the title would mean that the hero would be some a$$ kicking bad boy that would reclaim the earth in the name of humanity and actually found the ending quite powerful and sad.Now the movie here doesn't quite go to those lengths but it does have the 'Good guy sacfrifices himself for the good of humanity as he finds he isn't the last after all' bit which, in the face of the original ending just seemed contrived and cliché and quite honestly something the suits likely ordered tacked on.***SPOILERS END*** Now Will Smith actually does a pretty good turn as Neville seeing as he pretty much carries the entire movie, it's just a shame his material is bland and mostly really boring. Production values are also pretty good across the board with the bleak deserted streets of New York looking really eerie. The FX were also OK if misplaced in this movie...The director (Francis Lawrence) isn't to fault either as I felt he did a pretty good job and the bits I did find that held my attention were probably down to him. I also loved Constantine. The problem lies in the contrivances taken with a script that really wasn't very good to start with and should have had a couple more rewrites to really nail the substance of the tale being told.Shame. Maybe we'll get the version we should have gotten by now in about 20 years.",4,5,9,10 January 2008
The Illusionist," Not bad at all...
","I'd heard a lot of bad press regarding this movie, much of it I suspect due to the movie being released around the same time as the superior 'The Prestige'. While clearly there are similarities between the two movies, and some pretty striking ones at that, it's possible to take each of them on their own merits as I feel they are different enough that they don't really compete with each other.Both movies are essentially a love story at heart and both feature rival magicians (only touched on here as one of the characters happens to state that he's an amateur dabbler despite being a policeman)and some kind of twist at the end although to be honest with 'The Illusionist' you can see it coming a mile off. That doesn't stop you from enjoying what is, in a sense, a very entertaining movie despite some shoddy acting and lazy directing.I suspect much of the appeal and good things in this movie probably come from the novel it was based on and while there are a few scenes that do benefit from an understated sense of drama I think generally there were a lot of places where things could have been ramped up a bit. Particularly frustrating was how the death of a major character half way through was handled. Shockingly bad, no emotional context and off-screen to boot as well although to be fair there are some revelations at the end that do explain why things were handled this way although better directors could have done it more convincingly. The acting is pretty sub-par in quite a few areas too. Some actors actually look and sound like they could nod off mid sentence. Most of the acting it has to be said is pretty monotonous and bland despite the presence of solid actors like Norton and Sewell. The only real performance of note was from Paul Giamatti who turned in a solid effort as the police inspector trying to unravel the mystery. It's good to see him get some real screen time as he's becoming a great character actor and it's a joy watching him work(give this guy more gigs).Ultimately 'The Prestige' IS a much better movie, being handled more professionally all round, probably had a bigger budget too but despite it's shortcomings there's a lot to recommend in 'The Illusionist' and you could do a lot worse.",7,1,1,5 April 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Better than the first but still some flaws
","I was one of the minority that enjoyed the first FF movie albeit on a guilty level. I also agreed with the majority of criticism thrown at it but still found it relatively inoffensive despite all this. It had a level of hokeyness that sometime worked for it and sometimes against it. I'll admit also that some of the dialog was terrible (and it hasn't got much better here either)and some of the action just silly (that hasn't changed either although it is better in the second one). I thought it an OK setup for a franchise that entertained on a really base level.**MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD** Well I had really low expectations for this one since there were a lot of reviews panning it all over the place for various different reasons from crappy FX to deviation from source material. I actually found it to be really enjoyable and much better than the first one. There were still flaws, some pretty major but nothing that I really felt spoiled the film. The biggest bug bear is bound to be the representation of Galactus, basically he's just a big cloud although there are a few times where you can see a hint of the old comic book Galactus but they're like blink and you've missed them. They could have gotten away with having him more obviously in the centre of the cloud at the end and that would have satisfied most people. It made more sense to have Galactus in the form he is in here but I felt they could have alluded more to the old Galactus as well, you know, for fans, the people this movie is surely mostly aimed at if it wants to make any money.The other gripe people will have with this movie is the whole power swapping thing. Yes it's silly but it did make me laugh and would have worked if it hadn't been such a big deal at the end and they'd just left it as a silly gag that you could have forgotten about later.There's also continuity errors galore. We see countless shots of the Silver Surfer flying around knocking out power grids etc yet when he's being chased through the tunnel by the Torch the cars are all mysteriously working fine (unless I missed something). There's other things that anyone paying even a bit of attention will be able to point out, the biggest offender being **BIG SPOILER** when the Surfer seems to off Galactus so easily at the end after earlier saying that he had no choice but to be his herald as it meant his world was spared. Why didn't he just do what he did at the end of the movie? **END SPOILER**. I have a feeling that he is not so easily dealt with in the comic mythology and that the end of the movie was a contrivance bunged in there by the writers and film makers because they really didn't know what to do with the character. However it is left slightly ambiguous so you can kind of make up your own explanation. There is room for a bit of license on the part of the viewer.FX are generally pretty good across the board, they really nailed the look and character of the Silver Surfer although the lip sync on some of his CGI is a bit crummy. Jessica Alba still seems a bit miscast in her role but it's not too annoying. I think Gruffud fits the nerdy scientist role of Reed Richards pretty well. Chiklis as the Thing I've always thought was good casting although his acting as the Thing is better than his role in his human guise. Johnny Storm annoyed me a bit in the first movie, he was just a mouthy disrespectful punk that thought he knew it all. Here he's much the same although not quite as annoying and I really felt a smug satisfaction when he got lumbered with the Things powers.All the characters here have clearly had more time to get used to their powers with Alba being able to make other things invisible (was that in the comics?) and being able to explode people with internally generated forcefields (although we don't see that). Now onto Dr Doom. I'm not really sure why he was in the movie except as build up to the scene where **SPOILER** he get some of the Power Cosmic from the Surfers board. Just seems they needed another antagonist in there to fill a few minutes in an action scene. His character really doesn't develop at all and he still is nowhere near the Doom people will know from the comics.I also have to say that the film did an admirable (if not always successful) job at juggling all the characters here. We have four heroes and three villains and, with the exception of Doom, they feel they all fit well. Something I felt Spiderman 3 failed to achieve.In fact I felt I preferred this movie to Spiderman 3 which I just found tedious and crowded",8,2,5,28 June 2007
Transformers," Good but totally vacuous
","That about sums up Transformers. What you get here is about 45 mins of totally awesome giant-robot-mashing a$$ kickery interspersed with 95 minutes of Stupid. I don't know what I was expecting though I mean Transformers is for kids right? OK yeah it was but most of those kids that watched the show when it was in it's heyday have now grown up. Well Transformers hasn't although I don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing but it will possibly mean that people that remember the source material fondly will look at parts of this movie and think, man is this what passed for cool when I was a kid?It often feels like Michael Bay has blended two movies together here, you get the stock action movie, with tense war room situations, stereotypical characters, big explosions, cliché dialog etc. And then you get the actual bits with the Transformers in which, while epic in spectacle are clearly aimed at kids with dialog and exposition worse than the original series. Some of it will make you cringe it's so corny.The opening of the movie where one of the decepticons assaults an army base in the desert is really well done and when you see the first robot transformation your jaw will hit the floor. We're talking thousands of moving parts with panels twisting, hydraulics working, sections coming apart and coming together. The FX are freaking awesome. And thats what carries the movie and keeps you watching cos I'll tell you what, it ain't the story. There's isn't one. Thats right but what did you expect.Transformers the live action movie was always going to be as successful as the FX and the action and thats what we get here by the bucketload. You can see most of the budget up on the screen. There are a few nitpicky things that fans will probably complain about. Bumble Bee isn't a beetle car since the film makers couldn't get permission to use the car for the movie. Optimus Prime has no faceplate for most of the movie. I didn't think that one was too bad myself but I've heard fanboys really whine and complain about it.Shia Labeouf puts in the only decent performance of note throughout the whole movie which is the only reason to get behind his one dimensional character. I suppose John Tuturo is alright in his small role.When the robots aren't on screen doing their thing we're treated to derivative 'seen it all before' filler crap that aims for clichés and cheap gags to link the awesome bits together. None of them are really so lame as to spoil the movie but it's really totally by the numbers and surely the writers could have come up with something a bit better but they probably figured they could get away with it because with the subject matter they were onto a surefire license to print money.In the end it's a movie you'll see and most will probably really enjoy it for what it is. A shallow but epic action movie with giant robots galore breaking stuff, destroying buildings and looking really good while doing it. A popcorn movie. Thats about all you get and for a lot of people thats probably enough.Technology in movies now is getting to the point where epic spectacle and action is fast becoming the norm and if we don't get some story with our eye candy then things could be in danger of becoming very bland indeed.",8,1,3,6 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Playtimes over
","Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.Gone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little 'fun' in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.This (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.Harry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.She wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that 'stab you in the back' thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.It is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.The characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.Kreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.All in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.Now I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....",9,95,144,20 July 2007
Toy Story 2," Excellent.
","What a great film. This is one movie the whole family is garuanteed to enjoy. The animation and textures are absolutely superb, theres all the ingredients that made the first one such a hit, it's pace never lets up. My kids were totally engrossed all the way through and so was I. And there was also a totally breathtaking trailer for another CGI movie called Dinosaur at the start of it so all in all an afternoon well spent...",Null,0,1,25 February 2000
The Fountain," Mesmerising and Profound.
","I don't know how to describe this film really. You can tell within the first 10 minutes that this is going to be something different and indeed it is. This is not a movie for the 2-second-attention-span/Big dumb explosion brigade. It doesn't hold your hand with bland exposition and it doesn't give you all the pieces of the puzzle so you can neatly fit them altogether and go away with answers to all your questions.What it does give you though is a deep and thought provoking experience surrounding the issues of mortality and how we deal with it. There were a lot of things in this movie that I didn't really understand but it managed to touch me at a level I can't quite define. Like 2001:A Space Odyssey I think there were parts of this film that were deliberately left ambiguous in order to give the story some mystery and wonder.The cinematography was absolutely beautiful as well and I can't believe the movie was made for $35m dollars, it looks far more expensive.It has to be said that the acting across the board was exceptional too with Hugh Jackman being of particular note although I really can't take Ethan Suplee seriously in the kind of role he had after seeing him in My Name is Earl but thankfully his part isn't too distracting.I don't think Brad Pitt would have done half the job Hugh Jackman did in this movie. I heard he left because of creative differences and I can imagine Aronofsky saying 'Look Brad this is my movie, I'm gonna do it my way, if you don't like it then f**k off.' and Brad being the ego his is couldn't let someone else have control so left, the big wuss. Well our gain since I think 'The Fountain - The Brad Pitt cut' would have been crap quite frankly.",8,3,6,20 April 2007
The Green Mile," The best Stephen King adaptation ever...
","Whilst not a hardcore King fan I have read a few of his books and enjoyed them immensely and although not all of the movies and mini-series were that good, King's work on celluloid has provided some of the mediums finest moments (The Shining, The Stand, Misery and Christine to name but a few).Having never read The Green Mile I didn't know what to expect from this movie and I must admit that the premise sounded fascinating. The Green Mile is an exceptionally acted and scripted peice With Hanks and Duncan giving superb performances. The characters (as usual for King) are well realised and scenes are often touching and shocking alike.This is one of those films you wont forget in a hurry....",Null,0,0,18 August 2000
Godzilla," Boring and Frustrating
","I really wanted to like this after the travesty of the 1998 reboot and while Gareth Edwards' other flick Monsters was a good solid effort with good human drama this falls short on a number of levels the most unforgiving being that it's just plain boring. The reason for this I think is that besides the opening centered on Bryan Cranston's character and situation you really don't care about anyone else in this movie and it takes toooo long to kick off.Even Godzilla who shows up fully far too late in the game after a series of frustrating near and minor reveals (one of which literally has Edwards shut the door on what had built up to be the kicking off of the main event, teased with a split second of monster on monster action before shutting us out)just seems like a giant punchbag/wrecking ball for the other monsters and there just isn't enough of him or enough characterisation to make us give a sh*t. He turns up out of nowhere for no good reason and then just disappears like nothings happened at the end.In my opinion the painfully slow burn hurts this. I mean it's not like we don't know what Godzilla looks like from either the myriad other movies before it or even from the trailer for this one. Lets face it if you go to see a Godzilla movie you want lots of monsters a$$kicking each other to kingdom come and breaking sh*t all over (admittedly there IS plenty of destruction) you don't want to have to wait three quarters of the movie to see it. On the acting front after the strong drama at the beginning the young lead just can't compete with Cranston and you feel that black hole throughout the rest of the movie. You initially feel like you might actually be getting A list performances but that ends quickly and you're left with exposition and flunked by the book emotional beats.On the plus side Godzilla himself looks phenomenal and the FX are awesome as are the fight scenes but overall I think this movie is a disappointment.",5,5,11,16 May 2014
The Thin Red Line," Looooong and depressing....
","I missed this film at the cinema so snapped up the chance of renting it on video instead. I was expecting this to be along the same lines as Saving Private Ryan which was absolutely tremendous, however I was really dissapointed with this movie.While some of the characters where excellently realised and portrayed, esp. Elias Koteas, I found the film to be way too long with a lot of it being very boring. The middle section which had charlie squad pushing it's way up a hill in order to secure the top was the only part of the movie which really had any substance, or story for that matter. Most of the films narrative has it's various characters pondering the futility of war and life in general. A lot of this narrative is obscure and seems pointless but still wears the viewer down, like much of the rest of the movie. The pace is very slow too but it has to be said the most of the acting is very good indeed. Especially of note are Elias Koteas, Sean Penn and Nick Nolte. Ultimately this film is the movie equivelant of Pink Floyds 'The Final Cut'. Long, depressing, and once you experienced it you don't really want to hear/see it again.",Null,0,1,25 February 2000
Slumdog Millionaire," One hell of a roller-coaster ride and a great movie.
","This movie came right out of left field and, to be honest, surprised the hell out of me. Everyone was raving about it but it really didn't seem like my cup of tea so I gave it a miss at the movies. Round a mates one night he had a selection that he'd rented out and Slumdog Millionaire was one of them. 'That's meant to be quite good.' I said, so we went with that.....Visually, the movie at first glance seems to lack panache and polish but I think this might have been intentional as the gritty in your face style really conveys the feel of the slum lifestyle. The music as well is excellent and has a definite Indian flare to it even down to the bollywood ending. The acting is good across the board with the young kids in particular being standouts....The plot initially revolves around young Jamal, an Indian boy who is competing in 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'. The story jumps between his appearance on the show, his interrogation after the show by the police who are convinced he's cheating, and the flashbacks which are the stories of events throughout his life that he tells the police of how he knew the answers to the questions. In hindsight some of the reasons for his knowing the answers might seem a bit contrived or a bit of a leap but when you watch how it's all weaved into the story it unfolds beautifully and for the most part convincingly enough...To an ignorant westerner like me who knows nothing of life in any part of India, slum or otherwise, there was also a fascination in the 'slice of life' attitude of the flashback portions of the movie. Some of it is horrifying, like the whole child-beggar industry and how that all works and the general squalor of some of the disctricts. Some bit's are funny like working at a fast food shop where they fill plastic mineral water bottles from the tap then seal the lids on with glue, plus acting as a tour guide round the Taj Mahal making it up as they go along and then stealing peoples shoes. Not to mention a dive into a latrine then a manic run, covered in sh*t, to a fleeting visiting movie star to get their autograph. There are also heartwarming moments too and a satisfying ending.No matter what kind of movies you're into this one is well worth your time....",8,2,8,16 September 2009
Gladiator," Ridley Scott is back...!!!
","After a few sleeper hits and a few bombs (speaking from a box office point of view) Ridley Scott is well back on form with Gladiator. This is not, as some people might think, a no brain action flick. It actually has a story and the gladiator fights, which are superbly done by the way, don't play as big a part in the movie as you might think. All of Scotts visual flare is still very much apparant and adds some great atmosphere to the movie as do the CGI panoramas of the cities of Rome. The opening battle is breathtaking and actually shows what it's like in the roman trenches as it were, before a battle. Something you don't often see in a roman type movie. All the acting is brilliant especially Russel Crowe who deserves to go places and of course Oliver Reed and although he died during filming you really can't see the join were they filled in with computer graphics.The musical score is also excellent and very emotive. Running a 150 minutes this movie asks a lot of your time but you wont be dissapointed.",Null,0,0,13 May 2000
The Simpsons Movie," Good but nothing you haven't seen before
","It's been a long time coming but finally after 18 years of the Simpsons we get the long overdue movie. Is this a case of the horse having already bolted from the stable? Well, a little bit but to be fair after 18 years of material coming up with new stuff is going to be difficult and while the Simpsons movie does admirably to entertain for it's short running time it feels like little more than an extended episode with one or two bits of obviously superior animation.The plot is nothing more than what we'd expect from an episode of the show but being movie length means that Groening and co can stuff more than the usual amount of Simpsons tomfoolery into the bits between the plot. Just about every single regular character ever from the Simpsons mythos gets at least a cameo look in although shame on Groening and co for giving Mr Burns such a stupidly small part in the movie. There are a good few belly laughs throughout the movie including a few that take more than the usual 'Shown in TV land before the watershed' risks.It's unfortunate that after so many years of the Simpsons some of the gags are getting a bit predictable (not to mention recycled) but it's to the shows credit that even those bit's are still funny a lot of the time. I mean Homer's as much the clueless buffoon as he ever was which is always funny right. I was surprised that the movie didn't take more shots at pop culture but I guess thats a good way to date a movie quickly so maybe they deliberately chose not to go down that road.If I was rating this movie alongside the series I'd say it was at least as good as one of the better than average episodes but a long way off the really good ones......",6,1,5,27 July 2007
