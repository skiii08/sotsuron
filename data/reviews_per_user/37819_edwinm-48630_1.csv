Hereditary," Not what I was expecting!!!
","This movie wasn't scary like other movie like The Conjuring or Insidious. Like jumpscare movies, but this movie was so tense! When my friends and I went to see it, we were scared, disgusted, confused, and shocked. Definitely this is one my my most favorite movies!
