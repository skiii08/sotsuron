The Equalizer," Fun but indecisive and predictable
","This is clearly supposed to be a hard-edged realistic film, but it doesn't work without McCall being super-powered in some way. And OCD is not time dilation.I kept thinking of the tagline from the Taken movies: I have a very specific set of skills. If CIA agents were like this we wouldn't need the US Army.The plot is predictable.I thought McCall had a completely unexplained no-guns policy, despite the TV character's highly visible pistol, because he keeps ignoring guns in favor of cutting up his own hands, but at the end he shoots a whole bunch of people. And why do the bad guys fire silenced assault rifles without a target?",6,6,9,23 January 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Fascinating and perverse
","It was annoying to see a movie about GENUINE actors' emotions, problems, and mental states, but know it was all scripted and presumably made up.On the other hand, it was a tour de force to script and perform such a multi-layered piece. The actors are playing other actors, with (presumably) fake relationships and feelings for other actors (who they know in real life), in the middle of a play and 'real-life' drama. And their characters (such as 'Riggan Thompson') are playing other characters in a play, which intersects oddly with their 'real' (fake) characters' lives and problems. On top of all this, the main character appears to be losing touch with reality and hallucinating *part* of the time, so everything is suspect and we don't know if there's another magical realism level, but the ending implies there is some real magic.The title is funny -- Keaton was Batman, but never played either Birdman, but I'm sure DC Comics doesn't want questions about whether this is canon for their Batman character...I wish I knew whether any of the relationships they portray between characters are based on real life relationships between Keaton/Norton or other actors, or made up of whole cloth. Perhaps in 10-20 years IMDb will have good data and anecdotes on this.And I have to give Keaton credit for playing an over-the-hill actor who's losing it. Some points for bravery there.",7,0,6,22 February 2015
Lucy," Sadly incoherent
","Watchable because Johansson is charming and the production values are great, but it seemed like writer/director Besson took stupid pills to achieve the mood he wanted for this movie.Not only is the biology absurd, but the physics are ridiculous (this is part of the premise) and computers/communications simply don't work that way. At one point Lucy draws on the window of a car to use mental powers. WTF? Even the English is a bit off, making supposedly well-educated genius characters sound ignorant and confused.Lucy seems to have a plan for humanity, but she doesn't even bother calling off the cops before killing a bunch of them; yet she doesn't kill her helpless enemy, making trouble for herself and everybody else.I expect better from Besson.",3,3,8,19 March 2015
The Great Gatsby," Interesting but frustrating
","I haven't read Gatsby in years, but my reaction at the end felt familiar. Despite Nick's love, this isn't the tragedy of a man who is better than everyone, destroyed by a cruel and uncaring world. Gatsby sacrifices his life to protect his love. He accomplishes everything he wants, except her divorce and remarriage. Despite being a criminal and a fraud, Gatsby enjoys his affair, wealth, and fame. Unreasonable Gatsby does better with his (married) girlfriend than he has any right to expect. He dies successfully protecting Daisy, believing he won the game, once again thanks to good old Nick.It was very odd to hear such *modern* music by black musicians, alternating with Tom ranting about the necessity of keeping the 'inferior' black population suppressed in front of his small army of black servants. As a friend pointed out, there is a huge amount of great Jazz Age music that would have worked perfectly, so there was no need to bring us out of the period that way.The first third was all about huge dance numbers and set pieces, which was fun but felt a bit orthogonal to the plot. Clearly Baz is one of the many people more into ambiance than I...Before I even saw the movie I was wondering why Baz was effacing Fitzgerald as the creator of this story. At the end the story is credited to Nick and the credits talk about Baz, but there's nothing about Fitzgerald. Could the creator of such a huge and successful piece really be that insecure?",6,1,2,3 April 2015
