The Blair Witch Project," Want less sleep?.....
","Here's a summary of what happened. I saw The Blair Witch Project at a midnight showing. I walked out of the theatre with my friend Gio, who was chatting endlessly. I did not hear a word he said. Petrified, I got into my truck, started it up and drove. Gripping the steering wheel, I jerked my head at every litle sound, nearly driving us off the road twice. Now I sit here, terrified to close my eyes, knowing I will have to face the terrors that will emerge as I try to drift into a slumber. help me. I need someone to hold right now.",9,1,1,1 August 1999
