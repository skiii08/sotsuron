Black Swan," classy kind of stuff,with one unrepeatable Natalie...
","how enjoying watching Darren Aronofsky turning in one Hollywood puppet and how deep sorry feeling for him.for he has made one idol movie of mine Requirem for a Dream.and now he is Hollywood's bad ass surrender.but the movie is something totally dissimilar to its director.the story of one bloody rivalry and fancy girl dancing and drowning into fancy was performed so strong.i think it is one massive prosperity for lithe Natalie Portman which is my favorite Jew actress among of all and did deserved to gain the award of Academy. she is strongly the cold and connived ballet dancer with one trained body and all the contradicted feelings and she is one wild blitz of acting while she dances or cries or making love!now the movie flows with ballet subject on studying the dark half of human race and what is barely heavy for ruining ones soul,in which leads on very horrendous consequences.i believe that the part is fa cable but in a very emergency term.and Nina has paid the unbearable price of being perfect.her Life...Mila Kunis is one extraordinary bomb of energy which is hidden behind the glowing Natalie that has impressed the whole crew with subcutaneous performance of her.the rest are admirable too.Vincent Cassel,Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder in her middle aging years are mediocre in compare of Natalie and Mila.But Aronofsky ...",10,1,2,12 March 2011
Changeling," F**k you and the horse you rode in on
","A picture from Eastwood starring Angelina Jolie , my first thoughts of this kind of movie was a totally crap idea. but hey,this one is great. i must have admit,i didn't really think of such a excellent movie like this.and some sort of saying,i am wondered. story lines good and whole audience are memorizing this movie.for being at the 20 & 30 decades,Eastwood does a good job and the art direction shows it clearly. But for being a classic , it is far more behind such thing . way to go to reach the mountain top of classics . the idea of exchanging the identity of children and a single mothers's seeking for her lost boy,is performed well. but you know what?,i don't really like Angie's hairstyle & performance . seems little fake for me when she shows her wrath to wrong kid . it's like she's Lara Croft . but the woman does the role better than her previous roles and hell let's say,she has good improvement on her acting career after she is working with high working directors .she is really good.she plays a single mother who has been deceived after his lost son is found and a mistaken idea story is behind all . and she resists to believe that his son is returned by the police.this whole looks like a frame and Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie)is going to prove that.even though she is accused for being a psycho and is sent to a mental hospital.But she still have hopes to find her son. she has help to gain the aim and thats Rev. Gustav Briegleb(John Malkovich)...Angelina struggles damn hard and she is doing a hard job after fake pictures like Beowulf & A Mighty Heart. and she gains better conclusion of being an actress.hope her way is found soon or before retirement.her husky voices annoys me while yelling.but i just bare it for she is doing a good performance.i think she should give up smoking for it is bad for her children and my ear. great movie . 8 from 10.",8,3,5,18 February 2009
I'm Not There," Very Ambitious, Though Complicated , Like A Rolling Stone...
","Many aspect of Bob Dylan's life is been described here . you can call this picture a vast documentary . like its a general statement of one very well known character as your own thoughts . hiring 6 actors to play a role as difficult as Bob Dylan makes a director stronger in his directing career . and Todd Haynes struggles to gain the matter . do you think that he has done it ? i think so . as rebel was Dylan , as hieratic and realistic was Dylan , as phenomenon he was , makes it a hard job to make his life biography picture . because so many similar movies are for the characters who don't live no more . like Linda Mccarty , John Lenon , Emile Zola and so many others . But Dylan is alive and this picture can be judged very different . history of country music is clearly declares the deep impact of Dylan on it . his lyrics and maverick music with rebellious performance is the evidence itself . the movie shows many stages of Dylan's life with 6 actors Like :Cate Blanchett , Late Heath Ledger , Richard Gere , Christian Bale , Ben Whishaw , and the one who plays Dylan at its exact role is Cate Blanchett . which gives the strongest performance by an ( Actress/Actor ) by the passing decade . i do wonder of how the academy of Oscar refused to give the award of supporting role to her . though she didn't play a female role , but she thrills you with her Dylan style ever . Cate now days shows her late entrance of Hollywood reasonable . as she gained spectacular roles like Queen Elizabeth I , portraying of Katharine Hepburn not likely as she was but great and as Dylan . i admire her hardworking path of acting . Todd Haynes does a Lybrinth style of job , goes in the dangerous way of portrating Bob Dylan . though not very realistic , but qualified . art direction of reviewing the 60s concerts and changing colors are good . the movie is exactly like a rolling stone , you as a viewer will be little confused .8 from 10 . how does it feel?to be on your own , to be without home?like a complete unknown ?

","its not just a citron drop for relish your afternoon tea,it's 100% of frenzy for a hysteresis loop which is forsaken.for me Tarantino was an Ex Phenomenon that happened to run out since Jackie Brown(1997),and those raging series of movies known as Kill Bill's were an absurd joke that are deleted from my Movie Hitory for over than 6 years,but this Nazi killing spectacle is what i was waiting from him for a decade. i can't thrum this arrogation that i am not fond the movie,but to note some of the trifles,it's a bit foolish storyline and the story is been misled and hell with that Christoph Waltz is what is worth-ed.Christoph Waltz as Landa is an Eminences and short timer state changing Nazi officer that wot hrs amongst all stars like Brad Pitt,Diane Kruger,Eli Roth the Jew Bear Donny Donowitz and specially Tarantino himself.the pure love of Tarantino to cinema is puring from backstage to scenes themselves,Samuel L.Jackson as narrator explains of how flammable 8 mm negatives are and i am enjoying, it seems Tarantino stated that this is cinema's revenge against the Nazies,but it's a Jew's vengeance against the years of his absence and to be over-rated...",8,0,4,21 April 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Summer Blockbusters my ass...
","jeez i tolerated Salt,Knight and Day or that bad ass movie A-Team but an action type has many sides to be focused on.first of all it is based on a distinguished high rated video game in which i have played in in PS2 and X-Box both,and made me some sort of twofold feeling of weird contradiction,movies like this one are a pain in the ass.they,re no such Hurt Locker type nor Avatar,to cut a long story short,they paint the town red for a while and after that they would sent in your deep down archives for the birds somehow.and the aforesaid refuse is no exception at all.even at the very video game,the milieu was no similar to Persia,the punk prince seems like those hippies of 60s with his unclean hair style and parody is all set.camels rushing the stage with Arabs dressed as Persian with Hassansin suck in all the wasteland.and in the end Gemma Arterton as insipid English bewildered de luxe Tamina is rolling around.i do have a pity for academy nominee Jake Gyllenhaal,i saw him in Brothers,that gay movie and lots of other films and Zodiac too,here in between the nausea he seems a little lost and wasted.other do deserve Razzie for sure.and What does Hollywood know about Persian fables?zip is the answer. and any time they wanna make profit out of it its wheel and deal.the whole ball of wax is freaky and numb despite luxurious mien.that might ring a bell in the deaf ears of Disney money digging principals...",4,6,12,30 August 2010
The Doors," Wlid Child...
","I do have to admit that i kinda like this movie,not by the reputation of doors,not because they were a deep impact rock'n'roll band,but it was because Val Kilmer's performance as Jim was best,sort of thrilling and very talented performance,the concerts are remade very well,specially those very Jim's moves,he was most rebellious,most refreshing,modernest and greatest artists ever...but with the movie i can say they have tried their best,Oliver Stones's direction is not as good as Platoon ,Born on the Forth of July ,or J.F.K,but it is really good.i have my own idea about it but Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison is Jim himself.the movie is the story of early days of Jim's life with an accident on the road that impacted whole his life an further,his days on the beach and his companion with Pamela Courson(Meg Ryan)his lifetime companion,the Doors Band and their special kind of music ,with breaking all the borders,and Jim's against the law behaviors ,his travel to Paris and his death . the performances are so so ones.but one among all will shine and thats Val Kilmer's.he did Jim's all behaviors and habits .besides his voice.he is the new Jim Morrison. others are sort of usual.like Meg Ryan playing Pamela is just something very usual.i wonder if Pamela herself has been like this.but seriously to be a companion for their short lives with Jim's manners must be the hardest.the movie shows his glorious moments and mad moments.when he terminated himself in the age 27.and also did Pamela at the same age. the movie shows of how Jim was The WILDCHILD of 60s.good movie.over",8,1,2,23 February 2008
Shutter Island," your times are up
","Ain't that about a goof?now some might jump into the express and say i'm wrong but i don't give a horse's sh*t about it and i say whats going on in this little piece of crap.this book adaptation is a pain for most of the movies i,ve ever seen in adaptation category,needless to say Revelutionary road or The reader or ... and this one is not much far . well i am not divergent from proper critics and what people like,but to endure something which is mistakingly in common is not my credence,and about my pure love CINEMA it is drastic and harsh.Martin Scorsese for me is a living myth and the director of some of my favorite ever after movies of all time,well after the times of The Aviator and The Departed ,it boomed in my mind that his times of glory is about to an end pathetically,but with this one i am sure of Shutter Island is the dead end of Scorsese in all time.i don't want to say that DiCaprio is not a man of knack,but he has only one,to be frantic and an assho#e in his specialty,he has long way to go yet to receive an actor's figure.others are for sh*t now and the frivolous Michelle Williams,Mark Ruffalo,Emily Mortimer,Patricia Clarkson ... are to fulfill the scenes of this sham.no matter how powerful and effective once Scorsese once was,he has lapsed and he is over.you see the buzz happened for me after watching this,i took out Raging Bull and watched it,and i saw the end of one history maker and influencing director and i regret for that...",3,4,9,23 April 2010
The Last Legion," An Average Film
","So many films are made like this,i wonder why they make movies like this one at all. Action scenes are average type,the storyline does not worth ;ooking & its all been told before.i don't really need to say that the storyline should be told.it is about war in roman world & its umpire. Colin Firth,Ben Kingsley,Aishwarya Rai & so many others are giving very average performances. i am wondering of what the producer is waiting to gain by making such a movie. war films and its subject is been made a lot for film industry.at least they had something to absorb you.but this one is not very attractive. whole the film goes on like a routine part of your life.Colin Firth is a high qualified actor,but he gives a sort of week performance,academy award winner Ben Kingsley is a no use actor here despite his capabilities.Aishwarya Rai has not an important role and her dialogs are not more than 2-3 lines.

Revolutionary Road," Our dreams may come true?maybe not in this life...
","1950s and a class of life combined in routine way and regrets of a young lucky couple,main idea seems not bad, though you know , i feel a lot that the main performance of this book is good for theater.not just because of a little unreality of environment in the movie,but because the chemistry of the couple gets more hot and deep while their problems appear. they don't think that they deserve such a normal and empty life,even with two kids and a house big enough for the family in Revolutionary Road.American dreamz(s) are in vain. being in their place gives me a doubt of paranoid.promoting a normal life in ones own situation or praising dreams by joining Paris because everything seems something else in there. i believe for a lot of couples in real life,not certainly in 50s,but right now this problem is shining.man of family feels that wife and kids is not what he is after in his dreams.doing ordinary job does not satisfy him and wife is not happy for being mama for kids and housewife everyday.even after testing other thing and failing all over again... maybe couples like Frank Wheeler and April Wheeler should accept life and married life is just that.you don't fly to the moon or climb mount Everest with married life.but for these two people their last hope is to immigrate to Paris and when Frank is offered for promotion and April is pregnant for third time,their dream is about to terminate and their life is about to end...Sam Mendes is sort of Douglas Sirk director of our age with Amercan Buieaty and Revolutionary Road.a little absence of real feeling and unreal scenes are among this picture and Kate Winslet,my god she has the Right to win Golden Globe award for this movie,for being a smoking upset mama which she is not in love with his husband anymore but she is the mother of his 2 children.Kate is an actress at last,not that nude b**ch in Holly Smoke,Jude or Little Children.Leonardo DiCaprio is well as Frank.a regular man who is thirsty of promotion and wants his life as dreamy as it gets.sleeps with another woman but like his wife to keep their third kid.he is a man of life and man of his own together.this movie shouts this sentence:American Drwams Riuned forever...",8,0,0,20 August 2009

Kick-Ass," Tickling Ass of yours in one moment of neglecting

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Salvation of a young old man
","David Fincher is well known for his Thrilling pictures like Seven or The Game (Alien 3 is not counted) and others but i feel that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is something different. some story of reverse growing up and the problems based on it.I by myself did'nt expect this movie . this year's Academy Awars Nominated pictures are rarely good . as i understood the subject,every year the choice of Academy is based on movies which have been shown in December. because of that movies like this and The Reader ,Frost/Nixon ,Milk and Slumdog Millionaire are chosen.i declare that the absence of Revelutionary Road is deeply felt.but somehow this year's movies are perfect.Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt)'s life starts with a disaster.when he Born's his face and body condition declares the strange condition . he looks like a 90 years old man.he is thrown out of his house by his father Thomas Button(Jason Flemyng) after his mother passed away.and he is raised with old people with a kind black woman Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who Benjamin considers her as his mama . later he visits a young girl Daisy and he kind of like her.as time going by,Benjamin grows younger and he leaves the house . he goes to sea and he works on a boat . Daisy(Cate Blanchett) is now a well qualified Dancer and she comes back to visit Benjamin.and they fall in love with each other ,but the problems and troubles are on the way...hack of a storyline.this movie is going on reverse way itself.and i am sure that there are people in world that have the same condition of Benjamin.some of us really grow younger than do it on its proper way.the movie really attracted me.this tragedy of growing young and its weird kind of life .as Benjamin declares the actual consequences of such lifetime.and for that this is a great movie . but rarely deserves the award for best picture of the year.Brad Pitt performs some of the Best Performancrs in his acting career.i do admire the couple of Brad/Angie for their this years pro choices of roles and it fitting for them .Pitt's Benjamin Button is one of the best roles he has ever performed . his way of talking and behaving plus the growing young shows that the man is proved for being a decent actor. Cate Blanchett is as good as always.but in this movie her performing is under the influence of Pitt's strong acting.Cate is good.and for the record Taraji P. Henson is thrilling.as Queenie she gives a great job and shows a heartbreaking performance.after all i did'nt expexct a good movie from David Fincher.starting your way of directing with Alien3(1992) may give a hard backbone fall to any director.but Fincher separate the path by making Seven(1995),Fight Club(1999) and this picture from rotten directors and shows a outstanding kind of job.great movie. 9 from 10 ...",9,2,5,19 February 2009

Action parts are the only worthy parts,Thriller is basically something that thrills you,but it didn't even shake me for one second.What to say about performances? A)Brad Pitt as cool Johnny is bulls**t.he is not able to transfer the chemistry of their relationship.unable to show himself the cool killer.B)Angelina Jolie is what she always is.Sexy,aberrantly heroine,live sex symbol though dangerous.enjoyable?thrilling?astonishing?to be honest Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.whats happened to the director of((The Bourne Identity)),this is a really backward move for a talented director like him.summery:Wooooo,How Rubbish!!!!!!",6,1,2,26 February 2007

Stoyline:after making worthless pictures like:((bringing out the dead,aviator,gangs of New York )),Martin Scorsese return's to gangs all over again.as good as it gets,story of Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon),A Student of police academy Who's being the top est,chosen as on of the special operation officer,despite his other classmate Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio)which didn't become a top cop and now his going to be in a very sensitive position,because he's about to enter in Frank Costello's(Jack Nicholson)gang organization as a cop.despite that department doesn't know that Colin is Frank's inside man in the force.Oliver Queenan(Martin Sheen)is the head chief of force & whit his right hand assistant,Dignam(Mark Wahlberg),trying to catch Costello's gang organization but before the sent billy in the stage they did'nt have the clear evidence.among all there's the sweet Madolyn(Vera Farmiga)that falls in love with Colin.But as a doctor once she faces Billy as her patient and after a weird fight they get familiar with each other & fall in love.though it's hard for her to chose between the honest man tricky one.billy's stock in a lot of problems.he should pass frank's ARE YOU STILL A COP test,facing Mr. French(Ray Winstone) who's Frank's trusted tough guy.will billy succeed in his job?Superb performances by whole cast,great direction by Scorsese in every sequence,great screenplay by William Monahan,& great original music by Howard Shore which has done a good job in Lord of the Ring series before.Leonardo DiCaprio proves that he's not the heart burner doll face punk again.he is coming to show his act ability as a man in 10000 problems.he is in his most powerful acting time now & by today after i saw blood diamond,i should confess i am starting to hope for Leonardo.he can do many roles better and greater than he did during 90s.the stunning Jack Nicholson is all over back again.he acts as powerful,scary,funny Frank Costello.after performing in several comedies like Anger Management & Something's Gotta Give,Jacky's back in a right role of head mafia man,who treated Colin as an inside man in police fore department in Boston city.and he uses his cooperating in order to his own benefit.although he's around 70,he is still dating girls and enjoys the gang life of his own,i think Nicholson's role deserved an Oscar nomination,but they didn't give any.Matt Damon shoe brilliant performance as well.as tricky Collin who shows his real face at the end &has an un real affair with Madolyn.he is the best after his role in famous film(Good Will Haunting).Martin Scorsese is directing Departed after making historical dramas like:Aviator,Gangs of New-York&... thats the genre he's the master of it.considering Casino,Goodfellas,Taxi Driver & Cape Fear,Dparted is on his master full pictures that contains bib names all in Scorsese's validity:Jack Nicholson,Leonardo DiCaprio,Matt Damon,Martin Sheen,Mark Wahlberg,Alec Baldwin &... i personally think that after making of The Depatred,Scorsese should win the Oscar for best directing.after 7 times of nomination.this is a work of art,isn't it? then i suppose that Mark Wahlberg is truly great actor.he is one of the best actors in present Hollywood.he acts as Dignam in a very superb way.talking in speedy way,mostly insults,and the best dialogs of the films is for him.great picture,9 out of 10.",6,1,2,24 February 2007
The Holiday," A Good Entertainer.
","Not a perfect story,that goes on like an Christmas gift,its interesting to wait & see what's inside?even though it is not brilliant. 2 people that live in separate worlds are exchanging their places.due to they have uncomfortable jobs & houses.they find each other in Internet,and they try to live in a different world.Iris(Kate Winslet)trips to America & falls in love with Jack Black in his Romantic role. Amanda(Cameron Diaz) gets to rainy england and settles down on Irises place and falls for his brother(Graham) who is a single father.i swear that this is what i found out of movie,it cant be summarize easily.but the problem of this film is the story doesn't attract you. the simple story is a lot complicated.performances are not very good .Kate Winslet is not good.she plays as Iris not skillfully.Cameron Diaz is sort of better.she plays in comic role better than all.though Jack Black is qualified comedian he does not a good perform.Jude Law is as good as always. really good & entertaining film & good direction by Nancy Meyers. sweet moments are made fare well.but it cant be as good as Something's Gotta Give & What Women Want,but it is a good entertainer at all.",6,2,4,2 March 2007
The Reader," Screwheads:Jew history + Kate Winslet f**ked by a boy + some good scenes = The Reader(2008)
","Don't argue with me cause i don't like it.unnecessary movie and last effort of Polack and Mingella is such a average movie.comes in terms of sentimentally style and ends with Jewish conclusion. i mean gush ,have'nt you heard this story before? of you're not,.reading a story that tells the Jew history and a woman screwing by a 15 years old boy in post-war Germany,good idea for a movie.but Kate Winslet is so much better in second half.trail accuses Hanna because she kept people in church while burning,but she says she is just responsible and she had no choice,i mean such crap reasoning comes to make the main tragedy in the movie.and after burning them she is hired by government to inform the tickets in a bus,accidentally hit by Young Michael and make him read and make love for her just cause she cant read.and effect Michael,s life forever after a summer of making love.focus the idea.such an interruption goes in on it.does that break heart of anyone but perverts or Jews?without a doubt year 2008 was the crap year of film-making.that is for nominated movies for academy awards.best of all is Curios Case of Benjamin Button and worst is Slumgog movie.Reader is average.goes between good and bad.and has ambition to show a history of violence that went to Jews 63 years ago.now they have the power of Hollywood to show it to the world 100 times stronger and more beautiful with pictures like Reader.to show Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes in first roles and Stephen Daldry to direct it.after nominating Kate for 6 times before for darn middle movies like Iris,Little Children,Quills and... they have found the hole.What was wrong with Revolutionary Road?oh i found out ,it did not talk about Jews.and no sex scenes either.let me give you summery of The Reader: Jew history + Kate Winslet f**ked by a boy + some good scenes = The Reader(2008)",4,0,3,24 April 2010
Inception," Your mind is a scene of agitation...
","the year 2010 was really pissing me off with a whole bunch of scum movies that were supposed to be memorials but were for the birds for god sakes.now after 9 months of expect ion,finally i got the summer blockbuster phenomenon really late at November which is my bad for i did not get its DVD nor Blu-Ray for specific.now i should say that when you have such peerless idea for a movie,the right stuff are to be gathered and the raw material are to be shaped.in this case for Inception,90% is totally done in sublime.but the distress of subject is really harsh and hard to be performed.i do not intended to spoil it anyway but when making success out of some Batman movie,you cant drop your feet and preserve yourself from dictate your idealism onto one construction which is highly supplied and plentifully a multi million budget expected movie.Christopher Nolan must've considered himself as an exotic and gifted director in which he is for sure.but he must which his steps of slippery either.the movie really turned me on about him.he is inside of dreams of his hand made characters.he must not lose himself in complicated ideas at the times of prosperity for the times they are a changing.but over head of all the issues,the movie is a wreck outstanding jar of ones sick nigh mares.and i see lots of progress in most of the cast and the watching is highly recommended.i feel that aside of high budget state,the thoughts of writer/director is some sorts of performed and the rate of prodigality is high at the same time.the circle of cast is been influenced by Nolan's rigor but the resistance of some is so very apparent.Ellen Page is some lousy kid wiggling like horsefly in everywhere.Marion Cotillard was some moaning sloth with least avail point in my view.it is so bad for her after winning an Oscar that French doll,Leonardo DiCaprio is pushing hard now in which is respectable,but all the same moves are to be occurred more or less.well done about him but he has ro struggle harder to be something considerable.Ken Watanabe is OK and the rest i don't give a crap about.the movie shows of Nolan's maturity after 12 years of career.but,he must watch his steps from now on,chances like Inception are really few in counting.you use it or loose it and Nolan has...",10,0,4,15 November 2010
La Vie En Rose," indeed je ne regrette rien
","How words can declare the magnificent Edith Piaf ? How picture can review her indeed extraordinary life ? a lot of such Hows are answered here in this movie . Marion Cotillard and her natural staring , shining , outstanding , Thrilling ( No more words needed ... ) performance worths watching 100 times . of how she is accurate of picturing Edith Piaf's extraordinary life . of how she does a great job of portraying Piaf at this high range of art . there are a lot of examples for such a roles in which are unsuccessful . like Sienna Miller's performance as Edie Sedgwick in Factory Girl ( 2006 ) . though not bad , but it ain't very special . to understand the subject you should watch it . anyway Marion gives a performance of lifetime . a performance that everyone will save it into their memories . from the start to end of the movie , you can feel Marion staring all over . storyline is about How Piaf( Marion Cotillard ) was hurt ed when she was a child . of how she was raised after her drunk mother left her and her hard condition with his father in circus . and how she was singing in the streets with her friend Mômone ( Sylvie Testud ) to gain the money and have more drinks . the times that she was discovered in cabarets by the owner Louis Leplée ( Gérard Depardieu ) and this is her direction to the stage . and how she fell in love with Marcel Cerdan ( Jean-Pierre Martins ) , a married boxer and by the times of Marcel,s plane crash , she leads to alchol and her incoming death at the age of 48 . the film is assembled well . and the cast are really good . although i know a few of them by reputation . only Gérard Depardieu and Marion herself because of her performance in A Good Year ( 2006 ) . but this role is so much deferent than her role in A Good Year . this is a performance of her career . Olivier Dahan is a very talented director . with this movie , he proves that he can have big progresses in the future . next to all the entertaining summer movies , this is a pearl in the shell . and it could be bad if Marion did not take part . it is like how do you assume Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) without Elizabeth Taylor ? no way fellas . it is that makes one performance shining above the cinema history . indeed it is no regrets for Piaf . her magic voice dancing all over the movie . it gives a sense like Fly high above the clouds . indeed je ne regrette rien ...",9,1,2,9 June 2008
300," Who did Erase This Comment? So I Repeat...
","What should a wise man conclude?that this picture is based of true history?or it's just for entertainment? amuse the audience is to show a strong history root nation wild?is to make a powerful civilization barbarians?to make them upset by making such a dark picture movie or film or what? goddamn time it is,believe me if it's worth watching only one time,it's because reviews i have heard from people. Hollywood is called the organization of free thoughts,free believes. i suppose Hollywood is NO free zone of film making,since they make stupid brainless films like Borat,300,Not Without My Daughter &... what do you expect me to write about this movie?huh?do want me to say this whole insulation to my ancestors,my culture,my history is masterpiece?do you want me to be happy of this? History will judge that who was the barbarian,i don't understand what is Hollywood's damn problem? First of all The Persian's king Korosh has submitted the first law of humankind ever in our own country soul.we have made such a magnificent civilization that its effects still trembles the humankind. so 300 Spartans conquer the whole troops of the empire?with the Persian army that are Monsters?with a king who is 3 meters long & nearly homosexual? Zack Snyder showed a light path of direction by making a decent remake like Dawn of the Dead,now he moves his path straight to hell,making fakes for order,show himself a play card in the hands of fools. Frank Miller is certainly a godless freak that showed his beliefs in Sin City & this crab 300. You call this Art?therefore Maylin Manson is the greatest artist of the present century!!!!!!!! You call this movie?so Beerfest is the best movie of the whole years. Over.",1,5,9,9 June 2008
The Hangover Part III," when do you decide to cut the Sh#t off?
","Oh lord , i'm back with IMDb , probably 3 years after my last review and i'm proud of it , although during the years passed by , the best movie i saw was mmmmmmmmmm i didn't see any good movie during 3 years but if u ask of what annoyed me more than everything , it was the sequels now after i first saw the first part of The Hangover , it was truly one splendid and made my dizzy and hazy for a while , but if u put away the box office prospect for a while , i've seen the idea before in some The Simpsons series ... but that second part of the Hangover franchise was totally piece of sh@t movie and intolerable . i think for digging the box office , they had to putt all idiocy from U.S.A to Thailand to beg it funnier and funnier ...the third part is a little better , but its digging the corpse from rotten grave , the story must contain an end , not just drooling till the movie starts to ending parts . don,t you have newer ideas ? i think that from now on , if they try to make more sequels , something worse than the Saw franchise will take place to the series . there is nothing admirable about the third part , the crew are all gaudy and the director repeats all elements of last movies in one compiled situation . and that's all i can say about the movie , its better for them to produce new ideas to make a movie , not just make one annoying riot and make the audience do a giggle after living the theater and one last comment i got is , the series must stop in this moment or else there would be no more concession to make it for more 10 parts and sh#t ...",3,2,5,2 November 2013
Up in the Air," The detriment of dismissal is never considered before...
","Jason Reitman is a gifted and acclaimed director as if i can foretell that he has raised from Thank You for Smoking(2005) to such factual and heart-breaking movie.] being the agent of expelling/ejection is some coarse sentence which in my country is unknown but in States must've been very rough.Ryan is a man to expel people and give them fake vows in return of their basically fragile situation.offering them some rest times just because the boss did not have guts to tell them so.now Ryan belongs to nowhere based on traveling permanently city to city,now he might be at Utah and Chicago Angy Jersey or L.A or Nashville or Detroit which sucks the third base of one's actuated position.Anna Kendrick as recruit must be the danger of Ryan's current vocational situation but despite that she is the Human factor.she is the raw student of life which is emotionally and professionally deficient for job of expelling.but she believes in courtesy and life terms which for Ryan is basically null.Vera Farmiga as femme fetal is not that much of attention absorber that for me was no big deal.for more record,the whole movie is no big deal,but it has a notice of Farley human life terms to imply the one day everything ends sentence.it did not turn me off at Ryan's lonely occasion at the end but generally i wish i were him.when he was cheering Jim for marrying his chap sister,i scened it was George Clooney himself to express the words as he is closely lived like Ryan.although he does not seem insatiated as being a 50 years old cadet ever ,but it was the first time i figured out Clooney is living his role once in a while.in the beginning of the movie people who were really fired,were talking about their constant feeling of a jobless person or how to face it and same happened in the end credits.the emotional charges of being expelled was never considered before.some could kill themselves nor show their anger in one very weird way.some might got the ax several times,and still feel same thing,it really ate me to see their interrupted faces.i put my own butt in their place and ...George Clooney is good,also Anna Kendrick,Jason Bateman,Vera Farmiga,Sam Elliott as the pilot,very modest movie it is.now Reitman must watch his way not to become like his father nor a lot talents which were spoiled like him.excellent movie.way better than Juno and really had diservingness to be awarded but like always was irrated and denied.great movie,well done.",9,0,2,15 June 2010
