Lucky Number Slevin," Cross between Memento and True Romance
","I went to catch this movie this weekend, and was a little apprehensive given the generally poor reviews and box office. I just don't understand why this is, because this was about the most interesting movie I've seen in a long time. I think this had one of the most interesting plots I've seen come out of Hollywood in quite a while. It had all of the light-hearted murder and mayhem that Terantino included in True Romance, as well as the superb use of time displacement that Jonathan Nolan exhibited in Memento. The acting here was solid (no awards, but I never felt it was lacking). The pace and directing were both outstanding. All in all, well worth the $8.50 and 2-hour investment!",8,0,6,24 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Awful on so many levels
","This was just terrible. Let me list the levels on which this has to be the worst movie since Gigli.1) Length - well over 45 minutes too long. My a$$ was still in pain the next morning. 2) Humor - there was none of it 3) Love interest - absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters 4) Continuity - how did the whole cannibal scene come to be? How did the two fools, on their own, drag the ship back into the water? For that matter, how did a ship like that come to be fully out of the water with no damage in the first place? (It must draft at least 12 feet - there was no way the tides on that beach rise and fall over 12 feet.) 5) Ending - two and a half hours, with no ending - not even a partial ending. It simply stopped running. What a waste. It may have even been worse than Gigli.",1,11,19,25 July 2006
No Country for Old Men," Utterly Disappointing!
","This movie was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen.I fully expected an outstanding story given the reviews, both from critics and from viewers. And, up until the final reel I was not let down. Then we get to the final reel...The protagonist is killed off screen - did the woman in the pool set him up? And was that her floating in the pool? Did his wife get off with her life? We never heard a gun shot, nor would we expect to I suppose, with the silencer - but we just don't know. The equivalent of Frances McDormand's character from Fargo (Tommy Lee Jones' character here) just quits at the end with some lame conversation concerning a dream he had. And the killer is hit by a car in some contrived deus ex machina, but still manages to walk away, albeit with wounds that are a bit more tricky to self-treat than shotgun pellets in the backside. Whatever happened to the Mexicans? Was the money in the vent at the end? Was that how the killer eluded Tommy Lee Jones? And did the killer end up delivering the money to the gas station owner (the one who correctly called 'Heads' in the first reel)? All these questions, and no explanation. I'm sure someone will say that this is a sign of a good movie with artistic twists. But to them I say, this is too much! Even Short Cuts had an overall sense of conclusion, even if no single story line really ended. There's just too many unanswered questions and too many loose ends to have ended the way the Coen brothers wrote this! Again, I expected much, and got much for about 90% of the movie. However, the ending was so bad that I went home severely, ultimately, terribly, disappointed.",4,24,41,26 November 2007
