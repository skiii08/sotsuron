The Blair Witch Project," Scariest (and possibly best) horror movie of all time...
","I got to see a showing of 'The Blair Witch Project' on opening night at 11:05 P.M.  By the time I was on my way home, I had to call my parents in order to tell them to turn all of the lights in the house on.  I also made sure that I didn't have to go anywhere near the basement... 'The Blair Witch Project' is the scariest movie of all time, period. Although I may not be as learned as others on the subject, I don't give a damn.  BWP does not frighten you with images of a witch, or her gory kills. Instead, it plants traces of unknown horrors in to the viewers sub-conscious.  That, in my opinion, is far worse than visual horror.  The actors did an amazing job of portraying terrified people reaching their wits end.  My heart pounded just as fast Heather Donahue's; I guarantee.  The leads' acting ability surprised the hell out of me.  At no moment did I remember that BWP was fiction.  The actors (and directors!) do that good a job.  Do yourself a favor: See 'The Blair Witch Project.'  Oh, and if you've got a special person in your life, bring 'em along.  You might need 'em...",10,1,2,16 July 1999
