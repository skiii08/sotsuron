The New World," Beautifully boring
","The image is astounding, the audience suddenly feels like discovering Virginia in the 17th century, or feels like what it has been for Pocahontas to see London. So that is great, and if I had to judge only the atmosphere and the cinematography, I would give the movie a 10/10. But a movie is also a story. Here, the story is a true story (I don't know - and don't care - how much it is accurate to the original story), and the script tells it to us in a quite 'arty' way : while being told about the fort's discipline, John Smith thinks about Pocahontas (so we here about the fort and watch the girl running in the bushes). Lots of 'off voice', with a quite tired tone, it is poetic, poetic and boring like hell. I had to end watching the DVD using the fast-forward button : I couldn't stand any more. Thus, I learned a lot, I mean that for the first time, what I watched seemed really true to me, not like if a time machine sended a camcorder back in 1600 but even better : it stills is cinema, with a beautiful image I told that already.",6,0,4,25 May 2007
Moulin Rouge!," I'm not sure
","What to think of it ? Moulin Rouge mixes times and cultures with no respect of anything, and it's fun. Seeing the mythic Zidler, Moulin Rouge's owner, singing Madonna's 'like a virgin' song to fool a jealous duke, yes, it's fun. Some visual effects are brilliant, really, and Kylie Minogue, in her twenty seconds cameo as a 'absynth spirit' is great too. The whole decoration is great too. Now the bad thing : the storyline is simple, but at no moment I wanted to believe in it, I never felt concerned with the love story, Nicole Kidman plays like a fish : wet big eyes but a few expressivity (maybe not her fault : the role is not very well written). The camera does too much slow motions, it makes go sea sick. Sometimes, the camera can't stay showing a still thing more than one second and that is not very enjoyable too. I'm sure this mvie could have been much much better with a real director : Luhrmann has strong visions, good ideas (too much ideas maybe), but he is not a great director for me, I felt exactly the same with Romeo+Juliette. This movie can go in the same box as 'le pacte des loups' (brotherhood of the wolves) : funny, better than a waste but far from the masterpiece some calls it.",7,0,1,13 April 2002
X2: X-Men United," for me, the third best super-heroes comic-book adaptation at this time
","As a very long-time fan of super-heroes, I had always dreamed of this moving experiments. I enjoyed TV-series like Wonder-woman, Hulk or even the terrible batman. Then came Tim Burton's Batman : the first one was not bad, but I don't like it a lot. The second one (staring Michelle Pfeiffer as catwoman) was a great movie, it is the one I considere as the best super-heroes movie. Some years later came Xmen, the first one, and a not-too-bad movie : the chronology of the uncanny Xmen comics was not right at all (Iceberg, one of the 60's Xmen is a kid besides Tornado, who is one of the 80's stories, for instance), the dressing was black leather instead of the bright costumes of the originals (remember wolverine, blue and yellow), but it was okay, it was not ignorants choices but clever ones : all of the comic book can not stay same in the movie. The script was bad, because of its purpose : explaining quickly what are the mutants, showing a few characters and exploiting some of Chris Claremont most famous comics stories (like 'god creates, man destroy'). Lots of the Xmen 1 scenes were very dark : night costs less to shoot. Then came Spiderman : great actors, good and respectuous script, a not very good green goblin (but with a good actor), a great costume... A very good movie, my second favourite adaptation. We can forget Spawn, Daredevil, The Shadow... All that is enjoyable to watch on a rainy day, but they aren't masterpieces. Xmen 2 is my 3rd favourite of the superheroes kind. It has all the qualities of the first Xmen, but it has other things. It is more desperate and more cynical (the president sends the army on the mutants but warns 'don't show kids killed on primetime'), the line between the good ones and the bad ones is thinner than ever (the reaction of bobby drake's family is a good example : you are supposed to love your family, but what happens when your family refuses what you are ?). A very more mature movie, a good one. I now can't stand waiting for Ang Lee's Hulk !",9,0,0,2 May 2003
Amélie," smile !
","Some will say they didn't enjoy Amelie : not enough tragedy, not enough stunts, too much of a Paris city that never existed (not so true for me, it depends of the eyes you have to judge this), too much gentleness. But those people are the ones who enjoy nothing more than not to be happy, they might be what in France we call 'enfants gâtés' : who don't know the price of a fair smile, one of the things usually nobody never gives to nobody for nothing, one of the things people keep for them, selfish we are... What Jeunet gives us here is a reason to smile for a few minutes, and that is very very much, so don't be shy, don't refuse the joy that is given here, let it work as it is intented to work, do this or don't buy the DVD. It is rare that a movie acts as a perfect universe, where you have nothing to add or to remove. Some Capra movies do it for me, Croutching tiger hidden dragon or Hayao Miyazaky movies (Chihiro) too... and so does Amelie. This means it is one of that movies you can watch again and again and again, taking pleasure in the same places, not in missed details. You heard all about it I guess : charming, cute,... it is, and that is funny to see how deeply it is when such feelings are usually not considered as very deep : no passion, no tragedy, no bloody revenge, nothing that makes the heart go 250 bpm. Amelie will easely make you forgot most of the recent 'blockbusters', this is one of the kind that lasts, one of the kind you can buy in DVD without fear of any disapointment.",10,0,2,23 August 2002
