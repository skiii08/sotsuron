The Blair Witch Project," Tired Of All The Put-Downs...
","Yes, I am very tired of all the put-downs this film is getting... I'm sorry but I must say what I feel for once... I know people have their own opinions but this is just out-right annoying...You people that put 'The Blair Witch Project' Down are obviously nothing but stupid... You have no arguments... WOW so it didnt show a witch.. have u ever thought that that isnt what the movie is about?... ITS NOT! its about the fear of the unknown if u want to go see villans all the time rent another movie... and by all means if u know that you dont like these kinds of movies... DONT go see it... we (the people who liked it) dont want to hear your ignorance!Its different thats for sure and it might just be the reason it scared people off... or the fact that you acually (and dont lie to yourself) go in the theather knowing you are gonna come out hating it reguardless... ONLY because of the hype... well a HYPE doesnt mean it is going to be a bad movie AT ALL ( see Titanic... haha).Never has such a film been soon brillant and shocking all at once... as this film I must say... Cleverness was the key in making this... because it is and feels true, pure and horrifing... you know that you will never go into the woods again at night without having in the back of your mind some part of this movie... why denie it? ... you know you liked this movie... because there is no way you couldnt.. cause there was nothing wrong with it....(and for the record the actors were superb... how else could you explain acting like a 'real' person the whole way through)All I am going to say is that if u didnt like this movie... get your head checked... cause u are missing out on acually having the privilege to say... I liked it... and u are coming off looking very stupid with such silly and false explanations of why u didnt... get checked and... watch it again... and again.... and... well u know the drill...",10,1,2,26 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Truely Terrifying...
","Remember those rare kind of movies that at the end leaves itself hanging with you for hours or even a few days... where the eeriness just seems to creep over you, and stays in the back of your mind untill your fears leap out at you unexpectedly? Well it's here.... and it's colder than ever!In this film the main key element is 'mood'. Which it sets alot of it... and thats what makes it so tense. Bravo to 'The Blair Witch Project'! Very well done... A movie that you can't say has anything wrong with it... and it's sly identity of it being true still works and is half the fun... (even though we know its not real)'Blair Witch' relies on everyones worst fear... The fear of the unknown. Lets face it... its going to be hard to go camping after seeing this one, and you just may think twice about those sounds outside your bedroom window at night when you are alone... or in this case it didn't matter that you were alone.Excellent. and without a doubt, truely terrifying.",10,1,2,10 August 1999
Beauty and the Beast," It Sparkles Like No Other!
","This is without a doubt the best animated movie EVER made... It is truely magical! Never before has a movie (period) been so touching, warm, and inviting. It sparkles, there is nothing wrong with this movie, and it is hard to get any better than this.The only animated movie ever to be nominated for 'best picture' (put that in your pipe and smoke it.. The Lion King.. Which is way over-rated). The animation is some of disneys best, stand-out being the ballroom scene... will leave you in tears and will give you the strength that there is hope and true love for everyone... Never before has a film been so touching... No one can say this is a bad movie ... yet it is a true masterpiece... a classic... a #1 for everyone...... After Thought- Disney... make more like this... you did better when you stayed on this line.. and drop the 'think you have to be totally funny' attitude... you did best when u did this one..",10,0,0,30 July 1999
American Pie," Outrageous Good Fun
","There are movies for everyone... movies for people who like Drama.... gore... and even harmless vulgar humor.... and believe it be harmless vulgar humor is 'American Pie'! If you do not like movies dealing with such.. then plain and simple 'Dont Go See It!' No need in coming on here and telling people they are 'sick in the head if you like American Pie' like one reviewer did...Anyways aside from people with rude comments and not taking the fact that different people like different stuff because just maybe we can deal with it.... 'American Pie' is hilarious! It's been a while since I have laughed so much... True it may have a slim plot but with this kind of movie it only can be expected... so I am rating this movie very highly recommended, considering it is in its own genre...Better than the recent 'Theres Somthing About Mary', 'American Pie' excells in humor as much as fun! A definite crowd pleaser... I for one know I have never seen the audience react as wildly or with such togetherness as with this movie... it was outrageous good fun!The interesting part is that along with 'sick humor' it acually deals suprisingly well with the slight touches of 'teen' romance and not sinking to far into just plain lust....Really a treat.. Enjoy it... and don't be afraid to say so... it's worth fighting for... to keep this as one of the best movies of this year (1999)... so far...",9,1,1,11 August 1999
North by Northwest," Top-Drawer Hitchcock
","One of Hitchcock's best! Much better than others like 'Rear Window'. This movie is spectacular! Film-making at it's best, with some of the most memorable moments ever caught on screen.  So many wish they would never stop.  It is suspenseful, romantic, and even with light touches of humor. 'North By Northwest' is a classic, ranks up there on the 'best movie's ever' list. If you haven't yet seen this movie, watch it and get caught up in it's magnificent rollercoaster-ride of storytelling. *The direct ending is my favorite part of this movie, showcasing once again how Hitchcock can surprise us in even the most gleeful circumstances. It will leave you smiling.",Null,0,0,23 November 2000
The Shining," Horrible, Disapointing Excuse Of A Horror Movie
","This is by far one of the most OVER-rated piece of crap movies I have ever seen. There is absolutly nothing memerable about it. People are saying 'The best horror movie ever made!' and stuff.. when its obviouse they must have fell asleep in the 2 hour middle and woke up at the end when things acually begain to pick up.....Really, Really disapointing.... and how annoying is Shelley Duvall the girl CANT act! Please people stop baying about how good this film is. Watch it again! this time with your eyes open and dont go by what one person says... and by all means just because it has relations with.. Stephen King, Jack Nicholson, and Stanley Kubrick... Doesnt mean its going to be good... and U dont have to be a faithful little fan and like it just because they had dealings with this movie in some matter....Please email me if u want to discuss this further... obviously no one that has rated this movie on here knows what they are talking about...",1,5,20,20 July 1999
American Beauty," American Invincible!
","American Beauty is a complete masterpiece! Finally the Academy Award has gotten it right, now 3 years in a row all my picks have won Best Picture of the year, and rightly so.  Beauty's story was very well done with a mixture of black comedy and real drama.  The lighting, also magnificent, helps the storys grimish atmosphere. Acting, top-notch... never before has Benning been so wonderful and Spacey finally getting the attention he deserves! American Beauty will leave you in a state of wonder... it makes you think, for yourself.  However this movie is not for some people, particularly the ones who don't look further than the surface of anything. I know the people I went with in the theater to see this, near hated it... and I came out the complete opposite. But for the most part I am glad everyone in movies is having a more open mind.  American Beauty is magical, deeply moving, and poetic... never before have red rose petals meant as much, to anything, as they have here... give this one a shot!",10,0,0,2 August 2000
Titanic," A Powerhouse
","One of the best movies ever made!.... and also a movie people ONLY would put down because of the attention it got.... 'Titanic' is absolutly flawless... never boring... and has a story to die for... A powerhouse with the Oscars, only true lose (besides Kate) was Gloria Stuart being practically robbed of a VERY worthy her Best Suporting Actress Oscar.... Everything Is to like about this film from the Song (one which we all know) to the Actors, and lets not forget the special effects... they just dont get any better than that.... lets face it hardly any film gets better than this... except 'Gone With The Wind of coarse...   :)",10,0,2,21 July 1999
The Lion King," The Lion King IS NOT A Classic!
",The Lion King was EXTREMELY overly praised... mainly by the public... It is nowhere near the best disney movie... and i'm sorry to say... it's not really in there best effort at all... if you want their true classic try Beauty And The Beast... it showcases disneys brillance with much wounderful gusto! The Lion King Is NOT a classic...and shouldn't be thought of as one... its story is just so-so and the characters are not all that memorable... Disney definitely failed to bring any charm into this movie... mistaken hugely by the public as a classic.. in which no matter how hard anyone tries... this will never be...,Null,0,0,17 May 1999
Pocahontas," Courageous, Brilliant, and Uplifting! A #1 For Disney!
","Some of the best animation in film history can be found here, and being arguable as having the 'best songs ever' in an animated movie!Aside from it's beautiful artwork, 'Pocahontas' (the movie) is beautiful itself. Surpassing 'The Lion King' as if it had never even existed. Who cares if the story doesn't go along with the true to life events of Pocahontas? (Which is the very obvious and stupid reason this movie didn't get the attention it so much deserved.) If one goes around knocking movies for that reason then you need not see any at all.Courageous, Brilliant and Uplifting! It will be hard to escape this one without crying. Disney you've just about topped you charts when you made this one.(Sorry, but I tell it the way it is, and that's how a 'critic' shows their true love for movies. You are welcome to E-mail me your thoughts.)",10,2,5,10 August 1999
