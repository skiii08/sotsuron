The Blair Witch Project," Don't Believe the Hype!
","Don't get me wrong.. it's a good movie. But it's not as good as everyone seems to making it out to be. Maybe I just read too much about it before I saw it, but I wasn't that impressed. I did give it a 7 out of 10 vote here though. I think the people who have said it is the most frightening movie they have ever seen.. need to see more scary movies. I didn't really find it scary at all.. It had its moments, but overall I wasn't scared. I think it ended well... I was disappointed at first until someone pointed something out to me and then I appreciated the end a lot more. I would recommend seeing the movie, but don't expect too much...",6,0,2,1 August 1999
