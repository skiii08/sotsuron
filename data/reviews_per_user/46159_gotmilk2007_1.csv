Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: The international conspiracy
","Are you sensitive to offensive comedy? Are you offended easily? Then don't see Borat! That is a warning! I am not sure if I have ever witnessed something that made so many people laugh, and make so many people walk out. I remember while seeing it, the girl next to me had her hand over her mouth in shock the whole movie. Of course she laughed a few times, but she was more shocked that this movie was released to the public.Further more, offensive to other country's. We find Borat in his own country as he exposes you to his own home life and culture. After you get to know his country of Kazakastan, we find him getting shipped off to New York. Here is where the movie gets good. He interviews all sorts of people from African American hoodlums, to a women's rights activist. This is where he watch's a repeat of Baywatch to find his new found love in Pamela Anderson. He finds out through a book store that Pamela will be having a book signing in California, but he's in New York! He some how talks his producer into going cross country to meet his love. There is a whole mess that contains: Bears, ice cream truck, Baywatch guide line, Bed & Breakfast, and frat boys. You have GOT to see the movie for the ending, it will have you rolling the whole time. I honestly don't think I laughed this hard in a while. 10, no doubt.",10,6,18,5 December 2006
