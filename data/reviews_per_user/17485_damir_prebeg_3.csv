The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," All in all it's not that bad as some people say but...
","Again, I'm not so demanding viewer because if I like some idea behind the story, I tend to ignore bad things in the movie it self.But one thing I can't ignore is that they have created two movies instead of one. And they have done that by stretching and creating too long and too boring scenes. Of course, they want to milk more money from real Twilight fans when part two hits theaters, but come on...Although people are tending to blame acting, I think problem lies more in bad directing. For instance, Bella's wedding walk was one of the worst directed scenes in the whole movie. For a whole two minutes they made her look like she will throw up any moment.And after a 'good night' in Brazil... - Edward: 'I'm sorry, I've hurt you, I hate my self'. - Bella: 'No you didn't, I'm OK. I'm truly happy'. - Edward: 'No, I hate my self, you are lying'. - Bella: 'No I'm really OK.'. - Edward: 'No, you are not'. - Bella : 'Edie, I am OK...?'. - Edward: 'UR lying...' - Bella: '...? Tell you what, let's play some chess until you stop wining, OK?' - Edward: 'No, you are ly... uhm... sorry. I like chess'But to cut the... you know what. I don't recommend this movie to be watched in the theater since you don't have ability to fast forward when needed. In the end, with working remote, I rate this movie with full 5 stars. Without it, I would say 2-3 stars tops.",5,3,6,3 February 2012
Underworld Awakening," Big disappointment
","I really liked first 3 Underworlds, although I was skeptic about 'Rise of the Lykans' because generally I don't like prequels. In the end it turned just fine. I hoped that they will continue with story, in manner that Selene and Michael will spectacularly defeat their pursuers and bring peace between Lykans and Vampires and blah blah blah (yeah, I'm a clich√© sucker).Indeed, here we have vampires and lycans and sexy Selene witch should be 'The Future' according the ending of 'Evolution' but that's not Underworld movie. It looks to me that whole story was built around the fact that Scott Speedman for some reason doesn't act in this sequel.Trust me, if you are a true Underworld fan, go around this sequel because they have created abomination, a hybrid that should never have been created.8 stars for Kate because she looks so good in latex. 1 star for movie plus one because Kate was in it :D",2,3,5,26 April 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Too much of everything...
","First to say, I'm a true fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.But for what it offers this movie is way too long and, even for a fantasy film, overdone.One of overdone scenes: 12 of dwarfs (and a wizard) are so skillful and strong that they are successfully escaping, fighting and killing hundreds of goblins in that huge mountain cave while running at full speed over the old wooden bridges full of holes. And finally they are falling hundreds of meters in to the abyss while standing on a piece of the bridge - without a scratch.If other two parts will be in the same manner, I'm sorry to say but I think that, after 3 masterpieces, they have decided to make 3 mastersh..s. After all, that's Hollywood - they simply don't know when to stop.",5,17,29,28 February 2013
