Sucker Punch," 10 for action, 0 for story
","Once again, director Zack Snyder has proved that he can make an ordinary scene extraordinary with special effects and cool music. He's so good at this that it covered some flaws in his movies 300 and Watchmen, however the story was filled with so many flaws that no matter how cool the action was, the movie's flaws make this movie a D+ at best.I don't need the action to be believable, I need it to be justified through the story. NONE of the action is justified, it's just a fabric of her imagination that Snyder fails to show how it applies to her actual reality. Basically, the action is all for show and has no purpose other than to 'oooh' and 'aaah' us. It claims its relation to the story is these girls using it to survive the asylum. Well, what about the other girls alternate reality? What makes Baby Doll's (such a clich√© name) imagination so special? There are too many unanswered questions that it is clear that whoever was responsible for the story, failed.The acting in general was terrible. Carla Gugino did a great job capturing the typical, unoriginal Russian woman with broken English with lines such as 'I help you' and 'Tell me why you upset?' Emily Browning (the main character) wasn't convincing at all. You need more than a cute baby face to be an effective lead character. I was kind of hoping she would be killed because she was more abrasive than heroic.And the ending itself? Please, without giving it away, do you really expect us to believe that? That was such a lame ending it nearly ruined the movie. I hope this film doesn't set a new precedent of movie's based off of the main character's imagination.",Null,0,5,26 March 2011
