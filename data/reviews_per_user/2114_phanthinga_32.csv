Your Name.," this movie make me falling in love with Makoto Shinkai
",Your Name or Kimi no na wa in Japanese is a anime movie directed by Makoto Shinkai is probably one of the most epic love love story ever told in anime form i ever see.After hearing how much critic and media love this movie and say this is the best anime movie since Hayao Miyazaki era as an hardcore anime fan myself i am really exited to check this movie out when it hit my country theater.This is a very beautiful anime movie with each scene is a jaws dropping animations and a beautiful movie score that fit the mood of the movie perfectly.The character is very likable and i find myself investigate more into the side character and the environment not just the two main character.The movie balance the comedy and the emotion very well that when something really sad or really fun happen the audience can feel the same way as the character.Is this the best anime movie ever ? Who know but for the coming of age like i am this is a truly beautiful fun emotion ride and i can see people will talk a lot about this movie just like they did with Spirited Away when it first came out,10,2,4,21 January 2017
Wind River," Snow and silent
",Wind River directed by Taylor Sheridan is another movie that remind us how can isolation effect human being behavior and raise awareness about sexual assault on native American women.This easy easily one of the best crime movie in 2017 thank to Taylor Sheridan good writing and a terrific cast.Jeremy Renner as the main character is very emotion and Elizabeth Olsen as the 'fish out of water' FBI agent also very great.I haven't watched The Snowman which has the same environment yet but i think Wind River look better and you can see the proof on The Snowman IMDb page,8,1,4,14 November 2017
Underworld," Fun but quite long
",Came out 1 year after the not so based on the source material Resident Evil but make back the budget and make Milla Jovovich a household name in the action horror genre in 2003 Hollywood once again repeat the success with Underworld when they tackle some good old gothic monster like Vampire and they longtime rival Werewolf by give them gun in the modern world and this time the new femme fatale is Kate Beckinsale in the role of Selene a super badass vampire in tight bodysuit who also the reason why the series famous in the first place.People always say the first is the best but with Underworld it the other way around when there a pair amount of bloody action to be entertained but all the mumbo jumbo about past events that serve an important role to the plot bored me to death.I never watch the Resident Evil series or any other cheesy series for the story cause most of the time they all very dumb and forgettable so to see a movie that should be mindless fun like Underworld take itself way too seriously is just sad.The sequels later on is much more enjoyable when the runtime is short and the action is more over the top but that just my opinion,7,1,2,14 September 2018
Aquaman," I'm sorry Wonder Woman but you no longer the best DCEU movie for me
","Aquaman as a movie is the best and the most surprise I've got from the DCEU till now when it managed to turn a quite bland character in the Justice League movie and a joke character that never meant to be taken seriously according to many DC comic fan that I read online into this one large tatted up man with a larger than life personality who embodiment all the things that kids love when they watch a superhero movie. The movie is part traditional superhero movie, part horror movie, part kaiju movie all wrapped up neatly into one thank to director James Wan risking his career out there when he decided to direct a movie about a not many people know superhero that unlike the already established Superman or Batman just like James Gunn with his Guardians of the Galaxy series and director Zack Snyder for choosing Jason Momoa to be the live action version Aquaman for the DCEU",10,3,7,23 December 2018
Deadpool 2," The wise-cracking anti hero we all know and love is back and this time he get a new character development
",DP 2 is a relaxing Marvel movie after so much depressing 'stuff' happen in Infinity War so you can bring the whole family to the theater and watch it cause this time the fourth-wall breaking jokes and hyper violence is not the only factor that make DP 2 so awesome but also the new character development for Deadpool that bring him from cound nine down to earth just a little bit for us to find him somewhat relatable as a human being.Directed by one of the man behind John Wich and recently Atomic Blonde like i say before the action is really really good but still i have to give DP 2 a 9 cause DP 1 is my first experience with Deadpool and nothing can top that movie at the moment.Stay tuned for the after credit cause you don't want to miss that trust me,9,2,4,20 May 2018
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A worthy follow up to everyone favorite Red monkey : Hellboy
",I love The Golden Army as a kid and I'm still love it now cause it the first movie directed by Guillermo del Toro that I ever watch and his vision about the world and the lore in this superhero movie is so damn beautiful and bewitching that I'm still remember fondly till this day.It nice to see Hellboy and Liz back again at a couple after the first one and not only we got to see a new adventure of the team but we also see our favorite fishman Abe played by Doug Jones got some character development too.There a new addition to the team that is Johann Krauss and he also fun to watch but as much as i love to see more awesome supernatural being I also want to see a human as the glue to hold the team together so I find it kinda weird why they bring back the annoying Manning and not agent Myers.I'm not very optimistic about the new Hellboy movie when it not directed by del Toro or starring any of the original cast but I like the new director Neil Marshall movies so let see how it goes,10,3,4,7 September 2018
Ready Player One," I understood that reference.jpg
",The concept of become your favorite characters in any form of entertainment is nothing new for this generation because before Ready Player One we already have the VR technology and a handful of YouTube video like Video Game High School series so to see it finally being made with this much of love by Steven Spielberg is simply mind blowing.My opinion about this movie may change in the future after I read the actual book but up until that day Ready Player One is awesome,10,0,1,31 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," When Marvel get full rights for Spider Man magic happen
","As long as i can remember Spider Man is my all time favorite superhero not because i can relate so much to Peter Parker as a guy but he also the first superhero introduce me to Marvel comic.Grew up watching and idolize Tobey Maguire as Spider Man from Sam Raimi version i never care about Amazing Spider Man when it first came out although i have nothing again Adrew Garfield i just simply don't find him fit as Peter Parker.That being said go to this movie i try not to go full fan boy and jugging this movie fairly so when the movie end OMG what a relief cause Spider Man Homecoming is the best Spider Man movie i ever see in a long time.Tom Holland as Peter Parker is the best casting choice ever he nail every aspect of the character a shy adorable dork dealing with teenager problem while maintain his secret identity:A web shooting superhero.Cause this movie take place when Peter still a high school boy so you will see a Spider Man full of problem.He not always good as his job,he clumsy, make a lot of mistake and still trying to figure out how to use the Spider suit.The movie have a lot of fun action scene and a couple scene i like to call it 'Spidey moment' that really remind me of Sam Raimi movie. Michael Keaton as Vulture the main villain also very refreshing when he not a ultra powerful guy who lust for power that want to control the world like many previous Marvel villain but this time a man try his best to support his family.The movie end with a lot of question but if the Spider Man future franchise keep going like this i will be pleased",10,73,142,9 July 2017
Baby Driver," Baby Driver is your new favorite movie
",Edgar Wright is one of my favorite movie director in the world.With Scott Pilgrim at number 1 in my favorite movie of 2010 when i hear he gonna direct a new movie after a long time i immediately check it out as soon as it hit my country and i gotta say:Yeah this movie definitely is one of Edgar best work yet.To fully enjoy this movie i suggest viewer go to the theater completely blind and know nothing about the plot cause that what i did and it paid off very well.With Edgar unique visual directing style the movie nearly about 2h but it very fast paced and packed with so much awesome things so it very re watchable.Although the plot being done a million time before so you kinda know how it gonna end and how the characters being played but with Edgar dialogue style the movie always know when it need to be serious and when it need to be funny.All the characters interact with each other very smooth.Ansel Elgort for the first time i saw him on the big screen is brilliant as Baby the main character that relate very much to me.With a cast full of A-list actors seeing them each have their own backstory and mystery also please me a lot and add so much weight to the movie.With all the thing i list up there i highly recommend it for everyone,10,22,44,29 June 2017
Justice League," Chill out people
",As a simple person i watch movie to be entertain especially in superheroes genre i hardly care about how bad and how good this Marvel movie or that DC movie if the movie fun that enough for me so Justice League is no exception.The story not dark like previous BvS and cringy like SS it actually very light hearted and enjoyable.All characters played their role well and after this movie it make me hype for their stand alone movie more.Is the movie at the same level with The Avengers or not let the box office answer that,7,1,4,18 November 2017
Split," It good but maybe too good ?
","Just came back from the theater after watching Split for the first time and it probably stick to my brain for a long time.First off i very happy to see M. Night Shyamalan is back in the director chair one again and gave us this masterpieces of modern horror movie.Even through he kinda back with the movie The Visit in 2015 but in this movie i dare to say he finally back in the glorious day when he directing movie like The Sixth Sense or even Unbreakable that i will talk about it later.Really this movie is very good from the casting choice,the acting ,the location to some small details that require you to focus 100% to fully understand the situation the character has been to. James McAvoy give us a brilliance and jaw-dropping performance as the highly disturbed man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities that the idea itself is so refreshing and intriguing to see after countless bad horror movie or sequels that no one ask.The character is so complex when he has to change personalities every time from a little kid to a man with OCD Symptoms to a nice middle age woman and finally The Beast.The idea may seem extreme and not convincing at all but seeing James facial expression,the way he talk or movement to match each character make me totally buying it.The rest of the cast did a very good job with the material their handle especially young actress Anya Taylor-Joy who one again impress me with the character Casey Cooke a lonely girl also have a disturbing past so her chemistry on screen with James McAvoy is so thrilling and interesting to watch.The part that i say too good is not only the shocking final part when she face off with The Beast but also the ballsy of director M. Night Shyamalan when he let the antagonist got away in the end leave a unsatisfied feeling in our heart then the confusing scene set up for the future movie with character David Dunn played by Bruce Willis",10,4,14,22 February 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The second and sadly the last time he truly be back
","As an action fan, I ironically find myself rewatch T1 more than T2 for a long time due to how many people claim that T2 is the ultimate action movie of all time and fear that I will not feel the same way but today I finally got the courage to rewatch T2 again from start to finish and come to conclusion that T2 is no doubt one of the best action movies ever made and. If you like a grounded and revolutionary dark sci-fi movie then watch T1 and if you like a bombastic action movie with great action set pieces and impressive special effects at the time then T2 will blow your mind away but in the end, it all come down to taste and I love both for what is it. The sixth installment already on its the way but T2 will always be the perfect ending to The Terminator franchise and I know the fan can all agree on this one",10,0,1,6 July 2019
Van Helsing," After 14 years the movie still hold up
","Stephen Sommers is a guy know how to make movies with a silly premise very entertaining and with his run from The Mummy in 1999 to Van Helsing in 2004 he single handedly create his own cinematic universe of old Universal monsters dub as The Dark Universe today without knowing it.Van Helsing is a comic book style movie set in the Victorian age with a dash of Steampunk technology in to the mix where vampire,werewolf and the Frankenstein monster running amok and the onlyone who can stop them is Van Helsing the legendary monster hunter played by Hugh Jackman along with his sidekick Carl the Monk and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale who also a famous vampire/vampire killer in her Underworld franchise.I first time saw the movie when I was young and love it just like I did with The Mummy and now when I already got some knowledge about these kind of movies to my surprise director Stephen Sommers hasn't done anything since his last movie Odd Thomas in 2013 which is really weird cause although most of his movies never hold anything deep or thought provoking but they are all perfect popcorn entertainment.",10,3,4,21 August 2018
Avengers: Endgame," The biggest snap back of all time
",By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years,10,136,257,30 April 2019
The Transporter," Early 2000s action thrill with Jason Statham
",The Transporter (2002) is Jason Statham break out movie from his usual British gangster flick and forgettable side-role in America into Hollywood superstar and seal his name forever into the list of iconic action movie hero of the new millennium with the role of Frank Martin and also make me a fan of his ever since. Statham character may not be the most original when it came out but thanks to his stoic expression and the ability to kick multiple asses with the help of legendary Hong Kong action choreographer Corey Yuen this movie still hold up very well in the action and thrill department when I rewatch it to refresh my memories in 2019.,8,0,0,11 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," DC take note please
",Before Infinity War for me Thanos is just another genetic looking villian for me so i don't know how much this movie do the him justice but what i do know is he slowly becoming my favorite villiant of the MCU.Infinity War is depressing as hell everytime the heroes get a tiny bit of chance Thanos crush it into dust with his ultra OP weapon The Infinity Gautlet.His ideals of bringing balance to the universe is so wrong on many levels but the fact that he believe that is the only way is what make Thanos so scary and interesting.For more than 10 years the long string successful of the MCU still continue with Infinity War so let see how much they can offer us in another 10 years.(P/S.The best dark storyline of Marvel so far is still Logan btw),9,3,13,28 April 2018
Get Out," We live in a society.........
",I missed my chance to watch Get Out when the movie still the hotest topic of moviegoers in 2017 and avoid the movie like the plague after the director Jordan Peele won a Oscar of 2018 not because I'm trying to look edgy but I'm scared of all the hype around the movie at the time ruin the movie for me.Today I finally watch Get Out for the first time alone at my house and it the movie it pretty good to be honest but it still feel overrated for some reason.Get Out is a horror-comedy movie with a big message about all kind of discrimination that a person like me never experience in a very interesting and sometime funny way.The movie never go down with the thrill and the acting from the beginning to the end with is surprise me cause I'm always looking for a bad moment in horror movie to laugh at. It suck that I already saw some glimpse of Get Out before in movies like You're Next and The Wicker Man but nonetheless it still cool when a first time director with a heavy comedy background made a horror movie that win a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay the award that I think is the hardest to even nominated when Hollywood nowadays suffer from the lack of imagination,8,0,2,20 August 2018
Drive," The movie made me fall in love with Ryan Gosling
","I came across Drive purely by chance when I'm looking for some ultra violent movie and the title Drive pop up a few time but what I got after Drive is much more than what I'm asking forDirected by Nicolas Winding Refn Drive is a stylish crime drama featuring what I believe some of the coolest main character in modern cinema.The Driver played by Ryan Gosling is an action hero that on par with the like of Steve McQueen,Sean Connery or Charles Bronson when he the type of guy who talk very little but get the job done on time.Looking at The Driver the first impression is he a very handsome guy that can't do no wrong but you will not want to get on his bad side cause deep down inside him is a force of nature that waiting to be let loose.The whole movie got this warm and cuddly feeling with The Driver and his new found love interest in the first half but when the stuff hit the fan it make a great'GOD DAMN' moment.The movie may get a bit slow after the opening getaway scene but again Drive is not an action movie it a journey of a shady guy who want to be the hero of his own story",9,2,3,27 August 2018
Hellboy," Guillermo del Toro's Avengers Assemble
","I actually saw the sequel The Golden Army first and remember the sequel to be the best thing ever happened at the time and watch it again...and again so now I'm still think the sequel is better but the original HellBoy is also very good.Ron Perlman no doubt the best actor for the role of HellBoy when he bring so much charisma to a character at first I think just a force of destruction much like The Hulk and in many way he is but he so likable and fun when he express his jealousy over his new caretaker or how despite how big and old he is he still calm down when people pull out a Baby Ruth bar.Guillermo del Toro definitely got a clear visionary when he making HellBoy cause not only the character,the monster and the scenery designs look cool but the movie obviously not trying to play safe cause it a PG-13 movie alright but it very dark with the story and villian like Karl Ruprecht Kroenen feel like he belong to a hard R horror movie",9,1,2,5 September 2018
The Game," I want to join The Game once in my life time
",This is the first time ever I've been blown alway by the talent behind the movie The Game that is director David Fincher for directing such an awesome crime thriller that i can't even predict anything so the final twist hit me hard and let me speechless for a moment.Everyone performance is fantastic and above all is Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger.It sad that when you finish The Game the replay value of the movie is very small cause you already know all twist and turn so I can't really find myself watching The Game again with anyone,10,1,3,30 May 2018
Logan," Hugh Jackman great salute for you sir
","Logan is the final installment of the X-Men solo movie staring Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine for the last time and after seeing this tonight i proudly to say this not only one of the best superheroes ever made but also a game changing move of Marvel studios since The Avengers.Back when i first hear about the movie it already make me curious when they just simply put the words LOGAN in the tiles and even more shocking with the feel,the look and the music when the trailer first came out.This is a very different movie from everything Marvel ever done before when they portray The Wolverine as a jacked up old man who you can really tell that has going through some tough stuff in his life and now he is very tired with it.No more X-Men,no more saving people and mutant from the force of evil now he just a broken man with no idea for the future despaired to live pass another day and without the help of Charles(Patrick Stewart) and Laura(Dafne Keen) he will eventually kill himself.The movie feel like two separated movie combine into one when it part superheroes movie when the plot involving Logan and Charles has to help Laura get to EDEN a place full of the last remaining mutant when a evil corporation chasing them lead by a guy named Pierce and part family drama movie when they show each character chemistry on screen and how they dealing with a lot of problem to the point that you can't recognize them with normal people.I also have to give credit for the fact that this is a hard R-rated movie so now we can finally see Logan slices people into pieces full on blood and gore that so satisfied to watch.",10,1,5,8 March 2017
Total Recall," The only movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger disguised as an old lady and still looking awesome as hell
",Paul Verhoeven and Arnold Schwarzenegger need to work with each other more cause they a match made in heaven when Total Recall the only movie by them is a classic sci-fi movie with incredible story when it combine hard-hitting action scene and a dose of bizarreness.The movie plot can described as Jason Bourne in Mars when Arnie played a normal citizen who always dream of Mars so he go to Rekall a company that can implant false memories about Mars into his brain and next thing he knew is strange people and people he knew all try to kill him while the urge to go to Mars gets stronger over time.It a total blast when I first saw it and still now after many years cause the action is merciless and the twists is too good that i think no one will dare to remake this movie much like Robocop another classic from Paul Verhoeven but apparently I'm still underestimated the money hunger machine that is Hollywood when both movie get remake in 2012 and 2014,10,0,1,4 July 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," It not surpass the first one but still a fun sequel
",I guess after the incredible successful of the first movie Marvel finally gave James Gunn all the right to create his own superheroes movie and the result is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 not only a fun movie sequel but also a big pop culture Easter eggs.The movie is fill with enough iconic figures of the late 80s and 90s that guarantee to make you have a nostalgic blast from start to finish.The humor of the movie is still there with many scene that make the audience laugh out loud involving The Guardians especially Rocket and baby Groot but sometime does get a little over head.The chemistry between characters is as strong as ever when this time they not only have to save the galaxy one again but also have to face off with their own problem and learn how to work not as a team but as a family.Because family is the main topic of this movie so you have to expect there a lot of cheesy speech about family that kinda awkward and ridiculous at first but in the end it managed to make me almost cried.One last thing you guys seriously need to check out Awesome mix vol 2 it freaking kick ass,9,35,64,29 April 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Watch out everyone the King is back
","For a non-American like me i don't really know much about King Kong or his influence on modern day monster movie but that not a problem to hold me back from watching this movie in theater and it was an absolute blast to finally knowing the King of monster movie in America:Kong.I actually did a research and find out the plot of this movie is kinda similar to the original movie in 1933,it both follow a group of people travel to a unknown island soon find themselves being hunt and chase by a giant ape called Kong for trespassing his territory and disturb the peace of the island.First time directing monster movie Jordan Vogt-Roberts did a fantastic job on shooting the island with beautiful cinematography that deliver the savage look of Kong and the rest of monster on island as well.The cast is very large and full of talented actors like Tom Hiddleston,Samuel L. Jackson... and surprisingly John C. Reilly that brought many good and comedic moment so when there aren't any monster around the movie don't feel boring and dragging to watch.Of course everyone favorite parts is always the monster fight scene and this movie has plenty of it although for the most time is not all involved with Kong but trust me when the fight happen seeing Kong punching,kicking and throwing stuff is a very crowd pleasing moment(My favorite is the final fight).It maybe not all that great for some hardcore fan of the series but for new fan like me this is the best monster movie i saw since Pacific Rim.I strongly suggest audience going to see that movie please wait until the after credit",10,32,65,11 March 2017
Wonder Woman," A wonderful movie
","I love this movie a lot.This is the best DC movie i ever see since the Dark Knight Trilogy and that said something.Some of the thing i hate the most from previous DC movie is the bad lighting and a script that try too hard to be dark and serious that they almost forgot how to entertain movie goer not just only hardcore comic fan.Finally in 2017 from director Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman came out and remind me how much fun a superheroes can get while maintaining a good hero origins. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is one of the best casting choice i see along side with Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man.Seriously Gal kick ass from start to end with many fun and awesome action scene that i can clearly see that she had to put a lot of hard work in.Knowing it a woman empowerment movie but the guys character in this movie is not that bad either.They funny,likable and some scene involving the romantic relationship between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine that add a lot of emotion into the movie and make it more memorable.I guess the reason why i can't rate this movie 10 starts cause it suffer the same issues as other superheroes movie like genetic plot and weak villain but again this is the first DC movie that i truly enjoy for a long time so i recommend it for everyone",9,15,31,1 June 2017
Black Panther," Great now we need a asian hero to make SJW lose their shit again
",I get it Black Panther is a black superhero but he not the first one ever being brought to the big screen cause Blade already done that in 1998 and in my point of view Black Panther is a standard superhero movies with the best villain since Captain America: Civil War.The movie is high on the energy and action like you would expected from a Marvel movie(Not dissing DC btw) but let's talk about Erik Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan.I'm understand where he's coming from and how it lead him to become the man right now so when he died it actually very touching and I think if the MCU need a main villain specific for the world of Black Panther like Loki to Thor or Red Skull to Cap. Erik Killmonger is the one for sure,8,1,3,24 February 2018
Mother!," Your Home ? More like OUR Home
",I'm deeply sorry for the bad communist joke in the review title cause that all I got to light up my mood after the nerve wracking and unsettling one of the kind movie 'Mother!'. Both written and directed by Darren Aronofsky starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem as a couple who find themselves in a weird and bizarre situation in their new home 'Mother!'for me is kinda like a home invasion or a evil cult movie at first but the more the story goes the more heavily it get with the religious symbols that pretty eyes opening and at the same time horrifying.I know not many people gonna like and appreciate 'Mother' cause for as long as I can remember arthouse movies like this never be anyone's cup of tea but I strongly recommend 'Mother' to anyone who want a unique movie experience that for the better or worse (Sorry again if this sound pretentious) change your life forever,10,0,1,15 September 2018
Blade Runner," The one that started it all
","When talking about the cyberpunk sub genre you will heard Blade Runner being brought to the table cause it the finest example of the sub-genre and also inspired a whole new generation of film maker,game developer and comic book writer to go out and make their own version of Blade Runner like:The Wachowskis with The Matrix,Hideo Kojima with The Metal Gear series and many more.Frankly I'm not a big fan of the movie when I saw it for the first time somewhere in 2016 cause the movie is completely the opposite of what I thought it would be judging by it descendants.It not an action movie in fact it a crime movie that set in a cyberpunk world and is one hell of a slow burn.The look of the movie is a work of art no doubt and I can see how this movie got the cult classic status but just like any person who saw the movie when it came out in 1982 I don't think much about the movie after the first watch and that is my big mistake.Blade Runner got a sequel title Blade Runner 2049 in 2017 and it was so fantastic that I decide to give the original another go in 2018.It sure feels much more better now when I finally appreciate the hard works that being put into the movie and all the set piece not just there to be cool.Roy the replicant who mean to be the villain of the movie turn out to be more human than the main character Deckard when he spared Deckard life despite the death of his friend just to let the so called 'Human' know Replicant is not there to be worker or to be order around but capable of sympathy as well.I'm not gonna go in deep analysis about the weird unicorn dream or the debate that Is Deckard a Replicant or not cause this movie need to be view multiple time and I suggest anyone who want to get into the genre do the same",10,2,3,23 August 2018
The Matrix," Keanu Reeves IS THE ONE
","There nothing I can say about The Matrix that hasn't been said before by critics and people with more knowledge about film making than me so I humbly give my two cent about why I think The Matrix is a modern day classic and why the mind bending story The Wachowski Brothers cooked up is one of the most genius sci-fi story ever told.There's lot of things science still can't explant fully until this day and one of it is what if the world we living right now is just a big laboratory made by a greater being to observe and report about a species called human and with The Matrix we as the audience follow Neo a worker by day,hacker by night step by step discover the world and all the rules it hold now stranger than ever.Mind numbing plot and crystal clear fight scene from the greatest fight choreographer of the East Woo-Ping Yuen plus the movie also introducing the term Bullet Time a cool technique that I think evolve from Hong-Kong slow-mo gun fight.Watching it now I'm still feel the same chill when I first what the movie but I wish I had been born decades earlier when The Matrix hit theater around the world to experience it with as many people as possible",10,0,0,3 September 2018

John Wick: Chapter 2," Run,John Wick,run!!!!!!!
","To all hardcore action fan out there who deeply in love with the first John Which movie please hear me out:If your guys have very high hope about John Wick: Chapter 2 is going to be a action masterpiece with the same level as The Terminator 2 or any sequels that surpass the original will be disappointed.The movie still have the same formula as the first one,it directed by the same guy with Keanu Reeves back as John Wick a down right badass hit-man who always know how to cheat code head shot everyone but that not the main reason why i love this movie it also about him dealing with the bloody past he left behind and the emotion after his wife dead.In the first movie you can really see the reason why he get back in the game is avenging for a puppy that hold the last connection to his wife but in in the sequel i dare to say the reason he get back is very forcing and dumb.I mean why the hell bother accepting a last job from a stupid debt he makes back in the day to now find himself get caught in a manhunt across the New York city full of professional hit-man?The level of ridiculousness began to rise when i finally see how the world of hit-man works,at first it kinda amazing and intriguing to see all the hit-man services from clothing,weapon preparing...etc to the point that you can basically bump in to a hit-man in the street disguise as a homeless man,a street performer or even ordering a hit-man if you has their currency is some weird gold coin.The action scene is still there you will get bloody shootout plus well choreographed fight scene with Keanu and the cast doing their own stunt but is it done in a horrific way:Two big shoot out scene ruined by took place in a very dark cave that you can't really see anything and a weird glass art gallery that make you head dizzy,fight scene get interrupt by some people,casually shooting in public that seems like no ones care.The movie get dragged a little bit too long with too many boring and throwaway character with a subplot involving a character played by Riccardo Scamarcio that i hardly about.The only thing save the movie for me is some great camera works with neon night lights style,stand out performance by Keanu Reeves,Ian McShane and frankly Laurence Fishburne that delivery many great dialogue and over the top acting that keep me entertain through out the movie.The reason i gave this movie 6 stars instead of 5 because i admire the director for trying to create a story and still have hope for chapter 3:John Wick goes international(please this time have Chow Yun Fat as the main villain)",6,0,11,12 February 2017
Annihilation," We need a sequel
",The first time I watch Ex Machina it left me speechless with the shocking revelation near the end and the similar case happen with Annihilation the latest movie directed by Alex Garland.Annihilation is a good sci-fi thriller movie with many very questionable stuff need to be answer so I will be really happy if there a sequel but to be honest because critics hyped this movie too much I'm sure many people will disappointed with what they get,8,3,7,15 March 2018
