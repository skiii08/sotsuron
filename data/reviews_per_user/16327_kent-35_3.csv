The Rock," I loved this action packed movie.
","In my opinion, this was Nicholas Cages' and Michael Bays' last good movie. But it is an excellent movie. Action packed from beginning to end, this movie delivers a believable story and a likable cast. Ed Harris plays the 'villain', yet he is as likable as any of the 'good' guys. He is a an army officer who is dissolusioned with the military because of the way it has treated soldiers under his command. The only real 'bad guys' in this movie are the governmental bureaucrats who have essentially, lied to all of the principle characters in some way or another and a few soldiers who are essentially, mercenaries. Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery are excellent as the team who is chosen to go to 'the rock' and disable the nuclear weapons the the renegade soldiers have pointed at San Fransisco.All in all, this movie is as exciting as films get.",9,0,0,27 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," I enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it.
","The Blair Witch Project,(BWP) is one the best movies that I have seen all year. Amazingly, the BWP is reportedly a multi-thousand dollar movie and all of the other releases I have seen this year are multi-million dollar movies. If you don't know already, BWP is a horror movie. What makes it so horrifying is the unknown. This is the best advice I can give to a potential patron. Go see BWP before you know to much. The more you read and hear about the movie the less horrifying it will seem. Go see it soon, and don't walk home alone.",8,1,1,26 July 1999
Glory," One of the best movies ever made.
","This incredible movie has a great story which is based upon actual historical letters, an incredible cast, and a superb score. The soundtrack to the movie (written by James Horner) is one of the most incredible soundtracks available on CD. I would highly recommend it.The story is of an all black brigade in the civil war. Mathew Broderick is the son of an affluent family that is given the command of the brigade. The story depicts how the soldiers were treated by the Union and how they went to battle with the Confederacy. Ironically, there didn't seen to be much difference in the two. The story also illustrates how white soldiers, out of compassion or strictly out of sense of duty gave everything for the same noble cause that the black brigade was fighting for. This movie is as complex as it is fantastic.",10,0,1,27 July 1999
