The Monuments Men," Great film!
","Great film, well acted, shed light on a very important topic this well informed, VERY well traveled (23+/- nations worldwide)knew not of.Moved smoothly. Not positive on its technicalities,tho I'm certain those involved weren't too far off the mark.Not exactly an edge of the seat flick, tho I don't think it was meant to be...Good chemistry, not surprisingly as many of these fine actors have history together. Story line kept serious for the most part with often times of well placed and tasteful spots of wit and humor. Not certain where all the off comments stem from, as I read many prior to watching this. I can honestly recommend MM hope yo enjoy!",8,1,2,24 May 2014
