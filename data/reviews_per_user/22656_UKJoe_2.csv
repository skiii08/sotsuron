The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch exercises the Exorcist
","I saw this movie on it's limited opening Saturday night and I had a tough time sleeping that night. It was the spookiest movie I have ever seen. Most horror movies make their mark depending on the realism. Jaws, one of the best and top grossing horror movies ever, hits the reality factor pretty hard as most people believe it could happen. The Blair Witch Project seemed extremely real. The actors were very convincing and the filming was incredible. The movie builds and builds and the characters grow more agitated and fearful of the situation. It is a must see!!!",10,1,2,19 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Awesome, trashy flick!!!
","I have seen some trashy films but this takes the cake. This movie is everything every rebellious overgrown adolescent ever wanted from life. Swearing, rebelling and good friends. This movie has drawn a lot of criticism and it is well warranted. The vulgarity is out of hand and it's obvious the creators went as close to the edge of NC17 as possible. Ironically I haven't heard any criticism on it being a bad film. It was actually a very good movie with a lot of cleverness and originality. This movie is not made for the squeamish or the over-sensitive. This is just good old-fashion profanity that our movies have been lacking in the past decade since people in office decided to blame murder and suicide of kids on the movie industry instead of pointing the finger at the parents. I had tears I was laughing so hard. The new Austin Powers can't touch this. I'll have to see it again as I missed so much of the film laughing. This is the funniest movie I can remember seeing in a very long time with a very heart-touching ending brought to you by Mike Judge.",9,0,0,1 July 1999
