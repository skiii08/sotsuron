Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I suppose my expectations were too high.
","Dunno what that long boring pod race sequence was in there for. They could have skipped it and replaced it with something more interesting. The fight sequence at the end was... well, exciting I guess, but we had to have that annoying Anakin kid be the hero of the day. And don't get me started on Jar-Jar Stinks and those ridiculous Gungans. Who came up with that concept anyway?! I hope Episode II - 'Attack of the Clones' (what a ridiculous name) will be better.",6,0,1,11 September 2001
Mulan," Not too bad
","This is actually one of the Disney movies I likeed, partly due to the fact that it took place in China, I have a fascination for the Far Eastern countries.  The only thing I have to say is that the voice actor for Mushu should've been someone other than Murphy. I think the character is a little overdone. Other than that it's good for a Disney movie.",Null,1,2,4 February 2004
Blade II," Just plain bad sequel.
","Some people liked it, i did not. Found myself drifting to and from during the latter half of the movie, just waiting for the gory parts of the movie. Surely, this movie, as many others, was only made to blatantly make money off the Blade name. Watch a decent vampire flick instead, and avoid this one. They should have Snipes star in a martial arts flick instead, that's where his strenghts lie.",Null,0,0,2 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Well, I can say this much
","It was better than Lord of the Rings. There, I said it. Sacrilege? Nah, not in my view. I didn't have the patience to sit through LOTR (left after 50% of the movie), but time just flew by with this movie. But then, I'm a sci-fi buff. All that dungeon and dragons stuff I leave to the roleplaying geeks. Anakin has grown up now, and isn't the stuckup little brat that saved the day in the previous movie. Also, the almost total absence of Jar Jar was total bliss. It was also satisfying to see the plot thicken regarding Anakins fate. I give it 8 out of 10. Return of the Jedi still tops my list though. I anxiously await episode III.",9,0,0,29 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Mediocre stuff, didn't have the patience to sit through it...
","I never read the book, it looked like too long a read, and I always thought dragons and dungeons, swordfights and dwarves and the like were for roleplaying geeks. I got dragged into the movie theatre by my friend who has been waiting for this movie for ages. What he didn't tell me was that it lasted for three hours. After and hour and three quarters I walked out, it was just too boring. Sorry, LOTR fans...",1,1,5,25 December 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," High expectations, but dissapointed
","It just didn't deliver what I hoped it would. (I may have had a bad movie-day)It just seemed too much of a rip-off from Asian cinema.  Fly-by-wire kung fu and japanese blood-spurting ultraviolence.  If I want those two I'll just fire up an authentic chinese flic or a japanese one.But it had a few redeeming features I suppose, I'll just have to think about some.I feel generous, the beginning wasn't too bad, so it gets 5 out of 10.",1,2,4,19 November 2003
The Matrix," Don't believe the hype
","What makes this movie so good? Please tell me, I watched it once, and thought it was fairly OK, I borrowed it on DVD from a friend, who thinks it is the best movie of all time (which it is not) and tried to watch it again, but found my thoughts drifting away the whole time. Yes, I know this movie tries to convey a message, doesn't every movie, and the visual FX are fairly impressive, but watching it repeatedly just doesn't seem to make it better. My favourite movie of all time? I really can't say, there have been loads of movies i like, Matrix just isn't one of them. Sorry...",Null,0,1,29 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An objective view
","Many people find this (and the other SW movies) the best ever, since they watched them at a young age. After that they were indoctrinated through Star Wars toys/action figures/comics and so on. I never got around to watching the Star Wars trilogy until i was 19 years old, and didn't really find them that special. The special effects are fairly good for the late 70s/early 80s, but the storyline isn't exactly something it would take a genious to come up with. I can think of many other scifi movies that would rank equal or over Star Wars. As for the prequels, Episode I was a dud in my opinion, Episode II was a smidge better. It's all really about getting to watch how the Anakin/Darth Vader thing plays out, but the three year waiting periods just ruins the whole thing. By 2005 I'm sure I'll sit down in the theatre seat, and walk out 2.5 hours later a mediocre experience richer. Why do I torture myself...?",10,0,1,16 June 2002
