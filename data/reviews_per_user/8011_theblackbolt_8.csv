Ford v Ferrari," Superb
",It's just amazing you won't regret watching it even second of it will inspire you and give you goosebumps .,10,1,3,11 March 2020
Ford v Ferrari," Read it
","If you are expecting it as those fast and furious series with racing just meant Vin Diesel you are welcome to get out .
But it's a movie which really meant to racing not any stunt to impress someone it's an inspiring story and it will give you chills at every moment of race in it .
It depicted the unsung legend Ken Miles who expired even before getting popular and his talent just reminded a history .One this is for sure you will get really inspired after watching it just go if you haven't watched this superb depiction of this legendary racer.",10,1,5,17 March 2020
Batman Begins," Some grey area is there
","First thing about the movie is that Christian Bale is best for the Batman and same for the kate Holmes for being his girlfriend but theirs not plenty of actions , though it allows to introduce Batman to those who are watching first time any batman movies and it builds the plot about the Batman's character slowly but really well which is thanks to Christopher Nolan's direction and thats just the glimpse you get to know about more in the moviesJust go and watch it the only grey area is action for me but it will get paved in The Dark Knight .",8,0,0,17 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It's a bit weired
","It's up to the point it says, it is like its about the faded television actor and his stunt double but when the story starts it's ok but after an interval it felt like what I am watching at like its felt totally messed up and I was like 'ok ok but does it make any sense' and by the last 20 to 30 minutes its totally messed up at that time and it's still not making any sense but I was totally enjoying it , that what happing even without knowing what it's actually having for or what it meant to be .
But you will eventually enjoy it go and watch right now .",7,1,3,17 March 2020
Aladdin," Amazing
","You must watch this the plot of Aladdin is depicted very perfectly and there's a song for even situation there, the magic world full of fantasy which will make you feel amazed about the story with all the magic stuffs also it's a Walt Disney distribution so you don't even have to worry about its standard and VFX quality it's amazing just go and watch it's absolutely worth watching .",9,0,0,14 March 2020
The Dark Knight," There's one Problem
","The movies is up to the mark really entertaining and also it fills the gap of action from the Batman Begins and joker is as always a maniac villain which is really good thing about the movies but , but the thing is that they dropped Katie Holmes and that's the biggest thing I didn't like about this movie.Other than that it's really nice movie and of course it's a batman series and that the best character DC ever created .
So just go and watch its amazing man .",9,0,0,17 March 2020

The Dark Knight Rises," This is the best DC has ever offered
","It's the best Batman movie till now probably till 'The Batman' movies releases no offence .
Now the good thing about this movies is it will satisfy your needs for those dope batman tech .
It has most amount of action in compared to the other batman movies so far.
And the best thing in this is that this time batman gets a real girlfriend by the end not like the Batman Begins or Like The Dark Knight it's really only his girlfriend but also a fact is that he also dies till the end .
Go and watch you will get it it's superb can't wait for 'THE BATMAN'",10,2,3,17 March 2020
