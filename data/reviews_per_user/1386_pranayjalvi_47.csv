Blade Runner 2049," A visually dazzling follow-up 35 years after the original
","Strongly directed by Villeneuve, whose last film was another otherworldly epic, 'Arrival,' 'Blade Runner 2049' manages for the most part to pull off a very delicate dance. Blade Runner 2049' never feels like it isn't its own film. It smartly expands on the questions of what is human and what is not. Immersing you in a complete wow, Blade Runner 2049 is the thinking person's sci-fi event of the year. With films like Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival, director Denis Villeneuve has brought an alien strangeness to his intimate moments. This time he's infusing soulfulness into a story that could have rung hollow. Visual spectacle, fantastic music and cinematography and brilliance by Ryan Gosling in adapting to a new gen Blade Runner.My Rating : 4/5",8,1,7,8 October 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," What was expected and this I got !!
","Cloverfield being a good hit, I was eager to watch thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane. The movie was good at the beginning but lost its path under the ground where the cast was situated. There was very less of horror and no mystery. The movie was somewhat predictable however the cast tried to manage the act. I didn't like the plot of the film and neither the cinematography. There were very less dialogues and I was in a thinking that I was watching a silent movie. The trailer was promising but the movie disappointed me. The critics liked the movie for its twisted plot, however I think it was predictable and there was no twist in the movie. I wasn't thinking the movie to be loose. I would give 2/5 for this movie.",4,9,20,9 May 2016
It," 'IT' float above an usual horror Script
","IT contains some very effective and well-executed nightmare imagery. While Pennywise (the lead monster) is legitimately terrifying, overall, It is more intense than it is chilling. It's maximalist approach also extends to the movie's pacing. Nearly every scene builds to some kind of climactic jump scare—not just the appearance of Pennywise, but such alternative horrors as leprous zombies, menacing wall portraits come to life, and bathroom sinks that spurt fountains of blood. The extended, effects-heavy final sequence, in which the youths descend to Pennywise's dank underground lair to battle both the clown and their own deepest sources of dread, was a very good and emotionally built scene. Waiting for the Chapter 2.My Rating : 3.5/5",7,4,11,10 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One blasts its way into sci-fi relevancy by targeting the spectacle aspect that Star Wars devotees so fervently demand.
","To no surprise, Rogue One is a veritable gold-mine of nostalgic riches for Star Wars fans. Recurring characters and classic cameos raise surface-level hairs, but an even deeper connection pulls direct lines from previous Star Wars installations and re-purposes them for added homage.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story suffers from a clunky, too-many-moving-parts introductory period, but once characters are established and battle plans are laid, Gareth Edwards scales epic scenes of interstellar world-torching.It's more than enough to appease Star Wars fans, but Director Gareth Edwards' intergalactic firestorm is also good enough to stand as a mainstream success all in its own right. My rating for 'Rogue One : A Star Wars Story' is 3.5/5.",7,0,4,16 December 2016
Zootopia," Another Classic from Walt Disney
","A beautifully crafted story and great direction by Bryan Howard. Zootopia displays a place of peace and harmony among all the animals. Judy Hopps as the lead antagonist was exceptional with support from Wilde, the Fox. It was something creative with a detective- animated movie but it won many hearts. As always everything goes merry for Walt Disney, Zootopia becomes another one in my list of all time favourite animated movies. Walt Disney continues its miracle touch with the types of movies it makes. Overall, it exceeded expectations and will be a great conpetitor for Oscars 2017. It was one of the best movies of 2016.",10,3,9,20 May 2016
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 delivers the sequel with same great vulgarity and Action that we expected
",Deadpool sequel was the one of the most awaiting movie in my list since I became a fan after the first installment. Deadpool delivers the same humour and action like its predecessor. Desdpool 2 shows that it is childish and entertaining in its own ways. Ryan Reynolds is great as an ass-kicking Superhero character.,8,54,132,14 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," Brilliant Tarantino
","The film was 2hrs 48 mins long and frankly saying, I didn't get bored and practically liked every minute of the film. This was 8th film by Tarantino and damn, he does it again with its western genre and typical Tarantino style. Samuel. L. Jackson was great as a bounty hunter and the ensembled cast was too good. The movie was shot in 70mm camera which was very brave by Tarantino. This 8th outing from Tarantino offers another well-aimed round of signature blend of action, humour and over the top violence. I suggest everyone to watch this western drama. I go with 9/10 for this Tarantino movie and this is my one of the best movies of 2015.",9,19,52,28 December 2015
Moana," 'Moana' - Another Classic hit by Walt Disney Animations
","Unwilling to fix what ain't broke, Disney hews pretty closely to its usual narrative structure in 'Moana,' while at the same time further expanding its geographical boundaries far from the original Germanic fairy tales that provided the studio's stories for so many decades. Rather than revel in the South Seas kitsch that gave us the Enchanted Tiki Room, this adventure pays fitting tribute to both the natural beauty and the creation myths of the Pacific Islands. If we're looking at the journey and not the destination, 'Moana' is thoroughly entertaining if never completely groundbreaking. Moana does what is needed for a good Disney film. With outstanding Visual effects and good musical score, Moana will definitely make its nomination in Best Animated Picture in Oscars. I go with 4/5 for beautifully made Walt Disney creation 'Moana'.",8,3,14,4 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a comprehensively crowd-pleasing success.
","'Spiderman : Homecoming' may not quite reach the heights of Raimi's Spider-Man 2, but Spider-Man: Homecoming emerges as one of the character's strongest films to date, granting him a clean slate and infinite room to grow.Much of that praise is owed to Tom Holland, who is playing the first iteration of Peter Parker who, actually feels like a high school studentâ€”more or less. The characters and scenarios are familiar, but this is a loose, cool, funny remix that makes them feel fresh again.To its credit, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' forestalls the inevitable as long as possible. It puts the 'neighborhood' back into your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.My Rating : 4/5",8,2,6,12 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Good enough but not great
","The most awaited movie of the year arrived with great expectations among the audience and speaking truly, I was just enough satisfied to watch Suicide Squad. The cast do their best to flesh out the characters, and Ayer seems to enjoy finding songs for the film's soundtrack, but the action scenes were not so remarkable. The biggest problem with the movie is that, despite all the villains, the main antagonist — wisely hidden in the advertising — was not so appealing and ridiculous. Fans will probably appreciate 'Suicide Squad' for trying something different — and it gets bonus points for diversity — but the weaker characters and generally weak plot keep it from being one of the better comic book movies. I would go with 3/5 as it was not excellent but good enough to watch with new idea of villains fighting villains.",6,0,2,7 August 2016
Ant-Man," Better than expected
","When I first heard about Ant-man I was shocked, not only because the concept was new but because it was made by Marvel studios. I didn't expect the movie to make its mark in the audience. But when I saw the movie myself, I was damned. It was a very enjoying action heroic movie. And the thing Marvels created it himself has done half of its work in attracting the audiences. A new superhero with amazing ability to shrink himself has emerged and it gives Marvel a new line of sequels to it. The movie was fun, astonishing & more importantly worth watching. I loved this movie I recommend every action lover to watch this movie. I would go with 4/5 for Ant-Man.",8,0,2,15 November 2015
Bird Box," A decent enough take for a suspense
",BirdBox even though wasn't convincing in the Climax was good enough to make the viewers continuously think of what's coming next. Although the story and the ending could have been more tight but it was satisfactory enough to give it a thumbs up,7,2,7,20 December 2018
Justice League," A better one than its predecessors
","For those who loathe Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and they are legion, Justice League will be just the corrective followup they're looking for. The scenes of the League members together, bickering and bonding, spike the film with humor and genuine feeling, creating a rooting interest in the audience. Without it, the film would crumble. The addition of Ezra Miller as 'The Flash' was a great thing as he was maintaining the balance between action & some comic sequences. The CGI was good with enough good sound editing. Although it felt that at the second half the movie started faltering due to excessive use of CGI and for over use of fighting sequences. I admit that it was way better than Batman v Superman & Suicide Squad and was a decent watch..My Rating : 3/5",6,1,3,18 November 2017
The Revenant," Outstanding work By DiCaprio-Alejandro
","I am a die-hard fan of Leonardo Dicaprio and was waiting long for this movie. The trailer had created strong hype for the movie. The movie is directed by 'Birdman' director Alejandro Inarritu who is known for magnificent direction. Leonardo was masterpiece as always and has not let down in this too. The story centers on Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who was left alone after bear attack and killed his son. Leo takes revenge to new style with its own survival style. This can be expected from Leo to be perfect in every condition and can do anything to draw into character. Leo's performance was outstanding and this time I hope Oscar gets to Leo. I go with 8/10 for this movie with Leo's extraordinary performance.",8,8,32,27 December 2015
Bridge of Spies," Not happy with 'Bridge of Spies'
","Collaboration of Tom hanks and great Director Steven Spielberg created a huge hype for this movie and me too was waiting for this movie. I spent 1.5$ for this movie at a cheap price of ticket and went to theatre to watch this. There was nothing wrong with this movie as everybody acted well and Spielberg as usual directed a well deserved Oscar winning Thriller film. However the plot was too slow and I was feeling sleepy while watching. The story involves only on one thing, exchange between countries which I felt too dumb. However critics liked it too much and predicts it for Oscar. I felt the movie very slow and boring and so I would go with 2.5/5 for this Spielberg directed flick.",5,2,5,26 December 2015
Dangal," The 'Dhaakad' movie of the year and best to end 2016.
","Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal is highly gripping and transitions smoothly from being a sports drama to an emotional one. The inspiring tale of Mahavir and his daughters is narrated in such a way that you laugh, cry and at some point even make sure you root for these characters right till the end.The father-daughter relationships between Geeta and Mahavir and Babita and Mahavir are explored extremely well emotionally. Also, how situations change the ties between the two sisters has been tapped into well.DANGAL is a flawless piece of work -- it's captivating, unpredictable, spellbinding, entertaining and never overstays its welcome. I rate 5/5 for 'Dangal' and Aamir's best performance since Lagaan.",10,9,16,25 December 2016
Dunkirk," Dunkirk surely will be remembered as one of the best war movies ever made.
","Although Dunkirk is technically a war film, its tone and style are those of a high-octane thriller. For his most serious-minded film to date, Christopher Nolan has employed all the weapons in his arsenal to craft something that, despite the Oscar-unfriendly July release date, will almost certainly be remembered when the Best Picture nominations are handed out.Dunkirk is also one of the best-scored films in recent memory, and Hans Zimmer's music plays as important a role as any character.Dunkirk satisfies as a brisk, gripping survival story. At only 107 minutes, it's also astonishingly short in an era when most movies needlessly run on long beyond the two-hour mark.Dunkirk is less of an epic than Interstellar or the Dark Knight movies – it's more tightly focused with no fat on the bones. The experience is primal yet satisfies intellectually and emotionally.My Rating : 4/5",8,3,10,26 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Magnificience by Marvel
","One of the most awaited movies of 2016, I watched this movie in Imax 3d for better experience and damn it was too awesome. The movie was full of superheroes including Black Panther and Spidey. With great plot line and fantastic effects, Civil War exceeded my expectation and didn't disappointed the way BvS did. Star studded movie with fantastic dialogues and actions make this movie an outstanding achievement for Marvels. The only thing missing in the movie was a villain. The movie shouldn't have been a part of Captain America Franchise, rather it should have been next chapter of Avengers considering the Superheroes featured in the movie. Nonetheless the movie was an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D. It is one of the best superheroes ever made by Marvel Studios.",8,7,13,10 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic movie as its name suggests.
","Directed by David Yates, the steady hand who'd steered Harry Potter films five to eight to popular and critical acclaim has done the same with the Fantastic Beasts. Though Fantastic Beasts is genealogically linked to Harry Potter, with nods and winks sprinkled like cake crumbs throughout the script, in practice there's no particular reason it had to be. The catastrophic timing and tone of Depp's pop-up gurn sends you out of Fantastic Beasts feeling more anxious about the franchise's stamina. Solidly extending the Harry Potter franchise to a different era with new characters, Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them starts slowly before finding its groove, delivering sufficient spectacle alongside a little emotion. I go with 4/5 for this beginner of a new potential franchise.",8,5,10,19 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," A Great Sequel
","'The Conjuring 2' is a perfect example of what more sequels should be. It is a perfectly executed horror sequel and Director James Wan effectively explores themes of vision,belief and faith. The family drama is very effective and Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are efficient in their roles. The film doesn't provide anything new in horror genre, but its set pieces are often impressive even though it rely on jump scares. 'The Conjuring 2' has good story & suspense to have appeal on all kinds of horror fans. Unlike Sinister 2, it sticks to the basics and efficiently delivers a solid horror film. I give 4/5 for this efficiently made horror sequel by James Wan.",8,5,12,12 June 2016
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," Movie succeeds in portraying Dhoni's story
","The film is a must watch for every cricket lover because it aptly tells the tale of an extraordinary man. The struggles are real and so is Sushant's acting. There isn't any shocking revelation, just inspiration and determination of a born talent who along with right people by his side, became the legendary captain.You have to give credit to Neeraj Pandey to keep it intriguing enough for you to get hooked throughout the three hours. Although it could have focused more on Dhoni's rise through the years instead of his personal life, but that doesn't let the movie down.Tight screenplay and good performances makes this one a good watch. I go with 3.5/5 for Dhoni's biopic directed by Neeraj Pandey.",7,0,1,3 October 2016
Inside Out," Another superhit by Pixar
","The #1 Animation studio 'Pixar' has done it again with its new movie 'Inside Out'. I liked this new concept of Pixar. Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust forms part of Life. The movie depicts emotions of a little girl. After Monster University, Inside out is too a bright and very delightable movie. It is a totally family movie. The movie teaches bonding, friendship, honesty. While entertaining, Inside out also teaches the meaning of Life. This movie definitely deserves an Oscar. Director Pete Doctor, who also directed Monster inc. and Up has again been successful in creating another classic from Pixar. Nothing comes better than this.",10,15,49,4 October 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War deserved to be the best and grand
","The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.",9,511,1175,25 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," With low expectations, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is amusing
","Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley— creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that's instantly unforgettable. It works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue. There were couple of Scenes which were unnecessary (like where Keira comes out of nowhere in the final scene). Otherwise, the movie was overall good but can't match the goodness of the First 2 Installments of the franchiseMy Rating : 3.5/5",7,9,18,29 May 2017
Sultan," One of the best movies of 2016 and probably for Salman too.
","There was a great hype for Sultan and it paid off. Sultan is a must watch and a totally family entertainer with lots of drama, emotion, romance and potential story content. The film is recommended not only to Salman Khan's fans but also to the family audience who were awaiting a family drama high on emotions, just like YRF style.This is indeed his crowning glory as a performer. His masterstroke is a scene where Sultan is looking at his body in the mirror when it's out of shape. Sultan was backed by superb acting from its starcast. One of the best movies watched in 2016 and is definitely on its path to break the records in Bollywood.",9,0,0,11 July 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," A decent watch but didn't match the expectation
","Unfortunately, Singer's latest and likely last trip to the X-Men universe has its sights set lower than the altering of history. The movie was not so good match compared to its predecessor Days of Future Past however the actors gets engaged themselves very well (including new starcast, Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan). All the thematic interest and character dimension that's defined the best of this series falls away for a conventional action display. The final battle sequel was not so convincing. Instead of using 3D graphics, Singer used wide shots for every X-man battle. Overall, the movie was not matching its previous films, however Singer manages to still make it watchable.",6,2,8,11 June 2016
Hidden Figures," 'Hidden Figures' is a crowd-pleaser with math and social appeal
","'Hidden Figures' is about the unheralded group of African-American women who crunched numbers for NASA in the early 1960s, when the space race against the Russians was heating up the Cold War. Skilled mathematicians all, they took the theoretical equations of the white male engineers and turned them into workable data, often on the fly and always subject to last-minute revisions. 'Hidden Figures' is a paean to black female nerds, a generally overlooked demographic in American media, and the film's major through-line is the heroine's gathering confidence as she struggles to be accepted by the white male analysts of the Space Task Group. Outstanding piece of work by Taraji Henson and Octavian Spencer justifying their performances as Black Negroes. The film's made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them. It deserves to make as much money as other big budget movies does. I do admit that it is one of the best films of 2016 and an Oscar Bait for outstanding performances. I go with 4.5/5 for Hidden Figures.",9,4,11,24 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars : The Last Jedi was more of a visual spectacle then narrative storyline.
","Although The Last Jedi meets a relatively high standard for franchise filmmaking, Johnson's effort is ultimately a minor disappointment. That doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Rather, despite the success of 'The Last Jedi' at supplying jaw-dropping visuals and a hall-of-fame-worthy lightsaber battle, audiences could presumably skip this film and with a low Rotten Tomatoes audience score, maybe something went wrong with the film. Never the less, The Last Jedi keeps on the saga of Star Wars Series and I can say, I am waiting for Episode IXMy Rating : 3/5",6,0,3,17 December 2017
Silence," Fascinating 'Silence' weighs faith and doubt
","Silence, Martin Scorsese's long-in-the-works adaptation of Shūsaku Endō's same-titled novel about a Jesuit priest searching for his former mentor in shogun-era Japan, is a truly religious piece of filmmaking, in that it looks for meaning in the contradictions and absurdities of faith, instead of its assurances. Filmed in Taiwan, it limits its view of 17th-century Japanese life to far-flung villages, tiny huts, and walled compounds, effectively alternating agoraphobic and claustrophobic perspectives. Like The Last Temptation of Christ, Silence clashes the spiritual and the practical, the human and the divine. With the dialogue concentrated on the mysteries of faith and how Rodrigues' rigid insistence on God's existence might be its own form of self-deluded arrogance. Silence is an esoteric undertaking that appeals more to the head than the heart. Some may find Silence's agonised self-flagellation far too ponderous and tortured. But Ferreira's appearance elevates the movie beyond matters of Christian doctrine to universal questions about how society should best confront all forms of intolerance. A slow-burn tale filled with beautiful imagery and understated performances, its elegance yields Scorsese's one of the most subtle efforts.My Rating :4/5",8,1,3,28 January 2017
Everest," Worth Watching 'Everest'
","The movie was well made and the Director made full justice to the movie. I found this movie very interesting mainly due to its focus on Rob Hall who never loses hopes and acts as a supporter to his mates. The Soundtrack and the Cinematography is really astonishing.It takes a lot of courage to climb Everest and for Mountain climbers, it is a dream. The story of Rob Hall and Scott Fischer and their teamwork was very good to reach to the top. Everest is a stunning looking film tp come from, feeling totally exhausted.Overall, Everest was exactly What I wanted. Everest may have a definite chance to make it into Oscars Nominations.",7,0,1,24 October 2015
La La Land," A lively supercut of Classic musicals
","It's been decades since a studio produced the kind of colorful musical fantasy that 'La La Land' so affectionately salutes, but writer-director Damien Chazelle is the guy who done the job perfectly. It is high-concept pastiche, filled with beautiful people, beautiful movement, and beautiful colors. At its best, 'La La Land' probes the irony of its existence, celebrating the greatness of a bygone era in the context of changing times. As a drama, this is less nourishing than the heritage it pays tribute to. But for Chazelle, the story is just a slight rib around which he builds a modern rhapsody. So in spite of its flaws, La La Land has moments of pleasure and satisfaction that are worth the price of admission. It's not that it's a bad movie; it's just not an outstanding entertainment, the way great movies (especially musicals) should be. I go with 3.5/5 for the musical drama by Damien Chazelle and I do think that it is the frontrunner for the Oscars.",6,2,4,21 January 2017
The King," Could have been better
","Timothy Chalamet gave an amazing performance portraying King Henry V, however the stretched duration and a slow paced conversation made this movie wanting less. Alongside Timothy, Joel Edgarton did well and the rest were just fitting enough.The fight scene at the near end of the movie was a good and structured altogether.I will go with 2.5/5 for 'The King'",5,4,9,5 November 2019
Don't Breathe," Thrilling horror flick with great villain and primal scares
","Alvarez's Don't Breathe is a command, both to the characters and to us. The housebound thriller tiptoes behind three robbers who break into a blind Army veteran's home and awaken the angry giant, who grabs a gun and a hammer and nails them inside. If he hears a footstep, he shoots. To survive, the characters get so quiet you can hear their heartbeats. Spooks don't get more primal.Don't Breathe is stripped down to the basics: a dark, hushed house, heavy with dread, and a thousand things that make us choke on a scream, from a furious Rottweiler to a bit of broken glass that turns Rocky's sneaker into a tap shoe. It's effective misery. After Evil Dead, Fede Alvarez impresses again with Don't Breathe. I would go with 4.5/5 for this impressive and terrific movie.",9,0,3,22 October 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Great Sequel and Star Lord is back with his Gang
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is a fun movie that reacquaints viewers with some of the most lovable characters ever to conquer the big screen. Pratt is engagingly rascally as Quill, and Saldana brings a sassy charisma to the no-nonsense Gamora.Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 delivers a similar experience to the one provided by its predecessor except with more of nearly everything. The blessing of a sequel is that it reunites viewers with familiar characters doing familiar things. But as might be expected, Baby Groot steals the film.To some degree, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a more offbeat film than the original, with better gags, better action, and more visual variety. It is one of the rare sequels which wins the heart of critics as well as Audiences.My Rating : 4.5/5",9,2,6,6 May 2017
Sausage Party," Seth Rogen serves up a filthy, funny 'Sausage Party'
","The makers of the movie proudly proclaim it the first R-rated computer-animated comedy and do not mistake 'Sausage Party' for a kids' film, regardless of how cute the advertising may appear. The film is not quite smart enough to overcome the clichÃ©s and stereotypes it acknowledges but can't entirely dismantle. A violent, sexy, crazy action about supermarket products that rebel against their human consumers, Sausage Party is one of the funniest and most deeply offensive movies of the year (it's obscenely funny). Seth Rogen proved that he is genius in adult comedy even in an animation. I go with 3.5/5 for 'Sausage Party'.",7,3,6,22 October 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Kong : Skull Island delivers the thrills
","'Kong: Skull Island' delivers a lot of thrills, but not much more than that. Working from a screenplay by Dan Gilroy ('Nightcrawler'), Derek Connolly ('Jurassic World') and Max Borenstein, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts ('The Kings of Summer') keeps things moving as he updates the old-fashioned adventure flick. Better yet (and unlike Jackson's film), the new movie understands the line between thrilling an audience and scaring it silly — between action-adventure awe and horror-movie gross-outs. The action and special effects are mostly first-rate and Vogt-Roberts maintains a vaguely satiric tone that sidesteps schlockiness. My Rating : 3.5/5",7,6,11,12 March 2017
Finding Dory," An Excellent sequel
","Finding Dory was undoubtedly the most awaited animated movie of the year as it returned to screen after 13 years of Finding Nemo. Getting back in the water 13 years after Finding Nemo, Finding Dory is a supremely delightful sequel. The film defines loss and separations but never make us bore at any point of time. Andre Stanton after his failure with John Carter, came back strongly for which he is best known (Animations). Finding Dory doesn't create new standards for Pixar line of movies but surely makes it worth watching for children as well as Adults. I enjoyed the movie very much and definitely it is one of the best movies of 2016. My overall rating for Finding Dory is 5/5. Highly Appreciable.",10,7,30,17 June 2016
Arrival," A heartwarming and emotional Sci-Fi Drama
","Scripted by Eric Heisserer based on Story of Your Life, by short-fiction writer Ted Chiang, Arrival is more or less the anti-Independence Day.Arrival boldly snubs the standard alien- invasion vernacular of contemporary movies to explore a mood and language of its own. It may be a touch too subdued for the mainstream, but the movie has brains and originality. Adams gives her best performance as a lonely woman who has to make a decision that will haunt her – though perhaps in a good way – for the rest of her life. Although Arrival is about first contact with extraterrestrials, it says more about the human experience than the creatures from another world. This is a singularly powerful movie, without question one of 2016's best. I go with 4.5/ 5 for Denis Villenueve's another Directorial masterpiece.",9,3,13,15 January 2017
Black Panther," Black Panther was a decent enough one
",Black Panther has its hits and miss but one can't deny it's visual spectacle and the characters development it had. Marvel Cinematic Universe succeeds again.,7,2,20,15 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Most disappointing movie of 2016
","BvS was one of the most anticipated movie of 2016 and every fan of both these Heroes were eagerly waiting for the clash between these Superheroes. Gorging on its own self- importance, Batman vs Superman was too loud and very unoriginal. The part played by Jesse Eisenberg of Lex Luthor was damn out of my head. Zack Snyder was inefficient in creating an atmosphere of Batman which was beautifully crafted by Nolan in his Dark Knight Trilogy. No major blockbusters in years have been such incoherently structured and was not able to clarify the story itself. The only thing appreciable in this $250 million dollar flick was its amazing Visual effects, otherwise I was waiting for this 2hr 31 mins movie to end in a flash. I would give 2/5 for this disappointing movie.",5,4,13,3 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A spectacular Comeback
","After almost 30 years Star Wars created hype among its fans and me too. I was very eagerly waiting for this movie to hit the screen. The Force awakens is in touch with force of action, adventure and fun. J.J Abrams had a perfect vision and there was no flaw in his direction. The terrific performance from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, the new Dark Lord with a terrible secret was gorgeously cruel, spiteful and capricious. I would say J.J Abrams gave a new breathe to Star Wars through 'Force Awakens'. It's a very good movie, I'd say, and should entertain audiences both deeply and casually. I was very impressed with visual effects and the overall story which continued from last Star wars episode. I would go with 4/5 for spectacular effort by J.J Abrams to bring in Star Wars back.",8,3,23,3 April 2016
Life," Life is a real treat for the audience.
","The film 'Life' is a test-tube baby, born from a blend of old-school monster-movie DNA and state-of-the-art digital effects. At times silly — yet surprisingly satisfying — this tale of sci-fi suspense and horror, set in the weightless environment of the International Space Station, gives Emmanuel Lubezki's vertiginous 'Gravity' cinematography a run for its money. While this ever-more-nerve-racking game of cat-and-mouse is well calibrated by director Daniel Espinosa, the film's real interest derives from the human interactions. Life never reaches greatness, but it's solidly good, from its earned scares to a spot-on ending.My Rating : 3.5/5",7,2,6,29 March 2017
Deadpool," Deadpool has Arrived !!
","The most anticipated movie of 2016 has arrived and I was much eager like the other audiences to go for it. I watched the movie in Imax as I had high hopes with it. The movie was astonishing with a tangled love story and a revenge saga. Deadpool was intense, funny, violent enough to make the audiences go for it. A well made story and good character played by Ryan Reynolds. Deadpool brings Reynolds back again after a series of failures. Action were timed very well and jokes in between the scenes were funny too. I got what I expected from Deadpool and Marvels continues to surprise with new projects. I go with 4/5 for 'Deadpool' and everyone should enjoy their Valentines Day watching 'DEADPOOL'.",8,3,12,14 February 2016
Da 5 Bloods," An urgent and important film on racism and War Veterans.
","Da 5 Bloods is an urgent film on racism that's always been a major problem. The fight for America yet there wasn't no equality even after the justice.The performances from Delroy Lindo and Clark Peters were outstanding along with the cinematography. The film stretches a bit in its runtime of 2hr 35 mins, but did succeeds in showing the ugly reality behind the beautiful display.A simultaneous play between the war moments and the current situation of the veterans, Spike Lee does a great work in transitioning the emotions.
My Rating : 3.5/5",7,42,108,12 June 2020
Incredibles 2," Sequel worth waiting for
","Though it would be unrealistic to expect 'Incredibles 2' to have quite the genre-busting surprise of the original, it is as good as it can be without that shock of the new - delivering comedy, adventure and all too human moments with a generous hand. 'Incredibles 2' takes advantage of the advances in computer animation since the first film came out, and the family's adventures look snappier and super-exciting, but it is the echoes of the original (including a dynamic new score by the returning Michael Giacchino) that hook us. It surely exceeded the expectations.",8,28,81,13 June 2018
Warcraft," Another poor work inspired by popular game.
","The epic battle at the center of 'Warcraft' isn't the clash between humans and orcs. That's just what takes up roughly two hours of screen time. The true conflict comes from filmmakers trying to tell a story with soul and struggling against the inherent ridiculousness of the movie. Despite the noble effort of director Duncan Jones, who helmed the lower- budget sci-fi wonders 'Moon' and 'Source Code' , Warcraft just couldn't save itself from its unconventional and poor story tale.With its meticulously detailed realms built out primarily on soundstages and enhanced via CGI during extensive post-production, 'Warcraft' aims for fresh and eye-popping and yet ends up shopworn and rather tacky. I am totally disappointed by Duncan Jones 'Warcraft'. I would give 1.5/5 for this heartless movie without any soul.",3,72,144,12 June 2016
The Martian," Superb Sci-fi by Ridley Scott
","First of all, I am a big fan of Sci-fi movies and I was eagerly waiting for this space flick to be released. The movie was equally good as the Visual effects. Scott has done a fantastic direction at this age. The star cast including Damon himself has given an outstanding performance. The movie was outstanding, clever screenplay and was surprisingly funny. The movie was as good as Interstellar and Gravity. This Sci-fi Space drama by Scott has made options for Oscars Jury nominations. The screenplay was adapted in a way it should be. The Performance by Matt Damon as well as Chiwetel Ejiofor were very crucial in the movie. Scott has made total justice to the film.",9,1,39,4 October 2015
