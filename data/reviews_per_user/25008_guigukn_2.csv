Come and See," You feel like you're there
","I could never give a movie a 10. That's why I am giving this one a 9. 'Idi i smotri' is probably the best war movie ever.Forget about Hollywood; if you want to find something real, shocking and disturbing, look for this movie. Everyone involved in war is a victim of fate. The world, as the movie shows, do not care about people.While Flyora is running away, he (and we) keeps thinking what he is running away from.And another good thing about this movie is the acting. The boy is amazing. Uncanny. So is the girl, I almost cried when he left her behind. The directing is very interesting, the camera runs after the characters through the Russian fields and doesn't care if they die or not: we're still watching.After you watch the movie, you won't understand war. You will understand victims.",10,1,1,3 January 2010
Avatar," Please, get this thing off the top 250!
","OK, this movie certainly has got a lot of wonderful visuals, the characters are impressive (because they look real, not because of the script), that is true.BUT the story is so weak!Guy goes to some planet, people tell him to betrayal the natives, but, in the end, he can't do it. Add a ridiculous 'let's save the planet' appeal and that's it.This movie is a blockbuster without spirit. Or do you think that Avatar is better than Sunset Boulevard, Dr.Strangelove and Apocalypse Now?I know the top 250 isn't very reliable, but let's respect the true masterpieces and put Avatar on it's place. Cameron did a good job, but nothing revolutionary.",7,4,8,3 January 2010
