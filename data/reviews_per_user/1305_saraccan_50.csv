Ford v Ferrari," Not a losing formula
","It looks and sounds great. Nice story with some exaggerated details but overall an enjoyable movie. Will it be the car movie that changed car movies forever? No. The underdog achieving what seemed impossible at the begging, is hardly an innovative formula. It won't be the last movie that does this because we all like it.Shelby and Ford team up to beat the 'unbeatable' Ferrari in 1966.",7,1,3,18 March 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Near perfect
",I love it when i have high expectations for a film and it totally delivers. It feels super satisfying. I kinda didn't want it to end. This thing is a great piece of art. Everything about its visuals is perfect and it sounds spectacular. It has as great a story as you can get in a sci-fi film. Casting choices are super on point. There were some very captivating scenes that took my breath away.This is the sequal to the 1982's Blade Runner. We follow a Blade Runner named K on his quest to find answers about a miracle baby.,9,3,9,13 August 2018
First Man," It's good, but won't blow your mind.
","It felt pretty authentic and accurate. Even though it's a pretty known story, seeing some of the things from astronauts' perspective was cool. Visually it was really good and some of the intense scenes sounded amazing. I'm not sure if it could be done any better but still it's not a movie that'll blow your mind.Story of Neil Armstrong, first man to step on our Moon.",7,0,1,24 October 2018
Captain Phillips," Seen this movie so many times.
",The only thing that stood out to me in this movie was absolutely nothing. It was just a mediocre 'wow Americans came and saved the day' type of movie. I can't really stand these super patriotic American movies anymore. Yeah i get it that its a true story but its the delivery of it that makes it unlikeable for me. I think I would've been for more impressed with it 20 years ago.Its the story of a cargo ship's captain and his crew who for some reason decide to fight against Somalian pirates with aks.,6,1,2,13 July 2018
The Sound of Music," Very joyful but not cheesy so it works
","Personally I'm not so crazy about musicals but this one I actually enjoyed. I thought that all the singing and dancing stuff is really carefully placed so it never took me out from the story, instead it did the opposite. It's about a troublemaker nun who becomes a governess for seven children and accidentally falls in love with their super rich widowed father.",7,2,2,25 March 2018
War Dogs," Interesting story with a touch of Hollywood
",A very entertaining Wolf of Wall Street like movie with a weapon selling twist. I realized some of the things were Hollywoodized in order to make the movie less 'just making deals over the phone'; after reading up on the real life events that the movie is inspired from. Jonah Hill does a great job. I like that guy.Two childhood friends buy weapons from around the world and sell them to the US army for profit.,8,0,0,17 September 2019
Deepwater Horizon," Fast paced and exciting
",It is based on a true story but Mark Wahlberg and his wife look nothing like the people in real life which was kinda funny though it doesn't really matter. It is sad to watch how greed can kill innocent people. This movie executed the story properly. Deepwater Horizon is an oil drilling rig that is pushed into its limits by BP people and eventually it breaks and explodes.,7,0,2,21 September 2018
Hereditary," Too many dots to connect
","It starts out pretty slow and it takes a while to connect all the things they throw at you. It will eventually make sense, though wasnt super satisfying to me. The relatively unknown cast of actors all do a decent job i think. There are no real jumpscares but the well designed moments of tension make it worthwhile.After her very secretive mother dies, a woman and her family's life start to get weird.",7,0,3,11 June 2018
A Star Is Born," Feeble and boring
","Every aspect of this movie was just mediocre. Acting, directing, character development, dialogue, music... I found myself sighing in frustration multiple times. Fans of Lady Gaga might enjoy it, I dunno.Famous singer guy falls in love with a girl and helps her become a famous singer herself but he also loves alcohol.",5,6,12,31 October 2018
Us," Plotless and pointless
",It starts out as a mediocre home invasion movie then turns into a plotless and pointless movie. The pathetic and predictable ending did not add or serve anything. Lupita Nyong'o is a very fine actress but her performance was unfortunately wasted.A family is attacked by their exact look alikes in their summer house. They have some sort of meaningless world takeover plans.,5,0,1,3 June 2019
The Irishman," Not a great in this genre
","It's hard not to draw comparisons with other movies when the director himself already made some of the finest in this genre. There are good moments in it but when analysed as a whole I think it's far from great.When I looked at the cast, my immediate reaction was that, it's like watching the All-Star weekend in NBA. Except it's with hall-of-famer players who are already retired and way beyond their peak so it's just for fun and all the money goes to a charity or something. De Niro looks super awkward throughout the movie due to his body condition and the young make up doesn't help a whole lot. Al Pacino completely overacts in a bunch of scenes that it almost felt distracting. The story and characters felt unbalanced at times. Story points and characters that initially felt important got no screen time or got too much when not needed. I'm not a person who complains about lengths of movies but I have to say that this movie had a good 30-40 mins that was not essential.Story of a mob hitman who allegedly took part in the disappearance of a truck union president.",7,1,3,18 December 2019
Brokeback Mountain," Touching romance movie regardless of your orientation
","Its a nice and touching romance movie regardless of your sexual orientation. (Unless you have homophobia) Great acting by both dudes and really good cinematography.This love story between two guys suppose to span over 20 years and I'm definitly not a make-up expert but I thought the make-up game was pretty weak in terms of helping you where you are in the timeline. It was impossible to tell whether it was a week later or 4 years later. But overall it was an enjoyable ride. Ride lolTwo cowboys fall for each other and have to live out a secretive love affair while juggling wives, kids and work.",7,1,2,2 April 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," It's a bad children's movie
","Very childish humor, boring fighting scenes and an uninteresting plot. Another very unmemorable superhero movie for me. There's absolutely nothing different about this than the other ones.Thor is trying to save his planet Asgard while trying really hard to be funny.",4,168,278,28 July 2019
Milk," Could have been more
","It has all the ingredients to make a great movie and it delivers most of it to a certain extent. I wasn't very informed about Harvey Milk and the movement he led so it was very informative for me in that regards. The performances and production were top notch but given how dramatic this story was I think it could've been even more powerful.The story of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected as an offical in the US.",7,0,1,12 November 2018
Sleepy Hollow," Burton's style fits well
","I was not familiar with this classic story before so I can only speak for the movie. I really like movies where an eccentric person goes to a different place to solve a mystery. The Tim Burtonness is very evident obviously. Though I'm not a huge fan of him, his style worked well within this comical/horror type of film.A detective is sent to a town called Sleepy Hollow to find out about a killer who decapitates people.",7,0,0,5 January 2019
Malcolm X," A good and thorough biopic
","Malcolm X is definitely an important person in American history for the things he stood for and the things he had achieved. So I think it is an important film for whoever is interested in his life and/or that era in the US history. It doesn't try to make things nice and interesting or likable, it just tells his story as is. And that for me is what a good biopic should do. Denzel is Denzel.Biography of the controversial Malcolm X who goes to prison for living a gangster life, but learns about the religion Islam there. He then becomes a full on Muslim and goes on a mission to spread the word of Allah while being a voice for 'some' black Americans with his extreme views.",7,1,2,14 July 2019
Doctor Strange," Your average superhero movie
","It felt a little different at the beginning showing him as a normal human being but then it's just all of the same. It follows the same predictable patterns as any other superhero movie so nothing new there. Looks and sounds amazing but that is expected. There were so many times these bad guys could've easily killed this Doctor guy but didn't that it started to get really annoying.A successful doctor has a car accident and gets his hands paralyzed. So he goes to magic school, becomes a superhero and saves the entire world.",6,1,2,17 September 2018
Lion," Powerful and emotional
",The story itself is already strong enough and when you add some great acting and nice pacing it becomes a very nice movie.The true story of a young Indian boy who gets lost and ends up in an orphanage. He gets adopted by an Australian couple but wants to find his real mom and brother.,8,0,0,27 July 2019
Bird Box," Stupidity
","There's just so much stupidity in this thing that I'm not even gonna bother listing them. This is one of those movies you would normally run into on television at 2 am if it wasn't for the cast. It can't go anywhere beyond being a mediocre meme.People kill themselves when they see these invisible monsters, so they must live with blindfolds.",4,0,5,31 December 2018
Baby Driver," Its enjoyable because Edgar Wright did it
","Another great example by Edgar Wright on how incredible editing and music editing can make an actually pretty straightforward movie interesting.Perfect song choices, really good sound design as always, not a very unique story which also gets kinda cheesy sometimes and hollywood car-chase sequences we are all far too familiar with. Its about a driver whose name is 'Baby' that drives criminals to safety. Of course things get out of hand.",7,0,2,2 June 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Nostalgic but also fresh
","I personally grew up watching the cartoon and Spiderman was the only superhero I liked. I was never a fan of any of the live action superhero movies so this was a nice surprise. It felt a lot more like a modern take of the cartoon instead of actual people wearing ridiculous costumes. That said, 13-14 year old me would probably be raving about this film but now it just felt like a good animation.A middle school kid in Brooklyn gets bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes the new Spiderman in town while Kingpin is messing with parallel universes.",7,2,10,17 December 2018
Dangal," Simple Little Sports Movie
","Its full of all the good cliches like, training so hard that they almost give up, making the impossible come back and who could forget, remembering that crucial training in the final moments of the game. But still it wasnt that bad. Its the true story of an ex-champion father turning his two daughters into pro wrestlers against all odds.",6,4,7,12 April 2018
Dreamgirls," Couldn't take it seriously
","I couldnt take most of this movie seriously because of the boring songs and super predictable characters. 'hit' songs that they were releasing which made them rich and famous were just mehhh imo. also at times it felt like i was watching 'trapped in the closet'three singer friends who try to fight their way up in the music industry have to struggle with bad managers, copyright issues and betrayals.",5,1,5,23 April 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Not revolutionary but entertaining
","Even though there are still many obnoxious details that bother me a lot like; people refusing to kill one another just so they can say one more glorious line, the whole time traveling thing that makes the entire story meaningless or the overly predictable character realizations of giving up hope but then suddenly changing their minds; I have to admit it was entertaining. What I also have to admit is that its not easy to make a 3-hour-action-movie not feel like a 3-hour-action-movie with correctly balanced audio-visual dynamics.Remaining Avengers have to travel in time and try to fix what they couldn't prevent in the past.",7,2,9,26 April 2019
No Country for Old Men," Amazing filmmaking
",Outstanding performances from every department. But the two things that stood out to me the most were set design and sound. Attention to detail was remarkable on these sets. And I really feel like not using music is a very underrated decision in filmmaking. Just having sound made things much more intense. Javier Bardem is super sick.A man finds a bag of money in the middle of the desert where a drug deal went wrong. A bad guy is after him.,10,2,4,10 December 2018
Revolutionary Road," Realistic and Good
",Really good acting by both actors. I liked the small twists and turns thay they had to make you guess how the story is gonna unfold. I think how much one can enjoy this movie depends on how much they can relate to their situation. It's about young married American couple with two kids who all of a sudden decide to move to Paris for a chance of a fresh start.,7,0,0,22 July 2018
The Little Mermaid," Entertaining
","A good example for how simplicity is often an under utilized tool for movies. Nothing about this animation is mind blowing for me personally but every aspect is well done with one thing in mind; tell the story in a simple, entertaining and effective way.A 16 year old mermaid's love story with a human.",7,1,1,10 December 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Just as soulless and predictable as others but more compact
","If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of 'wait, where are we?' or 'wait, why are they fighting again?'. This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.",6,197,473,11 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Uneventful and uninteresting
","When a well-known director has access to super high budgets and all A-list actors, you kinda want him to deliver something and not tell a story from a very specific era of a neighborhood which most of the world either don't know or care about. If you do know or care, it is still told in a very boring and uneventful way that you just watch it for the high quality acting performances.We follow the lives of few people in 1960's pre-manson family murders.",6,3,6,8 April 2020
Beasts of No Nation," Raw and Powerful
",One of the better war movies i saw lately. Really cool cinematography that enhances the beauty of Africa thats being taken for granted. It does a really good job immersing you into the war and make you care about the characters.Its about a kid who loses his family to war then is forced to join the mercenaries. We watch his transformation from an innocent child into a soldier as he questions his own actions and trying to survive.,8,4,4,6 May 2018
Aladdin," Better than most live-action remakes
","I started watching this movie with zero expectations because of the bad track record of live-action remakes of animation/cartoon films and to be honest there were a lot of positives in it. Songs were pretty nice and catchy, the acting was good, the genie animations were really impressive, the overall mix of music and sound design was excellent in the chaotic chase scenes. However it did get a little cheesy for my taste towards the end but it is a Disney film so...Aladdin the street thief falls in love with Princess Jasmine and he will require a wish-granting genie's help in order to win her heart.",7,0,4,29 May 2019
The Lion King," Another unnecessary remake
",It's one thing to keep making these unnecessary remakes that literally nobody asked for; but it's a whole different thing to make them incredibly disrespectful to the original and just overall very bad. It feels super disconnected and none of the characters are likable in any way.A very bad remake of the classic Lion King that looks nice.,4,2,3,16 November 2019
Stardust," Without the cast; what do you have?
","This is one of those movies that doesn't really have anything that stand out except for its brilliant cast. So most of the remaining elements like; story, characters, dialogue and visuals are all below or just average. It's not completely unwatchable, it just doesn't do anything new or interesting.A guy is in love with a girl he can't have so he is trying to impress her by bringing her a beautiful girl. He later falls in love with that girl.",6,1,5,28 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Hardly any dull moment and excellent use of sound
",Really really cool movie. I liked it a lot. The whole movie is all about sound so i might be a bit bias because of that.Its pacing is really well done and theres hardly any dull moment in the entire movie. Very good acting overall. Excellent use of sound and i liked the creature sounds too. Kinda reminded me of clickers from the last of us but bigger. I just had few problems for when it spoonfeeds you for certain things. Definitely worth watching at the movies. Its about a family trying to survive in a world which is overrun by sound sensitive creatures.,8,2,4,13 April 2018
Coco," Not extraordinary but worthwhile
",It looks and sounds perfect as one wouldn't expect anything less from a pixar animation. The story is not that interesting nor emotional but it definetly felt fresh because of their nice take on 'The Day of the Dead' and its meaning. One thing that I super liked was how guitar playing was 100% accurate. I think that happens very rare in animated stuff.The story of Miguel who wants to become a musician in a family which despise music.,7,0,1,31 August 2018
1917," A must watch
","A lot of the time WW1 is overshadowed by WW2 simply because everything was bigger, better, stronger, faster, deadlier etc... But its easy to forget that when WW1 happened, the world did not see a massive war for about 100 years since the Napoleonic Wars and the French Revolution. So with that in mind, it was a bigger shock to the world how destructive this war was with all the new technology.This movie's attention to detail is just pure insanity. Starting from the first moment up until the end, you can analyze every different sequence and talk about how they got everything right and how the war shaped up in the way that it did to create those moments in the film. It's just phenomenal. The trench warfare, the muddiness, the dirt, the unknownness of the enemy's whereabouts and their plans, the brand new weapons, dead bodies everywhere piled up on top of each other, and much more. I think it is must watch for everyone regardless of your interest in war movies.And to top all of this, the technical aspects of the film is also near perfect in my opinion. Incredible cinematography, an excellent use of one-shot filming, amazing sound design, amazing production design, great acting. This movie is the full package.Two soldiers are assigned to deliver a message to stop a regiment walking into their death.",10,1,1,18 May 2020
Midsommar," Unique but not quite up there
",It was definitely a unique experience and it stayed with me for a couple of days. It had really nice cinematography and visual effects and some decent acting. I can't say it was the most original or the bizarre movie I've ever seen. I also felt like it had the same problem Hereditary had about its overall storytelling; a little bit all over the place with underdeveloped characters.Bunch of college friends go to a small village in Sweden to have fun/research. But things take on a twisted turn.,7,0,1,22 October 2019
Super 8," Can't offer something new
",It has a nice nostalgic feeling because of the similar movies we've all seen in the past. But it can't really go beyond that. It just does what they did and that's about it. It would be very enjoyable if I was 13 and never seen the classics that this movie drew its inspiration from.Weird things start to happen in a town after a group of kids witness a train accident.,6,1,2,17 September 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," A good depiction that builds up nicely
",I enjoyed how it started out with not telling us much about whats known about him and instead we slowly gather the info alongside the main character. So it feels kinda satisfying at the end of the movie when they eventually complete the mission.It does a very good job with building up the story and connecting it to the final event which is a really cool home operation.A good depiction of the real events that led to the killing of Usama Bin Laden.,8,0,2,23 May 2018
Crazy Heart," It's a pretty chill movie but not something that will stay with you for long
","Great acting by pretty much everyone. Also if you like country music for some reason, that would be a bonus I guess.It's about an old, washed up country singer who is way past his prime, trying to make something good out of his life again.",6,0,1,1 April 2018
Joker," Phoenix's version of a film done before
","There's no real need to explain how excellent Joaquin Phoenix's acting was. I also really liked the cinematography and the use of that specific yellow color throughout the movie. However, this was far from being the origin story of a one-of-a-kind mastermind psychopath criminal. The events that led up to him losing faith in society and should have turned him into Joker were kind of weak. There were other examples of this same exact plot without the superhero universe elements; 'Falling Down (1993)' or a more recent and cringy version of that 'God Bless America (2011)' had main characters that were pushed to their limit that eventually turned them into violent serial killers. But Joker is not a mere serial killer. And for me that's where the movie failed to portray his real mental state which made him the actual Joker that we came to know.Origin story of Arthur Fleck aka Joker.",7,3,6,18 November 2019
Parasite," An excellent movie but...
","Instead of talking about the individual positive aspects of this movie, I'm just gonna say that this an excellent movie and will point out a few things that I personally did not enjoy. The main one being; all of the events feeling ridiculously coincidental. Another one is; -still under the coincidentiality umbrella but with a slight twist- a common issue that I tend to realize in above-average-budgeted international movies. They sometimes want to tell too many things when they didn't really need to, which ends up muddying up the overall balance of the main story.An unemployed family of 4 infiltrate into a rich family's household.",8,1,5,2 December 2019
Marriage Story," Quality acting and good story
","It's safe to say that acting is the department that outshines every other one in this movie. I especially enjoyed Laura Dern's performance the most. Even though it doesn't have the most original story, it manages to stay interesting throughout and keep a nice balance between funny moments and divorcing family drama.A married couple with a young son is going through the tough process of getting divorced while trying to juggle their daily lives.",8,11,16,21 February 2020
La Vie En Rose," Sometimes boring but makes you watch it
",Amazing acting by Marion Cotillard. I wasnt familiar with Edith Piaf's story before so it was cool to learn about her life. Turns out it was a sad and eventful one.The movie itself is actually sometimes boring but there are also things that happen that makes you want to see till the end. Its a biographical movie about the French singer Edith Piaf. Even if you dont know her name you'll recognise her songs and voice.,7,0,1,23 May 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo's friend steals the show
","It's one of those movies where there are many topics and genres tackled all at once but it manages to stay balanced and entertaining. The comedy is obviously the main driver but there are lots of other positives too. Two things that stood out to me were, a kid's struggle to belong something and a mother's struggle to do the right things for her family. Oddly enough one of the side characters completely steals the spotlight.Jojo, a ten-year-old 'nazi', is going through a rough time in his life as the ww2 is coming to an end.",7,0,0,3 March 2020
Cloud Atlas," Nothing complex but leaves you wanting more
","Saw this in the cinema when it first came out 8 years ago with very high expectations and I thought it was great because it had loads of things I enjoyed in movies at the time. But in the back of my mind I knew I didn't fully understand it so I always wanted to watch it again someday. So upon finishing the movie, gathering my thoughts around it, reading some of the other interviews and forums, I realized that there is no incredibly deep meaning or an indecipherable plot. It's just six separate short stories from different times and places that have small connections in various ways. You watch each of them as they come and enjoy a 3-hour-adventure. All the stories are engaging with nice character developments and thought-provoking plots. One thing I really enjoyed about this movie is that, it leaves you wanting more somehow even though its 3 hours.6 short stories stretching from 1800s to 2100s.",7,0,1,7 January 2020
Annihilation," I feel sad giving a 7 for this movie
",There were times I felt like I was watching one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen and other times it felt like I'm watching garbage.Jennifer Leigh's character annoyed the crap out of me. It seemed like she didn't even wanna be in the movie. There were so many weird plot holes that it made me think 'did they even watch the movie after finished working on it?'. The whole movie just felt like it was rushed and not written carefully.But.. The world was very pretty when they entered 'the shimmer' and had that cool 'zone' feeling from the stalker. I really liked the progressiveness of the world as they got closer to the lighthouse and the ultimate face-off was neat. I kinda wanted the movie to be longer and wanted to spend more time in that environment. It's about 5 scientist entering a zone called 'the shimmer' which alters the plantation and all living life. One of them had her husband just came back from there in a dying state so she wants to learn what happens in there.,7,3,7,16 April 2018
Happy Feet," Could've been better but good
","Nice animation for its time. An all-star cast of voice actors. It kinda drags on for a bit too long but its fine. I liked how humans werent cgi, that was different.Its about a penguin that can not sing but tap dance and his quest to find out whats been happening to their food.",7,1,1,26 April 2018
The Nice Guys," Not a good comedy or action or thriller
","Its just your average cop-buddies poor comedy/meaningless action movie. They threw in a little girl to make things a little different but i didn't like her character that much. While watching it, I thought this would be a nice bad tv show that would get canceled after 1 season. Turns out that was the original idea lol.It's about 2 private investigators trying to solve an uninteresting case of people dying over a film.",5,0,1,15 April 2018
Sully," Should've been a documentary
","It is truly a remarkable achievement to land this giant metal object on a river, that weighs around 40 tons with 150 or so people on board, all surviving with minor injuries. We need to let that sink in for a moment. What doesn't really work here is that, this story deserves to be a documentary more than a film. Ultimately it feels stretched out in most moments and the final scene feels extremely anti climatic. Because well, that's what happened in real life. 'You're guilty. Oops sorry we made a mistake in the simulation, you're not guilty'The true story of a commercial airplane pilot landing a plane on a river and saving lots of people's lives then being questioned about whether he did the right thing or not.",7,0,0,10 March 2020
