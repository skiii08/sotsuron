The Blair Witch Project," The biggest marketing scam in movie history. Only people who get scared by OTHER people being scared will like this crap.
","This was a marketing scam that worked... plain and simple. And if you allow me the lengthy explanation, I hope you'll see legitamite reasons why I think it is an utter waste of time. If you don't want to read and either love BWP or instead want something that doesn't suck, go watch 'The Last Broadcast'. It's similar, came first, is better acted, and has an actual ending that makes sense.The BWP began with a huge ad campaign, in the form of allegedly 'true' documents and paranoia propaganda that took major advantage of the internet community. It got people out in droves to see what this thing really was. And what it was was an hour and a half of kids with a camera, walking in circles through the woods, working themselves into a paranoid frenzy while building to a climax (spoiler next) that literally delivers nothing.(Spoiler end.) The premise, and what the online campaign hinted as being true, is this: A small town legend, the Blair Witch, is terrorizing a town and abducting children. Three stupid teens go into the woods armed with a camera and try to film / find evidence of this, and are never heard from again. Their videotape surfaces, and what is on it is mysterious.Now here's the literal truth of what happened: The two creators of this 'film' built a long, slow consumer awareness program by leaking supposedly legitamite details of the Blair Witch incidents, like fictitous police reports and interviews. Over several months, people were hearing about the Blair Witch case with the overwhelming sense that it was all real. Then the 'film' was released in theaters and included what was supposedly the non-fiction video documentary of three kids who disappeared while looking in those woods. The lines of fantasy and reality had been effectively blurred, and people came out in droves to see what was really going on.
Seeing as how the actors in the 'film' were on Jay Leno that very weekend, I was readily aware that it wasn't real. But I went anyway, out of curiosity. I thoroughly, thoroughly despised what I saw. I didn't have high hopes, since I hadn't yet read the much more entertaining web site stuff. But I was so angry that at the end of the 'film', I loudly said 'Bulls***! I want my 7 bucks back!' And was met with rousing applause, and yes, a few boos.I'm a patient man, and very tolerant. I've seen subtitled, three hour long black and white foreign films. Ever heard of the 50 hour 'Three Kingdoms' chinese hitorical series? Yeah, I sat through that. I liked Titanic. And I've seen horror movies including Dawn of the Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, the Sixth Sense, Nosferatu, the black and white Frankenstein and Draculas, and even comparably modern junk like the Scream trilogy. And aside from Scream 3, I loved all of it. But with the Blair Witch Project, I was simply offended. I fell victim to a marketing scam, and the fact that some people still call it genius burns me to this day.This is why. The 'movie', viewed as itself, is utter garbage. For the fans out there, what are you gauging the movie by? The acting? The plot? The PACING!? Three kids whine, nitpick, argue, and cry throughout the vast majority of it all. There's a scene when the most annoying character, the woman (she's that hideous nose / eye creature you see on the box and probably think is the Blair Witch) breaks down in hysterical, overacted tears simply because the team has made a circle and is crossing the same log they've already crossed. And if you don't mind, here's a spoiler so be prepared: There is no Blair Witch. You see nothing on camera. You hear some noises, see strange clues like wooden sticks. And at the end, during a scene that should have been halfway through the 'movie', you see a creepy house with some blood on it. Then the movie ends. Period. I do not exagerrate. And I don't HAVE to see something to enjoy it. Jeez, 1997's 'Contact' was great, for example. But when you build up a movie like this, can you not put SOMETHING up there to qualify my time?(spoiler done) But you see, we're supposed to buy all that because it's a masterful example of anticipation, suspense, and power of suggestion over visuals, harkening back to the old days when stuff didn't have to be flashy and obvious to be frightening. Well, no, sorry. There is nothing frightening about kids in a tent, crying and shivering, and saying they've heard things. (Poss. Spoiler:) It's a ghost story with no payoff. They, and we, see and hear nothing to suggest anything more horrible than common woodland noises at night. (Spoiler end) The kids work themselves up like schoolchildren and start freaking out so badly that they frighten themselves beyond belief, at nothing. That isn't scary, suspenseful, or playing on my natural fears. If I got afraid just because I saw other people terrified of whatever it was that they were imagining, I would have been a basket case in grade school. And even if scared people WERE enough to scare me, it's still a wash because the majority of the 'movie' takes place in the daytime, where nothing of importance happens. I go on vacations to other countries and tape less daytime commonalities than these idiots. And Yeah, if a ten minute argument over someone losing the map is scary, then I guess I've just been spoiled by GOOD films like Psycho and The Thing.And these kids are just horrible to begin with. They're the most annoying bunch I've ever heard, and I was hoping halfway through that the girl would just die to move the plot. But instead, we get lots of arguing, lots of wandering, lots of hysteria, and a few hints of plot like finding an unidentified bloody cloth one morning.Here, in its simplicity, is why this 'movie' does not deliver. 1: If it's viewed on its own, without external knowledge of promotional material, the movie is baseless, without support, and with no closure or explanation. Without background information it's a pointless mess, so we must judge it by the material that got us interested in the first place- and that material was far more interesting. 2: If viewed as REAL, one must ignore the fact that it's well known as one of the most fiercely debated and famous films ever. But since the hook was that it might BE real, it's a waste. 3: If one watches it as a MOVIE to be entertained by, it's a dud due to horrible and annoying performances, no pacing or twists, and worst of all, no payoff. It winds up being an amateur film without music, lighting, or a good script.All I can say is that the fake case history that the creators came up with to sell this crap WAS intruiging, and was more interesting than the 'film' by leaps and bounds. My cousin struggled to defend his like of the 'movie' until finally deciding on a reason that satisfied him, and became the only explanation I could possibly buy: That Blair Witch was worth watching simply as a side bonus to the crafted material that he was more interested in. I don't want to insult the people who did like the 'film', but if you did, that must mean it scared you. Well once you get over the fear, I ask you to watch it again a few times. WHAT scared you? What mood were you in, to where you were actually frightened? Was it simply not knowing what the kids would find? (Spoiler alert) Well now that you know you never see the supposed Witch or anything that is NOT possibly manmade, is it still scary? (Spoiler over).  I wasn't scared at all because I knew it was fictitous, and went anyway just to see what was supposedly so good. I was bitterly disappointed to see Blair Witch for what it was: Two guys who took advantage of the gullibility of the public, tempted them, played to their fear, and failed to deliver on a mental, intellectual, or even visual level. The only 'genius' of the Blair Witch Project is, simply, how well it was used to scam the public. And I truly believe that the only people scared by this 'film' are people like the kids IN it: People who are scared because it seems like they should be, without even any evidence to support the fear. Sure, you may watch the BWP thinking it'll be scary, and nervous in anticipation of what you might see. But by the end, what did you ACTUALLY see? Don't you feel cheated?
Well if not, what scared you is called mass hysteria, and it worked decades ago with War of the Worlds...Which wasn't even an intentional scam. Oh yeah, it was free too.",1,41,80,1 December 2003
The Ring," Two hours of baloney that overbuilds to....nothing
","Spoiler free, no specific actions or character details givenThe Ring will entertain you fully and you will have no unanswered questions if you accept anything that is thrown at you and never stop to ponder even the simplest details.Okay, there's a videotape that kills people after they watch it. A little girl is involved. We know that, but there's unanswered questions. Well, the movie does give you answers, which are satisfying as long as you don't ask a single follow-up question. If I want to know why some angry kid went on a shooting spree at school, the local news will give me the answers why. Instead, 'The Ring' IS that troubled kid. For any question I ask, be it 'how did this happen?' or 'why?', the answer is a basic, uninspired 'uhh, because'. He may even give me an answer that he thinks makes perfect sense such as 'I want to kill people so I got a gun and did'. And of course, if that's all you ever heard of the case, and no other explanation were given for the series of questions that would follow, you'd be completely satisfied, right? Well, not for most people, but then here you have the Ring which pulls that crap with almost every important question you'd have. Yes, you learn how this video kills people, as demonstrated in one of the two 'big reveals' of the film that is so powerful and scary that I think 'Oh,' and shrug. The other big reveal a is red herring near the end that's just a bit of dialog - basically 'Uh oh, what we thought was the case really isn't, and now it's actually worse!' The film ruins this too, giving no explanation, reasoning or motive whatsoever for what was just explained. Savin' it for the sequel I guess.The end made me realize that, more than anything, I could have summed up this film in one sentence and saved myself a lot of time and letdown. Yes there's a little girl, a well, and a mysterious video that kills people. But why, how, and what do they all have to do with each other? Well, the big 'why' is revealed without much more than 'well, uh, because'. 'How' isn't answered at all- not in any logical, explainable way unless you just accept the very silly and ostensibly MEGA CHILLING super payoff that I think I was supposed to have seen. Of course, after seeing what I saw, I'd still like to know 'how' that event, upon which this movie's very premise hangs, is possible. No explanation attempted. You just buy it, 'cuz it makes the story super neato, you know?As for 'what do they all have to do with each other?' Well, the movie goes on for an eternity trying to make this the big mystery. In fact, if I gave you the answers to what happens, then went into detail of how this is visually represented, you'd probably think there'd have to be SOMETHING more going on, and probably say 'oh, that's what happens? How? Why? (there's those troublesome words again).Nope, there ain't much of a story here. It's a concept that, when stripped down, comes down to a special effect, one that has different motives than what we were led to believe. Huh, pretty powerful I guess, or so I'm supposed to think based on the Sixth Sense 'slowly zoom in on the character as they reveal the 'big twist'' shot. I mean, sure I know that the movie's last ten minutes are supposed to be pretty profound and I'm not supposed to question it. I suppose it's just the natural learner in me that says 'Gee, now I know the big secret. The video kills people by doing what I just saw. What again is the motive for this, how again does it work through a plastic videotape, and why does it take 100 minutes of buildup for the basic or nonexistent answers I received? Huh, what? Distract me with the end credits and release a couple answers on a special edition DVD released in time for the sequel? Sure, sounds great.To make matters worse, no one in the movie is appealing. The protagonist is a pest and a (expletive). In addition to other annoyances, she's rude enough to walk up to someone's horse, let it out of its cage, and watch its resultant gory death as its little girl owner cries in horror, all without a word of apology or explanation. I can also ponder credibility leaps like how she can be holding a dessicated corpse while up to her waist in putrid water and not think too much of it.Of course I'll get a personal message ridiculing my stupidity. How dare I try to find logic in a film that, as a horror film, shouldn't apply to logic? It's simple. I got the film, got the message. But you know, after two hours and all that praise, I expected a better ending than that, or at least some explanation beyond 'it's just magical. Accept it.' Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a horror film too, but Leatherface didn't kill people by popping out of a tree and making his chainsaw hover at his victims. If a movie isn't going to bother being realistic, it should at least give a better explanation than this film did.But hey, this movie is the perfect conformist's exercise. Everyone else loves it, so surely I must be stupid if I don't. I guess I need to just watch it and accept it, not asking any questions or pointing out flaws in the story since that's clearly what everyone else has done. Then once I'm done with that I can go and love Blair Witch instead of actually wondering what it was on the screen that I was supposed to be terrified of.",3,1,2,26 March 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Fairly satisfying conclusion, but there are disappointments, and it still doesn't make total sense.
","(No plot spoilers.)Like most others, I loved the Matrix. And like a lot of others, I was underwhelmed with Reloaded. But for Revolutions, I came out pretty happy. You do see an end, and there are some surprises. But I was still left with important unanswered questions, and that's kind of inexcusable for the finale in a 7 hour trilogy.What Matrix Revolutions brings to the table is a giant war. The machines have reached Zion, it's the last stand for the humans, and Neo must make a choice that could bring him face-to face with the machine city and a possible end to the war.After a slow but interesting start, we see the war begin. It's a special effects frenzy, similar to that of Lord of the Rings or the arena battle at the end of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. The war scene makes up the entire middle third of the film, and for what it's supposed to display, it does it well enough. Aside from legions of the 'squiddies', or Sentinels, there are a couple new machines that are fascinating to watch: Giant, drilling creatures that instill an appropriate feeling of dread and power. On the human side, there's a small army of walking robots similar to the Power Loader machines in 'Aliens', but with extensive firepower. This results in long sequences of shooting, attacking, and screaming, which is going to uninspire fans of the Matrix's deeper plot but which is appropriate for a war setting.The only problem is that a lot of this is pretty standard stuff. Grizzled military commanders will be hard on young soldiers, who find their courage and prove their true worth. People will be injured and give important information in a speech just before dying. The heroes will be doubted but still do just enough to prove their doubters wrong.But then one of the bigger overall problems is that the main characters are sort of lost amongst the backdrop of war. Morpheus has maybe 30 lines, becoming a shadow of the informative, enigmatic hero he was in the original. This time, he's reduced mainly to someone who hopes Neo saves the world while himself taking orders as co-captain of Niobe's ship.  Trinity has little else to do either besides tag along with Neo or do a couple arbitrary flips and kicks.And then there's actually a few more specific problems. A very important scene with Neo and Trinity occurs within the movie's last half hour, and although it's dramatic it too is cliche. What's worse, after the scene is over the plot just moves right along as if it didn't matter, without it even being mentioned again. Given the importance of the scene, and the fact that it's occuring between two characters who we've known for years, it feels like it's over way too quickly.  That's just a letdown. The same thing occurs with the appearance if the Architect, the builder of the Matrix. He has a brief scene in this film, and has almost nothing important or informative to say whatsoever. Again, it seems like a waste, especially due to the fact that he SHOULD have interesting things to say by the point at which he appears in the film.Finally there's the film's conclusion, which I won't reveal. I will say that it was one of the less predictable of possible outcomes. But it too is a letdown in a couple ways: First, it leaves quite a few important questions unanswered, and could be construed as leaving the door open for a sequel, but also could be seen as the absolute finish. But that's the problem. If it's the end, I want my questions answered, I want to know the hows and whys. The final minutes left me wanting, left me thinking that there were several possible conclusions to the story that aren't there on film. And in my opinion, that shouldn't happen at the end of something this large and built up to.But what really matters is whether I enjoyed the film. Although the review doesn't sound like I did, that's actually not the case. I went in planning to know what I wanted to know, and while I didn't learn everything I still did spend a couple fun hours watching an action movie. The acting, score, and effects were pretty much on par with the other films so there's nothing lost there, but it's the details that hurt. Where the original Matrix was a smart script that mostly made sense, this one was more or less action with an incomplete plot wrapup. But it still did have several good scenes, and many of the special effects were great (I loved machine city, with its vast fields and burned skies). I also truly loved the music for the final fight, and during the end credits.Still, while Reloaded had a standout chase scene as well as some great kung fu like the 100 Smith brawl, this one had neither. There is a climactic and important Neo/Smith battle at the end of Revolutions, but it too is different: In demonstrating the epic and dramatic repercussions of this battle, it consists mostly of giant (albeit very cool) effects, lots of flying, and very little actual close combat. This makes Revolutions unfortunately boil down to a plot far less interesting and focused than the original Matrix, as well as far, far less kung fu. There's also much less complicated story development than in Reloaded, but that's probably a good thing. That doesn't leave Revolutions with much to digest however, aside from a long war scene and a plot wrapup that doesn't explain much more than the most immediate questions. Even the actual 'ending' after the big fight is pretty brief, which then is followed by the closing scenes that make things confusing again.In the end, Revolutions is still fun to watch, and I still like it 2nd of the trilogy. It's just not as tight and fun as the original, and it kind of deflated after the information overload of Reloaded. Not a bad movie at all, it just falls a little short of the great climax worthy of what the Matrix began years ago. Not in style or flash, but in making everything fit.  I'd still recommend it to those who saw the first two, just don't expect that big, revelatory plot scene where everything make sense - that's still missing.",8,62,103,7 April 2004
28 Days Later...," Maybe not as scary as you've heard, but certainly a serious, greatly made study of humanity with definite horror moments.
","I LOVED this film. When I left the theater, I felt utter satisfaction and deep despair at the same time. That means the movie definitely worked.For starters, please don't automatically label it a horror film. It isn't a slasher akin to Friday the 13th or a disturbing no-sleep fest like the Exorcist was at one time, either. What it IS is a moving human drama, very effectively capturing the despair and isolation of a world after apocalyptic disease. This is its strongest point and mood, but at the same time there are several seat-jumping moments, and there are, for lack of a better word, 'monsters' that are around many corners. I don't anticipate many will walk away from 28 days later thinking 'wow, I was shaking in fear the whole time!', nor do I imagine people thinking 'What a body count! All that blood and guts!'  Truth is, there are some moments of both, but they are frosting on a story that leaves you with more of a feeling of 'Wow. Loved ones can be lost, times can be impossibly desolate, people can be impossibly cruel. I'm glad to be alive, and I'm glad I live in a better world'.The setting of the film is London, almost entirely free of human life due to a rapidly spread virus. The infected, the 'monsters' of the film, are regular human beings who no longer function like regular people but instead are fast, violent, and primal, living only to eat and attack whatever they see. The virus spread wildly due to its high communicability. It transfers through blood contact, saliva, and even through the eyes. It is such that 99% of London was wiped out in 28 days, at the end of which the main character wakes up in a hospital with no idea what has happened. No one knows the answer to a more haunting question either...Is life normal outside a possibly quarantined London, or was the whole world infected?The movie slowly lets us see what happens and slowly suggests answers to those questions. It unfolds not like a harsh killfest, but like poetry. We are with the main character, Jim, as he wakes up, having no idea where to go or where anyone is. He wanders the starkly empty streets, alone, hoping to find someone who can help,and somewhere to go. He encounters the infected, and he meets some people...All with their own view of their situation and ways of dealing with it. Some live to survive. Some live in despair. Some live with hope.It's situations like this that are touching. Thanks in part to a wonderful score, the story gives us many moments to take in. Jim heads out to see if his parents are okay. Another man puts out a beacon of Christmas lights on his empty apartment in hopes of finding other survivors. We watch in sympathy as one person remembers a simple, pointless breakfast with the family he/she will never see again. We quietly smile in hope as someone plows their way through a dangerous roadblock through sheer determination for a better place. We close our eyes in defeat as another person who has so much hope and even more to live for still succumbs to the disease due to the most chance of situations. Moments like these- sadness, warmth, hope, despair- are rife in this film, and it is through such moments that it truly feels like a realistic account of what could honestly happen. It is a very human story, and I say that because although there are scenes of violence and death, this overcomes the boundary of 'horror flick' by focusing most on the people, their plight, and the moments that matter to them. The acting is thoroughly good as well, with everyone asking realistic questions and doing things that appeal to us in some way or another. There are some characters near the end for example who have their own idea of survival and what it takes, and even though their ideas are horrible we can still understand why they have them. My only gripe with the film is minor. I enjoyed it all the way, and was satisfied by the last few frames. But the actual climactic event, which takes place in a mansion, was a little frenzied. I don't mind violence or anything, and there are sudden scenes in the rest of the film where things get wild, but the final major event is very harsh and sustained. It makes sense, it's just not as reserved as most of the rest of the film so be forewarned.In all, I found this movie entirely good. Don't expect the bloodiest or scariest movie ever, but be content with some of both inside a much more mature and emotional film, and you should be happy. I definitely was, and found it one of the most thought-provoking and moving dramas, or horror films, in a long time.",10,0,1,1 December 2003
Rocky," The first, the best, the sweetest and most honest
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Those of you who have been desensitized by Rocky's sequels may well have forgotten just how good the original is. (Spoiler later but I'll warn you).The original Rocky is, surprisingly, NOT about boxing. It is about a man who has dreams, has aspirations, but just can't make everything work. He lives in a squalid apartment, he barely makes enough to support himself, and people everywhere shun him, disregard his hopes and accomplishments, and call him a bum. His locker at the gym is unceremoniously given to someone viewed to have more talent, and a young neighborhood girl tells him to shove it after he tries his best to give her honest and heartfelt advice about staying away from the bad crowd.It's not about boxing. Rocky Balboa is an everyman, a simple man who does his best to earn a living and takes cash from any source willing to give it to him. He wants a better life, he wants to be somebody, but the chance just isn't there.The film, written by Stallone after being inspired by a similar story of a boxer, is sweet and low key. Its Philadelphia setting is very natural and doesn't have the glamour of typical Hollywood, and all performers do a fine job portraying characters that, in their own ways, are living lives of unfulfilled dreams and quiet desperation. Rocky has his eyes on the girl at the local pet store who's so shy that she's called retarded. Her brother, Rocky's only friend, is a boozehound. His boss is a cheap loan shark. And at the gym, the source of his only real interest, the owner seems to hate him.Rocky's real chance comes when the well-known and flamboyant boxing champ sends him an offer to fight. What's sad about this is that while Rocky has genuine hope to utilize this chance and actually gain some self-respect and approval, in reality the champ just chose Rocky because he looked like a good candidate to boost his own image. This is all too apparent in one of the film's most symbolic scenes, when Rocky visits the empty auditorium where the fight will take place. The promoter is there, and Rocky points out that the giant poster hanging from the rafters features incorrect colors on Rocky's portrait. The promoter looks at it, shrugs, and explains that it doesn't matter, 'you'll give us a good show'.This scene is quietly elegant, and encapsulates the feel of the movie as a whole. Whereas the other films in the series are more about Rocky's famous career, this one just lets us look at this poor guy who's just trying to BE somebody. And it's fitting that, by the end, (SPOILER ALERT: The film concludes with Rocky putting up one hell of a fight...And losing. But it doesn't matter. Rocky achieved what mattered most to him. He became somebody, he proved himself to the world, the champ, and even himself, and won the love of someone who really meant something to him. (END OF SPOILER)The reason this film succeeds is because it isn't done with a heavy hand. It looks at Rocky sensitively, and we're along with him and can't help rooting for the poor guy. He's a good person, he deserves to make it. And as another reviewer pointed out, the soft directing is aided by the famous musical score, which envelopes us into all the emotions that these people are experiencing.  It's a very complete package, and although easily dismissable as a 'rags - to riches' story, it's much more than that. It's all about someone trying to preserve their self esteem, trying to do what's right, and trying to simply win acceptance. Although I do still love the following four films, the original is where it's at. It's a sweet, honest drama about a man overcoming his obstacles, and it's great.",10,0,0,12 November 2003
Titanic," Why I like this film, as a longtime student of the actual Titanic
","A fellow reviewer wrote earlier that Titanic is among his or her favorite films, and sometimes people laugh. I myself laugh, not at the movie but at that statement. I echo what the reviewer said, which is that at the time, almost everyone loved the movie or at least recognized good stuff about it. It was critically acclaimed, made more money than any movie in history, and received uncountable awards including the most Oscars ever, tied with Ben Hur at 11 wins.Now, I shake my head when I see that Titanic currently has a rating of about 6.7.  Jeez people, view a movie for how it is rather than how oversaturated it got!!!And that's the problem. Titanic WAS a very good movie- and since I was interested in the actual ship a decade before the movie was made, hopefully I can tell you why I support it. The technical achievements alone were grand, the scale of the movie was epic and moving, and to James Cameron's credit, it was almost 100% accurate to the many different details of the Titanic legend. Of course, to accept this one has to ignore the fact that the main characters are fictitious amalgams of real Titanic passengers.Those two characters are Jack Dawson and Rose Buttaker, played of course by the leads Dicaprio and Winslet. Their awkward meeting and subsequent falling in love is played against the oncoming disaster, which, as everyone should know, happened 4 days into the ship's first voyage. At 11:40pm on April 14, 1912, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank 2 and a half hours later.Now for the movie itself. The acting, although passionate, is goofy at times due to a script that was much maligned as being stereotypical and bland. I don't hate it that much, it doesn't sound too far off from what people are like when they're stupid in love. However, my problem arises here: Rose seems to be witty and independent, yet she becomes a doe-eyed child when she falls for Jack, who seems to know the answer to everything and even needs to heroically command Rose to 'get back' when the iceberg comes by. More and more their relationship turns from possible to downright one-dimensional, as Jack becomes a grand hero and Rose becomes a helpless damsel. Granted, each character has scenes where they betray that limit (Rose in fact saves Jack's life at one point), but that's an exception to the rule. Another problem is that, quite simply, a relationship between a first class woman and third class male is possible, although entirely improbable. People just weren't that open minded in 1912, although for this movie it doesn't seem too severely hard to swallow.That having been said, I don't have much of a problem with the rest of the movie. This is because it stays admirably close to the facts, and pays insane amounts of detail to each scene. Director Cameron was in fact often joked about due to his fierce, almost anal commitment to the details. The ship looks real, because most of it is. The band played until the very end, which they really did. The ship indeed broke in half at the 2nd funnel, and if you look close, the iceberg scrape actually dots and dents the ship's hull instead of tearing a solid gash, as it actually did in real life. Although the 1958 Titanic film 'A Night to Remember' had no fictitous characters and sticks religiously close to what really happened, James Cameron's Titanic is technically the most accurate, especially due to the breaking of the ship which wasn't proven until after the former film was made. A couple technical slips do get by, such as a terrible blue screen effect seen when the drunken baker is standing atop the risen stern (just before the final sinking). There's a shot of victims rolling down the upright stern section near the end, and we can see one of them bounce off of the cylindrical capstans, obviously a soft prop. But hey, these are just gaffes in an otherwise very good technical achievement.In closing, I still like this movie, as I did when it first came out (though not nearly as much now, after a dozen viewings). It has a lot of emotional impact, it stays very, very close to the actual facts, and it can even be argued that although fictional, Jack and Rose are just an example of what really happened to many of the couples on the real ship when it went down. I don't think a better movie about the Titanic can be made, although the aforementioned 'Night to Remember' is also extremely good and in many ways just like James Cameron's film. If you see Titanic, the film, for what it tried to achieve, you can see that it is in fact a well made and successful film. I know it's hard to get past the negativity that its oversaturation caused, but at its heart I think it is an excellent movie.",10,6,12,29 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Wonderful finale, sweeping emotions and action
","Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like 'gets everything right', and 'I enjoyed every minute of it', but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving 'Into the West' is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends.  The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored. If for some reason you've chosen my review out of the many available, let me at the very least leave you with this, and it will hopefully help you to decide to see it if you haven't yet:  As the finale of a trilogy, this is the masterstroke that ties everything together and is successful on a multitude of levels. It's action packed and stirringly heartfelt at the same time. And finally, from someone who loves the books, I can say that although some omissions were made, the story doesn't falter as a result and the film as a whole was handled in about the most graceful, pleasing way I can imagine. It is, quite honestly, a cinematic masterpiece and a major accomplishment. I left teary eyed, happy for having been thrilled for more than 3 hours, and also quite sad that I don't have another of these films to look forward to.",10,7,11,21 January 2004
The Wizard of Oz," Just not my type of movie, I guess.
","Ok. I readily admit that Wizard of Oz is a classic. It's full of style, wonder, and originality. But I just don't like it. I didn't care much for it when I saw it as a kid, I didn't like it as an adult, and I certainly don't like it now that I've seen it 100 times thanks to my 3 year old nephew.I don't mind musicals most of the time. One of my favorite animated films, The Prince of Egypt, is as full of songs as any similar Disney cartoon. But the songs in that film were well done in my opinion. They had sweep when they needed to be, hit emotional waves when it seemed appropriate. In the Wizard of Oz, everyone sings pretty much all the time, and it's one of those films where absurd words and terms are inserted simply to keep the rhymes going, even if the line doesn't make any sense. Imagine a Doctor Suess book being sung in chorus. Sure it rhymes, half of the words are made up. There's a good deal of that in Wizard.And you better like 'We're off to see the Wizard', the song you've heard since the beginning of time and already are tired of. You'll hear it in this movie about half a dozen times, without any significant changes or necessity. I know that movies like this are supposed to this way, it just drives one nuts.The acting is typical of hammy 50s productions, just a decade older. Everyone enunciates very properly and/or hammily, and look to be on the verge of bursting into song, which often is the case. That's pretty much how it stays once Dorothy gets to Oz, which is after the boring first fifteen minutes of the film.I know that people will seethe when they read this review. I'm sorry, I just really don't like this movie. As a musical, and a whimsical kids' movie, it succeeds at what it attempts to be. But I just can't understand why this is considered a film benchmark, when there are plenty of more interesting and less annoying musicals to be enjoyed. Granted, 'Over the Rainbow' is a good song, and my favorite was one sung by the coroner of Oz (whose tune lasts about 4 verses). But the rest? Man...to me, it's just utter tedium. The movie may be good for kids, but I just can't understand why any adult would care to sit through it. I'm obviously in the minority, so what can I say. I just wanted to voice my opinion, which is that Wizard of Oz is vastly overrated. Read the book instead, or watch something better from the era such as Casablanca.",6,7,23,22 March 2004
