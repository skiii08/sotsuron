The Blair Witch Project," $22.000???
","Congratulations. Somebody finally made a movie more boring than Walter Hills 'Last Man Standing'. This is the biggest disappointment of the year. Everybody is talking budget, they only spend $22.000. Well, what the hell did they spend all that money on? There is nothing on the screen. Did they eat really well? Were they picked up in limos every day? This is the biggest mystery of this film, what the hell did they do with the $22.000??? I canÂ´t wait to see the sequel. 'Now with 40% more pitch black photo'.Don't see it, don't rent it. I you like films, then you wont like Blair Witch Project.",1,2,5,22 December 1999
The 13th Warrior," Best adventure flick since Highlander
","The 13th Warrior have been a long time in the making. But now that it is here, it is a joy to see. If you like, swords and horses, play warhammer or any fantasy RPG or if you are just waiting for The Fellowship of the Rings, then 13th warrior is defiently worth watching. I really enjoyed it. Even though it shows that a lot of matrial is missing (Dare we hope for a directors cut on DVD???) People accuse it for lack of plot, but that is not true, it is there, a lot of it has just been cut out, which of course hurts the film, but these kind of films are few and far between, so whenever one comes your way, you should see it. For all its problems, the film is really good. The sword fights are great and the armours and settings are so great that you lose youself completely in this universe. A great film.",8,0,0,13 January 2000
