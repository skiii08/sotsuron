Alien 3," not the best, but the scariest
","I think that Alien 3 is the scariest of all the Alien movies. The aliens themselves are not as good as in the 2nd movie (if you show the entire creature in anything, it tends to look fairly silly), but they were good nonetheless. What made this film the scariest of the 4 Alien movies was right at the end (*SPOILER*) when you realise that the other Bishop would kill his own race for an Alien. Bishop II gave me nightmares for some time. The 2nd Alien movie was the best, but this one is definitely worth watching.",7,0,3,18 January 2000
