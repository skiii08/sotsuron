The Lobster," Absurdism in society.
","With scenes as beautiful as dramatic, intelligent touches and good (rare) acting quality, The Lobster is a different movie, extravagant and yes, very rare.
Single men and women must meet in a hotel and get a partner for the next few days, otherwise they will be turned into animals and abandoned. That premise alone sounds peculiar enough, but watching the movie is even more so. Although it is categorized as a comedy and romance, I must admit that I didn't find room within any of those categories. I didn't consider this movie funny at any time, on the contrary, it is disturbing. Don't consider it a romance either, because it's more of a criticism of that romance. This is where the film shines by showing us a palpable message about 'love and society'. A look through a different lens that takes us into a world as pessimistic as it is optimistic, a world without contradictions where everything is perfect, and yet, wrong; a false world.It's worth seeing, even if it feels strange and somewhat tight, and fails miserably in its touches of ''comedy and romance''. It's worth just because of how... rare it is.",7,0,0,7 July 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Cyberpunk done to perfection.
","Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the original film of 1982, following an alternative story but related to the first.To make it simple and direct: Blade Runner 2049 is excellent. A sequel worthy of its titles, simply great. The scenes are extremely special and full of visual wonders, a spectacle for the eyes with excellent performances by the whole cast, full of tense moments and a solid and followable script.Despite the bad fame between the movies and their aftermath, 2049 is an exception to the rule. It breaks any expectation and I'm sure it satisfies with passion the fans who longed for a second part. The film is special to admire, full of emotional scenes and with subliminal messages to different ideas or philosophies, once again, returning to the intelligent evidence or hidden messages with double meaning based on ideas greater than those we perceive in a moment. The shots in this movie plus the beauty of his fantastic and futuristic soundtrack (an epic that does honor to the first) we get moments extremely enjoyable and rich to admire, Gosling makes an excellent raw and rude performance of his main character, showing us a new protagonist damaged from the center of his feelings but with hope in his eyes. The relationship between the characters makes us feel the sadness of this dystopic future full of plastic and neon, where we no longer distinguish from the real motives and false pleasures.A phenomenal film, despite the fact that its narrative seems to have tried to cover many themes or extra characters at once and is left without enough time to explain them all, this also opens doors to possible future projects of new sequels. A fantastic film that is impossible to miss for fans of cyberpunk and science fiction.",10,1,16,5 June 2019
Deepwater Horizon," Disaster movie done right
","I do not know exactly what we like so much about disaster movies, maybe the action or the effects, but with this movie there is not only a combination to pass the time watching some amazing special effects, but it is also a provocative film that moves our feelings; with very emotional scenes and an incredible direction that manages to portray events with as much intensity as possible. The performances are on point, completely great and fervent, Mark and Kurt do an incredible job as the tough guys but genuinely worried about the lives of their co-workers. The cinematography of the film is something special, the scenes are incredible to admire with fantastic special effects, the fire is extremely realistic and gives an excellent sensation of panic and heat, that plus the incredible sound design make Deepwater Horizon a movie very intense and provocative.I am surprised by the fact not only that the film itself is a great achievement for effects, but also how the performances and the script manage to create a quite realistic and palpable scenario in which we can feel the terror of seeing the fire engulf the entire platform. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,1 June 2019
It," Not so much a scary movie, but more of suspense and interesting scenes.
","To clarify, I haven't read the book and I haven't seen the original movie from years ago. So I entered this movie with an open mind and ready to see what it was like.Starting with the positive points; it has good scenes, interesting and creative, with excellent dynamics among the actors who are able to present the natural qualities of children their age, some are funny, others are shy, others worry a lot, and others are just annoying. Which is good, giving an excellent touch of fluidity and tangibility to the characters. Cinematography does a good job of building the scene, showing each of the environments and creating fascinating locations for each shot that occurs and creating good tension for the viewer. As another review of the film said very well, It feels at times, like a collection of scenes rather than a complete horror movie. The movie entertains, although its construction is very, very slow. With two hours of duration, it's not until halfway through the movie that things get tense, and when they get tense, they don't get so tense.This is where I think the movie fails. It's not scary, really not. Despite having good actors and special effects, the film completely destroys the sense of fear by giving a strange combination of gore and comedy; presenting itself more like a grotesque play than a disturbing one. And oh god, it makes a lot of use of jumpscares, which is perfect for stressing, but not entertaining. In itself, the movie lacks a truly frightening atmosphere, and feels more like an adventure movie than a horror movie, failing quite a bit there.In short, it's an entertaining, decent movie, but I don't consider it a good horror movie. It's probably good for young people who want to be introduced to the genre, but after that, it's more of an adventure comedy.",6,0,0,10 August 2019
Hereditary," Dramatic terror with a special touch.
","A family begins to suffer from strange events inside its home after the death of the family's matrarch, which ends up provoking terrifying phenomena within the family.Hereditary is a special horror movie, very different with a distinctive combination of forces, which combines the emotion of pain of loss with the terror of the unknown and unexpected, showing us truly raw and disturbing images. The advancement of the film keeps up with our expectations, however, through the middle of the film, a totally devastating event (which most of us probably don't expect) occurs, provoking a complete turnaround of the argument and creating a terrible and depressive atmosphere full of dark and pagan touches.A supernatural story taken to the big screen with a distinctive direction and characterization, the characters each bring a gram to the strange narrative of the story, showing us a rather unique and sad perspective for a movie of this kind. A good horror movie with excellent touches no doubt, even so I think it could be shortened a bit, suffering from a bit of overexposure and dramatization, however, I think that's the reason for the film, to be long to penetrate well into our skins, although even so, the duration of two hours was a bit frustrating, but despite that, it was a special experience.",7,0,2,5 June 2019
Train to Busan," Finally, a terrific zombie movie.
","In the last few years, especially about a decade ago, we were extremely flooded with zombie movies, both horror, comedy and even drama, however, a large majority of these ended up being mediocre movies and completely forgettable. Years later, in the middle of 2016, the fantastic South Korean filmmakers decide to change that and give us an entertaining, brilliant and original zombie story.Filled with fantastic scenes, fast-paced action and fabulous performances, Train To Busan is a great zombie movie full of emotional moments and well-built suspense, set in what is a modern city and at the same time, the claustrophobic atmosphere of a train. The film is made to entertain, from beginning to end does not bore, finally a film of this type that is really worthwhile to pass the time. Good cinematography, great scenes, an intelligent script, complex characters, fantastic effects and sentimental scenes make of this movie a redemption for the genre, and as an extra, one more proof of the ability of South Koreans to make incredible movies.",7,0,1,24 June 2019
Memento," A unique story from an even more unique point of view.
","We may not be able to understand from the beginning, maybe we will do it at the end, and maybe we have to see it a second time to fully understand it. But if anything we will understand easily is:But what a great drama.Nolan completely glorifies his name with this film as one of the most innovative and brilliant directors of the 21st century. A unique drama that we will probably have to wait a long time to feel the sensation of incognito and suspense with a new movie, but if anything I can to assure, this is one of those films that put our brains to work hard, however, do not make us feel silly, it does not bore us, it does not tell us in our faces '' You can not understand. '' This film challenges us to follow in detail a complex theme where it follows an incomparable time line like never before, the main character suffers from a strange illness that prevents him from being able to remember things in the short term, all this happens after a serious accident where he loses everything, now, seeks the redemption and vengeance he so desires to find the culprit of his misfortunes.Here, the way we are told the story is simply incredible. With the main theme in mind being the '' Amnesia ''. Nolan makes us feel as if we ourselves were suffering from this disease, with each clue and every sequence, it seems that we forget something, it seems that it is us who try to seek revenge, it is something incredible, where it puts us inside the flesh of someone with a terrible curse, forget everything and remember nothing. This work is simply incredible, tells so epic and brilliant a story that must be told by parts and memories, a story that we should not understand from the beginning, to feel the true pleasure of the enigmatic.",9,1,2,7 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Visually wonderful and better than expected.
","I was usually already adapted to the fact that the Star Wars saga would continue to deliver decent quality, or even mediocre at certain points, however, I didn't expect such high quality delivery with this movie.Rogue One is a fantastic movie from the Star Wars saga, delivering an incredible visual quality full of fantastic effects and a wonderful cinematography. As for the graphic-visual design of the film, I can say with certainty that it is of a superior quality to other deliveries, just incredible, both in its presentation and execution. But the movie doesn't stop there.It is an entertaining movie, full of tense moments of action and exciting scenes. Finally we have memorable characters that fill us with fantastic memories, along with a simple story but well made, this installment indeed manages to exceed the expectations and it gives a new hope to the saga.",8,3,4,22 June 2019
The Babadook," The psychological horror of sadness.
","Babadook is a special film that takes seriousness with great complexity and stylism, presenting a spooky story through psychological terror (the ability to frighten us with our imagination rather than with the presentation of the monster, villain or enemy) and it does not fail in the unparalleled narrative quality and the sad, decaying and lost atmosphere it holds. I understand the critical reception of the film, after all it is a different shot in an oversaturated genre.The Babadook is a psychological horror movie, full of unexplained mystery and scenes designed to keep us tense and stressed by the possibility of something. The suspense is real and remains constant throughout the film, being the main premise of this the ability we have to imagine things that are not there, in turn, it presents a story based on the pain of the loss of a loved one, combining the difficulties of fear of the unknown with the horror of eternal goodbye.With excellent performances and an atmosphere built to give us a feeling of maximum discomfort, The Babadook manages to penetrate strongly between our nerves, especially if we investigate its surface and go deep into its depth. A good horror movie that plays with our minds and depicts us a story through a different and well narrated structure.",8,2,3,24 June 2019
The Irishman," A resurgence of the highest caliber.
","The return of the movies about the mafia, directed by the great Scorsese, and starring the greatest trio of actors who could have set foot on such an iconic genre that Scorsese has managed to master in an impressive way.There is no need to write paragraphs and paragraphs about the genius of the film, about the already indisputable quality of direction that Scorsese has forged over the years and the magnificent acting ability of the unforgettable cast. The Irishman is a love letter to the fans of the genre and loyal fans of Scorsese, it is a biographical style film that manages to capture the unquestionable ability of direction and creation of Martin. It offers a credible, palpable and even humane story about the underworld of the mafia and Hoffa.Movies that have simply helped forge the ability of cinema to tell stories, movies like these are those that manage to stay in the mind of the viewer for hours. Presenting an extensive and complex story full of characters and events that manage to intertwine to create an image of the ambiguous morality of the life of crime and its related. Once again, we are presented with a film created with great attention to detail in every aspect. Simply another great work by Martin to enjoy with great passion.",8,2,6,27 November 2019
Aquaman," A decent and fun DC movie, but still not achieving excellent quality.
","Despite the harsh criticisms that the cinematic universe of DC has received over the last few years, they have managed to remain stable and again and again have tried to meet the expectations of their audience, yet again and again failed; now, as for Aquaman, it seems to be a green light to a ray of hope for the future of these movies, because they finally offer us something that is both entertaining and decent, without mediocrity or folly.Aquaman is an entertaining movie, full of intense moments designed to satisfy our eyes through a pretty cinematography and a great choreography, this but a soundtrack quite attractive that manages to help the scenes are quite satisfactory to our senses, well, at least the action scenes.Leaving the action on one side, I think that the rest of the film during the moments when nobody is fighting, are then, boring, full of dialogues and performances that sincerely do not contribute anything to the importance we have on these characters. His narrative is full of the cliches expected in any film, however it is something forgivable, but reaches a point where we simply want a break from observing the same thing over and over again during these dialoguing scenes. I think this is the weak point of the film, in contrast to the very good action it has, it lacks a strong narrative or structure in which we can be interested enough about the story of the film, the motives of the characters or the characters themselves.In spite of this, it is finally a healthy and well-received attempt in the action genre, apart from a good movement on the part of DC. Although the movie was entertaining, the reality is that it was simply 'good', nothing outstanding or anything excellent, but even so, it is worth having a look at it if someone is interested in the DC film universe, this is probably their best movie.",6,0,1,15 June 2019
Silent Hill," Probably the best videogame adaptation ever.
","In the cinema, there is this close curse of creating works based on videogames in the worst possible way; adaptations that end up falling into a pit of mediocrity and oblivion both by fans without knowledge about the videogame itself and by fans from Cerrino who were looking for a faithful adaptation. It's something that's been going on for years in Hollywood and it doesn't seem to stop. However, sometimes we are blessed with a gift totally different from the formula that finally works. Silent Hill is a horror movie based on the popular and unique video game, creating what is one of the best adaptations in the world of cinema.Silent Hill can be a bit confusing for those who haven't played video games; it can be enigmatic, different and disturbing, but this is one of the characteristics I can respect. You can see that the director had a great passion for the creation of this film, getting to put a multitude of succulent references within the film and following a perfect archetype to successfully create the feeling that Silent Hill causes, even going so far as to use much of the original OST of the video game. It is an entertaining film that manages to satisfy in the art of the pertubacion, with excellent overwhelming scenes that can traumatize to young spectators. This is a horror movie that builds itself through the visual experience and the disturbing environment, achieving a unique and fantastic scenography like no other. The actors deliver an unexpected quality in this type of film, presenting themselves as excellent protagonists with sympathetic motivations. The film is not perfect, may have overexposed and boring scenes, may even feel slightly long at times, but even so it is a solid horror film that manages to create a unique atmosphere not found in other films of the same genre.",8,2,2,28 October 2019
Ready Player One," A well done homage to the pop culture.
","Ready Player One is the return of Spielberg with his work as director, and does not disappoint with his new delivery. A quite entertaining film with moments dedicated especially to pop culture, especially gamer culture, I think that many characters, especially young people, will especially enjoy this work for its enormous amount of direct and indirect references to this genre.The movie is designed to entertain pleasantly, it achieves it with its fantastic special effects, incredible sound design and special soundtrack to activate that nostalgic sensation. With a simple story and a premise without over-complications, the film does not fall into a large number of holes or over-saturation, does a good job presenting itself as it is. A tribute to the world of entertainment.Very entertaining, it is fantastic to admire the incredible action scenes, although if I had to highlight the bad points, well, I would say that this is a film without real motivations, we do not get to feel a great attraction for the characters, each seems to represent an archetype already established without new samples of originality, the creativity of the film lies with its visual presentation, not with its characters which end up being simply averages. Perhaps the only character who really enjoys both the performance and the background story is the creator of the OASIS, which appears a few times, but each time is an emotional sensation that feels like a direct message to the audience. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear too much and the rest of the film is with the main characters which are not bad, but not very good either. Also, it reaches a point where the film is very dependent on references to video games, movies or the like, denoting a sensational overuse for it. Despite this, it is quite fun, entertaining and with excellent special effects, very good for entertaining us.",7,1,3,24 June 2019
Alien," The father of space terror
","In 1979, the world was taken by surprise to the best science fiction horror film, the best movie of aliens and one of the best horror movies. Alien is undoubtedly a fascinating masterpiece of science fiction that has absolutely every great aspect to hit us for a century and until eternity, a movie that will be remembered as one of the best of all time, here was born the true King of all the movies of aliens, we will probably never see a movie that has astonished us as much as this, but its legacy continues today and tomorrow.Going to see this movie in its opening day, was to see one of the most terrifying experiences in its time, something so magnificent and at the same time, creepy, a movie that showed us the true meaning of suspense and terror to the unknown.With a slow but entertaining advance, building the characters and the atmosphere, gradually increasing the mystery and beating at the end with the extraterrestrial surprise. Every detail is very carefully designed, with very realistic airs, making us feel as if we were really on board a spaceship, the actors are impeccable and teach the true madness of facing something unknown. The sounds are a masterpiece, with an incredible atmosphere and effects, the size of the alien, the sounds of the ship, doors opening, listening to the protagonist walking, weapons, gears, everything helps to create an atmosphere so dark that it surpasses All expectation, but the final prize, is taken by the Xenomorph, the alien number 1 in the film industry. Absolutely great, any fan of science fiction will find this movie spectacular, even lovers of terror or suspense, a movie that everyone should admire.",9,3,4,14 April 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dark and crude; a tragic masterpiece about grief.
","It is a pleasure to realise that over the years, films with incredible stories and fascinating scripts will surprise us once again with a stellar set of actors, with a fascinating story, a solid and raw direction, that successfully manages to capture our emotions completely. That's what I can say about this film in a few words.TBOEM is a dark, violent and depressive drama that shows us a unique story through an original perspective that combines a raw satire with a provocative story. Complemented with incredible and unique performances by the entire cast. Each actor manages to deliberate his lines in a fantastic and serious way, which feels like a crude and realistic conversation that keeps us with our ears to the fullest.An intense film that shows that the beauty of cinema is still able to convey a message, a story, a unique and beautiful concept; all that is still possible. Each unique aspect of this film was designed with passion and heart to deliver a strong story that manages to stay within us days after the film is finished. Unique, provocative, fantastic and thirsty; the kind of movies that I love to see and that everyone in their lives should be able to experience at least once to learn what the 7th art is.",10,0,2,11 October 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," The Queen
","No doubt nobody can debate the enormous importance that Queen has had in the musical field, being not only an innovative and resurgent band, but they were also a combination of musical geniuses that were able to create melodies that we can all love, and I say all because who Rays have not heard '' We Will Rock you? ''. His influence has been so great that they came to be portrayed in a complete movie, and he has done it in an excellent way.A biographical film, exciting and full of excellent sounds, carried out under a good direction and above all, incredible performances that give life to each of the members; it is not necessary to emphasize the incredible thing that is Rami for Mercury, an act totally in point, from its ways of behaving, compustura, tone until the expressions and the movement, is to see Mercury with life in the big screen, an experience difficult to forget for so emotional it is. I think it makes a good judgment of Queen's story and portrays them in a realistic and tangible way, a sample of the whole band's journey and the person who was Mercury.",8,1,1,1 June 2019
Bird Box," An interesting inclusion in the genre of terror.
","Bird Box is a movie based on a novel with an interesting and curious concept to carry out, taking the main idea of fear of something incomprehensible, but above all, imperceivable, thanks to the fact that they are unable to see their enemy, this monster or creature, this strange entity that has the ability to kill them with just a second inside the eye orbits of these people. A creature that is impossible to see, the fear of something that we cannot even defend ourselves.With an interesting idea the movie starts, developing at a slow pace, but solid, with good performances by the cast, especially Bullock, which gives an interesting perspective to the tough girl but able to open her heart to those who deserve it, both their care and love.The film is directed in a good way, with quite interesting and entertaining moments, although a narrative structure based mainly on flashbacks and memories that end up becoming a bit of overexposure, however, it gives a good idea about the main plot and the first days of the disaster. After this, the final act concentrates mainly on the present and takes us through the most tense moments of the film. Although it remains stable with all these aspects, I think it fails a lot in the logical aspect or at least the logical narrative, also becoming a little slow with the development of the 2nd act of the story, and I must say, that the movie really,is not scary, it can be tense and somewhat exciting, but I never had a sensation of terror while watching it.Still, it was very entertaining and worthwhile for horror movie lovers.",7,1,2,7 June 2019
Cast Away," What a great classic.
","Obviously I am many years behind with this review, but it is only a proof of how this classic despite the age, is still able to deliver an enormous satisfaction in its theatrical form. Cast Away is a film that I like to use quite like the example of good cinema; it is a film with a simple premise, simple in his veins but with a fantastic execution, fun and emotional. It is an art of being able to see it, entertaining from top to bottom, full of classic moments that we can remember forever, moments that are already captured as part of the history of cinema.Everything inside the movie is great, I was sincerely hoping to see something simple with a little adventure, but ended up being a trip quite emotional and passionate about the survival story of a poor FedEx worker who ends up spending years lost along with nothing but his companion mind, which makes great use with the classic ball, Wilson.And practically, these are the two protagonists of the film, although if there are several characters, the story itself is concentrated in Chuck, perfectly personified by Tom Hanks, achieving that we have a great affection for the person and his interaction with the world around him. Finishing with an excellent and simple end, emotional and moving, a classic instant that despite the years, must be seen.",8,0,0,1 June 2019
Split," Great story comes to life with fantastic acting.
","Split is a unique film that presents a different perspective than horror movies. It shows us fascinating moments full of mystery and suspense while at the same time offering us scenes with a high quality, especially for the fantastic work that James McAvoy does when it comes to acting the different personalities of the protagonist.A film full of suspense with quite intense scenes that manage to put us on the edge of our chairs; the fascinating narrative shows us a special case of a young man with multiple personalities ranging from innocent attitudes to violent and dangerous personalities. To achieve this, it requires a quality of performance quite high, and McAvoy simply does the perfect job for it, is the star of this film, the face completely, he sells us this film.However, although the movie itself owes its success to the excellent performances, also has a script and a convincing direction that helps us get into the film and feel the emotions of each person. Humanly and emotionally structured, it makes us want/concern about each person. It is especially great the relationship that we can get to feel for the multiple personalities presented by James, because they are different complementary people, which are represented completely different thanks to the incredible work of James.An intense movie with thrilling and excellent performances.",8,1,2,16 June 2019
Collateral," A thriller with action done right.
","A taxi driver trying to work to save and get his dream job, for a night after leaving a woman, a mysterious man gets into his taxi and offers him a large sum of money to take him overnight to certain points in the city, which ends up becoming a kidnapping by a professional killer.Collateral's story is quite a simple and eloquent one, without too many complications or saturated subjects, however, the direction and the performance is what makes this movie stand out from the rest. A clear example of amazing and realistic action with the help of Mann's fabulous direction, the action scenes are tense and realistic demonstrating great quality and time set to carry them out. Both Cruise and Foxx are exceptional in their roles, however I have to point out that as a villain, Cruise does a fantastic job becoming a very iconic and recognizable character.Collateral is an excellent action movie with a stellar cast and a fantastic direction full of small symbolic messages and realistic action, impossible not to recommend to action lovers.",9,1,2,4 June 2019
Dunkirk," Fantastic shots extremely beautiful with intensity and movement but a lack of characters that is rewarded in the end.
","Dunkirk tells the real events of the disembarkation of the Battle of Dunkirk during World War II.Nolan presents us again with an extremely fantastic image and perfectly created with Dunkirk, showing us one of the most beautiful and brilliant scenes of any movie about the Second World War in history. Full of totally beautiful scenes and technical wonders, it is undoubtedly a film that represents an event in a realistic and intense way. The perspective of the film follows the chronology of the real events in the battle, however it takes the perspective of 3 different characters, a fighter aviator, a civilian sailor and a soldier. Each brings his or her view of the way the war unfolds around them, with solid and convincing performances, although here is one of its most detrimental points. The lack of characters and the development of these; Dunkirk is a film without characters in reality, concentrating rather on the events and the total population that witnessed the events, developing through the eyes of soldiers and civilians, despite the lack of memorable characters or interpresent dialogues, I believe without doubt that the film rewards this with an excellent cinematography.I can understand the negative criticisms about this justifiable aspect of the film, however, I still believe that this film is incredibly good for the genre of war and tells a unique perspective in the most sublime way possible for the human eye. A graphic beauty full of incredible techniques.",8,0,1,5 June 2019
Aliens," In space, no one can hear you scream.
","One of the best works of science fiction and horror, of the history of the cinema, undoubtedly, undeniable, Aliens is the closest to perfect sci-fi, a masterpiece that to this day has no rival in its field . Combining terror and science fiction is not always a simple task, it takes some intellect and knowledge to create an exorbitantly incredible world, Aliens accomplishes that, and for terror? We need the touch of the unknown, the dread of something we know nothing, because as Lovecraft once said, the oldest fear of the human being is the fear of the unknown. Maybe few times we have felt the sensation of being trapped next to something that we have never seen in our life, but do not worry, Aliens will make us feel that in a shocking way. Ah! But there is one more topic here. All the action is the best.Now we will combine 3 things, science fiction, terror and action. The result? Aliens.And what does that mean? 2 hours with 34 minutes of suspense and the biggest entertainment of the cinema, full of scenes as iconic as original, special effects of maximum quality, incredible sounds that have become class marks, impeccable performances, tense and entertaining dialogues, and above all, the best Alien in history. The alien of this movie, a life form as frightening as it has fascinated the minds of fans since 1979, traumatized children and exploited the confines of science fiction.I have seen this movie at least 7 times, every time is incredible and full of entertainment, so much that sometimes I wish to forget it to only be able to feel that maximum emotion and fear that the first time, but despite having seen it 7 times, I seek to see it again and again, in simple words.A masterpiece.",9,5,9,10 October 2017
Tropic Thunder," A great comical enjoyment!
","Putting him fast, simple, direct and raw. This film is 100% black humor, full of rude jokes with stereotypical humor and clichÃ© scripts that deliver an excellent comedy. And I love it, it's totally fun not to take yourself too seriously and just let go of the jokes while admiring excellent performances by the whole fantastic cast. Combined with a funny way of execution and a multitude of delirious performances, this is one of the best comedies there can be.I'm really glad to have seen this movie, it made me laugh out loud when I needed it most, it's humour is fantastic and specially designed for adults with an excellent and open sense of humour, totally recommended to enjoy.''Never go full retard.''

Avengers: Endgame," A totally satisfying experience, the Endgame of a saga.
","Although I'm not a big fan of the Marvel saga and keep something out of date with all the movies, I've seen most of them and I consider them excellent forms of entertainment, each with special touches that make them very favorable to taste, but above all highlights the experimental creation of his ''cinematic universe'', a union of movies with different but related arguments. Endgame is the end to that great saga that for years was being built successfully to close with a golden brooch.It is a journey of action and fun, totally entertaining with excellent performances, amazing effects, an intense plot and above all a fantastic villain. Each of these factors manages to create a movie of great magnitude for entertainment, and I'm sure the most passionate fans will be satisfied with it.Although I don't consider myself an expert on Marvel, I consider this to be a high caliber movie for anyone that likes movies.",8,0,2,2 June 2019
Man on the Moon," Fantastic acting with a strong direction.
","A distinctive film in its genre, which causes us confusion and enigma constantly, however, I think that's the purpose, although it is not a film Memento style, if one, rather Man on the Moon style. Different and entertaining without a doubt, it tells us in an interesting way the real story of Andy Kaufman, a comedian (non-comedian) who tries to bring to the world of entertainment his new form of entertainment, one that to this day, seems to be still misinterpreted.The film features a fantastic Milos directorial detail, as expected, filled with a solid cinematography, script and enough attention to detail; however, the true cinematographic proof of this film I consider to be the fascinating performance of Jim Carrey.With this new facet, totally original and fascinating, Jim shows us that he is not only a physical comedy actor, but also someone capable of showing emotions, personalities, feelings, complex mental structures and above all, the ability to give life to a real character, Jim is Kaufman, he makes it simply fantastic.A movie quite different, entertaining and as expected, strange, but a good strange.",8,0,0,17 June 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An Anderson work of art.
","The story of a hotel manager and his lobby boy told through the mystery of a terrible murder, with an excellent touch of comedy, absurdity and above all, Anderson.Those who are related to Wes Anderson's work know that they are for a special movie, and let me tell you that it is completely. No film can be compared to such an exceptionally original work. Wes' direction is something that already stands out without needing to mention it, he knows how to direct like no one else, his style is simply impeccable and he has been given a special place in the history of cinema.This film is no exception to his style, but it is one of his best examples. Manufactured in a detailed and unique way, with an excellent atmosphere unique to find, a wonderful style reminiscent of a play. The performances are magnificent, incredible and fun; it is a comedy with a slight criminal and mysterious touch, full of fun and unique moments that undoubtedly make this film deserves a special place. The relationship between the protagonists is something fantastic and wonderful to observe through the development of the plot, never boring and always keep us emotionally attached to them, something I must highlight is that, the film will move us completely with a unique narrative and a special ending.A fantastic film, a comic tragedy with a style impossible to plagiarize.",9,1,2,4 June 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Black comedy with an original and creative touch.

They move our feelings, alter our ideas and show us terrifyingly close or future probabilities, feasible realities that constantly haunt us, this work is responsible not only to present us with a constant and top quality, but is also a work that will make us feel every beat of the heart.It's criminal to know that this movie didn't have the critical or box-office acceptance when it was released, I honestly can't understand why, but thanks to the power of the internet, in recent years it has been slowly but surely recovering its location as a master cult movie.Each scene of the film is an artistic work, each moment is a fantastic inspection of cinematic art. The cinematography is totally beautiful, full of incredible moments, tense and realistic, that make us feel the pressure in our throat. I have to highlight the end of the film, which is probably one of the most fantastic, surreal and impressive camera works in the history of cinema.The performances are of the highest quality, full of emotion and realism, during the development of the film we are shown a great contrast between the different people who appear in this world, the spectrum between the fortunate and the unfortunate, different secondary characters who speak different languages and belong to a variety of cultures, this only helps pleasantly to give a realistic life to this film.The script, the story, the structure and the narrative shown in the film are incredible, without seconds wasted and without unnecessary exposure, each part of each scene is designed to convey an idea or a feeling and succeeds completely, a film as realistic as it is magical, that shows a terrifying chemistry between humans, with explosive reactions as well as wonderful reactions.It is undoubtedly a masterpiece, I consider it one of the best movies in the history of cinema and one of my favorite movies of life.

Logan," A farewell of superb quality to an iconic character.
","After years and years of receiving various movies from the X-men universe, it is time to say goodbye to probably his most characteristic and emblematic character. The Wolverine.And after so many years with movies that were from poor quality to great, we expected a fitting ending that would give us something incredible, however, Logan gave so much, so much more.An incredible movie in a few words. As no other in terms of style and genre, which despite coming from roots forged under the simple stylized ''superhero action'', ends up showing us an incredible side, a human and intense final for a character with a wonderful development. Logan is full of moments of action, incredible cinematography, beautiful soundtrack, incredible performances, an intense and realistic script, and above all, emotions. Quite a lot of emotions. This movie is a moving action movie, full of sentimental movements that serve both to show the weaknesses of the characters, as the fact that they are as human as the other humans in their cruel world. Logan is directed and created sublimently to deliver what is one of the best comic movies of recent times, setting high standards for future deliveries, if there are any in the future.Logan is an amazing, entertaining, exciting and emotional movie. A glorious farewell for a glorious character. The end of a saga that has filled us with action ends up being a work of art that allows us to see human and inhuman mortality.Without a doubt, it closes the story with a high score; excellent music, magnificent chemistry between the protagonists, a credible and human script, beautiful cinematography and a direction full of heart makes Logan a film of superior quality to any other of the same genre.

Midsommar," A different trip but overly long.
","A different experience, although with the pace that movies have been taking recently, it seems that the rarer, the better, and so, no, not always.Midsommar is unique, without a doubt; with a pagan atmosphere and a slow but burning narrative, the film manages to hold steady and steady as a large repertoire of intriguing and ambiguous scenes, but at the same time, it stretches/ lengthens these scenes too much and it can feel like we are watching a rather dramatic documentary or a kind of compilation of rituals that we don't understand (or even comprehend).The film has a wonderful camera work, showing us quite brutal scenes and at the same time stylizing effects and filters that give it a unique, repulsive and fresh touch. Quite fresh, is here one of the factors where the film stands out, being made in its entirety during the day and in a beautiful green field, although as I stand out in that, also stands out in not giving fear, and to be a film of such genre, because honestly it was quite the opposite. The story, if there is one, leads nowhere and the characters are too dull and one moment they are there and the next they are not; in other words, their importance is really irrelevant.Quite long, too long for something that could have been accomplished in less time; but with well-designed scenes and incredible montages, the film manages to entertain, even if it is like a documentary about a pagan culture. As a recommendation, see the theatrical version, DC is too much.",7,1,9,26 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An artistic wonder full of sentimentality and beauty.
","I will try to keep this simple and to the point; Eternal Sunshine is an extremely beautiful film and full of passion in its artistic creation, is a film with beautiful moments that stand out for their originality combined with their beautiful representation of human emotions, presented mainly through the spectrum of two people with polar personalities. The film presents a unique and original premise through a fascinating structure that makes us think about how it works, how it goes, how it follows.Eternal Sunshine is a film full of originality, fantastic cinematography and a unique script complemented by fascinating performances, highlighting the incredible performance of Jim Carrey, which I consider to be the best of all the ones he has made in his movies. This is a film that highlights Jim's emotional and dramatic abilities to bring to life a character totally different from those he has personified during his career as an actor. This film is, of course, a romantic film, which is based especially on the value of memories and the need to overcome problems rationally and effectively. Showing us a bizarre journey through memories, memories and imaginations, the film transports us to a unique and fascinating narrative that resembles a dreamlike journey through dreams.Full of iconic phrases, fantastic moments, deep messages and strong emotions, it is a complete film in both technical and creative aspects, offering an excellent quality to satisfy the tastes of those seeking a unique, original and sentimental film; a down to earth representation of feelings and love.It is one of my favorites for a good reason; it is original, pure poetry and beauty captured with a unique narrative full of emotions and fascinating scenes.",10,0,0,11 July 2019

The Witch," A fascinating story full of symbolism and diabolical horror.
","This film presents us with an extremely disturbing, dark and depressing story, based on popular tales and legends, it is a horror story carried out in a different way than what we are used to. The Witch is not a movie for just anyone, it is not a quick horror movie or random jumpscares, it establishes itself as the narrative of the sad fate of a poor family as they are harassed by the evil powers of an outside witch.The film is filmed in a beautiful way, creating fantastic images that get stuck in our minds, but above all, full of symbolism and icons that present us with constant subconscious ideas to build the story they are trying to give. The performances are fascinating and make us see the real panic within the characters, even the performances of children are quite solid. The direction is fantastic, the scenes are dark, medieval and cold, giving a strong feeling of desolation. With a fantastic script, it makes us see through the eyes of the poor victims of this story.The Witch is a strong film, full of very incredible and spooky images, concentrates mainly on a very strong subject which is witchcraft and the powers of hell, teaching us the horrors that these entail, however, in a magical way and yet realistic, raw and sincere, without over-explained fantasies or effects. And it doesn't need explanation, that's what this movie is about, to face the horrors of powers that go beyond our understanding, our power and our mental health. Probably one of my favorite horror movies, a perfect movie for those seeking the ''special touch'' in the over-saturated genre of terror. Fascinating.''Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?''",8,1,2,25 June 2019
War of the Worlds," An intense action movie of an alien invasion.
","Exciting and strong, War of The World is an action-suspense movie with an incredible presentation and fantastic special effects; complemented with the brilliant acting quality, a realistic script and a believable story, takes by the hand an excellent thrilling movie with incredible scenes that highlight the madness of an alien invasion, when technologically superior beings completely dominate the inferiority of the human being.Tom Cruise, as always, does a fantastic job as the protagonist, presenting fantastic and intense scenes, demonstrating his love for what he does. The script of the film complements with the reality of the madness that each civilian is living, an alteration of his reality through the intensity of the war against superior beings. The effects of the film are completely fantastic, especially the quality of the sound design, which gives us one of the most iconic sounds in the history of cinema, the trumpets of the tripods. Cinematography helps the film to give a feeling of despair and total war, showing the human being as ants before extraterrestrials.A tense film, fantastic from the beginning to the middle of the acts, however, the end decays a little, slightly becomes irrelevant and anticlimatic, giving a fairly dull end sincerely. Which ends up ruining the film to a large extent, however, it doesn't take away the fantastic intensity that it has during the first main acts. An intense film that is worthwhile for lovers of action-adventure, and one of the best within the genre of aliens.",7,0,2,24 June 2019
Joker," Masterful, dark, shocking, and strong. An incomparable work, the film of the year.
","Joker is a unique, raw and special movie. It is a violent story that shows us the slow descent into madness of our protagonist, Arthur. The movie was incredibly hyped to what runs the year, however, unlike what usually happens with many movies that cause such excitement, this achievement exceed any expectation. This is a movie that definitely deserves any possible ovation to her. An incredible job. It seems fantastic to me to know that the director was able to carry out a work of such quality that it will simply become a milestone in the years to come; it is a unique story, without censorship which shows us the development of a protagonist in such a fluid, effective and fascinating way that we can come to sympathize with such madness, a violent madness, raw and emotional. These words can describe the essence of this film, capable of transmitting ideas and sensations of extreme power and power that nothing can equal.Much has been said about Joaquin's performance, and here I come to repeat the same thing, because he simply deserves it: It's incredible, it's perfect. This is the Joker that is capable of existing in this world, a performance as strong as human, a cruel and realistic touch gives enough support for us to understand the motivations of the character, who is not only a villain with a goal, or an idea, it is the explosion caused by the spark of madness. The acting is just sublime, and I'll say it at once; it's time for his Oscar.Incredible, fantastically dark, every minute of this film is a work of pure passion, effort and attention to detail, you can more than notice the incredible work that has been put into it. Everything is simply fascinating, the direction, the incredible script, the beautiful cinematography, the masterful performance, the deep soundtrack, the emotional scenes, the fluid development, and so on.Joker is a masterpiece.

Bram Stoker's Dracula," A dark and disturbing romance, a bizarre adaptation.
","Dracula's classic comes to life with Coppola's work, being a story that combines different elements within one, remaining in itself as two main: Romance and terror.Dracula is a unique film in its design, execution and narrative. Sometimes it feels slow, other times it feels very fast, the scenes stand out for their great practical effects and camera angles, the design of Dracula is especially fantastic and probably one of his best reincarnations on the big screen. The atmosphere of the film stands out for its incredible gothic atmosphere, dark and mysterious, perfectly building the great weight that has the name of Dracula. It contains incredibly disturbing scenes, especially if we take into account the year in which it was released, also taking into account the lustful scenes that pass around the film, you could say that it is a sensationalist film.However, the film has a strange structure, feels rushed giving big blows in a premeditated way, the characters are not very calm, reaching almost unrealistic extremes, although it must be taken into account that the book also had certainly fantastic and sensational dialogues rather than realistic or logical.It is a good film of terror and romance, innovative and unique for its effect. However, the fear effect is probably not as strong as it used to be because of the outdated effects, and the romance is quite coarse and snatched. It's a good classic, which comes as a surprise with its incredible level of visual narration, with excellent disturbing scenes and an exciting ending. A classic, no doubt.",7,0,2,25 June 2019
Jaws," The classic sharp teeth, the father of the monstrous animal movies.
","Have you ever gone fishing? Well, you usually expect to catch a big fish, something nice, that you can eat. But no, in this case, it is very big, very ugly, and it will eat you.I saw this movie when I was about 12 years old, it struck me and I terrified it abruptly, it is the culprit of being afraid of the sea, well, probably not only I was victim, many more for sure, but what does that mean? It means how shocking this movie can be.Maybe in the current year, if some children see it they will not feel the big thing, but as I saw it, it was not even the year of premiere, it was almost 3 decades later, even so I was traumatized. The shark, the scariest movie of the year, the great white shark. I said those words with great emotion when I referred to Jaws as a child, not only was it a terrifying experience, I also filled with emotion and suspense, the famous and recognizable main song, that song that more of us look for as Taran ta-ran or Shark song on google. The direction of the film of course is implacable, directed by someone who does not need introduction, cinematography is excellent, with scenes as iconic as great, and special effects are something unique! Despite being 2017, I still think 'God, it looks real.' It is something surprising that gave birth to a unique genre that was brutally exploited, that of gigantic or terrible animals.It's been many years, this movie is a jewel of terror and adventure that never disappoints, I always look at it even once a year next to my cousin or girlfriend, because we love to feel that nostalgia for what was once a advanced and frightening movie.Watch out for the sea, it's full of great movies.",8,0,1,8 October 2017
Kong: Skull Island," A worthy reboot! Gigantic action!
","The skull island is the birthplace of dozens of dangerous creatures of gigantic proportions; Huge spiders, giant killer ants, ridiculously large cows, monstrous 80 meter long lizards and of course King Kong.I come to review this movie as a fan of the action and giant monsters, since I have admired every detail in the fiction of giant Japanese and American monsters, of course, the king of kings in this case is Godzilla, but the title of king who Kong carries on his behalf is not just by coincidence.Without a doubt, this giant monkey is ready for all kinds of fantastic combat with unique scenes in the giant monster cinema.Unlike Godzilla of 2014, Skull Island has lots of monsters fighting scenes and many little details of how huge the Monsterverse is looming at us. Enter the cinema very excited about this movie and I must admit that I love King Kong.But not every movie is free from sin. What I do not like is the fact of the not-so-special script and the not-so-good performances from two great actors who wait a lot more, Jackson and Goodman. Their names are supposed to mean 'incredible scenes of script and pure acting' but I think this was not their case with Skull Island, because of these errors, sometimes the film became too predictable and even childish at certain times , But even so, if you want entertainment, this is just right.A deserved 7 for Kong.",7,3,6,21 May 2017
Parasite," A brilliant and emotional film that slowly grows in you.
","I saw the movie Parasite quite blindly, I hadn't seen the trailer and had barely read the synopsis, but I knew that the director and cast couldn't disappoint me, and the interesting cover attracted my attention to see the movie.And I made no mistake. Parasite is a quite particular and diverse work, which is responsible for building a story original and charismatic, attractive and yet slightly disturbing, but in a way that leaves us a strong emotion at the end of seeing it. With a fairly solid and interesting start, the film takes a complete turn in half and becomes even more entertaining and fascinating than it seems at first, showing a quality good enough to attract my attention, the unexpected.However, it's not just the interesting plot, but the provocative narrative and beautiful cinematography that builds the characters in a deep and realistic way. Creating palpable characters full of mistakes and at the same time humanity. Finishing with a strong and emotional escapeist ending, a unique film that is sweetly welcomed into the small collection of original and fantastic 21st century films.PS: Korean cinema never ceases to amaze, how great.",9,3,7,27 November 2019
Raging Bull," A psychological drama with strong punches.
","Intense shots of a sublime technical aspect manage to captivate with more than enough the feeling and the psychological context of this fantastic drama that with strong blows to the liver shows us the crude life of a boxer from its beginnings to its end.Raging Bull is another of Scorsese's great works, one that, obviously, does not lack the technical and masterful genius of his shots. Beautiful, sincere and direct, the quality of the angles allow to appreciate with great intrigue the psychology of the protagonist. By showing the film in black and white, it manages to capture a different, dark and raw atmosphere through the presentation of a violent and paranoid story.With the fantastic performances should not say much, each actor manages to deliver their lines and emotions with a unique touch, showing human and defective in front of the cameras. The film can be considered a magnificent work of psychological study, where the main quality is found in the character and the perspective we have of him. Although it has a somewhat slow progress, with scenes that feel longer than they should be, probably because it is a biographical film, this does not present a direct objective, a goal or motivation, which makes the structure of the film feel slightly like a documentary.Raging Bull is a strong Drama, which is introduced to us with very interesting personalities that let us analyze them with a great passion. That's the reason why I considered it a high quality psychological drama.",8,2,2,5 October 2019

The development of the film, the characters, the dialogues, the distance from reality and the alteration of what we know, the fear of the incomprehensible, the special cinematography and the fantastic sound design make the film have a unique and horrifying atmosphere of comic terror.The film is strange, yes, quite a lot, but not for sensationalist reasons, the mysteries that occur have a motive, although not very understandable to the human, because they are totally alien things to our understanding or motives, the alterations that are suffered around the film through a world that is supposed to be ours, but now seems to be totally different is an enigmatic and distressing sensation that causes our minds to wander for answers in questions that probably do not have, this is a very strong point of the film, the fear of the unknown, something that manages to capture excellently.A very original and creative horror movie in recent years, with good performances and truly distressing and horrifying moments.

","The Second World War has been exposed for decades in the world of cinema, however, the quality films of the Second World War have been gradually declining with the passing of the years in these modern times.

I did not expect much from the sequel to Promethues, as it seemed that the level of the Alien films declined more and more, but this time, It was quite different.The film has no doubt, the most beautiful views we see in the saga of Alien, has some incredible special effects, a very good script, spectacular performances (Fassbender is incredible) an entertaining plot, good sound design, great visuals And a lot, a lot of blood. I think it is the most bloody and violent film in the entire saga, just like the first time I saw Aliens, this one left me shocked and I try to see again and again.I am a big fan of science fiction and horror, Alien is my favorite saga, I must say that I am very grateful to Scott for the fantastic thing that is this new movie, very incredible, no doubt, it was quite entertaining and intense to experiment it in cinema. But, perhaps one of its biggest mistakes is its strange and too confusing narrative on the part of the director; this film is supposed to be designed to give answers to past problems, to the questions that we have asked ourselves so much, however, it only ends up reeling over themselves and trying to add layer upon layer of complexity that simply end up being unnecessary overexposure.Leaving that aside, it was a quite entertaining movie, with intense scenes and wonderful shots. I also highlight the incredible performance of Fassbender. Simple and fascinating I can describe it.Something interesting that I should highlight; Hell, this movie is brutal.",7,87,172,11 May 2017
The Martian," Entertaining space-adventure flick.
","Lost on the red planet, an astronaut begins to look for ways to survive on the surface of Mars, while on Earth, everyone tries their best to bring him back.With fantastic special effects, beautiful shots like any Ridley movie, The Martian is a film that wonders the eyes with its incredible presentation, expressing itself through tense scenes, hilarious, entertaining, moving and fantastic, showing scenarios in high quality. An entertaining movie and able to put itself as a high quality space adventure film. The solid performances of the cast present us with a tangible story, especially Matt's acting ability that never fails to give us some scenes hard to forget.An entertaining movie that manages to consume his time quickly without us thinking about it, even though it is not totally a master touch. The movie doesn't have a lot of tense scenes, well, it does, but it seems to be more like a situation where we already know what will happen, so the tension is quickly removed. The structure of the film is also somewhat fast, moving completely, and features a large cast of actors who act wonderfully, but don't have as much time on screen as we would like. Still, The Martian is a wonderful space adventure movie worth watching.",8,1,2,25 August 2019
