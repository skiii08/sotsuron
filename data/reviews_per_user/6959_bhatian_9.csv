The Ring," Scariest Film on Earth
","If you have not seen this film, then I highly recommend you watch it. This film will give you the creeps you will never forget. The film spooks you into the belief of the story and Samara's death. The film is extremely convincing about the websites being read by Naomi Watts.This film is the remake of the Japanese film RINGU and I saw this few weeks ago and RINGU is not too scary, but Hollywood feeds on dramatizing reality and this time they were successful with THE RING. The Ring is a simple story of a lady who watched a 30 second spooky video and is cursed to death, after which she conducts research on the truth behind the 30 second video and finally gets successful in her mission. All this is too simple to read, but wait till you watch THE RING, I guarantee you that 'Friday The 13th' will seem lame.My credit goes to the director of THE RING and he has done an excellent pre-production plan prior to the making of this film.WATCH IT AND STAY AWAKE ALL YOUR LIFE.",10,1,1,28 June 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Hollywood Virtual Game
","Before I stepped into the cinema hall to view this film, I knew that I was stepping into another highly marketed Hollywood clich√© on 'natural scare tactics'. Hollywood tends to enjoy racking in money by scaring their audience about the future. Films such as Day Afetr Tomorrow have been made before focusing on future fears such as 'Independence Day', and at the end we see that the human kind is a winner, just so that we leave the cinema hall with comfortable feeling of surviving the mental trauma created by the film. Finally, most of us leave cinema hall saying 'wow', 'amazing', 'fantastic only on a big screen', etc. The only part I believe is that it is nice on a big screen, and money well spent to create excitement and fear in people. As far as the story goes - there is none! Characterisation is lame and does not hold any weight. Graphics and special effects are only OK. Dialogues / script is boring. Acting talent - not required (especially here). Length of the film - it could have been shortened - 1. We have bad weather coming soon (20 minutes), 2. People in NYC made aware of the bad weather (10 minutes), 3. People dying in the bad weather (10 minutes), 4. A hero is born and wants to save the world (10 minutes), 4. Hero is struggling (5 minutes), 5. Finally, hero saves the world, and everyone is happy (10 minutes). Hey, that's only 65 minutes (shortest big budget Hollywood film).My final conclusion: Please stay home and watch the local weather news and save some money for a day out on the beach and catch the waves.Score: 4 out of 10.",4,0,1,30 May 2004
Lion," There is GOD
","I am writing this review as an Australian Indian who moved to Australia in 1989. Unlike Saroo's experience I moved to Australia for education and work and later called Australia my home. To me Australians are great souls which Brierly family rightfully signifies and are excellent living examples.The film is very hard hitting showing us the true meaning of love and care. I love the scene in the beginning where Saroo is surrounded by butterflies that shows us the innocence is surrounded by and protected at the same time by love of God. There is no secret or spoiler to this film as its based on true story, therefore all I'll say is that the Writers and Director have done an excellent job, and to add to it we see some brilliant acting especially by Nicole Kidman.Please take a box of tissues with you when watching LION because you're sure to cry from start to end.You know there is GOD when you see this film.God bless ALL LOST SOULS.",9,0,1,26 March 2017
The Pianist," Very gripping
","I had the DVD of this film for over 3 years and never watched it, because I never really had the time in between my hectic schedule to watch this film, but when I did read the reviews of the film on IMDb, it grabbed me so much that I finally decided to watch this film at mid-night (after my entire days schedule). I must say that it was WORTH every minute (late at night).Every single actor in the film had a realism in their character which is very uncommon in many international films. It seems that the director 'made sure' that the film grabs you inside the TV/Screen and puts the viewer in the space and time of Warsaw massacre. Having said this, the props were well selected and felt real.The story telling and the chronology was well synchronized along side the classical composition of Szpilman.This film is not about the Holocaust but about one man and his will to survive the evil that prevailed during the times of Hitler. This film also goes to show 'why should an innocent Jew suffer from the higher level of political war that prevails on this earth'. He just want's to be left alone and continue with his normal life. He has nothing to do with the war, but with his survival and his life. 'Why should he die, if he is not guilty'.In conclusion, this film conveys a message to all of us that we do not need to fight with opponent to win anything, but we need to find way's out of the trouble and war that has 'nothing to do with us'. This is a lesson we must all learn from this film.I am proud of Szpilman and many more who followed his footsteps, because they are the real winners of the war.MUST SEE THIS FILM.My score: 8 out of 10Regards, Neil Bhatia",8,1,2,27 October 2007
The Dark Knight," Finally a film worth raving about!
","Prior to watching Dark Knight, I had heard too many rave reviews about it on the radio and TV that this film has broken many records including bypassing Godfather in every way. Hearing such news, I wanted to see it with my own eyes before believing the media, and not to my surprise, this film has done complete justice to the world of cinema.Dark Knight offers a clear classic example of modern film-making; scripting, cinematography, sound, characterization, comic adaptation, lighting, make-up and costumes, directing and special effects.Every character in the film has been offered with a role and dialog that is unforgettable. Scripting of Dark Knight is very strong and compliments the soundtrack and the sound effects, something that lacks in many Hollywood Cinema's. Joker's role is obviously very essential, but over-taking Batman's limelight in this film was un-imaginable. Joker's sarcasms were so strong that it brought in a lot of laughter in the cinema hall. Joker was indeed a 'Joker', and he lived up to his name and his insanity which he filtered into the entire city of Gotham, and bringing down Batman with it.I can write a million positive words for this film and it still won't be enough. Therefore I strongly recommend you to watch this film and see for yourself 'what the hype is all about'.My score: 10 out of 10.Enjoy viewing, Neil Bhatia",10,5,14,24 August 2008
War of the Worlds," Waste of money
","I only saw this film, because my family took me to it, or else I had no intention to watch it. I knew that this would be another Hollywood Hype (out there to only make money). The film had no strong plot line or a base or foundation or a story to tell. It was a complete waste of the film reel. One could sum up this whole film in 5 minutes of viewing.There was no acting talent required in this film. Aliens in the film looked like some clown in your birthday party. The dialog's were extremely lame and poor and had no depth in it. This film is only good for Home Theatre System stores where one can display his new system while playing 'War of the Worlds' DVD for a good sound test. I just hope the DVD Home Theatre System sell after playing 'War of the Worlds'.Spielberg made a HUGE mistake making this film.Take my advice: Do not bother watching this film.NEIL BHATIA",2,5,9,29 June 2005
Downfall," An Evil within
","This film clearly accentuates Hitler's Evil brains and cold heart towards his own people. Half way through the film I felt like 'I wish I was really alive and present there in front of Hitler, I would have slapped him in front of his own army, no matter whatever consequences I may have to face later, because he deserves that'.The film is segmented in three parts connoting Hitler's Evil life; first, a complete dark scene with a voice-over conveying a message of Evil born on this earth, second, the film shot in absolute darkness in bunkers where it signifies Hitler 'down in hell', and finally, there is light after Hitler's death and the war is over and scene's outside the bunkers in broad daylight. This film makes me extremely sad about the fact that numerous people were shot dead for no reason at all, plus a number of unnecessary suicides. Suicide in my terms is a complete waste of life and is the power of Evil.The film is very well crafted and entertains you even if you are not a fan of any war films (just like me). Bruno's acting is spectacular and he portrays Hitler in its original form and deserves an award. I also appreciated the Set Ups arranged by the Art Director. Overall this film is worth every penny in the cinema / DVD.My overall score for this Masterpiece is 9 out of 10.Watch it! NEIL BHATIA",9,0,1,7 December 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Seriously; This film is no crap!
","The film teaches us all a lesson on 'how taking people's crap can lead us to success'. It is not asking us to be an 'ass-licker' but instead making us stronger by showing us the difficult sides of life.Here we have the character Jamal who is innocent, simple, happy, and takes life as it comes. Jamal's simplicity leads him to path which we all think is only possible by being a crook, street-smart, firm, confident or positive. Whereas in this film, Jamal achieves his destiny by just moving on with his life and taking every new day as a 'brand new day'.I think we all have a lot to learn from Jamal, and it's not easy for us to follow in a short span of time. Hence i urge everyone to view this film few times to let the story sink into our brains and hearts.Remember: 'There is no use fighting with crap.....because it is crap' N.

The Great Gatsby," Best Design and Costume you will see this year
","The story is nice and simple; hence if you are going in for the narrative, then please don't expect much. Whereas the production and costume designs are spectacular, making you want to live in the 1920's.The film is sheer elegance filled with excellent talent from end to end. It felt like a pop-up book of fairy tales when I was a kid who made me want to live in the times and immerse myself in their lives. Therefore if a film can place me into its fictional world, then I see it as a job well done.What I am trying to say is to watch this film to appreciate colors, design, special effects, production design, and costume design. Credit goes to Catherine Martin who is brilliant at what she does, and who would have thought that the film was shot in studios in Sydney, Australia.Note: do yourself a favor and listen to the soundtrack!My score - 8 out of 10Neeil Bhatia",8,2,4,3 June 2013
