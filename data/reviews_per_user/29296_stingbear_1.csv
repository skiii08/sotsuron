Hereditary," Suspenseful, Seat Gripping, kind of movie
","Ari Aster's first feature Hereditary was a startling, emotional, down right bone chilling film that was good, but not great. The movie took the traditional horror movie route, idley waiting jump scare to jump scare for the story to develop further. The two hour movie takes some time to unfold and understand exactly what's going on. With the soundtrack, plot, and dynamic of the film it feels like any other horror movie. But when the story does unfold ,and you connect the pieces, you can see the bizarre, goosebump inducing plot they wanted to get across. The character development is great though, as you feel the emotion and grief each family member bears in their insane time of stress. Surprises around every corner keep you on your toes. All in all a recommendable movie that makes you excited for what Ari has in store next.",6,0,2,16 June 2018
