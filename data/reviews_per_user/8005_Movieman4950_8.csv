E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Et's Spaceship landed Right In My Heart
","E.t. is a fantastic movie starring Henry Thomas And Drew Barrymore. It is a definite classic and will be an awesome movie forever and ever. I actually did not notice any goofs in this movie at all. This movie is with amazing special effects and real looking aliens. The movie tells of a boy named Elliot who longs for a friend. His wish is granted when an alien is left behind while landing on Earth. Together,they make friends. But Elliot does not want any adults to know. Government spies find out about the alien, and are out to get him. Elliot does not want this. So he only tells his younger sister, Gertie, and his older brother, Mike. This a great feel good family film, and a ********** star performance. Therefore, I recommend this movie to you!",10,0,1,30 June 2013
Minority Report," The Best Futuristic Movie Since 'Back To The Future: Part II'
","This movie has been on my watchlist for over a year. I love time travel/futuristic movies. I love Steven Spielberg movies. I like action packed movies with Tom Cruise in them. So with a movie like this... what could go wrong?With stunning Visual Effects, great jetpack sequences, and bald people who dream about future murders, 'Minority Report' puts this up there with the best futuristic movies of all time. The story tells of a man named John Anderton (Tom Cruise; MI: Mission Impossible, War Of The Worlds) who is the head of a police unit called 'Pre-Crime', which tells of a murder BEFORE it actually happens, leading Washington D.C. murder free for six years. When John Anderton is accused of a murder himself (awkward!) he is set into a fast-paced adventure to find the person who set him up.Steven Spielberg was a good choice to direct this film. If it were anyone else (apart from Robert Zemeckis) I would probably scream. This movie can get a little bit confusing... so lets hope you've read Stephen Hawking's 'A Brief History Of Time', or at least seen a Back To The Future film.Now don't listen to what anybody else tells you, because they probably didn't like this movie. Listen to me when I tell you this: it's awesome. If you're a big 'Back To The Future' fan, you would definitely love this. You would probably love this if you were an 'X-Men' fan, too. Overall, I hands down recommend this action-packed Friday Flick to YOU!!!",9,0,1,23 October 2014
Alien," It's OK, But Not Amazing
","Everybody loves Alien.... except me. I don't know what it is. I like cheesy monster movies like Godzilla, but the rubber suits just couldn't get by me here. I'm not really jumping with joy that it's on the top 250. I like 'Aliens', the second movie in the series. There shouldn't be any puppets or rubber suits in these popular phenomenal movies. Blurgh!One of the highlights I guess is Sigourney Weaver's good acting. This was one of her first well-known movies. The part of Ellen Ripley was originally written for a male, but Sigourney Weaver showed up and said women could do the part as good as any man could. Imagine if we had an Elliot Ripley!One of the features that really bothered me was the alien itself. That phenomenal scene where it bursts out of that guy's stomach with lots of bloody guts and gore, I think they did it better in 'Spaceballs' (1987)! The alien was merely a hand puppet which would look better if it were part of the Muppet Show, and when the alien goes to full form, it just looks like a cockroach walking on its hind legs!Overall, this movie is alright, but not something you'd go out of your way to see. It's definitely a ****** performance. How people like it so much, I don't know. I definitely don't like this that much, but I don't mind the sequel, 'Aliens' (1986) over this one!",7,0,4,24 January 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Bit Overboard....
","Alright, I'll admit it: this movie wasn't the best. I'd just went to the movies to see 'The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug', after liking 'The Lord Of The Rings', and 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. But this one wasn't so impressive. The first fatal flaw was the camera. In the 'Barrels' scene, the camera which is showing what Bilbo is seeing, looks like it was filmed a video camera, just like the one I have in my cupboard right now. The second flaw was the cast. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is top billed, yet was only in the movie for 20 minutes. Then, there was Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Bilbo needed more lines, seeing as the story was about him, not some stupid dwarf called Thorin.Yet, the movie got a few stars higher in my book because of Smaug. The voice was fantastic for a massive dragon. It would have been hard to suit the personality.So if you like OK sequels to movies like 'Jaws 2' (1978), and 'Jaws: The Revenge' (1987), then I recommend this movie to YOU!!!",6,1,2,31 January 2014
The Dark Knight," 'Let's Cut You A Smile.....'
","I have seven words to cover this movie. They are: Best. Darn. Superhero. Movie. Ever. Made. I expected it to be good but this: whoa! 'Why So Serious...' you may ask? Well, probably because it was Batman at his worst hour, what with Rachel dying and all.Speaking of Rachel, who on Earth cast Maggie Gyllenhaal as the Dark Knight's closest friend? What happened to Katie Holmes? She was a great Rachel. Maggie Gyllenhaal's terrible performance is probably what's holding me back from giving this movie ********** stars. But, lets talk about the good things in this movie. For example, the Joker. OK, Christopher Nolan, you may not pick a good actor for the part of Rachel (don't worry, I'll stop being so obsessed over Maggie Gyllenhaal in a second) but you can sure pick a good villain. Heath Ledger would win over Jack Nicholson's and Ceaser Romano's performance of the Joker any day.Another fantastic actor in this movie: Gary Oldman. This was my first Gary Oldman movie, and boy is he good. Oldman continues his part as Commissioner Gordon. Some other fantastic actors in this movie is Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart (not Maggie Gyllenhaal).But, the best part of this movie is the script. Who knew Christopher and Jonathan Nolan could write so well?Overall, this movie is a ********* star performance. So, if you like superhero movies, such as the 'Superman' series, then I definitely recommend this movie to YOU!",9,0,2,25 February 2014
War of the Worlds," An 'Out Of This World' Movie
","Spielberg's version of the H.G. Wells classic 'War Of The Worlds' is really good and scary, but nothing like the book. I think Spielberg changed it's genre from 'Sci-Fi' to 'Horror'. But, once again, like he does with all his scary movies, Spielberg scared me again. I found that the originality in this movie was very high (except for the actual aliens). Those giant three-legged spaceship thingies were awesome. The acting was very good, starring Tom Cruise (Jack Reacher, Oblivion) and Dakota Fanning (Man On Fire, Coraline). I haven't seen the original movie, 'The War Of The Worlds', so I can't say this is better. All I know is that this movie is very scary, and, for you Sci-Fi-horror fans out there, I recommend this movie to YOU!!!",6,1,3,3 July 2013
Jaws," The Movie That Scared People Away From Beaches
","This movie is a horrifying extravaganza. The first time I saw it, it was summer, and I wanted to go to the beach. I found this movie and watched it. After I watched it, I wanted to go the pool. Spielberg shows horrible side when he made this movie. After seeing E.T, I thought he's was a mild mannered person. After seeing Jaws, I thought he had a dark side.The story tells of a small town called Amity, which has extremely good beaches. When a massive shark starts haunting the waters, It's up to Police Chief Martin Brody to stop it. With horrifying special effects, gruesome, bloody scenes, and a good director like Spielberg, this movie was sure to not fail in the box-office.This movie is a definite ********** performance, if you ask me. It's a brand spankin' good time! I definitely recommend this movie to YOU!!! And, remember, 'Someone Yells Barracuda, Everyone's Like 'Huh? What?' But If You Yell Shark, We Gotta A Panic On Our Hands On The Fourth Of July!'",10,1,3,30 June 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," The Things You Didn't Know About Mary Poppins...
","Here comes the amazing and slightly disturbing truth of P.L. Travers (Book: Mary Poppins)! The amazing true story of how it all happened. Definitely a ********* performance. Now let me get this straight with you: I do not cry in movies. Yet in this one, I cried. I actually cried. The acting was just so superior to other movies that I thought I was actually seeing the real thing happen, with my very own eyes. The amazing Emma Thompson stars as P.L. Travers, and legendary Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. The ultimate feel-good/pick-me-up movie of the year, mixed in with suspense, comedy and drama. So, if you like spectacular dramas like 'Pride and Prejeduce' (1980), 'Finding Neverland' (2004), and 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' (2011), then I most definitely recommend this movie to YOU!",Null,0,1,26 January 2014
