Walk the Line," A must see
","This is one of the most wonderful movies I have seen! The chemistry between Phoenix and Witerspoon is absolutely amazing and magical!! The music is great, the performances also! They both deserve to be awarded! It was as if i was right there in the movie with them. What amazes me is that both of them took the effort to learn to sing and play instruments so the performances were as real as can be.Phoenix sings absolutely amazing. I strongly recommend the movie to everyone, because you will see a wonderful love story spiced with great music and perfect acting. Even if you are not a huge fan of Johnny Cash, I believe that after seeing this movie, you will become one!",10,0,0,14 April 2006
