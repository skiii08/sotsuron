Your Name.," Too Good,Watch it alone,Judge carefully
","I give this movie 9 only due to animation quality, it's good as movie too good as story, everything in this movie are appreciable. Hats off to the director Makoto Shinkai, for getting such a good thought, and as of I have heard, he got this idea from a anime Ranma 1/2. Well, I'm also an anime fan, and watched other anime movie. Other movies such as Spirited Away, are better than Kimi No Na Wa, but 'Garden of words' one of my favorite Makoto movies has also been included in some scenes of the movie, so overall I can say Makoto has worked hard on this movie and he deserves every award he gets. Also the band Radwimps, have worked good for the song Zen Zen Zense, appreciable for each word. I hope Your Name releases in India soon, crosses 1 billion USD collections and wins an Academy Award. Hail Kimi No Na Wa, I can't wait.",7,2,4,23 January 2017
