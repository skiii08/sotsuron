Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," garbage times a million

So Star Wars is a Harry Potter episode now?
If Leia could influence Ben by - meditating?? - why didn't she do that before he killed Han?
Jedi can resurrect people now??
Solid objects - snatched and teleported?? - between characters now?
Characters sword-battle remotely between locations - really?
Jedi can rip enormous craft out out the air now?
Rey is the greatest warrior the rebels have??
Is there anything Rey cannot do? - how about surfing 300ft waves on a vehicle she just met and somehow is expert at controlling - makes sense.
Why in a galaxy with gravity defying tech are storm troopers riding around in sand snow-mobiles?
Up until now Rey was proficient in everything why does she need to train all of a sudden?
