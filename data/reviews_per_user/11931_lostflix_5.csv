United 93," Very powerful film
",Just got done watching this film. I was definitely skeptical of it when it came out as I thought 9/11 wasn't that long ago. But my fears were put to rest and this film is quite appropriately right for the time. It is a very strong and moving film and does an excellent job portraying the confusion that filled the day. It doesn't glamorize anything and sticks to all the facts that are known about 9/11. I highly recommend rented this film and watching it by yourself on a night of no distractions. You need to really fully dedicate yourself to the film as it commands your attention. Not only so you can get the full dose of the film but also out of respect for what you are watching and learning.,9,3,6,10 January 2007
28 Weeks Later," Classic horror flick moments.
","Great great follow-up of a film. Not quite as good as the original but many shining moments. The first 10 mins is spectacular as far as zombie films go and there are many more moments later in the flick where this thing shines. Where Romero left off with Night of the Living & Dawn of the Dead, this new zombie genre picks up. Romero completely lost his touch on his 3rd film and in 28 Weeks Later you can see what Romero's original vision should have been on the bigscreen. I am so glad someone finally took over the reigns (even through the course of 2 different directors) from Romero 25+ years later. The music in the film is incredibly rich and intense and gives the entire picture wings. Do yourself a big favor and watch this baby on the bigscreen. Please.",8,0,2,29 May 2007
The Princess Bride," A beautiful and witty masterpiece
","What more can you say about this incredible film? The casting was perfect, the acting was perfect, and the writing was perfect. And the soundtrack was pretty darn good too. Andre the Giant? Perfect! I will add something. You know the scene with the shrieking eels? Well they just found a very similar creature (half shark / half eel) over in asia. Apparently it is a species that lives very low beneath the surface of the ocean and has only been seen on occasion when one is dead or near death and comes near the surface. They recently caught a near dead one and put it in a pool for its last few days of life. Anyways, that discovery made the shrieking eel scene a lot more spookier for me. :-D -LOSTFLIX",10,0,1,14 February 2007
Transformers," Started out strong....then quickly fizzled
",Very promising start to a dull movie. I got the feeling within the first 30 minutes I was watching some kind of Terminator 2 ripoff but with car robots instead of cyborgs. The similarities were completely obvious. But that was during the promising set up stage to this way too long flick. Then Mr. Bay must have taken some cues from the older George Lucas (yeh the older one being the guy who thought Jar-Jar and Darth Maul were cool) because out of nowhere some kick-azz bad guy robots developed annoying personalities and speech mannerisms...i.e the infiltrator bots suddenly had to whine and cry when they got hit and generally just become annoying. Period. From that point on the film looses interest and becomes a CGI palm fest. OK we get it... you can make really cool CGI.... can you have a somewhat non-annoying script to watch while you are at it? Does the lead lady always have to have her makeup perfect? Did Tyrese need to be in this film? Do the robots really not shake the ground significantly enough jumping around that we can't notice any vibrations? Can the good guy robots only drive (really slow to for some reason) while the bad guys can fly at will? Please. Can you promote Burger King any more? 60+ years of studying Megatron and landing on the moon is the best we got? Can we scrap Transbeaters 2 and pump that 300 mil into something we might want to watch more than 30 mins of? My suggestion: Watch the first 30 mins then turn it off and get the ending from a good friend. Save 2 hrs of your life and watch T2 instead. Over & out.,6,0,1,18 October 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy," We left the theater. It was that bad. (Spoilers)
","The first five minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy is a hook and gets your teeth sunk in for what looks like a fun, creative, and quirky ride. Then after 10-15 minutes went by I couldn't help but feel I've seen this EXACT movie before. I had. It was a film entitled Raiders of the Lost Ark. You may of heard of it. If you were to watch the first 10 minutes of each of these films and overlay them you would pretty much be watching the same film. So they updated it with a LOT of CGI and super heroes because super heroes are the current trend right now. Of course pepper in a cameo with Stan Lee right? The movie gets worst from there on out. The CGI is over the top, the characters are thrown at us with no development at all but with the assumption we are to care about them. One minute they are trying to kill each other (or not kill each other for some reason... why put him in a bag? I don't get it. Just take the orb). Then about 60 minutes in the producers decide to blast us with a 20-30 minute CGI jack fest that looks just like another film. This time they decided to duplicate Star Wars Episode II (not a good film to replicate). A space chase with CGI only Lucas could love. Ten million things happening on the screen in the span of one chase scene all while blasting our eyes and our ears with brutally piercing effects. Your ears will be ringing for 48hrs after seeing this film. You might have an epileptic seizure if you try to follow all the action as well. This leaves us a little later on with Peter Quill mysteriously smitten over a girl that he has no connection with that has been established. Matter of fact he decides to risk his own life to save her and depend on the undesirable to save him. Sure. Cue more CGI and miraculous healing a minute later to his face.... after all he isn't mortal is he? Or is he? There is also a tree in the film that walks and conveniently regenerates limbs when handcuffs are needed to be placed on him. They have a prison suit that fits a 2' tall raccoon (who doesn't know what a raccoon is even though he speaks English) but not a prison suit that fits a 8' tree. I think this was a case of the CGI department having no problem rendering walking branches instead of a walking rodent. The tree has a case of the Hodors but not unlike Chewbacca he can be completely understood as he speaks articulated sentences. Except with Chewbacca we could infer Solo was guesstimating what Chewy was saying and having fun with it. This is not the case. The raccoon actually understands everything. The film got so bad that we saw a few people get up and leave about 90 minutes into it. We took their cue ten minutes later (the person I was with kept looking at me like... really??) and left as well. The film was an obnoxious capitalistic CGI jack fest that had no story (that wasn't stolen from three other high grossing films), no character development, and no creativity. To give you an example of how uncreative it is, after ripping off the entire intro to Raiders of the Lost Ark the director (I assume) tried to pull a song from the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack and use it to lighten the film. In this case 'Hooked on a Feeling' was used. When? When the characters were entering prison of course, why of course they were hooked on the feeling of going to prison. Contrast this with the brilliant work of Tarantino's use of the same song in Reservoir Dogs. It's like the director never saw Reservoir Dogs or he had no say in the music used in the film. What happened to the clever 70s music to be sprinkled in for comic relief? It just disappeared midway thru the film and didn't return til later. They had to have the Episode II CGI jack fest scene to take up half the movie and the pretend romance scene. I could go on from there about how bad this movie was but I would have to go back and watch the last thirty minutes. Maybe after my ears stop ringing and they release the fifth special edition DVD (at which point 99 cents will be the going rate for all other versions) I might just do that. Until then I'll cross my fingers and hope JJ can save the Holy Trilogy that this film and so many others try to rip off while turning a blind eye. It's no coincidence that the poster looks exactly like the poster for Episode IV.",2,37,85,10 August 2014
