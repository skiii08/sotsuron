Sucker Punch," Modern cinema has reached a new low point
","A lot can be said about this film, but only when accompanied by clenched fists and a look of bewilderment. Wooden acting, one-dimensional characters, awful writing, boring and repetitive action sequences, a plot which is predictable in it's journey to no-where, a lack of meta-story, a horrible degradation of well-loved songs, evidently bad editing (which is a rare one)... All contributing to a pile of misogynist filth that makes you wonder why you still bother going to the cinema. This film characterizes everything that is wrong with modern cinema, emphasizing looks above content and a type of 'stylised' filmmaking which is long past its sell by date above common sense. Don't see this film, unless you enjoy developing an aversion of movies.",1,59,121,25 March 2011
