Vertigo," Hitchcock at his best! Don't read this comment, just go watch it!
","Blistering! Amazing! Shocking! Only a true master could make a movie like this. Hitchcock knows exactly where he's going and plays you like a cat playing a mouse. he will drag you in, and never let go. Even long after the movie is finished!A lot of people think of movies like 'Birds' and 'Psycho' when they think of Hitchcock. Forget those! Watch THIS one!James Stewart is excellent, as always. I had never heard of Kim Novak, and looking at her appearance list i wasn't sure what to expect (well actually i expected a bad acting bimbo). But she was more than great!I never felt so ..... after seeing this movie. It wasn't happy, it wasn't sad, and i was unsure of the ending (but it was certainly suspenseful). The only possible way to find out what i mean here is to watch the movie yourself!",10,3,6,2 August 2004
The Incredibles," The Incredibles is not a bad movie. It's not a masterpiece either.
","Since many advised me to watch this movie, I decided not to be a hard head and give it a shot. I wished it was good, since Pixar is one of the most respected digital animation companies around. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed. I am aware I'm stepping on a lot of toes here of people who completely disagree, so I'll explain, or at least try to.Now to start with something positive. The style of the movie is based on the so called 'Kitsch' art, a mid 50's pop culture style. Which is what gives the Incredibles the indistinguishable look of the 50's and class. Worked out greatly, since It's not an easy thing when you consider the movie is computer made, and the 50's didn't exactly have a lot of that at the time (read: nothing).The movie ridiculous movies of the same time period it style is, like James Bond. And also newer ones like star wars. Unlike Shrek however, it fails. It fails at making a point and it fails at making it funny.Now to the real downsides of the movie. However, simply getting the style and setting of the movie right does not make it a good movie.The movie was empty. Empty, caused by a lack of emotional feeling and an catching storyline. While watching it, I simply couldn't care less about what happened to the characters. It was like watching Pokemon. It's watchable, but hey, nothing happens to call the queen about, it's obvious from the beginning how the scene will end. Which brings me to the script, which ending was also obvious from the beginning. Now, I know that is the case with many many movies, but with the good movies, It's often worked out in such a way the ending is still a revelation. While in other cases, it makes you drop a tear and feel warm inside. None of this was in the Incredibles. The movie ended, and I was untouched. Not just by the ending, but by the whole movie. The best it did was give a little smile from a simple joke.This movie, sadly enough, could have been made by Dreamworks*. Except it did truly attempted, and at some points succeeded to make an animation movie different from all other ones. The Incredibles is not a bad movie. It's not a masterpiece either.*Dreamworks, in my opinion has merely copied everything Disney/Pixar made to make cheap money, ever since Shrek (Shrek II does not count since that is just a sequel of their own work).",6,1,3,6 December 2005
