Mission: Impossible III," Very nice
","It was a very nice. Always a pleasure to see Tom - he's got the clout to draw the big dollar investors - and uses it (look at the screen!). Its just that, I really liked MI2 - much more stylish, much grittier, too. This wasn't exactly what I was hoping for - but all-in-all, I DON'T feel like I wasted 2 1/2 of my life. Now, if he would just do something to show that he is an ACTOR, as well as a Stuntman - that would be GREAT - because HE can do it (remember Born on The Fourth of July???) The Supporting Cast was okay - but Ving Rhames role seems to be getting to be - I dunno: technical? phoned in? And Jonathan Rhys Myers - come on: he was Elvis Presley for crying out loud - but I guess everyone just needs a paycheck once in a while. So: Summation: Tom, ya done good - real good. Be proud of MI-III; people can do (and have done) a LOT worse!",9,1,1,11 May 2006
