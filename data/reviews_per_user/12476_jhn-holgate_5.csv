Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," More of the same.
","If you've never seen a Pirates film before, this will probably seem pretty darn good. It keeps a fast pace, never seems to get dull. There's a few new inclusions to the story - Blackbeard being one, and Ian McShane does a pretty fair job of being someone you don't really want to mess with (in a Disney sort of way!). The mermaids are a nice touch too. The story and plot flow pretty well and most of the actors do a pretty good job. Except for Geoffry. I don't know why, because I think he's a great actor, but he's just not as convincing in this. I always felt like I was watching Geoffry Rush and not his character.The other slightly disappointing thing with this movie is that it felt a little 'formula' driven, like it was a bit too well thought out or over rehearsed and too slick. In the end, while there was nothing to complain about, I just wasn't engaged by the movie and have spent almost no time thinking about it once it finished. Towards the end I was resisting the temptation to look at my watch....and we all know THAT feeling.At the end of the film, my wife and I looked at each other and just sort of shrugged.....aw yeah...it was alright sort of thing.It's definitely worth a watch, but it's nothing you haven't already seen.",6,0,0,17 June 2011
Pacific Rim," Great monsters....ordinary acting
","People are giving this 10 stars?? Seriously? The first thing that struck me was the absolutely awful accents. If actors can't do an accent properly, they should just stick to their normal voice. The two 'Australians' (at least I think that's what they were suppose to be) were absolutely terrible. And Idris's English accent was pretty ordinary. In fact, apart from Rinko and Charlie, the acting was below what it should have been. The two 'science guys' were way over the top...but not believable. And Ron Perlman just couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. (sorry Ron!!)But hey, I wasn't expecting to be riveted by the story line, I went to see Cloverfield V Transformers and visually, it was spectacular and really well done.It felt a lot like it was trying to be Godzilla, with a few zany bits and giggles thrown in....some of which almost worked.Leave you're brain at the popcorn stand and enjoy the visual feast. Was certainly worth a watch but I can't see myself adding it to the DVD collection.",5,2,8,24 July 2013
Avatar," Fantastic visuals, AWFUL story
","Well, like some of you, I registered solely so I could vent my spleen about this movie. James Cameron should be ashamed of this plot line. How many times must we watch a movie that portrays 'the military' as just not giving a hoot about who they kill providing they get the minerals out of the ground. I was actually a bit angry about this movie. Must be because I thought the huge tree was great and, of course, the military just had to blow it up. For what?? Unobtainium? Is this the same unobtainium that they spoke of in 'The Core'? At least we saw what that was. I knew before I saw this that the plot was not much, but the plot has been done to death so many times before and it really is predictable and horrid.The performances were quite passable and I've got nothing to quibble about.Visually, yes, it's stunning. And I only watched it on a 42' LCD TV!! Somehow, I never quite got to see this at the theater. Mr Cameron has created an amazing world that is visually awesome. It almost sets a new benchmark for what can be achieved. It's just such a shame about the storyline! I'll most likely watch it again anyway!!",6,3,7,26 July 2010
Prometheus," Good, but a few blond moments....
","Having read quite a few of these reviews, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I saw this. I liked it - particularly Michael Fassbender's performance. I think it's well worth a watch. It looks stunning. It's not quite predictable though it certainly has a few 'doh' moments where real people surely wouldn't be as dumb as some of the characters are at times. It's an interesting plot but it's one of those films that raises a few more questions than it answers.... at least at first. I'll have to get the DVD and watch it some more methinks....It's not the classic film that Alien was and is certainly not as cut and dried - don't be surprised if you find yourself scratching your head at times. Definitely recommended viewing for the sci-fi fan...perhaps not highly recommended though.",7,2,4,21 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Disappointed.
","I have to admit feeling a bit flat after watching this. I didn't have any expectations one way or the other when I went to see it. But it felt a bit slow and pedestrian at times. I've read where other people have said it's 'phenomenal' but I'm sorry, I just don't see it that way. I didn't find Bane as a particularly well thought out character and even his speech didn't quite seem to suit the part. In other areas of the film, it just wasn't convincing. I really think the last two Batman films had a lot more flare than this. I wasn't looking at my watch during the show (like I kept doing during the last 40 minutes of Lord of the Rings III) but I wasn't far off. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film but it certainly doesn't feel like a great film. I won't be rushing out to grab the DVD when it comes out to watch it again. And fair warning, it's a long film too.",6,4,8,29 August 2012
