The Blair Witch Project," A truly unsettling movie...
","After seeing this film, some friends and I (all horror buffs) were trying to remember a film that had truly scared us as much as The Blair Witch Project - we all drew a blank. The unrehearsed, documentary feel and the nightmarish build to the terrifying conclusion is something that has stayed with me for a few days now. The final shot has to be one of the most disturbing on film. And all of this from a low-budget, mostly video production with almost no blood or violence and no annoying hipster rock soundtrack. I'll definitely think twice before ever camping again...A horror masterpiece.",10,2,4,28 April 1999
