Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," AMAZING, better than expected, I saw things I never thought I would see!
","The thing I really loved about this movie is the new ways we saw the force work. They really expanded on it's true power, rather that moving a chair, or choking someone, it really went to the next step!  Darth Maul was too low key, I wanted more of him.  The most exciting parts of the movie are without a doubt the pod races, and the lightsaber duels!TRULY REVOLUTIONARY!",10,0,0,19 January 2000
