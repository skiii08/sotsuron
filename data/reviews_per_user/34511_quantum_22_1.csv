Requiem for a Dream," Pinpointing the real issues of problematic drug use
","Aside from being a cinematographically and artistically beautiful piece, I like this movie a lot because it actually addresses the REAL problems about drug use without reverting to clich√©s: unethical subscriptions from doctors, loosing control, bad conditions for taking drugs, lack of empathy of the surroundings/society, failure of society to address people in need of help, social stigmatization, failure of users to acknowledge when things spiral out of control, ... The point-of-view is also the drug user(s), giving this movie authenticity and credibility. On the other hand, the perspective also shifts constantly from the very real to the almost surreal.A must-see for everyone opposing OR supporting liberal drug laws.",8,0,1,30 July 2013
