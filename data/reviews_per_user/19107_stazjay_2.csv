Walk the Line," This movie certainly Walks the Line!
","When I entered the theatre, I sat in my seat and snored through the boring trailers. I almost walked out the cinema due to my immense annoyance at the trailers and adverts. However, when Walk the Line began, from the very second, I could sense what I was about to watch was going to rock my world. The style, the class and the storytelling is so articulate and magnificent. The directing is totally unique to that of the stereotypical biopic. As for the actors- Joaquin Phoenix growls his way to perfection as the uninhabited Johnny Cash. He perfects the voice to the stage actions to the private incidents with dignity and prowess. I really believed him when he sang the timeless songs. Who can forget Reese Witherspoon's performance? The Oscar for Best Actress is deservedly hers. June Carter was sensitive, amusing and caring. Reese's portrayal was honest and real to me. I truly felt as though these two young actors were in the shoes of both performers. The vocal coaching by T Bone Burnett really paid off- their voices were perfect. Walk the Line isn't over-hyped- the hype is justified. The Oscar nominations are not in vain. But I have one niggle- WHY oh WHY is the movie not nominated for Best Picture? If only it was, it would be the cherry on top of the tastiest cake in recent years. Brilliant, show-stopping! 10/10",10,0,0,14 February 2006
The Ring," Best horror film in years
","I must admit that the first time I watched this movie I didn't understand it and found it not at all scary. During the second time around, I came to realise how cleverly written this film is. The writers must be extremely proud that they have made such a brilliant film. I sat on my bed scared behind a cushion when Samara came out the TV. The thought of the whole Ring legend frightens me too, and each time I watch the film I stay awake at night afraid!!! The acting is great and I feel the directors chose the correct people to play them, especially Daveigh Chase,who plays the cursed child Samara. I think Daveigh is a fab actress, considering her age.
