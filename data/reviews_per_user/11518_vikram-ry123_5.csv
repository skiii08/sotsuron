Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," 'A Game of Shadows' Not Exactly Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes! A Different Packaging of Sherlock Holmes.
","It was 3rd January morning 10:15 AM; a 2$ ticket in my hand; seat number F 3; second block, fourth floor, BTM, Bangalore. More or less 32 people are sitting inside, 20 stuffs working outside the hall; two snacks shops; four security officers, including one woman officer; three ticket counters; two elevators and two escalators, one is coming up and one is going to down. This is the way of expression that I have learned from 'Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows'.The film shows Sherlock Holmes' superhuman intellectual brainstorming, meditation and precautions of every-single steps; before taken by his enemies. I think, Guy Ritchie's version of Holmes is full of errors. The climax is started in the beginning,Professor Moriarty: Are you sure you want to play this game?Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.Professor James Moriarty, the role is played by Jared Harris is an unforgettable villainy. Holmes's elder brother, Mycroft Holmes was expected more roles that was missing. The 'slow wits' and puns are the only entertainment, that at least make the audience laugh.Dr. Watson: Did you just kill my wife?Sherlock Holmes: I timed it perfectly!The movie is primarily based on the short story 'The Final Problem' by Sir A.C. Doyle and also from many of the other Sherlock Holmes stories: 'The Sign of Four'; 'The Greek Interpretor'; 'Valley of Fear'; 'The Speckled Band'; 'The Dying Detective'; 'Bruce Partington Plans'; 'The Adventure of the Creeping Man' and 'The Second Stain' are included in one single motion picture. Isn't it sounds idiotic?Sherlock defeats Professor Moriarty by pulling him over Reichenbach Falls, with both of them falling to their apparent deaths. Holmes is later shown to have survived. This was meant to be the final Sherlock Holmes story, 'The Final Problem' by Sir A.C. Doyle.Robert Downey Jr.'s 1992 biographical role on Chaplin is noticed in Holmes. It is not exactly that I read and imagine about the literary character of Sherlock Holmes. Calculations, actions and re-actions are overdosed. There are many abstract and unnecessary clips broke the central story, was totally unexpected. Cinematography is like an artistic boon of modern technologies. Here science, arts and literature are brilliantly juxtaposed.Sherlock Holmes riding a pony, 'Slow and steady wins the race' is a good wit and moral. Overall 'Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows' is entertaining.",6,1,2,4 January 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," My Belgian Friend, Tintin!
","Last Sunday, sister 28, brother-in-law 32 and me 24; three of us all adults went to watch the latest Spielberg film 'The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn', we put some extra-large glasses in our eyes; the experience to watch a WETA digital animated motion picture technology in 3D is superb. John Williams' sound composition for the motion picture purpose is awesome.Tintin is a legendary detective and journalist boy character by Herge. I was a kid, only 3, my sister and neighbor sister Lucy, both were 6 and they were good playmates. Lucy was my first love to introduce and love Tintin. Her father has two children, both are beautiful girls and every year they go to Calcutta international Book Fair, they bought TINTINs. It was in 1989; I was first introduced with the Belgian friend, 'The Calculus Affair' or 'Calculus Er Kando' – in Bengali is the first face-to-face introduction with all the evergreen characters from the history of creation.In those days I was too little to understand the heavy ideas that Herge put into those large glossy papers. I like Tintin, his looks; Captain Archibald Haddock, 'Billions of blue blistering barnacles!'; Thomson and Thompson, their foolish intelligence and the smartest little 'Snowy' or 'Kuttus' is better known to me. I draw several poses and still keep those paintings with care. 'Tintin in Tibet' was my first self-collection, that I saved from daily tiffin money in the school days to buy one by one in every month, it last only up to 6 of the books. Then a partnership collection with my classmate Arunava Roy, we pay half and half to read the complete series. 'Tintin and the Lake of Sharks', was the last book we bought together.I always look for the cheapest collection of Tintin and it was 'Anandomela' – a leading teenage monthly in Bengal. They publish in two or three bunch edition in their magazines. I unpin those pages and set them into one single comic book edition. It was a huge part of my collection too. ‎ Dibyendu Nandi, my neighbor brother, he has the book 'The Castafiore Emerald' ('Panna Kothai' – in Bengali) I took it and didn't returned him for several months, finally he asked for the branch. I was intentionally waiting for his forgetfulness to grow up my collections but the trick didn't worked. The last book I read when I was 17, 'In the Land of the Soviets'; it takes time because it was the costliest of the whole series.Recently, it was an exciting conversation with Premjit Nath, on 13 November at 14:38Me: Yesterday I see both 'The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Immortals' in 3D and my suggestion, attend them only in 3D the experience, just unforgettable!Premjit Nath: If pocket allows only one; then which one?Me: ‎Premjit da, Tintin TinTin I grow up enjoying this character so much, and Spielberg always fulfills the huge expectations of entertainment. Lots of unforgettable memories and emotions related with our Belgium friend Can't betray 'Tintin'! Premjit Nath: Agreed can't betray our childhood friend.About the film; people around the world read Tintin is well known about The Adventure of the Unicorn. So nothing to say special. And who didn't know Tintin, I am keeping the story in secret to watch and invent the adventures themselves.",7,0,3,16 November 2011
Life of Pi," 'Life of Pi', The meaning of the floating algae island; is God exists?'
","Synopsis:'Life of Pi' Yann Martel's 2001 best-selling novel, is a magical adventure story of a young boy, Pi Patel, son of Santosh Patel, a zoo owner living in Pondicherry, India. The family decides to move the zoo to Canada, hitching a ride on a huge freighter. After a shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a 26-foot lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, all fighting for survival.Review: Novel 'Life of Pi', and film director Ang Lee's version seems, I never imagine its possible to combine the philosophy into the film screen. The imagination through the novel was fantasy in my opinion when the film version is magically realistic. The use of modern highest resource of 3D technology is a merit of success achieved by the art-direction team, I salute. The film made me speechless even after it ends I was sitting and waiting to watch more and more. I was thinking where the digital entertainment is sailing the boat for the NextGen?The movie contains good sense of humor regarding the dialogs. In market, Pi was following a girl he saw at the dance class. When she catches Pi and asked why he is following? Pi innocently asked at the dance class she ended two wrists joined loosely cupped hands, what does it mean, he wonders. The girl tells him, the lotus hides in the forest. Pi asked, 'Why lotus will hide in the forest?'At the end when Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger left unceremoniously, Pi says, 'All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.'Is God exists? The narrator promises at the beginning that he will prove God exists. Well, in Yann Martel's book he did, but in Ang Lee's movie, did he or not? In 2012 film 'Life of Pi', you see the floating island of vegetation with its own ecosystem that could be boarded and had animals living on it out in the middle of the ocean. It seems far-fetched, but does anything you notice in the movie?Pi Patel's confession of faith was regarding Lord Vishnu, the Vedic God who masters the past, present and future, the one who supports, sustains and governs the Universe and originates and develops all elements within. Its called Vishnu sleeps in the ocean of milk with his companions. Did you see very carefully the structure of the floating island? The art-director shaped the island like sleeping Lord Vishnu! I was surprised to see the art work at a glance.In my opinion the movie is a lifetime experience, so don't miss the movie and as well if you did not read the book then read it too. This is one of the remarkable philosophy of film-art.",9,2,5,5 December 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Epic Mythology v The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (A Review)
","The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies was Peter Jackson's adaptation of the popular fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien. Yesterday I was lucky to count on the final act of the Hobbit trilogy on 3D at INOX theater, Jayanagar, Bangalore. The experience was awesome and not comparable to any such high end production. It was an experience, the inner feeling, at a point of time I was thinking, if such story continues for the lifetime may be I would love to keep watching and watching. Yeah! 144 minutes of the video was passed like an eye blink.Some important facts from the movie I wanted to highlight in this review. The epic mythological standard of the Hobbit story is undoubted. In the Indian epic mythology, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, or The Greek epic mythology, the Iliad, or all the literatures of the mythical standards have one thing in common, either a tragic end or the downfall of the heroes.In the epic, The Ramayana, Ravana who was a good king, built the first democratic republic in the human history for his people. He had wealth, gold, and luxury in his kingdom. He was the conqueror of the heaven by defeating the demigods. But at the end he had lost the battle with Rama, an ordinary human prince from Ayodhya, India. Because the one mistake of Ravana by stealing Sita, the wife of Rama. Ravana did not listen to his ministers, brothers and wife to send back Sita, and protect the kingdom. In-stead of the sick king declared his own followers as the traitors and banished them from his kingdom. Here in the Hobbit, the exiled dwarf king of Erebor, Thorin Oakenshield, became blind of all his promises to the people and his followers once he got back the gold treasury. The life of people seemed no value to him in compare to the gold. He lost his conscience and became sick by not trusting his own people for the gems stone, called the heart of the mountain.In the epic, The Mahabharata, Duryodhana, the elder prince of Hastinapura, India. He had claimed to be the king of Hastinapura. He had conspiracies and several false promises made to his cousin brothers for the share of the wealth of his kingdom. In spite of fulfilling his promises he chosen the war which took place at Kurukshetra and ended up after 18 days of devastating destruction and the complete ruin of his life and the kingdom. Duryodhana told, 'Without the war, I will not give even a needle worth of land'. Here in the Hobbit, Thorin, forgot of his promises made to Bard, the dragon slayer and the descendant of Girion, the Lord of Dale and to his people. Bard saved the life of Thorin and his followers. He and his people helped them, by giving food, comfort, and nourishment. Without their contribution it was impossible to Thorin to get back to the mountain. But when the time came to reclaim the promises made by Thorin to Brad and his people; Thorin chosen the war. He was not ready to pay a single gold penny to them.In the epic, The Iliad, Priam, the king of Troy and his elder son, Hector, both of them were aware of the mistake done by Paris. Helen, queen of Sparta, who eloped with Paris, the younger son of Priam, was the cause of the Trojan War. Perhaps Priam act at the right moment to send back Helen and protect Troy. But he did not, which caused the downfall of Troy. In Hobbit, Thorin, it was look like, though he had a small strength of army which was not sufficient to go for a war, declared his own downfall.May be, he could allied with Bard, and Thranduil, the Elven king, have had been helped by the alliance a smooth win against Azog, the Orc chieftain and his Goblin army. At the end, Thorin could have a happy life by ruling, Erebor, until the end of his career. Which he did not act at the right moment, and bring his own downfall at the hand of Azog.Albeit, Peter Jackson had no hand on that part of the story, as, I hope, it was all written by J. R. R. Tolkien in his novel. Albeit the commonness of the Hobbit version of the mythology, here I found beautiful and unforgettable supporting characters like, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Legolas, Saruman, Radagast, and Galadriel. These characters were acted and protected the role of wise, honest, courageous, who were changed the permutations and combinations of the Hobbit, the epic mythology.Thanks!Always love, Vikram",9,4,10,19 December 2014
X-Men: First Class," Why you call them 'X- Men'? Here a 'First Class' answer is ready in this film.
","X-Men: First Class is the rewind version of the story. Magneto have had no choice! Michael Fassbender did an excellent score. Professor X was expected with more personality that I missed in James McAvoy... Kevin Bacon, man you are an excellent villain! You preserved more hollowness in disguise. This movie is worth watching. if there are mutants hiding around us they will love it...:P I was astonished of the main characters that are existed in the glossy Marvel Comics pages. They did appear with no alteration in the movie. I was appreciated with this work. Director Matthew Vaughn, he did an excellent job. He has worked like an eye witness in every impact of the story. The massage was very tough to reveal but it is well calculated and involved with the political clips of Cuba-Russia attack of 1963; not to break any relationship between Russia and USA but you will happy to know that the mutants are behind the diplomacy of breaking the war. :PThis film already make a debt and it will be loved by generation XX.",6,1,6,9 July 2011
