Captain Phillips," A slick thriller but not enough of a story to support a plot.
","The problem with basing a film on a true story is that the true story needs to be of sufficient interest. Any story that can be adequately summarised in one sentence - 'A ship is hijacked and the Captain taken prisoner but is then rescued by the US Navy' is not going to be a great film. 
That said, Hanks is excellent as always and the actors playing the Somalian hijackers are also very good. The film is well=paced and there is sufficient level of tension to keep the viewer's interest. BUltimately, however, the film leaves a feeling of 'Is that it?' The final scene in which a shaken Hanks receives a medical is bizarre - and seems like a jarringly self-indulgent last plea for an Oscar! 'Hey Academy! Look at my great acting!'",6,0,0,8 January 2018
Empire of the Sun," Sentimental direction spoils Ballard's surreal masterpiece
","I watched this film when it came out as a child and enjoyed it. However, it doesn't stand up to rewatching in the 21st century due to the level of mawkish sentimentality - just how many times can Spielberg fall back on that cringe-inducing 'character-slowly-salutes-another-character' device in one film? I think it happens FIVE times in this movie. It is perhaps the laziest and most nauseating device (at least to non-American audiences), and to use it so repeatedly in one film is unbelievable. 
Bale was undoubtedly a precocious talent but you can almost see the direction here, as if you can hear in EVERY scene Spielberg's voice 'Ok, now look around the room in wonder, now take a step forward, now put out your arms, now turn around'. It all seems so hilariously wooden, at one point I thought a chair and table were doing the best acting in the room.
The character of Jim, watched as an adult, is also so unbelievably irritating that in moments when we are supposed to be feeling tension and hoping he doesn't get caught, I was actually hoping that he get swiftly bayoneted so hat the whole tedious film could be over.",5,2,5,1 March 2018
12 Years a Slave," Not just bad but criminally inaccurate
","This is a terrible film for many reasons and I could go on at length about the over-simplified characterisation, the 'tell-us-something-we-don't-know' of the story, and the dismal Terance Mallick-style 'extremely lengthy lingering shots must equal something profound' but none of those things would really matter (it's only a film, right?) except that this nonsense will be viewed by some people as a true reflection of US society. For god'sake, this ridiculous depiction of how the northern states of the US was an idyllic utopia for black people (and only the nasty evil south was racist) is not even true NOW in 2014! Never mind how much this distorts the reality of the early 19th century. You can go to Phildelphia, get on a bus, see the black homeless lying in the street, see how STILL America has not made amends for the abomination that was slavery. Race riots and the fight for equality and end to racism were late 20th century events - and yet this disgraceful garbage sets out to rewrite history and paint the northen states of the USA in an absurdly egalitarian light.",1,20,40,5 November 2014
The Martian," Good for the first 90 minutes but tediously overlong
","The first hour is interesting and engaging but the plot starts to tail off after 90 minutes and the final hour is dull and irritating. The attempts at humourous scenes fall flat and detract from the tension which has been building. Ditto the choice of music - as if 2001 A Space Odyssey had used Priscilla Queen of the Desert for its soundtrack. Ultimately, this film seems to be confused about what it wants to be. It starts out as a gripping thriller but then turns into something weirdly light-hearted. A pity, it showed promise but didn't deliver.",6,0,0,9 April 2018
