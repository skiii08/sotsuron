The Finest Hours," Would have been good but...
","I was looking forward to watching this film since the trailer looked amazing and I love these kind of action movies. Unfortunately, Chris Pine spoiled the movie for me during his appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Not everyone knows about nautical accidents so for him to go on the show and say exactly what happens in the film (to the point of saying how many people died, etc) ruined the film for me. I think he needs to be prepped by the film's marketing/pr manager next time he gives an interview...Watching a film where you already know what is going to happen kind of takes the suspense away from it. Thank you, Chris Pine...",5,5,13,7 February 2016
