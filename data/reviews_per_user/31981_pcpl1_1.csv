Angels & Demons," I am disappointed
","I read about 2 months ago Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. Then my wife read it. Yesterday on Monday May 9, 2011 my wife and I saw the movie Angels and Demons on Blue Ray extended version. When I read the book I was thrilled by the writing of Dan Brown, the excitement and the story set before my eyes. The movie is so different from the original story, lots of elements have either disappeared or have been changed in such a way that I think it does not reward Dan Brown enough. Mind you the special effects are spectacular and Tom Hanks like usual is brilliant in the role of Professor Langdon but I must say that both my Wife and I are disappointed. Where is Kobler??? Langdon's girlfriend in the book is warm and emotional. the actress who plays her in the movie is cold as ice. The assassin who in the book appears so powerful looks like a geek in the movie. For just a movie without reading the book its OK but after reading the book this movie is a flop.",6,1,2,10 May 2011
