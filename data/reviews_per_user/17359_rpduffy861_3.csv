Insidious: Chapter 2," Absolute garbage!
","I used to love horror movies. I've decided they are basically extinct and have been for a long time. Insidious 1 was decent and I made it through the entire movie because I was engaged with the story more so than the cheesy cheap scares(that we've all seen a million times and are actually exhausting to watch). With that being said, I just rented #2 tonight and turned it off half way through. What absolute garbage --- exhausting. I am done with Hollywood junk..DONE DONE DONE! I wish I could get my 1 buck back. The acting was awful. The scares were not scary but super cheesy. The story, boring and they just tell it to you. Urgh. Don't even waste your time!",1,13,26,18 January 2014
Come and See," Better have your doc write you a prescription for depression and anxiety --- this movie provokes deep emotions!
","I've always been deeply intrigued by the atrocities committed against humanity during war, specifically WWII. I thought I had seen every WWII war movie there is to see. I accidentally stumbled across this gem when I was searching for the best Halloween movies and #100 was Come and See. After reading all the reviews here on IMDb I absolutely had to watch it for myself. I was not prepared for anything this spectacular, it's truly, like many others have already stated, 'A MASTERPIECE!' I watched it last evening, alone and was crying by the second scene and never really stopped crying. It's exhausting, painful, and an emotional drain but quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen thousands. I would not recommend this be viewed with young children. If you are in high school and you are learning about WWII history you might want to check this one out but be prepared to become mildly depressed. I haven't been able to really think of anything else since watching it last night. I almost feel like I need some sappy, happy-go lucky book or movie to make me feel better. They don't make movies like this one very often, in fact, I can't think of anything in recent history that even comes close.",10,11,15,2 November 2013
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Very Boring and utter garbage
","Absolute garbage and incredibly boring. I couldn't wait for it to end but sat through the entire piece of garage. I don't care what others think about this film or that they want to see this film (go ahead I'm not your nanny), but I do want to express how overly-hyped this so- called 'artsy' and metaphorical POS this film is. I wasn't shocked, I was bored to tears. There isn't a story line, no character development, no emotional attachment, no visual stimulation (unless you get your kicks out of crap eating and forced sodomy) & no it doesn't take a Harvard degree to try & come up with some imaginable intellectual point as some people have tried to shove down our throats and pretend they are 'special' because they have found room in their perverted souls to justify this film. I don't find anything exciting or entertaining or educational about this p.o.s. film. If I want to know about Nazi's, WWII, Fascism, Communism, Pedophilia, Homosexuality, Murder, Power, Depravity --- well I wouldn't go here for it that's for darned sure. I heard the film maker got killed after this movie came out - at least something good came of it's release.",1,14,31,27 October 2013
