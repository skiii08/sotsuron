The Blair Witch Project," eh
","You've heard the hype: the rebirth of the horror film, most frightening movie of the year, whatever..sadly, the best thing going for Blair Witch is it's pr campaign. The endlessly bickering characters are straight out of an episode of the Real World, while the cinematography is too nudgingly amateurish to be taken seriously.  Only the chilling beginning (the small town urban legend everyone can identify with) and the truly breathtaking finale can hold up the sagging middle. Not completely disappointing, but in my audience, there were more laughs and groans, then screams and gasps.",2,1,4,13 July 1999
