Raiders of the Lost Ark," The celluloid equivalent of dad jeans
","What can I say? It's one of these blockbusters from the past that enjoys a cult following among the 50+ year olds but is actually rather outdated, cartoonish, with some really bad acting across the board and an annoying soundtrack (and I usually like John Williams work). Perhaps the kids like it although I have my doubts because it's as uncool as it can be.",3,2,8,17 January 2020
Chinatown," An enigma
","One of those classics that earned their reputation at a time when character development was an excuse for lacking in everything else, including a title that actually makes sense. As I am catching up with quite a few of these old movies I never managed to watch at their time I see a pattern emerging. With Chinatown it's clear within 20 minutes that this is not going to pick up pace and actually care about storytelling. Instead you're supposed to be drawn into the characters. The rest is an incredulous string of events that could go on forever or end right here without making any difference.I very much appreciate film noir as a genre but this is not film noir. I am aware that I'm in the minority here but the boredom that this movie creates deserves no more than two stars. Good acting though but as said, you should develop characters for a purpose. Enough said.",2,0,0,15 April 2020
World War Z," Another Shakycam Mess
","How to write a film review when watching causes motion sickness? This is not a figure of speech. I mean it quite literally. Mr. Seresin, your chaotic camerawork ruins whatever this movie might have been, despite the ridiculous script. The constant close-ups, zooms, handheld wobbly panning even when there is no action. All to create that false resemblance of 'authenticity'. It simply doesn't work. Nonsense throughout, and unwatchable.",2,0,4,29 April 2020
The Impossible," Utter rubbish, going nowhere
","I gave this film a second try after not liking it much the first time round. That because I had been to Thailand and Sri Lanka, the places most affected by the tsunami. I have friends there and donated money to the community rebuilding efforts in one of the towns I had stayed in several times. But I was right, this is movie is a royal waste of time. The entire approach is wrong. The script sucks, the directing and acting is mediocre and the camera work... well, don't get me started. It's Shakycam all over, with the majority of scenes shot with relentless close ups, all for no reason other than screaming 'look how authentic!!' The actual tsunami scenes are shockingly realistic but that's about it. There is no real development from there, no context, nothing that would do justice to the global magnitude of the event. The story and photography suggest you should care about that one white family of five and even that doesn't work. All locals are nameless extras. Pointless and annoying to say the least.",2,1,16,4 May 2019
The Town," Bad Script, High Production Value
","It all feels right at the start but falls apart quickly. So the FBI knows all the time who the bank robbers are but for some reason they are allowed to keep going. The main witness from the first robbery falls in love with a mysterious Ben Affleck, 4 days after the robbery and despite her claim that she remembers all their voices. And of course the flower shop would have been raided years ago. This script is a joke. Three stars for the excellent camera work and for the fact that finally an Affleck movie in which he is not crying. That aside... not much of anything.",3,3,4,16 May 2020
Interstellar," Waste of time
",Matthew McConnaughey's Southern accent is unbearable. The story not very exciting. The whole thing a blend of boring and annoying. Quite an achievement.,1,0,5,30 April 2020
The Bourne Ultimatum," The crazyness continues
","This is Supremacy on steroids and that's not a good thing. And endless string of action scenes, all ruined by the horrible camera work which doesn't even stop when the action slows down. And the story... pure madness. The whole thing would be unwatchable if not for Matt Damon who is a great actor. I am still a fan of Identity but the three sequels are utter rubbish. Great theme song though.",3,0,2,12 April 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," How can a movie about Queen / Freddy Mercury be so boring?
",That's the big question. Bohemian Rhapsody falls flat and I can't tell exactly why. Or maybe I can. The acting is okay but not as outstanding as all the hype suggested (an Oscar for the dentures would be in order). The newly recorded songs come close but still sound like cover versions. The story follows the main events but seems to leave out important milestones in the Seventies. And the technical aspects - cinematography and editing - just don't do much to add any excitement. The whole thing is just too bland. It's not the most wasted two hours but not enough to give it more than 4 stars. And I loved Queen back in the day.,4,2,4,19 September 2019
The Italian Job," Get me a copy of the original. Quick!
","I never felt quite comfortable with the 2003 version of The Italian Job. Rewatching it for the first time in ten years I didn't like it any better. It's a slick but terribly clichéd film that annoys with its cast of cookie cutter characters and the relentless pandering to teenage audiences. Just the right vehicle for third rate actors like Mark Wahlberg. About as unintelligent as The Fast and Furious. Giving it three stars simply because of Charlize Theron who is the only credible cast member. As others said, the first 15 mins are good. After that.... Ugh.",3,0,2,29 October 2019
Independence Day," Oh Dear....
","How this ridiculous teenage fantasy has not instantly ended the career of Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, James Rebhorn, Bill Pullman and so many others is beyond me. The plot is idiotic, the acting horrendous, the dialogues cringeworthy. Oh wait, it's a Roland Emmerich movie. Of course. He hasn't done anything that makes sense in his entire career. Embarrassing.",1,1,3,3 June 2020
Lawrence of Arabia," Excruciating
","This film and its reputation are an enigma. I could not stand the western actors playing Arabs, the bias and stereotypes. Apparently not only could you get away with that a long time ago but also collect awards. This movie needs a reassessment and be stripped of most of them. Except for the cinematography which is good. But three hours of all this is an excruciating test of one's patience and tolerance of clichÃ©s.",1,3,7,6 March 2020
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Unwatchable
","This sequel is simply boring and none of the characters are likable enough to care about. Not worth watching, not then, even less now, 22 years on.",2,5,13,22 February 2019
From Dusk Till Dawn," Pointless and disgusting
","He wasn't directing this piece but still this is a Quentin Tarantino movie throughout. So be warned if you can't stand any of them like I do. Given that George Clooney and Harvey Keitel are in it, two excellent actors, I thought perhaps this couldn't be so bad. Big mistake. This is a messed up gore fest, a C movie with a ridiculous plot. I'm pretty certain some of the better actors must have regretted to have any role in. Two stars only for the production value but otherwise it's a 'zero'. Avoid.",2,0,1,23 February 2020
Zero Dark Thirty," Slooowww...
","Go watch this movie if you're having trouble finding sleep. As others have said before the slow pace is what's so annoying and there is no good argument for it. The search and final take out of OBL took ten years, that doesn't mean the movie should feel like ten years, too. Decent acting given the bad script, not so good editing, some kind of soundtrack in the background that is hard to hear. A missed opportunity as the subject is of course great material for grand cinema. I guess you have to like The Hurt Locker to like this. I sure didn't.",2,0,4,10 October 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Cringeworthy
","Ugh... Where to start. This is the kind of humour that might excite some 16 year olds. It's just silly, gross, over the top and extremely American and by that I mean loud and annoying. Yes, it's meant to be exactly that but that doesn't make it a good movie.",2,0,1,20 May 2020
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig ruined the franchise
","I keep this real short because no matter what I say, Craig fans will disagree. I understand that Bond evolves. That's how it was done for decades and it always worked. Until they picked the wrong guy. Craig simply doesn't cut it. And sadly, Casino Royale is just the first in a series of new Bonds that proves this point every minute. He just isn't a credible or likable Bond. This plain vanilla acting, the lack of any chemistry with female leads, the complete lack of humour: it's all wrong. Before Craig took over, Bond films were highly anticipated events, watched and rewatched and loved across generations. That era is over. Craig's legacy is that with him, the films became what none of the other instalments ever were: boring and painful to sit through. We're now supposed to take these plots seriously? Ugh! Bonds are meant to be fun, full stop.",1,4,17,14 April 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," Not good, not good at all
","An incredibly messed up farfetched story. Action scenes ruined by the excesses of Oliver Wood's crazy shaky handheld photography, a style popular in the mid noughties which luckily has disappeared since. If it wasn't for Matt Damon, The Bourne Supremacy would be totally unwatchable. With him and the great Frank's Potente, it's an okay movie but weak sequel, strangely overrated. I rather watch The Bourne Identity three times in a row.",4,1,4,11 April 2019
The Birds," I'd rather watch paint dry
","Apparently this picture worked when it was released almost 60 years ago. Why? I have no idea. I remember watching it as a teen in the Seventies, not being impressed. Now, some 40 years later I gave it the benefit of doubt and watched it again. Boy, what a stinker this is. One of the most overrated, underwhelming 'thrillers' ever made. Hitchcock did great movies before and after The Birds, which makes this flop a real mystery. What were they thinking? The plot is dragging out forever and the boredom just gets more unbearable with every minute that passes. Yes there is character development, the whole first hour is reserved for that. Just that none of the characters is remotely likable to make me care about any of them. The whole exercise is utterly pointless. In short: a monumental waste of time.",1,4,8,7 March 2019
