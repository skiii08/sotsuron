Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Relies on technology at the expense of story
","This was a disappointing movie.  While I feel that the original Star Wars was one of the best films I've ever seen, this one is a waste of time. There's a saying that's been around in the computer industry for some years: Garbage in garbage out.  No matter how good a computer and computer program you have, if your data is worthless, your output will be worthless.  In spite of all the wonderful special effects and computer animation in this movie, the fact that it has a silly story ruins it.  Watching this movie is like playing a video game that's rigged so you know you can't lose.",4,0,1,20 June 1999
