10 Cloverfield Lane," Brace yourself the chemical attacks are coming
","What is it like to be a chemical attack survivor in a mysterious man's private shelter ? wait a minute, is it really a chemical attack or he is a lying psycho kidnapper ? 10 Cloverfield Lane a great horror, mystery movie, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle), John Goodman (Howard), John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett). a solid movie, great acting especially from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman, awesome soundtrack, smart dialogues. the scenes are perfect and attract your full attention to the movie. the only problem is there is only a little Boredom and emptiness, but overall the movie is astonishing. final rating 9/10",9,3,4,12 August 2016
Warcraft," Enjoyable and Interesting
","another interesting fictional medieval story similar to the lord of the rings' world but not as great as it was, an enjoying conflict between the orcs and the humans with some magic. Warcraft, starring Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Ben Schnetzer, Daniel Wu, and directed by Duncan Jones. entertaining movie, with good story development. but not convincing acting, some silliness. I think Dominic Cooper was a bad choice for king Llane rule. not very good graphics. good soundtracks from Game of Thrones' Ramin Djawadi. despite the problems i think you will enjoy the movie especially if you are a tolkien's fictional world fan. in fact, i'm interested in seeing a sequel for this movie. final rating 7/10",7,1,3,11 August 2016
