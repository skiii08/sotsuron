50 First Dates," Funniest Part!(spoiler)
","How funny was the part at the beginning where the lady was talking about him and she says in anoher language...'He pounded me like mallard duck' and you see it in subtitles. When i saw that i thought i was back to old school adam sandler movies like happy and billy. This was still one of his better though, funny and a good story for Adam.",8,0,0,23 February 2004
The Girl Next Door," Review Of This movie(*spoilers)
","Before i begin my review, i just want to say that I haven't seen a movie i hated in a long time. I am hard to please so i try to see the best films possible because i am a movie buff. When i saw the girl next door i was not expecting the Godfather, or Gladiator, but something interesting and funny...like Old School or American Pie. After watching this insight was shattered. I am not trying to start a fight with anyone, but THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!! The plot was unbelievably dumb, and it seemed like it kept dragging on and on. It gets really stupid when at the end you find out they made a 'sex' ed video. Was that supposed to be funny? And the movie was supposed to be about a porn star that moves next door to a high school nerd, and half way through the movie, she is basically forgotten, because the lil annoying kid gets in trouble with her manager, who was also extremely annoying. This is the worst movie of 2004, and should be on the imdb bottom 100. Oh yeah that kid is not tom cruise so he should stop trying to be. this movie is a sucky version of risky business. 3/10",4,0,1,14 April 2004
