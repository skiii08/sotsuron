Insidious: Chapter 2," If the first was a hit, this one double's it
","Horror films are really difficult I think to provide a sequel towards them because audiences are not like expecting a sequel to many of films of the horror genre because to me they seem like one off sagas and a sequel usually expands the original story too much. Well Insidious was great to me and I really enjoyed how different it was. When I first heard about the sequel I certainly didn't want it to happen. After watching the trailer I felt a bit more optimistic about it but not something I would go out of my way to watch to be honest.Later on it got and the reviews and ratings came in and 90% of them where positive which shocked me so I thought I will watch it. So when I did I was so shocked on how it was made. It was fantastic and not a lot of horror movies scared me but this has a terrifying sense to it which James Wan does very well with his films. The style is very similar to the first film such as dramatic music in the background to make the jump scenes even worse. The camera work is the same with the bizarre shots used and the lighting specifics. The second film left my mouth open and I was unsure what actually happened at the very end and this film explains it all. So much detail went into it and it truly explained the origin of the demon that was inside Josh and it blew my mind away from just having the certain ideas in the first film, and then to explain all of them in the second installment. Absolute brilliant. If you are a big horror fan I would recommend this because its truly what horror is about these days and stuff like this will keep the horror genre what it used to be.",8,0,0,8 January 2014
This Is the End," Satisfying as it could be
","There are not many elements for this film to be significant to others because its basic instinct is to show the audience what they can do with an end of the world idea. I think action wise, it was pretty awful as I thought, spending this much money it could of been done a fair bit better because it seemed stupid in ways. The comedic side towards this film absolutely sold it to me. It was just full of actors that I adore. Seth Rogan and Jay Baruchel play both main characters and I did enjoy their whole storyline and backdrop. The party scene was by far my favourite. The comedy was just brilliant. Michael Cera usually annoys me but in this he did provide me with a lot of laughs. The film didn't absolutely annihilate the audiences expectations with the action however with the actors that are chosen they really suit the film and this type of comedy. I think if the majority of these were not chosen I would not of enjoyed the movie as I did. If you are keen on these actors and love the past projects most of them have been in then you will certainly like this.",7,1,4,26 January 2014
Sinister," The trailer says it all
","When this movie was unreleased and the trailer was brought out. It looked extremely promising. A newly imported horror that genuinely looked terrifying. The villain was something different and that's how you will succeed in the horror genre. Personally from watching the movie it really had nothing special about it that was already in the trailer. The thing that it most had going for it was the jump scares and they where actually rather rare. The storyline was very interesting and its great to see a horror plot that extends my interests. Ethan Hawke played a true crime author looking for another best seller. His idea was to base it around the previous murders that occurred over the years and is researching into them. More and more he gets into the hidden messages behind them he finds out that once you see the murderer, you wont get away. Overall the idea and plot is brilliant. I just don't think that this was very well thought through. I think that there could of been so much more added to the storyline and made it that much creepier. The villain was brilliant as he had such a frightening face and that is what drawn me into watching it. Its a shame that I've written a poor review really.",6,0,0,29 December 2013
The Hangover Part III," What was the actual point in this film?
","I never post bad reviews but you know some films just generally need to leave it at the first/second film. This film is actually pointless. It has lost the whole agenda that the first film was popular for. All this is, is a fighting film. Its just action and that's not what the whole concept of the films are about. I think they have tried to be different with this approach but they have failed badly. What I like about the first two films is that they are funny, Alan can actually make the audience giggle. In this film he tries too hard and my facial express didn't change one bit. I think this was such a waste of money to go see and I feel ashamed for the production company as they make the whole franchise seem awful. I would not recommend this to any viewers unless they are under 12. Oh wait you need to be over 15. Terrible movie.",3,2,4,4 January 2014
A Walk to Remember," Brilliantly Done Drama
",Nicholas Sparks truly does shine on his work with the whole drama saga. Having written 'The Notebook' and 'Dear John'. This is a truly breathtaking story and it stood out to me so much. The idea of bringing two opposites together and forming something brilliant is outstanding and its great to watch the development of the characters such as the boy Brandon 'Shane West'. His expand of emotions creates such a nice atmosphere that really had me stuck in for the time cost. Storyline cut short. A boy who is in a friend-zone with the wrong click gets into a heap of trouble and has to do several things in order for him to get out of it. Drama club is one of them and that is where his love for Jamie 'Mandy Moore'. The reputation and company that his friends expect him to stay with are more for them in the process of the movie as he becomes to realise that he generally loves Mandy and the journey that this film takes you on with them is amazing. Overall from not even read the book this movie is outstanding and I can honestly say its Nicholas's best work still. If you are into all of the romance and true love sort of thing then this is no where near a miss.,9,0,0,29 December 2013
Her," Took me by surprise!
","There were a lot of things that where going to put me off seeing this film until my girlfriend decided to watch it and I just happened to be there. The leading actor Joaquin Phoenix has never had a love off me and the same with Spike Jonze. I enjoyed Where The Wild Things Are and I do appreciate the work he did when producing Jackass cause I'm a huge fan of them movies and TV series. Initially though I was so wrong about this movie. The observational views and the way movie let you inside this man's mind and listen and feel every emotion he had. Scarlett Johansson provides a brilliant voice for Samantha and I couldn't picture it being anyone else's voice. Jonze really provided me with love, care, sadness, aggression. Which I never thought Id ever say in my life but I really cared for Theodore and this character really related to me. I think the hidden message is that you can just fall in love with a voice.As long as they say the right thing and they have feelings for you back. There is no need in any physically amendments. Beautiful film and an outstanding script that you could read all day long.",8,1,2,28 January 2014
