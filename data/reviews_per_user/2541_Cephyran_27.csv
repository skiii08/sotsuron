Alien 3," Sufficient...
","Certainly not the better of the series, but not terribly bad in any way. The most awkward thing is how the writers took the previous storyline and set it on fire. The composition is nothing spectacular, the characters are about as deep as a puddle, and the active and suspenseful elements forged in the first two don't carry over at all. However, I can say that the story never really slows down, and when it hesitates, its to good effect. So good effort, poor movie.",7,1,3,6 September 2003
As Good as It Gets," Emotional, dynamic, a well-made film...
","Jack Nicholson can do no wrong. The man is a veteran of the profession, and he is constantly giving a unique, dynamic personality to every character he portrays. And this film is no exception. It introduces us to some very deep, very real people, with real problems, and weaves them together in a series of events that build them up and bring them together. And through it all Nicholson retains his magic, delivering a superb portrayal of a man burdened with chronic obsessive-compulsive habits. It is a very effective film, and the acting is no less than one would expect from the likes of Nicholson and Helen Hunt. It's an honest, emotional, and often sad film with which you're bound to find yourself sympathizing. It's a strong story, strong cast, truly a dynamic film with an offbeat sense of humor that everyone is likely to enjoy. I strongly recommend you see this movie, whether with friends or family.",8,2,4,13 September 2004
Alien: Resurrection," No more character...
","Of the four, this may be the poorest simply because of character. The body of the cast has very little development, but the big problem is Ripley. She's just not herself anymore - she doesn't have the same drive as she did in the first three. For Resurrection we return to the typical run for your life format. In This case, its the humans trying to get off the ship before they're all made into lunch or hosts. Aliens pop up all over the place, and we're granted some brief, bloody moments. My real appreciation lies in the CG aliens - this advantage, however briefly seen, allowed the aliens to be more insectoid, and saves a costume budget. Granted, there are bonuses to having a physical alien suit, but for sheer realism, an uncostumable physique works better for the aliens.",7,1,1,6 September 2003
Beauty and the Beast," Beautiful, a classic Disney masterpiece...
","I like Disney movies. Either they're a fanciful adaptation of a fairy tale, or if not, they are visually exciting. Beauty and the Beast is by far one of Disney's best. It's an adorable story with romance, comedy, and a little slapstick action. The characters are really well developed, particularly Belle, the Beast and the many implements of the house that play significant roles. They also provide the humor. The clock Cogsworth and the Candlestick Lumiere have a dynamic friendship with a brotherly knack for irritating each other.The motherly teapot, voiced by Angela Lansbury, is the calm, steady minded member of the house, and more often than not she can sets things straight.This really is a magical, beautiful film, almost more a work of art. I think it deserved it's best picture nomination.",8,0,0,19 November 2004
Batman Returns," The better of the sequels...
","Batman Returns is a cool movie. It takes the magic from the first one and keeps it rolling. Of course, it can't fully match the effectiveness of the first one in sheer exhilaration, but its does okay. We return to Gotham City where we discover two new foes on Batman's roster - A short rotund villain called the Penguin, with political aspirations, and Catwoman, a lithe, agile woman with her own agenda. This movie succeeds for several reasons. First, it's Tim Burton directing again, and he knew how to make a good Batman movie. Second, Micheal Keaton reprises his role as the billionaire/Dark Knight with the same energy and dedication. Third, Danny DeVito in the role that everyone will remember him for, since he fills those shoes quite perfectly. And fourth, Michelle Pfeiffer in skin-tight black leather. I think we've got the attention of the entire male demographic narrowed down exactly. A new addition to the cast is the indelible Christopher Walken. Here is a man who can take any role and make it his own. He's a remarkable actor, with a hidden charm that you can almost sense even in his villainous roles.Batman Returns is a worthy successor to the first installment, and quite honestly, the best of the sequels, both in spirit and loyalty to the characters. I definitely recommend you see this movie.",8,0,0,19 November 2004
X-Men," Not just about special effects...
","I'm a big fan of everything Marvel, so I had high hopes for the X-Men. Needless to say, it live up to my expectations, though apparently not to those of many critics. It had its strong points. I always enjoy when there's a strong verisimilitude, that is, the integration of fictional elements into a very real feeling world. These were particularly strong with the opening scene, as well as Senator Kelly's speech. And the special effects were perfectly satisfactory for the film.One issue people may have had was how much more there was of a story and less usage of their powers, etc. Well, I feel that the X-Men is really more about the human element, and the powers are not so much gifts, but curses that they have to learn to live with, just as the people who are anti-mutant have to learn to live with mutants. If there was one weak point, it was the running time. But for a potential Saga-starter, it seems almost perfect. Not too long, just enough to give us a taste and leave us wanting more, then swoop in with an exceptional sequel and fulfill our desires. I highly recommend this to comic fans and movie fans alike.",7,0,0,4 October 2004
The Beach," An average movie at best...
","I really don't know what to say about this movie. I mean, I watched it with as much attention as possible. It just seemed like one of those movies you can forget about within days. Leo DiCaprio has some skill, and his performance in this movie is about on par with his Titanic role. He's not my favorite actor, but I don't judge actors by favoritism. I think I basically watched this movie because at the time, I was interested in finding out more about Virginie Ledoyen, the french actress who stars in this movie alongside DiCaprio and the rest of a relatively no-name cast.There were some action-like scenes, but nothing to really make a fuss about. Overall, I'd call this an average movie - not a stunner, but not a bomb.",7,4,8,19 November 2004
Alien," Cinema history...
","Alien is easily the greatest sci-fi horror movie. Weaving strong themes of suspense, fear, and the omnipresent darkness, Ridley Scott has created a masterpiece. The cinematography is profound, the acting is strong without being cheesy, the special effects are surprisingly good, and the alien itself is amazing. H R Giger has been influenced by an oceanic lifeform called the Phronima, and modelled the beast on this tiny organism, to great effect. The drool factor, while not fully controlled in this one, is still gross in a cool way, and there's so much fun in watching the behind the scenes footage. I highly recommend this for serious collections.",8,0,1,6 September 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," More of a date movie...
","This movie was okay in trying to get a point across - mainly, that of recreating a shakespearean play and bringing it to the bigscreen. The real highlight of the movie is the tumultuous relationship between Ledger and Stiles. Score points in a teen comedy for having the girl flash a teacher to help out a friend. In any case, this is a decent, date type of movie, one that's rent worthy unless you're a fan of Ledger or Stiles or Levitt.",7,0,0,2 September 2003
American Pie," A guy kind of movie...
","Certainly not the highest grade of comedy, but neither is it absolute grossout humor. In the first installment of this trilogy we meet the kids, this group of boys eager to lose their virginities by graduation. Now, while a little shallow in story, the characters carry it well, especially Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth together. Here we see a developed relationship of each guy and his respective girl, and there certainly is sweet romantic stuff, notably between Chris Klien and Mena Suvari. All in all, a defined guys night rental.",7,0,1,20 September 2003
Watchmen," A visually stunning narrative that captures the novel almost page-for-page with passionate respect
","I read the graphic novel before seeing the film. In turn I went into the film knowing what I was about to see - a living embodiment of the story with an ending I already knew. In doing so I immediately found myself asking these questions upon the start and ultimately the entire way through the film: Will the narrative of the film respect the narrative my mind constructed as I read the novel? Will the shots structurally reflect the same visual craftsmanship of the novel in it's move from page to screen? To answer this, we have to grasp that the way your mind reads a book and watches a movie are two vastly different faculties. With a book - in this case, the graphic novel - your mind constructs the voices, the tone, the choreography and the pacing as a response to the static visual narrative. In films it's all done for you. Ultimately, I found myself able to recall the novel page for page as each scene progressed. Very little of the narrative is rearranged, and those elements that have been shuffled are structured in a way so as to make the character development happen smoothly for an audience that has not read the book. I think the cleanest and simplest way I can describe it is that everything necessary to the telling of this story has been included and everything unnecessary has been left out without damaging the final product. As far as capturing the true visual of the novel, I think the film was completely successful. It is one of those works where the novel itself would have been literally used as the story-boarding. Speaking strictly from the perspective of a comic book fan, one of our greatest desires in film adaptations is seeing how successfully the cast matches the look and feel of the characters. This is also near-flawless. If there is one difference it is in the women, but this is to be expected because from my experience women in comics are never drawn realistically - figures are too toned, too elongated, faces are sharper, and they almost always are overtly sexualized. Obviously, the genre demands it. And the film manages to capture that, the combination of grace, sexuality and strength in a real body and real costumes. Rorshach comes out exactly as I picture him in the novel - a gruff, Punisher-like force of violent vengeance, willing to go right to the edge to prove the ends never justify the means. The back story of his mask is not explained in the film, and it is one of those elements I would argue is it's own compelling detail in the novel, but is peripherally unnecessary in the film translation. I don't believe you have to read the novel prior to seeing the film. Nothing structurally critical in the novel is lost on-screen. The establishing of the political climate and the superhero generations is done perfectly fine. What you get from the novel is the understanding of the minor details - characters you see momentarily in the film whose lives are fleshed out in subtle asides throughout the novel. The characters of the young man reading the comic by the news vendor, the vendor himself, the heroine Silhouette, and so forth - to the unknowing audience these are inconsequential elements resolved in a manner that balances their introduction; to the book-first audience, it's almost a little feeling of satisfaction, knowing more than what's shown, as if the character was played by a close friend, allowing you to lean over and say, 'See that police-man? That's my cousin.' Most importantly, what you take from the novel is knowing how it ends. This is one area of the narrative that was modified for the film. To have taken the ending exactly as it was written creates two problems. First, the literal ending would require greater extrapolation into all of those minor characters and side stories (the majority of which are in true essence erased from the film's script), thus creating a longer movie. Secondly, the literal ending I believe would have been an imbalance in the narrative - in the greater context of the film it would be asking too much for the suspension of the audience's disbelief.I have to address the common observation of 'You have to read the book to appreciate the film.' What they're really saying is you have to know the details to appreciate the details left in and left out. I say appreciation must take two paths here: If you watch the movie first, you're likely to choose to appreciate the film simply for the cinematic art it is, and rank it next to others of the genre; if you read the book first you're more likely to appreciate it as an adaptation of a rich layered story, and draw the lines of comparison between the page and the screen. Taking these two perspectives I present my opinion. As a film, it is visually stunning, fairly well acted, and long in the same fashion that Dark Knight was long - you weren't watching the clock, you were watching the movie. As an adaptation, I feel it succeeded. I feel the filmmakers did everything in their power to respect the material at its core and it is successful for their doing so. Ultimately the biggest question is one nobody can answer due to the uncertainty paradox - does reading the book first in any way diminish the impact of the movie more-so than the inverse of this query? I can't answer this. No one can. What I can tell you is you need to make your own decision on the matter. Do not listen to the critics, just go see it and make up your own mind.",8,6,12,26 March 2009
Armageddon," Campy, occasionally romantic...
","Reading a lot of other reviews, I get the sense this movie isn't very popular. Granted it's got a fairly star studded cast - Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, and all those other familiar faces you know you've seen before. That could be one of the film's faults - they stocked their hopes on a popular cast, and didn't pay enough attention to the plot itself. As far as plot, I'm always entertained by disaster movies, particularly the disaster part. For me, the best part of the movie is the foreboding atmosphere built up by the superficial damage that the tiny fragments create. Everything after that is just filler. At the same time, I personally feel the one other strong point is the romance between Tyler and Affleck, and the conflict they have trying to build their relationship around the cynical father, Willis. That's a guilty pleasure of mine - a sweet romantic story thrown in peril by extenuating circumstances. Overall, it's a satisfactory effort at film-making. Armageddon is campy action-fun, the kind of movie made for a rainy Friday night or Saturday afternoon.",8,0,1,13 September 2004
American Beauty," It makes you think....
","This is a very strong, powerful movie. I find myself analyzing a lot of stuff after having seen this. Its one of those that makes you think differently, and can change your perspective. Kevin Spacey is very good, and the nudity is a respectable demonstration of the story, and not a flagrant use of the female body to generate revenue. And despite one grotesque image, all together it is quite a significant film. I highly recommend it.",8,0,1,20 September 2003
Face_Off," Action and Character Depth make it great...
","I hadn't watched this movie in almost 7 years, so I figured it was about time I see it again. I considerably enjoyed it. Travolta and Cage are two of the more charismatic actors out there, and having them play off each other in this fashion makes for a darn good movie. The opportunity for the actors to play both personalities helps you really get into each character's life and discover what drives him and where his flaws lie. As far as the cinematography is concerned, I felt it was up-to-par, nothing spectacular, but certainly not a below-average effort for the kind of films John Woo has given us in the past. This is also the kind of movie where you have all these other great supporting actors. At the time, they weren't A-List celebs, but now that you've seen them in other projects (Thomas Jane, Dominique Swain, Colm Feore) you suddenly have that moment of recognition - 'Hey, its that guy, from that other movie! I totally forgot he was in this!' As for Nic Cage, it was totally his movie. Travolta is cool, no doubt, but this was way more a Nic Cage movie. I don't know what it is, but I can honestly say I've liked every one of his movies I've seen. Overall, I'd say great movie, excellent acting, and awesome action. Its the perfect Friday night popcorn movie.",7,1,2,26 March 2006
Aliens," Superior sequel...
","There was a time when scary movies were actually scary, and you weren't just jumping at a music sting. There was a time when special effects were believable because they were real, tangibly there. There was a time when scripts still had shreds of originality in them. The late 70's and early 80's were that time, and quite fortunately, out of this era came James Cameron's top-notch works. Aliens has a timelessness to it, and it's a composite of so many different elements. This was a generation of filmmakers who didn't have the luxury of a computer in the next room that could spit out 3D renderings of anything they could think up. People had to imagine, sculptors had to physically build, and engineers had to make machines that actually worked. This is the first reason Aliens is far superior to any modern films of the genre. The weapons aren't just props with digital gunfire added in - they're working machines spitting bright white flares of blank powder. The power loaders are fully operational hardware that had to be built. And the aliens themselves were real - costumes, puppets, they were real. Believability doesn't just reach between the viewer and the characters on-screen; it has to fall between the on-screen characters as well. When a stunt man in an alien costume leaps at the lead actor, that actor knows how to react, how to grasp or flail and can actually ACT the reaction. We lose this with all the modern movies so over-saturated with special effects that we wonder why the film wasn't done all CG to begin with. Ellen Ripley - Sigourney Weaver - was one of the first female action heroes the people of my generation would recognize. In a genre dominated by Schwarzenegger and Stallone, we suddenly had this strong brazen woman, and frankly a damn good actor, taking the lead. And Aliens characterizes her leadership in a very effective way. The marines think they're invincible. Once they've learned they hard way that they're dealing with a dangerous force, only then does Ripley's opinion really become respected. The music. One of my core theories is that a science fiction movie's effectiveness is driven half by the music. In Aliens we have James Horner creating this intricate and unparalleled spectrum of sound. And while he admits to scavenging his own score from a Star Trek score, he still does amazing things with it, specifically in a minimalist way. James Horner knew that music can sway the emotion of a scene, and he knew exactly how to use it to evoke the terror aspect of the aliens. A long delicate ambiance is suddenly torn by a sting from the string section, a dissonance of notes that is has such simple perfection it could only forever be recognizable as his 'Woah!' sound. And special effects. The Aliens were real, be they costumes or puppets or just a head on a hydraulic for the second jaw to spring out. Visually, the Giger-inspired creatures are truly unique and forever etched in pop culture's mind as one of the most effectively scary monsters. In the 80's, James Cameron knew exactly how to use his special effects to maximum effectiveness, and it shows in all his films from that decade. Were he try to make the same film today, the effect simply would not be the same. We've become so desensitized to special effects that while the older cinema-geeks like myself would relish the idea of costumes and props for monsters, the younger generation would immediately point and laugh at how 'fake looking' the monsters are. Incidentally, CG isn't immune to this either, and the assorted sequels and crossover films have only served to punctuate that. In summary: Aliens is one of the best science fiction films of all time, I am comfortable with saying. If you have not seen it - the full director's cut - you owe it to yourself to go and do so.",9,0,2,6 September 2003
Alien vs. Predator," Better than anticipated...
","Warning: some of my comments may be construed as spoilers.
First of all, I want to say that I liked this movie. The before-hand critics weren't very open to it, and the people in general had low expectations. However, it was not a bad movie. I have been a fan of both Alien and Predator since seeing each original series, as well as a fan of every other media type this pop-culture crossover has surfaced in. Therefore I had my own high expectations.I will say this. It was cool. Despite being subject to some piddly studio-enforced time constraint, it played out well for an hour-forty movie. I felt the effects were well done, the aliens did not look in any way as deficient as those in Alien: Resurrection (mostly the queen), and the predators were quite excellent.That said, I have some beefs. Being a longtime fan, I noticed some really irritating things.The sense of time lapse in the movie was relatively basic; that is, it didn't feel like time ever really jumped forward by a big chunk. Because of this, the facehuggers seemed to take only a few minutes to implant the larval aliens, despite the several hour process intoned in the first two movies (which I consider the bible on all things Alien). I didn't mind this as much; so maybe the facehuggers are a little premature. However, this time problem arose with the chestburster stage. They set it up so that it seemed like the bursters also only took about ten minutes to fully mature, and exit their host. This, to me, felt way to fast. But, being a devout fan, maybe I'm just too obsessed. Finally, I felt that, even though it was cool and all, it was pretty shallow in terms of action volume. There aren't many big action scenes with the predators and aliens together, and they're mostly broken apart during the second half of the film (The first half is mostly character development and introduction). If it hadn't been for the queen's inclusion in the action, I doubt I would have voted on this as I did. To me, the queen really saves the movie. And, it's definitely open for a sequel. Now I know, there haven't been any 'number one movie' commercials for it, meaning it's general reception is satisfactory at best. But, unlike Godzilla, which was set up for a sequel that never came, AVP will most definitely get its sequel. This is because, using my example, Godzilla was a popcorn-action flick, and thought it may have earned its keep in sales, it didn't have the physical fan base to prod the sequel into production. AVP has that physical fan base - we've been around for twenty years. This means, even though AVP might not even make back its production costs, it most certainly will be sequeled simply to feed the fan's interest.Oh, one last thing: Antarctica is really cold. Towards the end they seemed to have forgotten that.",9,1,2,29 August 2004
Ghost Rider," Cage's Weakest to date...
","I'm a Nicolas Cage fan. I've liked every film of his that I've seen, and suffice to say this one is possibly his weakest. He has a certain charisma that saves his movies from being total train-wrecks, but even here it's an iffy save. His portrayal of the character is decent, although I did find a lot of the dialogue, particularly whenever they would start the whole 'is this my destiny' style monologues, very tedious and cliché. And this was certainly not Eva Mendes' best movie, although you think the director wanted it to be considering the ridiculous number of nice-and-close shots of her. Her character existed entirely to be a reactionary person to Cage's lead, which gives her almost no depth and masks what skill Mendes has behind the 'ooh, save the pretty girl' device. Cinematographically, it wasn't bad. I didn't see as many painful homages to other Marvel movies as we saw in Daredevil, although I might need a second look to confirm that. The effects seemed fine to me, although personally the skull CG didn't seem quite to par with the fire effects. All in all, it's a good 'turn off your brain' popcorn movie, but it's certainly not going in my top 10.",7,0,1,3 March 2007
Back to the Future Part III," Weaker, but a worthy conclusion to the trilogy...
","Okay, let me just say - Part 3 is not quite as good as the first, nor the second, really. But it has it's strong points. We are reunited with Marty, who discovers that Doc has ended up in the 19th century. The movie unfolds as they race to repair time as best they can without screwing it up any more than they already have.Part 3 is also fun on the grounds that it brings together the two cinematic styles that can be most appealing to young children - science fiction and westerns. I know I thought it was really cool the first time I saw it. Now that I can take a step back and look at it from a technical point of view, it's still not bad. Granted, the script and directing are definitely weaker than the first two films, but this one is basically a necessary installment because, much like the disputed Matrix films, part 2 and 3 both are smaller divisions of a greater unified storyline. the acting is basically just as good as in the first two. If anything drags it down, it is that the western styling can start to feel tedious to someone who isn't really into that type of movie. Still, despite it's various weaknesses, it is a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy, and you can't watch part 2 without part 3.",7,0,0,17 November 2004
8 Mile," very real...
","I'm not a big fan of rap music, but the one artist I can tolerate is Eminem. And he's not such a bad actor, either. this movie is very effective, quite realistic and gritty. I think its a good movie on the grounds that everyone has a barrier to overcome in their life, and it doesn't make any difference what that barrier is. The message is very strong, and the characters are believable. I recommend this movie to those who want to see a realistic movie and not a cookie cutter action flick.",7,0,1,30 January 2004
The Dark Knight," A Dark Riveting Epic that will stand the test of time
","For those of us who are the die-hard Batman fans, we all watched the first and thought, 'Well, here's hoping they move forward with an even better sequel.' I bet most of us were expecting a Spider-Man 2, and instead we got an Empire Strikes Back. Pure cinematic excellence. If anyone ever doubted Nolan's talent before, they better be believers now. I'm aware credit doesn't fall solely to him, but a strong director can mean a strong movie. The decision to shoot a lot of the film in Imax cameras gives it such a vast, impressive feel, particularly the first scene. You knew after those first six minutes that the movie was only going to get better. The acting was nothing short of superb. Christian Bale is Batman. He owns the role. He's brought together everything about both sides of the personality that the previous franchise couldn't entirely grasp. Bale has Kilmer and Clooney's clean-cut good looks and honest smile that make him flawless as Bruce Wayne, and at the same time he can cast an unnerving cold darkness that Michael Keaton brought so well to Batman. Michael Caine is one of those guys who wasn't really in the scope of us younger fans before, but he has been a top-notch actor for decades and now it is my generation that has a chance to see the subtle beauty of his talent, ever the vigilant butler with a wise word to aid Bruce in the darkest hours. In my mind Maggie Gyllenhaal creates a conundrum. What she poignantly brings to the film is acting talent, able to instantly make us forget about Holmes' performance in the first. And yet Holmes is much more attractive than Gyllenhaal, purely for the youthfulness of her looks. In the end I'm thankful they found someone new for the role, someone who actually made you care about Rachel Dawes as a person and not just as a pretty face. And Heath Ledger - what can I say about him that hasn't already been said? A dark, twisted, disquieting, edgy performance and flawless from start to finish. the character was so well fleshed-out, I never even saw Ledger in that face. There was only the Joker. The musical score always plays a big part for me, and this franchise has two of the best at the wheel of the orchestra. James Newton Howard combining forces with Hans Zimmer is one of best decisions Hollywood will ever make. The soundtrack is dark and moody where it needs to be, and grandiose and swelling when the action kicks up. Just listening to the music by itself feels like watching the movie. Even if you know nothing about Batman and his universe you will enjoy this movie. The story is an addictive journey, one that will keep you in your seat the entire way through. It's very much like Casino Royale - a long movie but you won't know where the time went, because virtually every minute has kept your attention squarely fixed on the screen. There is one word to describe a film of this caliber - epic. It deserves nothing less than a permanent seat in the Top 10 of all time. Now only one problem exists for the filmmakers - how do they go uphill from this?",9,3,8,11 November 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Odd in a good way...
","You won't truly understand this movie unless you've read the book. Even so, it is a wonderfully magical composition of suspense and sublime scares. Its just one of those movies you have to see again and again and it still won't be boring.",8,0,2,4 September 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Bravo!!!
","I had the good fortune to see it in the opening long weekend, and may I say Bravo to this movie. The story carries over extremely well, and the visual effects are nothing short of incredible. There's just the right element of action, drama, and a little humor to keep you riveted. Now, the critique. I have to say, despite the immense coolness of the fights, some have the fringe tendency to drag on a little too long. Not by much, but the feeling is there. Also, I was hoping the twins configured more heavily in this film, but they don't get quite the screen time they should have had. Major gripe - what happened to Tank? He survived the first movie, but here he's disappeared. There is a tiny hint that might be the answer, though.The superman thing - woohoo. The last time Neo does it is, not to spoil anything, intense. Now, the ending. Yes, when that cliffhanger jumped up there, I did emit a choice combo of profane vocabulary. But at least it keeps us wanting to see the third. Also, the game that adjoins the movie is superb. See the movie, then play the game.",9,0,0,23 May 2003
Army of Darkness," Campy action-horror-comedy...
","I haven't actually seen the first two Evil Dead installments, and I understand they are better horror movies than this one.Personally I like the comedic touch. Bruce Campbell is just that kind of guy, a 'take-no-crap' kind of cheesy action hero. The chainsaw in particular provides more than its share of quirky moments. Campbell and Raimi together are a dynamic duo, and they continue to prove that even now.Sam Raimi is a talented guy, and he makes cool movies. Problem is a lot of people need quality, not just cool. And I digress - yeah, it's a bare-bones attempt at horror, relying much more on the comedic touches for effect. It's a guilty pleasure movie. I like it, I'd recommend it if you want something fun, something you don't have to think real hard about.",8,2,3,13 September 2004
Back to the Future Part II," An actually good sequel...
","Being a big fan of the original, I was quite happy with this sequel. The intrigue of time travel into the future is one of the biggest allures for science fiction, and Part 2 makes it look very clean and fun. Granted, there are some major plot holes that result from the 'cause and effect' paradox of time travel, but for the sake of entertainment, we have to push that away. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fun the second time around, with the continuum of time at stake this time. After journeying into the future, they discover they have to go back and fix the past again - the 1955 that they'd already visited. The movie is fun, fancy, and it keeps you hooked to the end. I don't know what problem the critics had with this one; I liked it, because it took the spirit of the first one, and transformed it into a dynamic story, enjoyable action scenes, and respectable dialogue. Not to mention the special effects were very well done for the time-frame of the film. If you liked the first one, you will like the sequel. Don't listen to the naysayers; you have to experience it for yourself.",8,1,2,17 November 2004
X2: X-Men United," Best comic sequel ever!
","I went to this with my friends opening night, and we were all quite pleased. From what I gather, the studio made decent cash from the first one, and thus they were able to take everything that made it really cool as well as meaningful, and crank it up by a lot in the sequel. They went a little more intense with the sequel, too. for an example, in the first film, you can account for about six people who actually die. In this one, Wolverine matches and exceeds this headcount in five minutes during his most action-intensive scene. I don't want to spoil it for you, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, go out and rent it, for gosh's sakes! It is studded with great moments. In the average movie, there is a spot where you can walk away for about five minutes, which is about the typical bathroom break you'd take while in a theater. As far as I'm concerned, there was not one of these moments in X2. It keeps moving, keeping the action coming, and if it's not an action intense scene, then it's a decent scene showing the human element or the emotional weights of the characters. And of course, there's always a tiny sliver of comic relief, played out in this movie by the interaction of Logan's less than pleasant personality and most everyone else. Overall, this has to be the best comic-movie sequel yet. Spider-Man 2 was decent, but it wasn't as balanced as X2. I highly recommend you see this movie. If you're an X-Men fan, and you haven't seen this movie (the odds of you actually existing is exponentially low, but you never know) you have have HAVE to see this movie! You will enjoy it.",9,0,0,4 October 2004
Aladdin," Family friendly...
","While I'm not a fan of musicals, I can enjoy Disney movies, specifically because I'm not watching the actual person singing. Aladdin was a classic from my childhood, so I respect it on all the levels, and it performs very well. Robin Williams is one of the older comedians who's still got it. Too bad he couldn't be in the sequel. Its definitely kid oriented, but always family friendly.",7,2,4,6 September 2003
Back to the Future," I guarantee you will like this movie...
","I really like this movie. I mean, I really like this movie. I probably first saw it when I was about ten, and it was the coolest thing I'd seen. The concept of time travel is always intriguing, and Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd seem to have an unbeatable 'student and mentor' chemistry on screen. The story is very well-constructed, too. Marty (Fox) is asked to join doc Brown (Lloyd) for a test run of his new time machine, and through an unfortunate series of complications, Marty ends up in the year 1955. To top things off, he may have accidentally set history in a new direction - one that results with him never being born. Not only is the movie fun to watch and well-written, but it just has the atmosphere. A lot of the good movies have it. Its almost a state of mind where you really get into the movie; you can feel the characters going through their conflicts, and you break through that barrier that says 'This is fiction.'Back to the Future is definitely in my top favorite 25 movies ever, and I adamantly recommend this to fans of the genre, the cast...really, a fan of anything will like it, just because it has so much.",9,0,1,15 November 2004
