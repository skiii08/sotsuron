The Devil's Advocate," ...
","Although the story is very similar with 'The Firm', it's a very good movie, with breathtaking scenes, excellent performances (specially for Pacino) and a beautiful scenario. But definetively, it's not a movie for chidrem.",7,0,1,12 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Interesting but not so scary
","The idea of the movie was excellent. The actors really seem to be scary (I heard that they were scared by the crew during the making of the movie). But maybe because I've already read lots of things about the movie, it wasn't scary to me. I didn't 'jump' from my chair anytime. And I saw the movie at night, with the lights off. I expected an end with 'no end', after all, the idea is that it was a tape found by people...",6,0,1,6 June 2000
The Mummy," I TOOK A NAP DURING THE MUMMY....
","Sorry folks, but The Mummy, although is a good movie, it isn't anything but a new point of view of The Raiders of The Lost Arc, but inferior than that. The effects are tremendous! Very good. But..... It's not scary. No way. If you like to watch scary movies, don't expect much thing from it. I wouldn't take my kids to see it but definitively is not scary... And sometimes is hilarious... I would like to see it again but only when I didn't have any other option.Besides, I prefer Harrison Ford instead of Brendan Fraser (although he saves the movie...)",7,0,0,20 June 1999
L.A. Confidential," INTRIGUING FILM NOIR
","If you like films noir, you can't miss this. The story is serious, intriguing and attach you at the seat until the end. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as James Cromwell.",8,0,0,20 June 1999
Snatch," Hilarious...
","Hilarious, fast and very funny movie where everything goes wrong to everybody. Except for the dog that almost 'steals' the attention. This movie was a nice surprise for me. It was the first time that I saw Benicio del Toro and although his part was short (unfortunately), I liked it very much. Dennis Farina gave a very comic tone to his part. Brad Pitt though, could be better. This movie is a must to people who likes to laugh at dumb robbers in action.",Null,0,1,31 January 2002
Fargo," Amazing film.... JA!
","I've just seen drama/comedy film, action/comedy film, but this was the first time I saw a thriller/comedy film and it was amazing. The story is very funny and the characters brilliant. She deserved the Oscar and the rest of the cast was brilliant too. If you didn't watch it yet, don't delay... Go for it. JA! JA!",7,0,1,20 July 1999
Amadeus," A lesson of classic music
","At the same time we watch a excellent movie, we learn more about the classic musician Mozart, well performed by Hulce. At the same time Murray Abraham is excellent as Salieri, the antagonist of Mozart, and he deserved his Oscar. Unfortunately, Hulce didn't receive his. Some folks told me that the story wasn't exactly as they told but who cares? No strong scenes, no sex either. My kids loved to watch this movie.... Absolutely brilliant.",10,2,4,17 July 1999
Amadeus," I don't remember how many times I saw it
","Touching, sentimental and marvellous movie. All the cast is excellent",10,1,4,20 June 1999
The Game," The Book that Agatha Christie Didn't Write
","Astonishing!!! You will only know what's true and not in the last minute of the movie. Douglas is brilliant. Penn not so much. But you can't miss it. Take a big bowl of pop-corn, soda and enjoy it. If it's necessary, take a oxygen balloon just in case...",8,0,1,20 May 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," Violent but surprising movie
","Two brothers robbed a bank, kill a lot of rangers, kidnap a family and try to run away to Mexico. During the run, they fence strange people in a desert bar. When you think you are watching just another violent movie of Tarantino, you'll be surprised with the happenings. Very funny and different.",7,0,0,4 August 1999
There's Something About Mary," LAUGHING HURTS...
","Since long time ago I didn't laugh so much. OK. The script is not so exciting, you don't have a 'deep' story but it's hilarious almost all the time. The most part of the jokes are visual jokes so, you don't need a script for the Oscar. Just simply rent it and enjoy it. Forget your weekly hard work for a while",9,0,0,20 June 1999
American Gangster," Excellent movie, but... not accurate according the 'real' Frank Lucas and others
","It's interesting the fact that, after 15 minutes of movie, I mentioned to my wife that, no matter which character Denzel Washington is playing he's always 'classy' and seems to be a gentleman. And it's not a negative critique.But the fact is, if you google the name 'Frank Lucas', you have a link for the wikipedia. There you learn that according Frank Lucas and others, the movie is '1% true and 99% Hollywood'.Also, the real Richie Roberts was upset with the movie because of(WARNING: SPOILER HERE)the custody battle scenes. After all, according to him, he never had a child!!! And again, according to him, the real Frank Lucas was an illiterate, and extremely violent man.Despite of all the things above, it was a pleasure to watch another very good performance of Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe (although he's not one of my favorites).",7,0,1,10 April 2012
Heat," Two Monsters in the same movie
","First: Does anyone know if Pacino and De Niro were actually together in the same scene at the bar meeting? The movie is about two genius. One is the good guy (Pacino) and the other is the bad guy (De Niro). The script runs around the intelectual fight between them and the involvement for their parties. Except for the bank robbering, and the last scene, don't expect a lot of action in this movie. Instead, be sure you'll find an excellent script and performances. The director of this movie (Michael Mann) is the same director responsible for the TV series Miami Vice. And he directed another movie (L.A. Takedown - 1989 - TV) that actually looks like today as a 'draft' for HEAT...",8,0,0,16 July 1999
