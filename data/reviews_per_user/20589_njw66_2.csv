The Devil's Advocate," Ten out of Ten Nipples!!! Woo-Hoo!!!
","The movie starts out a bit slow and somewhat predictable, but takes a strange turn about midway through. Things start to get really strange, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. You get not one but two good looks at Charlize Theron's amazing tits. You also get a full frontal of Connie Nielsen as well as a couple of good looks at her tits. Absolutely top-notch nudity. I give this movie ten out of ten nipples. Keanu Reeves acting is fine, although his southern drawl sounds quite fake in a few scenes. Al Pacino is great through most of the movie, though a bit over the top in one scene. I really wish that IMDb.com would allow users to make shorter comments since I often find I can summarize how I feel about a movie in five lines.",7,1,2,15 August 2006
Training Day," Disappointing Story Line
","While Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington each turn in remarkable performances, the story itself disappoints. I found the film overly violent for my taste. (I realize that I am in the minority in that regard. It seems that most movie-goers want the maximum amount of violence packed into their films and Hollywood has complied.) The film is successful in creating an atmosphere of impending danger and edginess. The script is good and the film is well shot. The story itself disappoints. The actions of Denzel's character in the second half of the film seemed out of character compared to the character in the first half of the film. While it provides for an unexpected twist in the plot, I found it unsatisfying. The overall effect of the film was very scary and very disturbing.",4,1,4,7 April 2006
