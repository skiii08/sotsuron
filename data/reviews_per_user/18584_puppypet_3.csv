Blade Runner 2049," 3 Hours Long, Dark Sadistic and Bleak
","Maybe 25 years ago you could play a movie where the future was bleak but have you taken a look around times have changed. Too many movies about the end of the world saturate our psyche. Today were on the brink of nuclear war resources are running dry and pollution is killing everything.Oh yeah what does this have to do with the movie? If you want more of the same depressing humans being brutalized slaying and the likes then this movie is for you.anyone that has a soul for a better day a better time that think something should be uplifting and entertaining I'm trying to protect you.Back to the movie it was long dark sadistic and the music tried like everything else in this movie to emulate the original Blade Runner but did it in a jabbing hard dark way that just goes along with everything else I've been saying.the movie was highly rated 8.4 I think scares me I mean seriously scares me. Very rare do I ever see a movie that is entertaining. You may want to watch Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. It was excellentSo overall special effects were what you would expect and they were dark, the acting was average and I don't know how these actors sleep at night also bleak and dark. Music was scary and bleak. The plot was awfully long and should have been put together in a much shorter package. Would have saved me the agony at least. No spoilers here just don't watch it because if you see it- you can't take it back.I hope somebody reads this I hope it helps. Just trust me",1,2,4,2 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I came here because something was way off in this film
",Well good day everyone there will be no spoilers or anything like that I came here because I was so disappointed with the storytelling and the actors cut scenes basically everything in this movie seemed low budget for a Star Wars film. It's like they were trying to save money everywhere so maybe that's what they really were doing so they could gouge the money from your pockets and make the most they can under the pure greed principle. It has cheap Star Wars clich√©s in its production and the actors you virtually just don't even care about them. So everybody giving it a low score these are the accurate scores. So it looks like JJ Abrams is in this film but I don't even care to look I'm just seeing it in people's reviews. I've seen the guy on YouTube and I know I don't like him I think he trashes movies and should never have become a director. I really feel that way about him I've disliked too much of the things he does. To put it blunt he doesn't have any heart and soul and Star Wars is not his project and never was. George Lucas I wish you would come back but I guess this Star Wars stuff is all behind you so maybe it should be behind all of us. They're just trashing it for the quick buck. If anyone does see my review just don't spend a penny on this and then if you wish go ahead and watch it. I have nothing else to say thanks for your time and too bad the memories of Star wars is all some of us older folks will have from the days George Lucas created his dream.,2,1,5,22 March 2020
Midway," Acting Is this movie is so unbelievable. What were they thinking
",I gave that title because until you see bad acting you can't believe it got off the cutting room floor. The CGI looks dated this I think is the Asian company it's just their level there look whatever.But the acting is sterile it's childish I guess the writer had something to do with that. You can't believe a single thing in this movie. So yeah I'm not on board with people giving the movie a high score. Not when so many other movies have been made where they can bring the viewer into the movie this one you're too much of an outsider and believe nothing.I was just so angry at the acting I gave it a 1 but if you like to just have a very light non-believable war movie that has cool looking scenes then it probably deserves maybe 5 of 10. But you're not going to like any of the actors there so bad it makes you think that a director must have a lot to do with their presentation arcana just be a bad combination of both. Anyway pathetic to say the least.So thanks for reading this you still might like it,1,9,17,2 February 2020
