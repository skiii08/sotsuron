Requiem for a Dream," What a terrible waste of film
","Requiem for a Dream is a movie that has its heart in the right place, but not much else.  Much has been made of the technical aspects of this film. And some of the technique does impress.  The rampant use of split screen very effectively, quickly, and cleverly underscores the selfishness of characters.  They are literally separated from one another within the film frame.  The repetition of certain elements--the rapid fire images that accompany every hit of heroin taken by the characters--is cool.  Less cool are these crazy point of view shots, lots of odd angles.  Why are they there?  They do not enhance the film in any way.  They are as pretentious and unnecessary as any technical thing in film this year.The other thing about this movie is that I didn't care about most of it. Jared Leto Marlon Wayans and the girlfriend--sorry, can't remember her name--go through all these horrible things.  And we're supposed to sympathize, feel their pain.  Oh, look what drugs have done to those poor creatures.  But look:  these people are junkies and dealers, spoiled brats doing their own thing and paying the price.  As callous as it may seem to say this, they deserve what they get.  But look, here's the other thing. Aronofsky is so heavy handed and obvious about one fact--that these characters WILL BE PUNISHED--that it becomes almost laughable.  I mean, these are cliches that even most hacks would steer clear of.  Simplistic, naive, are the words I would use to describe Mr. Aronofsky's take on this whole thing.He goes so far over the top--and he does this in the other main storyline, involving Ellen Burstyn--that he undercuts the potential power of his own piece.  It becomes a movie of bombast, a trite piece of audience manipulation.  Look at what drugs have done to this person and that person. I love that Aronofsky tried to make a really powerful anti-drug movie. But I hate how incredibly he failed.",1,24,49,30 November 2000
Fight Club," A totally brilliant, woefully underappreciated film
","I read comments that call Fight Club depraved and I cringe.  I hear people talk about its ludicrous, totally unsupported plot twist, and my jaw drops in shock and horror.  THis is a brilliant film, one of the five best ever made, and I am not some knee-jerk, violence loving fanboy.  I have seen this film four times, and it becomes better with every viewing.  First of all, the plot twist.  Without giving it away, I guarantee that if you watch carefully, you will be able to see, in hindsight, how brilliantly and perfectly the twist is set up.  But you have to WATCH the movie.  You cannot simply let the movie wash over you.  This film requires thoughtful, attentive viewing.  Secondly, the movie doesn't even come close to glorifying violence.  The fight clubs are at first a mode for expressing repressed emotionality in the men who attend the fights.  beating each other is the only way they can make themselves feel, so they do it.  It is a symbol for greater things.  The film has three stages.  Ultimately, the extreme philosophy that emerges in the second act of the film is rejected. It does not glorify or encourage fighting or violence.  And this is not even to mention the glorious style of this film, with its atmospheric, nearly expressionistic lighting, its extraordinarily sophisticated and complex use of the camera, and its truly amazing sound mix.  This is, on all levels, a brilliant film.  It has a dark streak which makes it inaccessable and susceptable to the ravings of the naive, those who see a violent act and automatically begin to cry out about irresponsability in filmaking and everything else dangerous to film form.  This film is a ten, an A+, four stars.",10,0,1,7 May 2000
Gladiator," The first truly grand movie this year
","During the first five monthes of 2000, I sat through loads of dreck, waiting for some film to live up to the annus mirabilis that was 1999.  I went to Erin Brockovich, and was repulsed by the manipulation of the audience in that film, not to mention the deification of Julia Roberts and passed through the film.  I decided not to look for a good movie, just an entertaining one, and I went to U-571.  Instead of giving solid action, it tried to build characters into a story that couldn't handle characters. They piled cliches on an unsturdy frame, and the all film colapsed.  I really wanted Gladiator to be the film that I would love, and I truly did love it.  The opening has echoes of Saving Private RYan in style, but goes beyond that film because it truly ties us in to Russell Crowe's character, instantly.  We know who he is, we identify with him, and we are instantly willing to follow him through to the end of the film. All of the fight scenes are on a grand scale, perfectly mounted and expertly executed.  But there is more to this film than action.  Russell Crowe had better become a movie star with this movie, because after The Insider, he truyly deserves it.  He is a romantic, heroic, nobleman in the grandest sense of the word. Joaquin Phoenix is suitably over the top at times, yet there is depth to his characters.  He is a human villain, and yet a hissable one none the less. That is great movie making.  The political aspects of the film are also magnificent, adding a sociological dimension to the film that at no time feels like the film is teaching the audience.  It is worked into the story organically.  It also manages to work this massive scope into the context of a conventional, though thoroughly compelling and engrossing, revenge story. All in all, this is extraordinary, majestic, wonderful work.  Now that I've listed everything I can think of that is great about this movie, allow me to take this opportunity to curse the name of Hans Zimmer.  His score is, until the last twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, horrible, and should be excised from the film and replaced with something else in later incarnations of this film.  Hopefully this is less than 1,000 words.",9,0,0,7 May 2000
