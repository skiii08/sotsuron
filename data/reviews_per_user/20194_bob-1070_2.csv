The Young Victoria," Unnecessary - watch the TV mini-series instead
","I can only wonder why they bothered making this film so soon after the excellent and far superior 2001 TV production 'Victoria and Albert.' In comparison with that version, this one fails on almost every level. The lead performers have very little chemistry, and the episodic plot has no real through line. I got the feeling that the film had to be reworked in post production, given the choppy editing, the strange structure (the first half is presented as a flashback for no apparent reason), and the reliance on voice over to explain who's who and what's what. The director really likes to rack focus, which becomes incredibly annoying. And the digital backgrounds and compositing are quite obvious and distracting. There are some nice sets and excellent costumes, but that's no reason to waste 100 minutes of your life on this dud. Instead, rent the mini-series or one of the documentaries about Victoria if you're interested in the subject.",2,10,23,21 November 2009
Match Point," I walked out of it
","Save your time and your money and skip this utterly awful self-indulgent garbage. The characters are completely unbelievable, and the dialog is simply terrible -- real people don't talk this way. I don't know how the story turned out because after 30 minutes, I didn't care to sit through any more, because the plot setup is something you've seen many times before. Every scene went on twice as long as should have, and you can easily see where the scene is going to end up before it gets there. Allen's visual style has always been dependent on his cinematographers, so when he had Gordon Willis or Carlo DiPalma shooting his films, they were visually striking even if the films were not terribly interesting. Here, cinematographer Aderfasin brings no style to the proceedings, so you have a boring film that isn't even worth looking at. IMO, it's time for Mr. Allen to hang it up.",1,7,21,1 January 2006
