Ford v Ferrari," The ultimate racing film
","Ford v Ferrari just adds to the growing list of amazing films to come out in 2019, it delivers one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen, the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like that at all because of how exciting and engaging the film is. James Mangold has proved that he is a seriously underrated director and needs to be considered as one of the best working today. The cast is fantastic especially Christian Bale who should be in Oscar talks this year. He delivered what I believed was the best performance last year in Vice and he once again gives such an amazing performance alongside Matt Damon who is also awesome in the film.The film also explores dynamics such as: A father son relationship and being proud of who you are as a person which were really poignant. The sound mixing and editing is Oscar worthy with the cars sounding so awesome. It also explores all the aspects to racing that are rarely explored in film such as: The strategy behind winning the race, finding the right driver for the car, the business behind the racing and all the politics that are associated with it.The only nitpicky thing I could find is that some audiences may find the beginning to be a little slow and would like 5-10 mins cut out from the film so that it is a tighter package however it didn't really bother me at all.Overall Ford v Ferrari treats its subject matter with care, the film has great direction, fantastic acting and explores such interesting themes that I think it transcends the genre so people who aren't even fans of cars and racing will still love this film.",9,8,22,15 November 2019
Knives Out," A very fun whodunit
","I had a fun time unravelling the mystery of Knives out, it takes so many twists and turns and executes the whole whodunit formula really well. The cast is fantastic every character in the film have very distinct personality traits that stick out and they are all played really well, Ana De Armas does a great job of being a protagonist that balances out all the exotic personalities these characters have. If one person stuck out the most in the film it was definitely Daniel Craig, the accent he puts on is fantastic while not exactly an accurate southern accent it is used in a way where its supposed to be exaggerated adding to the fun nature of the film. The writing is pretty great with the twists and turns blindsiding you at times making it more and more intriguing as the mystery slowly unravels.While I say the writing for the most part is great it has certain moments and sequences in the film that go for too long which can sometimes make you slightly bored and draw your attention away from the movie, it is quick however to getting you back to being engrossed in the mystery, if these sequences were slightly shorter and more concise it would benefit the film to me.While not perfect Knives out is a movie I had fun with and would be a whodunit I would recommend you watch especially if you're a fan of the genre or of the films fantastic cast members, 2019 is an excellent year for film and this just adds to that list.",8,16,52,23 November 2019
The Irishman," A film I found enjoyable but frustrating
","The Irishman left a lot to be desired for me, firstly let me just start by saying that the technical aspects of this film are fantastic, the cinematography, score, editing and the de aging technology are all fantatsic to me as well as the acting. De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are all awesome in very different ways, Scorsese is a fantastic director and it shows in this film. The whole 3rd act of this film is near masterclass storytelling especially a 20 minute sequence within this third act which was mesmerising to watch.However I do not think this film is a masterpiece, the 3 and a half hour run time is near ridiculous and you definitely feel it, also for a film this long it does have some very rushed sequences that explain way too much in that time and expects you to remember all of it when they reference it 2 hours later. I do think the screenplay is the weakest and most inconsistent part to this film. I think that the film needed to make use of visual storytelling a lot more instead of having a character explain something in a monotonous voice over a sit down conversation. Also when the film is starting to hit its emotional points of the story you feel burnt out due to the run time you just want things to wrap up and whilst these scenes were great it doesn't leave the desired impact in my opinion, I am certain that if an hour had been cut out of the run time it could have left that impact.Overall, I did enjoy the film but I do think a whole hour of it could have been taken out and it needed to make use of more visual storytelling rather than just heavy exposition the cast is fantastic, the technical aspects are fantastic and the 3rd act is masterful. Not a masterpiece but a film I enjoyed and just wished it could've been more efficient in the way it told its story.",6,1,4,27 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A film that you could pick apart forever but one I ultimately had fun with
","Firstly does this episode or this trilogy live up to the original, no but was it really ever going to. Setting those expectations aside this is quite an enjoyable and fun Star Wars film that tries a couple of new concepts and throws out new ideas that I thought were really cool to watch. If you loved the dynamic between Ben Solo and Rey in the past two movies you'll love this one as it takes that further in ways that I thought were fitting for both characters. Adam driver gives the best performance in this film which is to be expected because of how fantastic of an actor he is. I thought the conclusion of the film was fitting for this trilogy and I was satisfied with the way it ended.However there are some other concepts in this film that were silly and at times undercut the consequences of the original trilogy. This film like the force awakens is sometimes scared to pursue the original concepts this trilogy has had to offer, and decided to shove nostalgia and cheesy references to the old movies which I found to be quite annoying at times. I also found that most of the storyline covered with the resistance was boring, forgettable, and generic, and had me dying to go back and see what Rey or Ben Solo were doing. There is also an ongoing mystery that Finn has where he knows something that no one else does which gets completely forgotten about and left me wanting to know what he knew as it seemed like a big revelation. The cinematography at times was awful there was a lot of shaky cam and flashing which felt quite amateurish and had me disorientated as to what was going on, this mainly happens during the 1st act.I came out of this film overall happy with how it ended but it is by no means perfect and I do understand how people would dislike it. However if you go into this film not wanting to hate it and actually have a good time with it you might just have yourself some fun watching this conclusion to quite an entertaining Star wars trilogy.",7,3,13,19 December 2019
1917," A technical achievement in cinema
","1917, is a war film that adds something completely new and unique to the war genre. The idea of making it look like one take is genius, the cinematography is by far the best of the year, as it immerses you deeply into the film and the characters that make you almost feel like you are there on this journey. The film also has a moving ending that had me mesmerised by the time the credits rolled, that is due to the cinematography and the performances given in the film which were very strong, ending on one of the most nicest shots I have seen this year with a quiet moment that says so much when speaking so little. The production, and costume design were also fantastic and the score only enhances your immersion which is exactly what you want in a score.The weak parts to the film however, were there wasn't the greatest character building, especially in moments early on in the film, where I was supposed to feel some kind of emotion I didn't because the character development early on isn't the greatest. I believe as the film progressed this issue eventually sorted itself out which was nice, and also there were quiet moments in the film that felt they dragged on for way too long and needed to be shortened down a little to make a tighter packaged film.Overall 1917 is a film that I found used its cinematography in fantastic fashion and creates a war film that stands up with some of the best, due to its incredible 3rd act. This is pure film making class and will be something that will be studied for aspiring cinematographers in the future.",9,7,10,9 January 2020
The King," A period film that hits on all fronts
","The king delivers another great film to Netflix's list of exclusives, the topics covered throughout the film like, man's need for war has a profound effect. Chalamet delivers an excellent performance which is now to be expected. The acting is the strongest asset to the film with Joel Edgerton and Robert Pattinson both adding weight to their characters. The score is fantastic as well as the cinematography capturing some well crafted battle scenes as well as the politics behind war which are all fantastic to watch.The only gripe I have with the film is it is somewhat committed to the Shakespearean language,but not entirely as it keeps swaying back and forth between regular English and Shakespearean English. Also some audiences might find the film to be quite slow at points, however I believed the battles needed this build up and politics to further heighten the reasons both these countries are at war.Overall I had a great time watching the king, Timothee Chalamet is one of the best actors today and it shows in this film. With a great supporting cast backing him up, direction which is passionate about the subject and a story that is extremely intriguing and exciting. Definitely a film you should consider watching.",8,16,32,2 November 2019
Joker," This film definitely put a smile on my face
","There are 3 movies that I believe have earned this rating for this year, these films are: Once upon a time in Hollywood, The Nightingale and now Joker. This film is an excellent character study of an individual who has been beaten and broken. Joaquin Phoenix gives arguably the best performance of the year as Arthur Fleck, everything that he does from mannerisms to his laugh portrays his ability to convey how the character is feeling. Joaquins' facial expressions are all of the highest calibre and are most definitely Oscar worthy. Other aspects of the film such as: Makeup, the score, and the cinematography are excellent, but with a film like this one it needs a strong screenplay and this film delivers, Todd Phillips has shown that he can write serious drama.As someone who has always loved the character, I can say that this film does the role of Joker justice and plays it exactly the way a Joker film should be played, no campy humour and no sympathy for a character such as himself. The Joker is one of the most evil characters in fiction and the film shows it. This film doesn't shy away from showing brutal violence as well which is what needs to be prevalent in a joker film.Overall, I couldn't find any glaring issues with the film and it is very refreshing to see a character study of this nature appear in film in 2019. I couldn't recommend it any more. I suggest do NOT take your children to see this movie, it has a lot of themes that are certainly not child friendly. A masterpiece of Screen writing.",10,2,4,3 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Does It live up to its high expectations?
","It Chapter 2 is a good movie that manages to keep you entertained through it's nearly 3 hour run time. This really tries to be a sequel in every way with a bigger is better approach and at points some of its attempts to frighten you can be quite predictable at times, however the film to me is scarier then the first as there is more variation in Pennywises attempts to frighten. The cast for this movie is one of its strongest points James mcavoy, (Bill), Jessica Chastain, (Beverly), Bill Hader, (Richie) alongside Bill Skarsgard, (Pennywise), all giving some very excellent performances. I was very satisfied with the way this movie played out and was delighted by the performances, definitely a horror worth seeing.",7,18,37,5 September 2019
Parasite," Parasite is an excellent showcase of fantastic writing
","Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise.",9,25,41,3 February 2020
Marriage Story," Everyone here gives a career high
","Marriage Story is the most heartbreaking film I may have ever seen, Both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances of their careers which is saying a lot for these two as they are both phenomenal actors. Noah Baumbachs direction is also fantastic, the choice of using 35mm made it feel like old family photos that you look through as you get older. But the exploration of the divorce, how both parties behave and react to all the legal proceedings take place were really interesting and thought provoking. Baumbach's screenplay is also fantastic, the arguments in this film felt authentic and real, and was extremely confronting to watch at times. There is one scene in particular which I truly believe is the best scene i have experienced in the past 5 years. I loved this film and found it emotionally gripping and feels like a piece of work so personal that I felt that only Baumbach could pull off this film the way he did.The only nitpicky thing I have with this film is in the beginning some of the scenes are a little on the long side and draw out for too long, however I think this was due to the fact that I hadn't connected with the characters yet and wasn't as immersed as I was until the film started building momentum, however when it does get the momentum the nitpicks I had at the start weren't even worth worrying about.Marriage Story is one of the best films this year showcasing absolutely world class acting, directing and writing. I went through a whole range of emotions when watching this and I loved it. This film is a true masterpiece.",10,13,29,6 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Waititi delivers again
","Jojo Rabbit absolutely deserves to be in the best picture race right now, I have never watched a single film that has made me laugh and cry in the very same film and this one does. The acting is superb every character feels like they are there for a purpose and are all useful to the movie in one way or another. There are times where the screenplay is truly masterful as well as the visual storytelling. There is on aspect this style of storytelling that involves shoes that is absolutely brilliant and I would almost compare it to the red jacket sequence in Schindler's List in terms of how striking it was. When the film wants to be funny it is and when it wants to be sad and change the tone halfway through it does that so effectively. The humour isn't just dumb as well it is a way of showing how ridiculous some of the beliefs and propaganda of the Nazis were, which I thought was brilliant.I do have some negatives with film though, whilst the tonal change in the movie is done very effectively it tries to be funny again midway through a sequence that is quite sad and it doesn't feel right in the situation. Also the film has about 10 minutes in the beginning of the 2nd act that I thought had some very slow scenes.Overall, Jojo Rabbit is one of my favourite films this year and adds another yes another excellent film to 2019's list of great films. I truly believe this is the strongest year of film maybe ever and I hope you go and see this movie as this stands near the top of them all.",9,9,24,18 November 2019
Da 5 Bloods," A Spike Lee Joint for the Ages
","Da 5 Bloods, feels like an awfully relevant film to release right now, providing some powerful imagery and showcasing immersive storytelling. The film has all the makings of a Spike Lee Joint from the high quality cinematography that makes use of a diverse range of film and adds something genuine to the story, as well as provide Oscar Worthy Editing that transitions through aspect ratios smoothly. Spike seems to be on a roll with making some of his most powerful films off the back of his superb Blackkklansman. The performances in the film are Oscar worthy making you feel empathetic to the cause as well as giving insight into the unfairness African Americans faced when it came to the Vietnam War, the two notable performances in this film being Delroy Lindo and Chadwick Boseman, I loved both performances and will be some of my favourites for the year, also Jonathan Majors gives a noteworthy performance as well. The writing for this film is powerful and when needed, builds tension, relationships and the conflicts the characters go through during this film. I will also say the use of real footage throughout the film is extremely powerful and adds an extra layer showing the problems that the USA has faced throughout its history right to this day.If I were to pick out a flaw with this film it would have to be the score which was quite forgettable and at times didn't match the moment that was presented on film, and at times it could have a minor impact on the scene itself, which was quite disappointing as i found the Blackkklansman score to be memorable and matched the style of the film really well.Overall, Da 5 Bloods is a film that is extremely relevant and powerful, showing that Spike Lee is still in great form as a director 40 years in and is maybe better than ever. The use of the Vietnam war felt appropriate and the characters felt authentic. The performances were fantastic, and most technical aspects to the film were at an Oscar Level. This is a film that everyone should try.",9,77,160,12 June 2020
