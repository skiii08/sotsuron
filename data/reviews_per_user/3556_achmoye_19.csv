Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Some flaws but a highly enjoyable SF movie
","I watched it recently and I really liked it. The Jedis are presented like some diplomats, but we quickly see their power as they free themselves from a setup trap made in the ambassador star-ship. This one scene is really important. Not only we see their mastering of light-sabers, but we see some use of the Force, so we have everything we need to understand what are they capable of in a matter of seconds. And the movie keep this kind of efficiency until the mid-part. The characters are well-written and enjoyable, even evil ones. It's interesting to see the Force used to tweak a dice roll, rather than it's usual, powerful bash. Don't get me started on Missa, the biggest wacko of the galaxy. When the war with the droids has begun, he just goes bananas, but he is killing a lot of enemies by his accidents, really fun to watch. The pod race is sheer awesome. I enjoyed every second of it. Watching Anakin beating older, stronger opponents, with a fair-play handling of electronics crafting skills. He even made a robot for his mom, how lovely is that. Aaaaand then the movie dives into an hour of boring negotiations. We lose some sense of characters, the pace is entirely gone. But eventually it ends. Overall I recommend it. It aged well.",7,0,3,30 November 2017
Skyfall," Nice movie until it starts
","I liked the opening. This is where belong my two stars. The Bond opening are always beautiful. Actually I'd rather watch 2 hours of Bond opening instead of this garbage. 1. Daniel Craig has only one expression. No wonder he doesn't pass the psychological test in the movie. Maybe it was the actor answering. 
How could he pass the casting. Remember Pierce Brosman, his fine humour traits ? What happened to Bond's personality ? 2. My Lord this movie is so sexist. Women just fall drooling in Bond's presence. Their only goal is to go in his bed. 
The random sex scenes are killing me. Is it Game of Thrones ? 
Funniest example is first car chase, when his female colleague is driving, and he actually push her, take the driving wheel to turn on the right. Because she could'nt do it obviously LOL 3. The plot is ridiculous and predictable, with cliché hacking like it is a superpower or something. 4. Bond risk his life to chase a ...guy. Why ? Couldn't you, like, make a police perimeter instead of running if a GOD DAMN TRAIN ??? 
Can't you just take the actual elevator instead of hanging yourself to it ? How does that help you chase the guy ??? He could just have called the button XD So yeah, a hilarious pile of cinéma clichés. 
A skyfall on action-movies. 
I don't recommend.",2,3,7,15 December 2017
It," Just read the book
","First of all, I read the book and I saw the first IT movie. This movie is not so bad, has a decent cinematography, even if some CGI scenes feels weird and questionable.
However, we see a vertical bokeh (artistic blur) on the background, which is really bad and deforms perspective, we usually see a round bokeh which makes soft bubbles of color, so it was a weird use of camera. 
There is a clear overuse of wide lenses, which is a naive approach to horror atmosphere. Then even used it on a cliff (when they jump in the water), we the the cliff completely deformed by the wide angle and it's just an amateur mistake. Characters do have different personas, but it's really cliché and instead of adding some backstories to them, the movie focuses on showing the Pennywise's trauma inflicted to each of them. This process is a huge issue in the movie because it takes way too much time, and it's systematic so very predictable. Other big structure issue : this movie is focused on the past (from book's point of view), when they were children, so we lose all the confrontation between past and present, and this was actually an important aspect of the story. Maybe they tried to do it differently than the first movie, but I think it's more a commercial choice (like CGI use), so the first movie actually did better in this particular aspect. IT is kind of scary, but it doesn' t add much to the story, there's a lot of random scenes where IT appears and disappears, it even disrupts the timeline.I don't recommend, I just recommend you to read the book, and maybe watch the first movie. Might not look as good, but still a better adaptation.",6,0,1,21 December 2017
Us," It promises to be original and surprising, but it's not.
","So, It's Jordan Peele's second attempt to create something close to Funny games from Haneke, and it still fails.I really liked the cinematography, especially in the beginning.The first 20 minutes hooked me. We discover a family haunted by their doubles, and these doubles are very special, they are not zombies nor humans.
That's what interested me. And then I realized that nothing special would happen. It's just people being harassed by strangers. The double could be anyone else.
There is a vague expanation in the beginning, the mother is somehow linked to a girl she met when she was young, and that's all.The concept is very inconsistant. Sometimes the characters can control their doubles, but most of the time they can't, it makes no sense.
So it ends up just being a horror movie, trying to be special but failing.
I don't really recommend.",6,0,1,26 May 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Funny, dramatic, shocking
","I had no expectations for this movie, I just saw the trailer and figured out it was some kind of comedy.Turns out it's a social drama about racism and particularly about KKK, it's handled in a clever way,
No surprise here because the director is Spike Lee who likes to make movies about this subject, like Malcolm X.I like the way this movie is both funny and political, and I especially like the way 'white power' and 'black power' are aligned by editing like the extremisms they are.
It's really interesting and I recommend it.I didn't like Adam Driver in Star Wars 7 but here he's a big surprise. His character is really strong with improvisation which helps a lot his infiltration in KKK.
Both main characters are well written.
The costumes and haircuts really add an immersive atmosphere for the time period.Watchout for the end though, don't bring anyone under 16 it's really graphic and it's real footage of violent riots about racism.",7,2,5,11 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," As interesting as 3 billboards can be.
","I saw that movie because of its 8.2 rating, and now I can say it's clearly overrated.The first half is decent but the writing completely fails at renewing the intrigue and creating any kind of progression. The main character is dull and unlikable. Her son has almost no dialogue lines. The police characters doesn't make sense for the most of them.
She get covered by someone who has absolutely no reason to cover her, for a very serious crime.
They are much better dramas out there, keep looking and don't waste your time.",6,0,0,12 May 2020
Split," Surprisingly bad
","I think Shyamalan has been abducted by a multiple dissociative disorder guy, because I don't think he could have directed this crap. How come i can cry on some deep emotional movies, and How come i can feel NOTHING for Split ? How did he make this way to make me not care about any of these characters ? How did he fail that much, in his communication with the spectator ? The main actor is amazing but it doesn't matter. This is out-of-pace during 2 hours. Irrelevant flashbacks, general lack of rhythm and pacing of the action and emotional scenes. Actually this movie doesn't split anything, everything is faded the same way into this garbage aesthetic nonsense, so we have no idea whether to be scared or moved, but thats not the worst. The representation of dissociative disorder is cliché, childish, silly and ridiculous. Does he even know what is he talking about ? Cholesterol, really ? That is bio-lo-gical. Come on. Let me tell you something. I have known someone with these kinds of sickness. And that movie is a true disrespect to this medical condition. It's pure fantasy. Look it up, idk. Most of time they are NOT aware of their other personalities.Oh, and the girls and overly sexualized for no reason. pre-teens, laying down, running with no bra, are you kidding me ? is there a narrative justification ? And hunted by a wild beast ? Hell. I'm done, Jesus. What happened since Signs, sixth sense ? Is that Hollywood business bs ? Seems so.",3,91,218,7 April 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Never saw such stunning visuals since Summer wars
","I absolutely loved this movie.I didn't see an animation that great in years. The visual effects are complete madness. It's beautiful, colourful, and it perfectly fits the story.The movie, in my sense, is the best movie using Comics books codes. I mean the way cases are cut becomes a split screen, the movie also pauses to make some static 'splashy' effects,
we also get some 'Ouch' 'Paf' classic Comics sounds, and everything is made with a lot of taste, a lot of patience. The movie lasts two hours and it's a fast-driven, amazing ride.
Two hours of clever animation like this is just insane. I can't imagine the amount of work this required.
So yeah this movie should be even greater if you can watch in IMAX (is 3D available ?) Go for it !Now, the story...is also good ! Even the story is decent and the characters are relatable, funny, interesting, this movie really have everything.
I just feel like the 'Spider Pig' is too much and this could have worked with 4 characters. Maybe this was for entertaining younger audiences.
Basically The mutliverse has a leak here on Earth so other Spiderman went by and this has to be repaired. The interaction between different Spidermen makes them ally against a greater evil and it's well crafted.
Not 10/10 because the story could have been more interesting. Classic 'Superhero against evil' type.The Spidermen from other dimensions are really fun and I especially like Spider Noir and Spider Gwen.
I wasn't expecting this kind of movie at all.
Honestly I was sick of all superhero movies, but this one is really worth it.
I recommend 100%. For all audiences.",8,1,2,24 February 2019
Dunkirk," For those who don't like war movies.
","I don't like war movies. It's just too easy to dive into the drama and make a profit from has been the most horrible fail at being human, being a society, living with each other. 
So yeah, it's a moral problem, making a ridiculous amount of bucks from something that is NOT a memory duty but a smooth, agreable trip with some conventional obstacles. That being said...I loved this movie. I just had no choice. 
Cinematography is outstanding, the use of wide lenses is justified by the number of soldiers filling the screens and the landscape of Dunkirk. Great acting, too, but what I liked the most is the quality of editing. They are several stories merged into the Dunkirk drama, slowly enough to build suspense, quickly enough to not get confusing.Why would you try to reload when you get fired at by a machine gun though. (beginning sequence)10/10 would pay and watch the nonsensical moral behavior of watching a soft reconstruction of what has been hell. 
I recommend.",8,1,2,22 January 2018
Climax," Drugs, again ?
","I really hated this movie. I don't care about drugs, and this movie made me care even less.
This movie tries so hard to be politically incorrect, it's beyond depicable.I love the IMDB game that occurs with these controversial movies :
People who appreciate will be like 'don't listen to bad reviews' and vice-versa. Lol.
Hey, listen to what you want to listen. This is just my review, for God's sake.What Gaspar Noé should understand is that filming people on drugs doesn't make either a story or a good movie.
Or maybe with less that 20 characters, like Blow or Fear and loathing in Las Vegas, or his own movie Enter the Void...
Why would spend time with characters if we won't follow them again ? Why filming 5 minutes of random people instead of creating good characters and follow them ?
Have you ever heard of character development ? Of course you did Noe, because Enter the Void is amazing, so what in the hell happened here ???My 3 stars belong to the director of photography. The camera roams around the characters and gives a surreal, dreamy atmosphere which relates to the drugs.
It's the only interesting thing in this movie. Camera work.Acting is hysterical and really tiring.Structure is like this :
20mn dance
Some credits (???)
2-hours unwanted drug meltdown.
Fun fact : I wrote 2-hours but I just verified and it's actually 1h36. That's how boring it is !
And all of this interrupted by weird statements on black screens, which add nothing to the movie except satisfying artsy weirdos from cinema critique.I like the esthetics of dance in cinema...but this one is grotesque. It lasts like 20mn and you will feel every one of them.Basically we follow a dance club doing a party after a rehearsal. They like sex and drugs...like in every Noé movie. I liked to discover this kind of atmospheric cinema but the story is really getting old at this point.
It feels like Noe is really struggling to renew his work, and find new ideas.
Not only it's still about sex and drugs, but it's not even as good as the previous movies like Enter the Void.This movie is too experimental to be a good story, and yet it's still a movie with a story and characters.
He should have done either a 100% experimental movie or not. This movie is an in-between, awkard attempt at being artsy enough to go to Cannes festival and still get enough production funds to be released worldwide.There is no climax, at the end they just get to sleep after their psychotic drug effect, and police come. It's ridiculous.
If you want a Climax, go see Mother! with Jennifer Lawrence.",3,13,29,7 February 2019
The Favourite," When you only have one lens ...
","The story is good and I like everything Emma Stone does,
It's also a pleasure to see Nicholas Hoult from Warm Bodies.There are a few characters and you can feel the mechanics of power and manipulations, similar to Dangerous Liaisons.I like the grotesque scenes, depicting the perversions of aristocratic people.I have a huge problem with the cinematography though. It almost always uses a very wide lens, almost like a Fisheye, and it's really disturbing.
It's actually beautiful when used in Dolly shots, but when used as a steady cam is absolutely garbage, you can see a huge distorsion in all the corners and borders of the frame,
It just gave me nausea.
It seriously looks like they got only one lens.(spoiler)
There is also a problematic plot hole for me : When Emma poisons her rival and then she comes back, she....slaps her.
She almost died and she just slaps her, and Emma to say 'I accept your anger for now.' Is this for real ? I expected her rival to just grab a shotgun and chase her down !
Emma just attempted murder, why her rival is so calm ???Also, sometimes the music can be weird and irritating. Score is good but badly used.The ending is poor and vague and very disappointing. It's not even an ending.I have no idea why people expected comedy on some reviews ? It's not a comedy at all. What kind of trailer did you see ?
I recommend as a good acting performance, but godammit with this wide angle lens.",6,2,4,25 February 2019
Million Dollar Baby," Average people can do incredible things
","I've been pretty moved with this movie. You don't even have to like boxe, I don't. If you like clever, beautiful dramas, I recommend it. First, the acting. It's really pleasant to see how the old trainer (Clint Eastwood) is so confused by Maggie (Hilary Swank) who won't listen to anything he says about getting another coach, going to another club. She just wants him as a coach and no one else. You can feel how Frankie is reluctant to train a girl, but then he starts to like her, and this is made in a very subtle acting. Both Eastwood and Swank are outstanding. Frankie and Maggie have deep psychology, especially Frankie who is really conflicted, and are well-developed throughout the movie. Maggie is an average waitress who realizes she can actually do something great by motivation. It's really interesting to see average people evolving but not much but pure willingness. She stands up to Frankie, it looks like he doesn't really have a choice, she's so stubborn ! Photography is beautiful as well, close shots emphasizing drama, not taking risks but mastering the manual in a nutshell. Now what's wrong. Some really random scenes disturb the narration. They even talk about socks for a WHOLE scene, and it's not presented like it's supposed to be funny, or philosophical or anything, it's just socks, really. About the weird, retarded boxing guy : this is SO badly written. It looks like he is not finished as a character, that he should be in another movie or something. In 2 hours, scenes about him spawn randomly. This serves no purpose. Ending's great because it doesn't follow expectations about your average boxing movie. TLDR; not flawless, but still one of the best dramas, I recommend. If you like uplifting boxing movies, be sure to check out 'Bleed for this', too.",7,0,1,3 November 2017
Midsommar," An insane, otherwordly masterpiece
","I didn't see Heredity from Ari Aster but I definitely will. I saw Midsommar 2 days ago and I'm still shocked, still with the atmosphere in my head, it's really bewitching.We follow a group of american friends going to a festival in Sweden. The music is very harsh, tense, you can tell it's not gonna end well. Even before the trip, the setup is very dark because Dani's sister has suicidal tendencies.And then it really begins. The trip is thrown away is a few shots, because it's about the festival.Dani and her friends are welcomed by a community of maybe 100 people. They seem kind even though a bit weird, and I don't really understand how these young people could be interested in a traditional, local festival, but anyway. Some of the friends have actually related studies about anthropology, so I guess it all starts from here.Quickly, a lot of unsettling things happen, and Dani and his friends feel more and more insecure. These locals culture is odd, to say the least. Quite shocking actually. Do NOT bring your children.
This cultural differences bring a really good reflexion about what is good and evil. It's not just about a bunch of weird people, we could actually learn some things from them.
Dani, even with the strange coutumes, starts to feel integrated to the locals, while his friends are freaking out (and they should). It's hard to see what's wrong and what's right. Ari Aster makes a perfect job at muddying the waters.All I say sounds like a basic horror movie but it's not. The atmosphere is perfectly conceived, it's deep and captivating. I didn't even feel the 2 hours and a half. But it is really mentally exhausting, maybe like Funny games or Clockwork Orange.The narrative progression, the tension is so well-rythmed it's a surreal experience.Everything is beautiful. Even when horrible things happen, it's just shot perfectly, with perfect colors, and clever details ( some of the friends take drugs and sometimes you see subtle changes in the shots, in the background). The costumes, the dances, the architecture, the symbols and runes...they put a lot of work in details and creating this universe.The actors are amazing, regarding the tough scenes they have to realize. Dani is a nice discovery for me.It's impossible to describe really (without spoilers), but I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind some graphic violence. (a few shots)",9,1,7,2 August 2019
Les Misérables," A genuine masterpiece --- with some flaws
","I don't why no one told me about this movie. I love movies with a beautiful cinematography and this is one of them. So I had a spontaneous experience. I had no idea they would be singing. It sounded ridiculous for a few seconds but then I understood the tone, and there's so much energy in this movie I wanted to behead some kings then. The music is just awesome. It's still in my head. It's really powerful, because it's enhanced by a really clever staging. The first scene with the boy is a pure joy. I was surprised to see all these actors I knew singing perfectly well. The cast is unbelievable - Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Eddie Redmayne, Anne Hataway...and my favorite, Helena Bonham Carter which is incredible in its grotesque character, you can tell the same king of vilainy from her character Bellatrix in Harry Potter. There is a lot of astounding scenes, and Bellatrix and his husband stealing choregraphy is one of them.
It's not about choosing popular actors though. I think they perfectly fit the story and the tone, especially Jackman and Carter. 
Redmayne choice is kind of weird, because he's really soft, as a leader of Revolution, but maybe that's the point ? Anyway, this movie is so ambitious, the staging is epic, like the cortege scenes in exterior. Interesting cinematography because a lot of wide angles lenses were used, even in some dialogs and close-ups, to enhance the grotesque of French poverty, diseases, and mischief that emerges from the hobble life conditions. But the higher class takes its toll too, thanks to the Revolution and the powerful songs. Everything is described with a harsh eye. And yet it's aesthetically neat and enjoyable. My only cons: 
I don't like the theatrical tone much, especially when everyone wants to die for no reason. Dying from love ? I just don't buy it. The most ridiculous death is Crowe suiciding because...being in debt of a thief ? Come on. It lasts more than 2 hours but I wish there were more.

The Shawshank Redemption," Welcome to the most overrated movie of all times
","I have read tons of people getting off watching this pile of random prison drama, and I cannot believe this is the highest rated movie on IMDb. I never liked Morgan Freeman. Really. He always plays the wise man in movies, and that is quite unbearable. Not only it jails him (lol) to a specific, unrisky role as an actor, but it's also outrageously pretentious. Tim Robbins is OK I guess. So you get to see some fishy business involving cigarettes and rocks for two hours, spiced by some five-year-old melancholic philosophy. End of story, If you like prison drama, go watch The Green Mile. I wasted two hours so you won't, you're welcome.",5,1,5,14 November 2017
Mother!," Mother of unwanted parties
","This movie is unbearable. It is a technical masterpiece, but a real pain in the ass to watch. It's disturbing, violent, reminds me of 'Funny games' in some ways, except the story does not makes sense. So yeah, beautiful shots, excellent acting, but it doesn't matter in the end. This movie relies too much on allegorias and Biblical methaphors. I say the public does not care about this. It's not justified in any ways. It's so much filled with metaphors that the movie is not self-sufficient anymore, you can't just watch the movie, you have to read the Bible, think about it...avoid the hassle. Aronovsky doesn't even provide answers in interviews, he keeps it as an enigma about day 6 of Creation, lol who cares. This is Cinema, not catechism. So you have this two-hours crescendo of people invinting themselves into the life of an isolated couple, the people become a blood-thirsty crowd, and it becomes stupidly violent and provocative. Have fun. The shots use a ridiculous amount of inserts, making you think the stain on the floor is important, the wall is important, the...boiler, the crystal...you'll eventually think EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT, so nothing is. Misleading use of cinema language. 
Innovative story, but overall a bad experience. 
I don't recommend.",5,1,1,15 December 2017
Final Destination," Great concept, garbage result
","I know it's a popular horror movie, but how does it matter. The acting is quite ridiculous, cinematography is poor and amateurish, the only good thing in this movie is the concept of Death being fooled by people saved from it. Oh, and of course it's not scary. It create funny scenes (yes, because it's completely unbelievable, not just unlikely to happen), or chain reactions. That's it. I love the scene where one char makes a lot of precautions to avoid death in his apartment though. Is that even a great concept ? I mean, Death doesn't really care about us. It's not personal, you know. Death just makes sure some people die frequently, it's not like it's gonna make a complex, tedious chain reaction to kill you, and specifically you. You escaped a plane crash. Whatever, dude, Death is just gonna kill some old people instead. You know.",4,0,1,8 November 2017
Incredibles 2," Incredible disappointment
","What happened ?The first volet was nice and complex, pleasing both adults and children and this is just an explosion of bright color to please families who bring their kids.
Basically this movie is for kids.
All characters are void, every scene is a Superhero fight and it's messy and annoying. Gimme a break from casting superpowers. The very first scene is a crazy attack by a supervilain and every else follows as a fast-paced nonsense.
There is no breaks, transitions, just an endless flow of CGI like Disney knows how to do now. I guess the magic from 2D Disney movies is just dead.Another problem : they casted the guy from Better Call Saul to play...some kind of lawyer. They basically extracted this character from Breaking Bad and put him, and his voice, in the movie. This is what you do when you have no ideas about character design and character develpment.I don't buy that the sister fights crime at the end and leaves her boyfriend alone like an old sock, and does the most moral, responsible choice. Like hell she does, at her teenager age.Characters just show off their abilities without any interesting plot or development. This movie is an incredible failure. As always, the more money in involved, the more likely you are to fall into a huge pile of CGI epileptic mess.Goodbye, Disney. I'm gonna watch Mulan now.",3,2,4,26 October 2018
Sully," Deeply moving drama
","It's been a while since I saw Tom Hanks, maybe it was the Terminal, a movie about a man stuck in a airport, maybe he's got something for planes ! Anyway. I've been deeply moved by this drama, Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckart are just excellent and make a really believable pilot duo, the humanity and steadiness of Sully is just amazing as he faces the cruel investigators. We care about Sully from the very start, because we can see he's a good man tormented by bad dreams about plane crashes, and I have a special mention for dialogues which are really enjoyable, Sully just always finds the right answer to the investigators of the crash, it's a real pleasure to see his confidence in what he did. I would have expected more presence for Eckart though. The co-pilot finds himself in an incredible situation, yet he doesn't even asks : 'are you sure about this ? Isn't there another way ?', it really felt too passive during the crash. The psychology of Sully is really well-written, you can see he doesn't really like to be called a hero or being hugged, but still he fights back to not be called a criminal. A nice surprise to see Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad, playing here one of the investigators. She quite has the same administrative role in Breaking Bad so it fits her well.Cinematography is mastered even if not excellent, by director of photography Tom Stern who also collaborated with Eastwood on Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby. You can see the real pilot and crash victims meeting in the credits, so stay to the end. One of the most interesting movies of Clint Eastwood. I recommend.",8,1,1,6 November 2017
