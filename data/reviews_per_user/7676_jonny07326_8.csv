50 First Dates," Sandler's most mature and best movie he's starred in so far.
","Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore deliver. The Wedding Singer was good, so is this. The idea for the film was brilliant, a well written, smart comedy(something Sandler hasn't done too many of) but I can see him turning into a great comedy actor. If you like this, I would recommend watching Click and Spanglish. Rob Scneider even has an excellent role, and Alan Covert as 10 Second Tom was absolutely hilarious. Sean Astin as the juice using brother was also great. And Dan Akroyd played his part very well. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that Steve Buscemi wasn't in it!! But... despite that, the cast clicked, and it was brilliantly written. Rent it!",10,0,0,2 February 2007
The Prestige," Keeps you guessing!
","The first time that I watched this movie, I had became interested immediately as I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman. Each and every actor played their respective parts well. Basically, there are two rival magicians and they're both trying to out do each other, what happens is that they both sabotage their rivals' acts. This leads them both to a driving obsession that takes over their lives. They both become so obsessed with magic that they don't seem to notice everything else in life. At the end of the film all of the twists come out... and the film becomes very, very interesting after that. You have to watch it twice to understand the entirety of the film.",9,2,5,2 July 2007
Silent Hill," Not a lot of people understood the movie
","Personally, I didn't mind the movie, but I also didn't truly understand it until I saw it the 2nd time. It isn't a horror film, but more of a mystery/thriller. The people of the village were like early 1000s burning witches and stuff There were a couple death scenes but not gory or anything like that. I thought the mother was a little whacky as well at the beginning. The reason I am only giving a 6/10 is because of the weirdness at the beginning. Watch this movie if you're in for a good mystery, good acting but I didn't care for the stroyline, so 6/10 is my rating... and also, if you liked the movie, try the video game, it's pretty good and similar to the movie.",6,0,0,27 October 2006
Forrest Gump," How did this not get a higher rating than Fight Club?
","I agree with most of the IMDb's top 250 list, but two things have puzzled me. One of them is the fact that Forrest Gump is currently #81 on the list, and a movie that wasn't bad, but not nearly as good as this called Fight Club, was #31! The other thing was that Forrest Gump was so low on the top 250 list. I think it should be in the top 20, right up there with Goodfellas, but it's not!! Tom Hanks basically had a star turning role in this film. It's one of his best performances to date and he didn't even make the top 20? The movie was a mixture of comedy and drama, something that is so hard to do and seldomly keeps the story in place, but Forrest Gump did. This was brilliantly casted and very well directed.",10,1,5,9 March 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Kind of Retarded.
","I rented it... I can't believe that I spent the $5 for the rental fees. This type of thing has been done before... Many times before and I would like to stress that a family of mutant cannibals is very stupid. If it is meant to scare... it didn't meet any demands of a horror film. It is not a classic, it's basically a step backwards of the original... No wait, it's a GIGANTIC leap backwards. Terrible actors, bad script, nothing good about it accept for the fact that it was funny! The 6.2 rating is a load of ****. The only reason I watched this is because I heard it was good. Let me tell you, that man owes me 5 bucks, because this was a waste of my life, I would rather go upstairs and watch new episodes of SNL.",1,0,2,4 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Has to be the best one yet.
","I have to say, this is my personal favorite Harry Potter film. It introduces a lot of new aspects of the film and brings up many questions. I loved the characters Dobby(The House Elf), Professor Lockhart, Luscious Malfoy, Ginny Weasley, Weasley Sr, and the introductions of The Whomping Willow and Moaning Myrtle. The film was incredible. I loved the flying car scene and when they were trying to escape the giant spiders. Sadly, it was the last one that Richard Harris lived for, and the last of John Williams music and even the last Chris Colombus directing. I don't know why the rating is only 7.3, why is it so underrated?",10,0,2,2 February 2007
300," Better than the original! (Gore fest!)
","This movie is nothing less than amazing, and I loved it, but that's just an honest opinion, if you have not seen it, take a look at this comment and see if it succeeds to arouse your interests. I was expecting a lot out of this film, and my expectations were delivered and then some. This movie consisted of many different themes. War, love, happiness, betrayal, pride, integrity, passion, etc. Anyone who loves war movies or battles, I would recommend this movie to them. Otherwise, I would stay away from it. There were many great visual effects and scenery, it's a work of art. This is probably my favourite movie about ancient times by far. Other than the Gladiator.",10,1,4,6 August 2007
Click," Awesome! A life Lesson!
","I really loved this one. A lot of people expected that it was going to be a silly typical Adam Sandler movie. My friends told me that it wasn't very funny, and I wasn't going to watch it. BUT... it WAS funny, I couldn't stop laughing at the beginning, I was astonished. And at the middle, a lesson telling you to pay attention to every detail in life. I've watched it over and over. It is well casted and well written. I can see Sandler putting out some more mature movies because of it. It's the perfect formula, a bit of comedy mixed in with a great storyline. The whole family can love it(even the kids) and provides intelligent comedy. It's a must-see and worth the money to rent or buy it.",10,2,4,4 February 2007
