First Man," Solid movie
","I saw the flag, it was there. I don't get why people are complaining, speaking as a conservative. I thought this was going to be a COD or BF5 thing where they spit on history but honestly there was nothing wrong with this movie. If they completely ommitted the flag I would understand, but they didn't. And they say the left gets easily triggered.",8,1,3,28 October 2018
Us," Interesting premise, lackluster execution
","This movie made no sense, and Im not even talking about the little things like where the scissors and the golf gloves came from or how there's space for all these people in the tunnel or why there is lights or why the government didnt care to shoot them all when they abandoned the project, Im talking about the major plot twist. Why didnt Red escape from the underground when she got replaced by the clone after she got out of the cuffs. Was the clone all of a sudden able to control her now she was not underground anymore? Why would she choose to stay underground for 30 years? And the execution of the plot twist was corny as hell. Also the voice of Red was seriously comical.
The comedy was seriously annoying. I hate it when people who are in horrible situations dont even seem to care. Especially the kids were unfazed by dead bodies. Really takes you out of the experience. And the parents were like: 'oh our friends are dead which means probably everyone is getting killed by their clones right now, that sucks I guess' instead of having a panic attack.
The music was okay, except for the main theme which sounded like a parody of satanic chants from other better movies like The Omen.
The characters had no development and werent interesting in any way, this movie relied purely on its stupid plot which fell flat.To summarize: this movie was ridiculous not only in its premise (which is a good thing, I like originality) but also in its execution (which ruined this movie for me). It was comical how they tried to make it scary and deep while it felt more like a less coherent M Night Shyamalan movie. Get Out was great, Us was not.",5,1,1,27 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Too long like every Marvel movie
","The first half was almost a masterpiece but later on, it started to drag and the second half was like every other Marvel movie with a not very exciting showdown. I wish they'd keep their movies at 1h 45mins max and scale back the boss battle or do something new because the formula is starting to bore me. That being said, I found the telekinetic bad guy at the beginning more intimidating and interesting than Thanos. I had the time of my life the first half, the second half was good and even though the ending was different, it's painfully obvious that it doesn't matter. Shame they had to kill off Quill, Spiderman etc because they already announced another Guardians and Spiderman movie. If Marvel wants their movies to have conequences or intrigue they should stop announcing sequels before other movies those characters appear in. Really, really stupid. And the way Loki died was also unearned. Still, probably the best Marvel movie for me.",8,1,4,28 October 2018
