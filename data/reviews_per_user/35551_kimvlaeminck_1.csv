Hereditary," The exercist of the new generation
","Very good movie. Masterpiece horror movie. 
Great filming, great story, mindblowing acting. The mixture of drama and horror blends very well. I felt so uncomfortable the whole movie. Yet it was impossible to look away. 
The bits of silence were so powerful. 
Left me speachless. 
Go watch at cinemas though. Without distractions of the outside world this movie is able to suck you into this family drama in no time.",9,6,16,9 June 2018
