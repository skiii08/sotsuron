Saturday Night Fever," Loved the music, loved John Travolta and have the 2001 Odyssey, how ironic!
","SNF really brings back memories. Recently, I got the DVD for Christmas (the only thing I wanted). I thought I would watch it with my kids, but quickly nixed that idea after the first round of graphic sexual scenes and pungent expletives. (I was 13 in 1977, when this definitive 70's movie came out, so I was a disco wannabe and only remember seeing it as a PG-13 movie. I honestly think it could do with a NC-17 rating in its rerelease instead of the fairly tame R-rating. )After sending the kids out (they love the opening 'Stayin' Alive' sequence), I fell in love again, with the music (okay, like the Bee Gees are my absolute favorite group of all time), with John Travolta (my husband has a cleft in his chin, too), and all the generation-defining disco dancing. The Bee Gees have always been my favorite group (because of their work on this film), and I have a 25-year-old original soundtrack LP to prove it, so even though I never set foot in a disco, I feel I was really part of the disco generation. And, now, disco music (and weird 70's clothes) is cool and hip again (although I promised my tweens I'd never say either 'cool' or 'hip' again - sorry).For those of you who think disco sucks, too bad - you're simply out of fashion - disco is back, man. My kids love the soundtrack, too.
And, in addition to all my posters of John Travolta, the Bee Gees, and Princess Diana (yes, loved her, too - great when they danced together at the White House), irony of ironies, I own the greatest, most obscure (and probably the most common) piece of movie trivia - a 2001 Odyssey (Honda).I think all who love this movie should get together and watch it in unison every Saturday night a la 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' and all act out the parts. 'Tony, can I wipe your forehead...'  Anyone game???P.S.: This movie is a film flub lover's dream...",10,1,2,3 January 2003
