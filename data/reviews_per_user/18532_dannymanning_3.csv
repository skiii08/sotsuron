The Sound of Music," The Best musical
","The Sound of Music is without a doubt the only musical I have ever genially liked , perhaps its the nostalgia of watching it as a kid; or more likely, when it comes to the Sound of Music the songs sung feel genuine and not forced. By this I mean for me personally I have always thought that the songs sung in most musicals seem non realistic and not genuine. The songs sung in the Sound of Music always feel like they could have actually be sung in real life. Without a doubt Julie Andrews carry's the movie with her amazing voice.",9,2,2,16 April 2020
Taxi Driver," Good
","First I should say that I watched Taxi Driver after I watched Joker. I watched Taxi Driver after hearing how Todd Phillips was inspired by that movie when creating Joker. Ultimately what I find different about the two movies is that 'Joker' is a lot more acknowledging to the fact that our protagonist is mentally ill and needs help. I also notice the complete difference in movie scores, while Joker's movie score delivers an award winning powerful score that heightens many of the movies scenes. Taxi Driver's score however is very repetitive and honestly boring. Most of the dialogue is delivered in an even duller way than the music. It's not till the last 40 minutes of the movie where something actually starts to happen. I wouldn't say Taxi Driver is a bad movie but just a little dull. What didn't help the movie in my opinion was that for the first half of the movie Travis Bickle he was portrayed as just being a little slow or dumb but not crazy as he quickly transitions to to the second half.",7,0,0,7 May 2020
Psycho," The OG
","How to begin talking about Psycho... It was the first movie to show a toilet! Beginning with the toilet, like many things in this movie the showing of a toilet showed the boldness's Alfred Hitchcock was willing to do when making this movie. Psycho may have been rated R but even as an R rated movie this movie when above and beyond any horror movie that had been made before it. The usage of black an white color in order to by pass restrictions on showing blood was a great idea that added so much to this movie. Of course how can you discuss this movie without talking about the infamous shower scene? Originally the shower murder was going to be completely without music, however what has become one of the most parodied movie scenes in movie history was most likely thanks to the inclusion of the ere and creepy music played during this scene. The shower murder itself was very bold like much of the movie, while nothing to revealing is shown, we do see and believe Janet Leigh is full blown naked while being realistically stabbed. Where this movie slows down a little is the explanation scene at the end which was a little awkward, long and boring. Psycho is very interesting movie worth seeing, this movie did so many firsts which overtime has really payed off as Psycho is one of the most well known and beloved movies.",10,1,1,7 May 2020
