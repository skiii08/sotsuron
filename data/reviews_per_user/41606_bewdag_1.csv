Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The most surprising film I have ever seen
","I have to say that Sherlock Holmes: a Game of Shadows was absolutely terrific. It totally blew me away by how great it was.I went to see this on a cold night back in January, not expecting much, but it ended up delivering. Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job as Sherlock Holmes and the way that Jude Law as Watson participated in the plot made him not seem like a sidekick but an equal.Jared Harris was brilliant as Professor Moriarty. He is definitely my favorite movie antagonist ever. This film is funny, the plot does not drag and it has lots of action and mystery. I love the first movie and this was just as good. This sequel definitely did not suffer the fate of most sequels. It is a rare, brilliant sequel that will leave you on the edge of your seat for two amazing hours. With brilliant cinematography, great acting, an interesting plot, a great antagonist and wonderful music, this is my favorite movie of all time along with the first movie. I will always feel proud to have this movie in my DVD collection.",10,0,1,6 July 2012
