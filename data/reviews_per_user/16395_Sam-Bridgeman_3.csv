Scarface," The one and only...SCARFACE!
",Scarface in my opinion is Al Pacino's greatest roll he has ever played. I first watched Scarface about 2 years ago and within the first few minutes I loved the film. Im a big fan of the film mainly because of when it was set (1980s Florida) I also like the fact it is about the Cocaine world. Also in my opinion I think Tony Montana is the biggest film legend of all time. There are many great scenes and lines in Scarface ('Say Hello To My Little Friend'). I think no one else could have played Tony Montana better than Al Pacino. To be honest I don't think someone as great as Robert De Niro could have played him. Pacino was born for the part of Scarface.10 Out of 10!,10,0,1,22 June 2008
No Country for Old Men," One hell of a film!
","I watched No Country For Old Men on the day it came out. I was completely blown away by it. Everything about it was brilliant. Anton Chigurh is one bad-ass of a villain played superbly by Javier Bardem. It was the first film I had seen that had been made by the Coen Brothers. I got 'No Country' for my birthday and still think its as good as I saw it in the cinema. I found The Coen Brother's 'Fargo' for a great price and bought that and thought that was also brilliant. Im looking to find Blood Simple as I have heard many good things about it. All the actors that play the main rolls (Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin & Javier Bardem)I think Tommy Lee Jones played a great roll of Sheriff Bell.9 Out Of 10! Excellent",9,2,4,22 June 2008
Goodfellas," What a masterpiece of a film.
","I first watched GoodFellas about 2 years ago and the moment I saw the murder of Billy Batts within the opening couple of minutes I knew I was in for a treat. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway brilliantly. Joe Pesci also superbly plays the ruthless Tommy DeVito. In my opinion I think it is Martin Scorsese's best film. Im a big fan of Scorsese's choice of music to put in GoodFellas as I am a big fan of Eric Clapton, Cream & The Rolling Stones. Since I watched GoodFellas I have gone on to buy other Scorsese films such as Raging Bull, Casino, Taxi Driver & Gangs Of New York, But still without a doubt I think GoodFellas is better than all of those.",10,0,0,22 June 2008
