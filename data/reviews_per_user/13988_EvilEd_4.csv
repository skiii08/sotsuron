The Blair Witch Project," Great movie, but doesnt reinvent modern horror.
","SPOILER ALERT Not a bad movie at all, in fact its quite good, the only problem i had with it was that i wished they had shown some of the fake reaction footage that they had shot. They could have had it compiled before or after the film itself and explain the story in more detail. Instead, the only parts of the legend that we know is what the kids in the movie tell us. Seeing the footage of the parents putting up missing flyers and talking about the search, including where and how they found the footage, would've made it much more disturbing. I noticed that the people who thought it was real true enjoyed the movie much more, so don't go telling your friends that it is fake. There was some fairly good acting in it, unfortunately, the guy who plays mike isnt the best, and his facade falls through during the scene where he reveals what he did with the map. I wish the night scenes were longer, and a few of the jokes are obviously contrived, but still a great movie, just missing a beginning and an end.",9,1,1,1 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Only thing that was missing was Mr Hanky
","Great movie, GREAT MOVIE, wonderful satire. This movie was so funny that i saw it twice and laughed just as hard. Lots of little things too catch in it as well. Dont go if you're easily offended, this movie takes a stab at everyone.",10,0,0,29 July 1999
The Mist," This would be great as a SCI FI channel movie...
","I was very disappointed with this movie. The CGI really sucked. The whole theme of 'We are the monsters' and obvious derivative elements from Lord Of The Flies is really played out. Show me more monsters please. The 'Suprise' ending isn't a surprise, its really, really lame. Monsters from another dimension just happen to have the characteristics of spiders, mosquitoes and crabs? Then it turns out that they aren't the REAL monsters, we are? This played out like an unnecessarily long episode of some Sci-Fi channel Twilight zone episode. Best part was the grocery kid getting eaten, then its all downhill. Not worth a second viewing.",5,2,6,28 November 2007
The Sixth Sense," Excellent Flick, but very slow moving
","This was a great movie. I live in philly so it was neat seeing all the stuff that i walk by every day in it. Great acting job by the kid and willis. Willis comes off very likeble. I didnt recognize Donnie wahlberg until he started crying like his brother did in boogie nights. This movie really reminded me of all those old horrror movies like the Omen and Rosemarys Baby. The plot is very slow though and the movie crawls along, but its still very good. AMAZING ending, it was great. Unfortunately, i dont think i could watch it again without being bored.",8,0,0,25 August 1999
