Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," first chapter
","This film, the first in the star wars saga. Has had a lot of different people saying a great many thing,about the child friendly characters, the lack luster performances by the actors. But what we as viewers have to understand is this is just the first chapter. Unfortunately we as a public were only able to read the last three chapters first. We were placed in a world already thought of, already in full swing. As a viewer I didn't have huge expectations when i went to see this film. I was excited, I simply thought of it as finally reading the beginning of a book that I loved as a child. The worlds were new and exciting the scale was very large but as with all movies repeat viewings always brings better understanding. The way Palatine effortlessly guides the queen and the senate to bring himself one step closer to power is amazing and the fact that (GL) came up with it himself is a testament to him and the reason he is the one in sky walker ranch and we are sitting in our apartment giving our reasons for weather or not we like or dislike his films",8,0,1,30 November 2005
