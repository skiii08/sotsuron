It," not scary, 6 stars for the kids
",I was excited to watch this movie because most reviews said it will haunt you for days after you watch the movie. The movie experience was completely different. The movie starts off well. You immediately feel the connection with Georgie. Its downhill from here. The visual effects were disgusting than scary. The kids were cute though and have some funny lines. So 6 stars for the kids.,6,1,3,30 September 2017
