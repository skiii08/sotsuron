The Rock," The greatest film ever made (sort of)
","Okay, so it may not be the greatest film ever produced, but it sure is up there with the most fun. Sometimes a film is just perfect. Or, to be precise, it's absolutely perfect for what it is. No, 'The Rock' will never be hailed up there with such greats as Citizen Kane or The Godfather, but it is the perfect popcorn-munching action film.Nicholas Cage (back when he still starred in decent films) plays a self-confessed FBI lab-geek who specialises in defusing explosive chemical weapons. And, by one hell of a coincidence, an insane ex general (Ed Harris) only goes and steals a load of explosive chemical weapons and sets up his hollowed-out volcano lair (well, sort of) on the disused prison-site of Alcatraz. Guess what poor ol' Nic's going to be getting up to today? Unfortunately, he's not much of a soldier and doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of defeating Ed's band of hired marines. However, that's where the only man ever to have escaped Alcatraz comes in – retired (and imprisoned!) British Secret agent, Sean Connery (his character probably has a name, but – like every film he's in – Sean Connery basically plays Sean Connery). So, as the tag-line says... in a prison where no man has ever broken out, two men must break back in.I hope whoever wrote that tagline got well paid. It really does say it all. You really don't need to know much else about the film. You only need to enjoy action films. And, when I say 'action films,' I mean action films that are actually quite fun, rather than the dark and depressing style we've been treated to in recent times. The Rock never tries to be 'gritty' and 'realistic' – it just has great action, numerous explosions and a plot so over-the-top it will envelop you completely and let it take you along for one hell of a ride. If the sheer joy of the chemistry between Cage and Connery isn't enough to entice you to watch this film, it's actually worth noting that Ed Harris' villain isn't actually as villainous as you might expect, being one of the only evil bad guys with a conscious whose point of view you can also emphasise with.Also, don't let Michael Bay's name put you off. It was made 'pre-Transformers' where he actually made some decent films.Don't think about the plot. Just love it for what it is – the perfect action film that really sums up the nineties (oh, that line could also be applied to 'Speed' – that's pretty damn awesome, too).",10,3,4,4 February 2016
The Blair Witch Project," The (sort of) original and (sort of) best
","'The Blair Witch Project' invented the 'found footage' portion of the horror genre. Well, it kind of did. The genre was technically lurking in the background, somewhere behind the slasher genre and low budget zombie flicks. You could probably trace it back to such cinematic delights as 'Cannibal Holocaust' in the seventies (only you'd probably regret it if you did). Anyway, The Blair Witch Project may not have entirely invented the type of film which is purely watching shaky hand-held camera-work filmed (for the purposes of the story) by the characters we're following, but it did bring it back to the forefront of horror-movie making. Maybe that along means I should despise it. Only I don't.If you're not familiar with the 'found footage' genre then you probably don't watch enough horror films, therefore any interest you may have in watching three teenagers get lost in a woods will be minimal. That's pretty much the story. The three of them are film students and decide to make – you guessed it – a project on the (allegedly fictional) 'Blair Witch.' Naturally, things don't go according to plan and, if getting lost wasn't annoying enough, some unseen force starts to mess with their little school trip (and one girl gets a runny nose – if you've already seen it you'll know what I mean).You may have picked up on my use of the word 'unseen.' For all found footage films are cheaply produced (okay, feel free to shout me down with such epics as 'Cloverfield' and the odd high budget one, but MOST are!). That way the film-makers don't really have to spend that much money on special effects when they can just have the person holding the camera shake it about a bit and then run off. This is the Blair Witch Project all over. If you're expecting hordes of computer-generated monsters storming the woods and chasing our hapless teens down then you're going to be sorely disappointed.You have to realise that you're going to get long periods of time where not that much happens. The highlight for much of the film is crossing the same river again and again. When I read what I've written I really think I'm not really selling the ol' BWP very well. Believe it or not, I did enjoy it. Back when I watched it in 1999 it was still a fresh genre and, not including old 'video nasties' was pretty original. Plus the acting was good. It really felt adlibbed (actually I think some was) and what you might expect from watching hours upon hours of footage filmed by just some bloke behind the camera. Perhaps one of the reasons I enjoyed it was because I spent a fair proportion of my childhood as a young boy getting (sort of deliberately) lost in the woods and could relate to how creepy the prospect of never getting home again could be (although I made sure I was never more than a stone's throw away from the road and with my dad at all times!).The three actors themselves were just about likable enough, but they do get a little bit annoying and whiney towards the end. I guess that could be explained by them slowly losing their minds due to their predicament, so, if you don't mind their constant swearing, it can be excused.So, if you're okay with 'found footage' films and are interested in the one that spawned a hundred inferior clones, then give this one a go. It's not long and you won't waste too much of your life on it. It's genuinely creepy here and there. Just don't bother with the sequel which doesn't even bother to be original and is just your standard horror cliché-fest.Oh, and if you don't think much to the way BWP ended, you're not the only one. It's a love or hate ending. I guess Family Guy hated it – look up the clip of Brian Griffin the cinema watching Blair Witch on Youtube and see that you're not alone. I felt a little cheated, but grew to accept that that was the way it was just going to be.",8,2,4,28 December 2015
Despicable Me 2," Good silly fun
","After the success of 'Despicable Me' (1) a sequel was only a matter of time. If you didn't see the first, it was about - what most people would describe as - you 'pretty clichéd Bond villain,' (aka 'Gru') complete with lair and army of incompetent minions. Only his plans for world domination and chaos are thwarted when he adopts three orphan girls. If you can believe that, you probably enjoyed what followed.Now, we find him making jelly instead of nerve gas and taking his girls to the park. However, because he's turned good, he's recruited by the good-guys to take on a 'real' supervillain. And, naturally, this time round he meets a 'love interest' along the way.The bottom line is that the kids will love this. It kept my nine year old daughter entertained for hours. It's silly, colourful, loud, easy to follow and packed full of delightful animation and visual gags. Plus it contains a healthy dose of spoofing of Bond-type films which will be picked up by the adults.If you have kids, they'll love it and you shouldn't mind watching it with them (a few time, too!). I have to say that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't think it was up to the (high) standards of the Toy Story and Shrek franchises. Even thought I love Steve Carell, if I had my way, I wouldn't watch this more than once. However, that's not an option as my daughter is currently wearing out the DVD in the player.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,0,26 July 2014
The Mask," Still great after all this time
","I haven't watched 'The Mask' for years and I was actually wondering how well it would stand up after over twenty years. Back in 1995 Jim Carrey was Hollywood's (comedy) golden child. Everything he touched was Box Office dynamite. However, since then, his offerings have been a little more hit and miss (don't get me started on 'Dumb and Dumber To!'), but I'm pleased to say that The Mask still shows off his manic persona and comedy timings.I have a feeling 'The Mask' was based on a comic book, but I haven't read it! Therefore, I can't really say how well it's transferred across to the big screen. Although I can say that it works. Carrey plays a – depressingly average – guy who's too nice for his own good. Everyone takes advantage of him and his life is pretty awful. Naturally, when he finds a mysterious wooden mask that when worn transforms him into a green-faced superhero, he chooses to fight crime, protect the weak and generally stand up for justice. Or rather he kind of considers all those options. He mainly just uses his new powers to get back at all those people who have wronged him and do his best to woo the – then unknown – Cameron Diaz.Yes, the story is hardly original and, if you've seen any of Marvel's latest offerings, it's pretty much identical to every other superhero film, i.e. man gets superpowers, man fights crime, defeats villain and gets girl. But, don't let any small lack of originality put you off. It's not there to be a great work of art with deep and meaningful prose and character arcs. It's there to entertain, utilising Carrey's full repartee to the max.The manic jokes come thick and fast. Normally, the best films are 'team efforts' when the cast all play their parts. Not here. Here it's just Carrey, Carrey, Carrey. He steals every scene and created a thousand new catch phrases in the process.It's a fun film and it should be enjoyed by everyone. It's simple enough to be understood and enjoyed by children and it's just dark enough to appeal to adults.100% prime Carrey (and Cameron Diaz is pretty good, too).",9,2,2,25 January 2016
Insidious: Chapter 2," By the number sequel
","I didn't like this film. However, the main reason I wasn't impressed was due to how much I enjoyed the first 'Insidious' film. I found it - amazingly - quite a refreshing (and above all scary) little horror film. Therefore I was hoping for more of the same from the sequel. And I sure got it.Insidious 2 felt like the same film. Everything was the same (apart from a lack of so much Darth Maul towards the end). It just seemed like they photocopied the first film's script, added a couple of 'flashback scenes' and turned it out as a new movie.To be honest, there's nothing wrong with Insidious 2. It has scares, i.e. a few loud noises that make you jump and the ghostly effects are reasonably creepy. However, so was the first film, therefore I was hoping for a little more than simply a 'rehash.' No one can accuse the franchise of straying from the formula. That's 'Chapter 2's' main problem - it's too similar. Now it just feels like a hundred other formulaic horror films that get offloaded straight to DVD.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5,0,0,11 July 2014
The Avengers," Great fun for all the family (or mainly men)
","What can be said about the Avengers that can't be summed up by the poster? In case you've been living in another dimension, the past, or with the gods, you must have noticed that all the most recent Marvel films have been running side by side, setting the scene from something bigger. And this is it.The Avengers sees superheroes: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Nick Fury come together to fight Thor's nasty brother - fellow God Loki.Just check the poster and promotional art out to see whether you think you'll like it. It's big, it's bold, it's explosive, it's special effects-laden and everything you've come to expect from a summer blockbuster. Apart from the fact that most summer blockbusters are simply special effects and a costly cinema admission. The Avengers is actually pretty damn good.The Avengers was released in the same years as Batman: The Dark Knight Rises and many people wondered whether there would be enough room for two such giant superhero movies. I would say yes, largely down to them being such different types of film. The Dark Knight is...well, much darker. It's not so brash and loud as the Avengers. Perhaps The Dark Knight is 'the thinking man's superhero movie?' Either way, if you want dark, moody and deep, Christopher Nolen's Batman will probably fit the bill. However, if you just want some pretty wicked action, great set-pieces and a bunch of people with superpowers knocking lumps out of each other in silly suits then delivering a witty quip or two, then The Avengers should keep you entertained for a couple of hours.People have argued that the superheroes don't receive equal screen time. Well, they nearly do, but you have to expect that Robert Downey Jr gets a little more screen time than his counterparts due to him being the biggest star in the film. But that should be a minor gripe.Bottom line: if you liked any of the previous Marvel superhero movies that this film is based on, then you will probably like this one.But, like I mentioned in the title, I'm guessing it will appeal mainly to young boys (or men like me who are still young boys at heart - and it has nothing to do with Scarlett Johannson in her catsuit... honest).",10,0,3,7 January 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Good, but could do with a trim
","Despite my love of epic sci-fi, Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford and general futuristic shenanigans, I am possible the one geek out there who never really 'got' 'Bladerunner. I've watched it numerous times over the years, every time hoping I'd see it for the 'masterpiece' that everyone else seems to. The weird thing about my interaction with Bladerunner is that as soon as the credits roll, I forget everything I've seen. About the only two things I can remember are something about a man questioning a robot about a turtle and Rutger Hauer snapping fingers towards the end of the movie. Therefore, when I sat down for the (long awaited) sequel 'Bladerunner 2049' my hopes were hardly high. It's now nearly a day since I've watched it and, although I wouldn't call it the greatest film I've ever seen, at least I can pretty much recall everything the average cinema goer does about a film they've just watched – so at least that's an improvement on the original (from my point of view!).The first film is set in the future where human-shaped robots (known as 'replicants') live among the human population. Harrison Ford was the cop in charge of bringing in any replicants who go AWOL. This time round in 2049 we have a similar set-up, this time with Ryan Gosling taking over the role of the cop chasing down rogue replicants. Now, he's a good choice for the serious tone of the lead. Just because the original was filmed in the eighties where action movies were a little more over the top and tongue in cheek, doesn't mean either 'Bladerunner' film is anything other than completely serious. And, I should say now that neither should really be considered an 'action' movie. If you're looking for wall-to-wall shoot outs and car chases, you won't find them in 'Bladerunner world.' I suppose as much as I enjoyed Gosling's performance in the lead, I was (and am) always a Harrison Ford fan. Now, he came back in a big role in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' and I keep hearing rumours of a fifth 'Indiana Jones' movie. So, I hope I'm not spoiling this film for anyone when I say that, despite Ford being featured heavily in the marketing, the overall film is kind of 'Ford-lite.' This is Gosling's film and, to be fair, he does it well. But, I'm being a bit negative. The film was actually pretty good – it's strength lying in its atmosphere. You really do get a feel of what the world is like here. The long (reasonably non CGI!) establishing shots, combined with the haunting musical score bring a sense of gravitas to the film that few others have. I can see this becoming a bit of a cult masterpiece of the future, simply by how it looks and in relation to its score alone.However, as atmospheric is as this film is and, despite that being a bonus, it's also the film's undoing. The film stands at quite a lengthy two hours, forty-three minutes and much of that is spent watching long, lingering establishing shots of various desolate landscapes. Basically, I'd probably end up editing about ten seconds out of every scene and bring down the overall running time by about twenty minutes (it would help – my opinion!). Yet, as much as the slow pacing of some of the scenes did drag for me, ultimately the film didn't seem the full run time (probably felt more like around the two hour mark). So, I guess that means that I actually enjoyed this one more than the first (rare for a sequel, I know). Due to its length I probably wouldn't watch '2049' again for a while, but I definitely think I'd watch it again as it's left more of an impression on my than its predecessor. Yes, I'd have liked more Ford (and possibly more Jared Leto, too – also underused!), but you can't have it all. In a world of sub-standard sequels it does seem that this one was actually worth the wait.",7,0,2,7 October 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Slow and steady wins the race
","I'm guessing that most people won't have decided to watch 'Kill Bill Volume 2' without watching the first instalment. So, if you've already seen the first half, you may be expecting something similar from the final act. However, whereas the first half was a blood-soaked massacre of bodies and mayhem, this one is anything but.I won't say exactly how many people 'The Bride' kills in this one (and it's nowhere near the seemingly infinite number of ninjas she chopped up in Part 1), but there's a big clue in the title! Yes, 'Volume 2' is a very slow film. In many ways it's more like a Tarantino film that its predecessor. It's very 'talkie' – there are tonnes of long, drawn-out scenes where characters natter to each other, seemingly going nowhere. It just is. It's there to build character. However, if you're not partial to that sort of scene, then you probably won't enjoy this part.As with the first half, there are a handful of scenes that you probably feel could have been left on the cutting room floor, but, all in all, it's a pretty solid film. Yes, it's not fast-paced; it's almost deliberately slow – like the 'ying' to Part 1's 'yang.' Fans of Tarantino will probably love it anyway, but anyone who likes broodingly slow film with clever dialogue should enjoy it, too.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,2,3 August 2014
Men in Black 3," Black is definitely 2012's black
","The first Men in Black was a hit. For some reason the second one didn't live up to the first. I think the general consensus was that it was okay, but more of a rehash of the original. However, number 3 - the sequel that comes after a decade - shows that they're back to their best. Okay, so maybe not quite as good as the original, but definitely a worthy instalment of the light-hearted alien-bashing series.This time Agent J (Will Smith) has to travel back in time to stop Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) from being assassinated by a particularly nasty alien (oh, and save the world while he's at it, but that's a given for the Men in Black). Back in the swinging sixties (populated by more 'sixties style' aliens - if you've watched the original Star Trek series, you'll know what I mean) J partners up with K's younger self (expertly played by Josh Brolin).If you've seen the first two, you'll know what to expect. There's nothing that new here, but sometimes that's not necessarily a bad thing. Men in Black was never meant to be taken seriously. It's just a popcorn film that will probably appeal to most people who like a healthy dose of silly sci-fi.Just sit back, put your brain on hold and your dark glasses on... and enjoy.",7,1,3,27 October 2014
Scarface," Pretty much perfect
","Scarface' is just about as near as you can get to a perfect movie. It is also a remake. How many times have you heard those words put together?! I dare say not many. The original was made back in 1932 and I think it's fair to say that film-making techniques had progressed enough (along with the world around us!) to create an original and totally different spin on the story of an ambitious criminal slowly climbing the underworld's seedy ladder until he becomes the kingpin himself.You'll probably notice from any associated artwork for this film that it depicts Al Pacino, almost always on his own. That's because he plays the lead Tony 'Scarface' Montana - a South American immigrant who comes to Miami and sets about taking over the local drug trade. It's totally his film. Many say it's his equivalent of Robert DeNiro's 'Taxi Driver' as it would be almost nothing without him.It's also worth noting that he's possibly one of the most unlikable leads ever to grace the silver screen. He's a truly horrendous character with almost no redeemable traits - I suppose the only exceptions to his evil is that he only really hurts/kills those who are already involved in 'the business' or know what that sort of lifestyle is all about and he does his best not to hurt any innocent bystanders along the way. However, even his attempts to protect those he has some genuine feelings for (i.e. his family) often end up in disaster.I suppose it's worth mentioning about the protagonist's character as some may find it a little hard to watch a man like that for over two hours of screen time. If you're looking for a hero you can root for and even relate to then you probably won't find him here! I guess most view him like a human 'car crash' who you just can't help but watch in order to see how bad it (i.e. his life) can get. There are certainly some other familiar supporting cast-members, Michelle Pfeiffer being the most famous (or rather PRE-famous!), but, again, it's all Pacino's show. It really is a vehicle to show off his acting talent.
There's not an awful lot else to say about the film. If you're into your gritty crime/gangster films then you should probably own this one already. I suppose the only negative thing about it is its content. Due to its foul language, violence and drug abuse, it's probably not going to appeal to everyone (mainly those with a more 'sensitive' nature!), but it really is the pinnacle of cinematic gangster films made about a true anti-hero (of course 'Breaking Bad' later copied the idea - sort of - and made plenty of changes to create something completely different for the small screen, but the similarities are all there -keep an eye out for them!).",9,3,4,3 September 2018
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Will probably offend everyone (and all the better for it)
","If you're wondering whether to watch 'Borat' or not, you probably need to ask yourself how do you feel about its star – the man behind the moustache, aka Sacha Baron Cohen himself. If you don't know who he is by now, or have never heard about him, I strongly advice you look him up on the internet (there must be numerous clips of his work on Youtube for example) and, if you like what he does, then Borat will be a treat for you.Sacha Baron Cohen is an English comedian/actor who specialises in sending up his (unsuspecting) victims by portraying outrageous characters in their vicinity and secretly filming their reactions. Here, he plays a fictional journalist, Borat, from Kazakhstan who travels to America to do a documentary on American culture.However, if you're thinking that the whole film will be nothing more than 'hidden camera antics,' then you'll be wrong. The 'story' is heavily scripted around the 'set pieces' which make up the footage that is filmed without the knowledge of the public. It's most likely best to view the film as half scripted, half hidden camera and completely outrageous.It is offensive. Although it's hard to say exactly who to. Much of the debates surrounding the film centres on who should be offended more. Some say that it portrays people from Kazakhstan poorly while others say it's 'anti-American' and, in places, anti-Semitic. I think it just mocks the world we live in and nicely points out that no one should be beyond parody.Don't expect a beautifully-created storyline with well-developed characters and clever story arcs, just enjoy seeing pretty much everyone sent up, as they are repeatedly amazed and appalled by the antic of the man with the moustache. And, as I said at the beginning, if you have no idea what to expect from this film, don't watch it. You need to know what you're letting yourself in for before you spend an hour and a half in the company of Borat. Also, if you enjoyed this so much that you bought it on DVD, it's worth noting that a lot of extra funny scenes were cut from the theatrical release and can be found on the 'extras' menu – don't take the DVD out of the machine without checking those babies out!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",9,1,1,21 July 2014
Alien 3," There is a trick to getting something out of this film
","Firstly, let me get off my chest that I loved 'Alien' and 'Aliens,' therefore, I was one of the legions of fanboys who eagerly awaited the next instalment of the franchise. And, like so many others, I was left severely disappointed at what I got.Alien 3 continues the story, but just wasn't what the - numerous - fans were after. You can look up online as to the many problems the production went through. To this day the director has still disowned it.I hated it. People were basically expecting 'Aliens Part II' and they got this. They say a sequel should be 'everything good about the original and more.' Aliens is one of the few films where (some) people claim it is actually an improvement on the original. Whether you agree with that or not, it does offer 'the same and more' of its predecessor. Alien 3 didn't just take one step back, but TWO. It's less tense than Alien and not as action-packed with such memorable characters as Aliens.So, it was pretty much despised by all. However, I still watch it from time to time (mainly the extended 2003 edition - you don't want to bother with the original cut) and, begrudgingly, it does have its merits - not many, but a few. The trick to enjoying it is to simply not consider it a part of the Alien franchise. Don't think of it as the sequel to Aliens, but just a horror/sci-fi movie. To me the saga ended with Aliens. I watch this for something different. It is well-directed, with its distinct own look. Plus it succeeds in creating a very bleak atmosphere and vision of the future (in stark contrast to the upbeat ending of Aliens). The sets are nice, too.Overall, it's not the travesty that so many - including me - once made it out to be. It'll never be Alien or Aliens, but let it be what it is - a stand-alone effort which dares to try and explore new territory (albeit with mixed results).",6,1,2,5 September 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Not bad... for a sequel
","One of the easiest ways to sum up Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows would be to say, 'If you liked the first one then you'll love this one too.' It's basically more of the same, but if what was done the first time was a winning formula, then who really care? (it worked for Terminator 1-3!).You have more witticisms from Robert Downey Jr as Holmes, more of long-suffering Jude law as Watson and more trendy and stylish slow-mo directing, courtesy of Guy Ritchie. This time round they team up to lock horns with arguably Holmes' most famous villain - Moriarty.You could call it all a re-tread of the first film, but in different locations, but that would probably be overly cynical. It's a new story in itself and, while certain purists complain that it's not completely faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original books, it's got its own charms. It may not be a hundred per cent accurate or believable, but it's basically Hollywood's take on what Sherlock Holmes was and - in my opinion - it's a pretty exciting take. Bring on Holmes III!",8,1,2,26 April 2015
The Incredible Hulk," The Marvel shared universe's 'misfire?'
","Thor. Iron Man. The Avengers. It's pretty impressive how the Marvel Studios can make one memorable hit film after the next. And then you had the Incredible Hulk. Somewhere. Seeing as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America seem to have pushed themselves to the forefront of the Marvel Universe, sometimes it's easy to forget that there was also a film dedicated to the big green grumpy fella! Or maybe that's because there were actually TWO movies, but we won't really touch on that.The Incredible Hulk movie was actually a remake of a similar Marvel movie only a few years before. However, it totally bombed at the Box Office and was therefore quickly forgotten as soon as possible, especially when the Hulk was to be drafted into the same on screen universe as Iron Man and co. It's not a bad film, it just has problems. One of which is the lack of originality. It's basically Iron Man (1), only with different characters. The story is pretty much identical, only with a green star instead of a guy in a metal suit.Secondly, and this is more of a downside that's applicable after the film was made, the Hulk's human alter-ego played by Edward Norton, decided to leave the franchise. Therefore, all Hulk-related scenes in everything from the Avengers onwards was taken over by Mark Ruffalo. I think the studio was hoping that the Hulk would become more of a franchise in its own right, as there are plenty of little plot points in the film which aren't resolved, clearly so that they can be addressed in later instalments. I guess only time will tell if these will ever see the light of day, or whether the Avengers will take over and the Hulk will just be a background character in the overall story.However, that was to come. Judging the film on its own and it's not that bad. It has some pretty impressive action scenes which are fun to watch, but it's main plus point is Tim Roth. Yes, he's the man tasked with bringing down the Hulk at any costs, but I was on his side. He pretty much saved the film for me. The Hulk (when big, green and generally smashing things) was fun, however Edward Norton (despite being a great actor) just didn't really have much to work with. Therefore it was up to Roth to steal every scene.I know the Hulk is based on a comic book and the monster itself did (still) look pretty computer-generated, which was a bit disappointing as it looked only slightly better than its forgotten predecessor 'Hulk.' The Incredible Hulk doesn't really feel that bigger part of the overall 'Marvel shared universe,' but it is a fun enough little jaunt that is worth a watch just for Tim Roth's performance.",7,0,1,21 October 2015
The Monuments Men," Hard to pigeonhole this movie
","'The Monuments Men.' Maybe I should have found out more about this film before I watched it. I thought I had a round idea... we're told from the promotional material that a group of 'misfits' hunts important pieces of art during the end of the Second World War and prevents them from falling into Nazi hands.And, to be fair, that is what it's about. However, I don't know what I was expecting, but it never seemed to fit into any particular genre. It's not really a war film. Yes, it's set in the middle of a war and – almost – every scene depicts a war-torn Europe. However, there's hardly a shot fired throughout the entire film. The 'misfits' label makes it sound like some sort of 'Dirty Dozen' film where a bunch of screwballs triumph over adversity (falling down quite a few times along the way). Again, the characters are a bunch of misfits, yet they're certainly not funny enough to be particularly entertaining. Yes, I know this is a serious subject (i.e. Nazis stealing – and sometimes destroying – precious art during the war), so I wasn't expecting the central characters to behave like clowns, but I thought their interactions may be a little more enjoyable.Unfortunately, none of the characters are really fleshed-out enough for us to care that much about them. Despite the cast being full of excellent talent, all seem to be a little underused. The story is simply the main characters sitting in one war-ravaged location after the next, discussing where they're going to look next for a painting, or sculpture.There was some attempt to interject a 'baddie' element. Early on in the film we meet a Nazi who's also hunting all the priceless pieces of artwork. However, that story is kind of snubbed out halfway through and feels a little disappointing.What we're left with is an important story (as it is based on true events) that find themselves told in the blandest way possible. The cast do their best, but the script just isn't that enjoyable. Maybe the film-makers were trying to accurately capture the 'depressing' feel of the era. If that was their intention then they succeeded. I felt gloomy waiting for it to end, too.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5,1,1,13 August 2014
Mission: Impossible III," The name's Cruise, Tom Cruise
","Yes, it's that time again where Tom Cruise basically gives us the American version of a James Bond film (not counting Matt Damon's Bourne saga). Now, that might be a bit of a copy... you have the typical globetrotting, coupled with the man who's going to sell something bad to someone even worse, not to mention a doublecross which you may or may not see coming. However, the Mission Impossible films just so happen to be really good fun.For a start they're all serious (i.e. like the 'modern' Bond films, rather than Roger Moore's time holding the Vodka Martinis), so if you're looking for something a little tongue-in-cheek then you won't find it here. And they're filled with enough action to make Bond himself work up a sweat. However, unlike Bond and Bourne, Tom doesn't go it alone. He has a team of IMF agents in tow to help him get the job done. And, in this case, the 'job' involves catching someone bad who's trying to sell something even worse to someone yet still worse (I think I mentioned that).And, like just about every other international spy film, they have to travel the world to many scenic locations to blow stuff up (not that they mean to blow up every venue they visit, but it just happens to always end up that way). So, if that sort of film is your cup of tea, you'll be in for a couple of fun-filled hours.Yes, you might have to suspend your disbelief a little bit to imagine Tom Cruise still managing to remain in one piece (due to the amount of punishment he can apparently take), let alone capable of saving the world every few minutes, but... isn't that why we've watched the Bond films for so long?",7,1,1,18 May 2014
Lucky Number Slevin," Like an American Guy Ritchie film
","And, when I say 'like an American Guy Richie film' I mean one of his good ones, not Swept Away. Lucky Number Slevin follows the tale of a young man, oddly enough who goes by the name 'Slevin.' Upon arriving in New York he's mistaken for someone else and ends up getting caught in a life or death feud between two rival mob bosses (both wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). Throw into the mix a hit-man (Bruce Willis) who you don't know which side he's on and Lucy Lui as the love interest and you have the recipe for a half decent film.Like made famous more in British gangster films, there are plenty of shady characters along the way (you know most will end up on the wrong end of a gun sooner or later), plus even more twists and turns so you don't know who's double-crossing who. However, luckily there aren't so many plot twists here that the conclusion will leave you scratching your head and having to look the end up on the internet (as I found myself doing with Guy Ritchie's 'Revolver').All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is a good, solid entry into the gangster genres. It may never quite attain the dizzy heights of Goodfellas etc, but it's definitely worth a watch it you're a fan of the genre.",8,1,2,9 November 2014
Sucker Punch," Well... I liked it (please don't hate me!)
","I'll start off by saying that most people seemed to absolutely HATE 'Sucker Punch.' I didn't. I guess I'm weird. But I can live with that. Zack Snyder, normally best known for only directing his films, now writes AND directs one, too. Sucker Punch is the result. And, whereas I choose to mainly just enjoy it for its silly action sequences, I can see why the haters had such a field day tearing it to pieces.So... what's it about? Er, good question. There's a girl. She's accused to murdering someone she didn't and sent to an institution for the mentally insane. Do they still do that? I don't know. The film's time period is woefully unspecified. Anyway, once there she teams up with four other hot girls and they fight German steam-powered zombies in First World War trenches, robots protecting a trainload of explosives heading into a futuristic city and Orcs. And I also think I remember giant monster-samurais. And then there's the bit about the girls working in a brothel. And gangsters. And they kill a mummy dragon's baby.Do you think I'm making this up? I'm not. Basically, the film does try to cover many levels at once (with limited success). It's one of those movies which exists on many levels (not all of them real – many interpretational and symbolic). Some say it should have just stuck to one, but it doesn't, therefore it does tend to confuse and disorient a fair proportion of the viewers.As a story, it's a bit of a mess. I can see that. I appreciate where the haters are coming from. However, I can't fault the awesome action sequences. They're amazingly shot and look like something out of the highest powered computer game ever made.I think if I'd paid full price to watch it at the cinema I may feel a little short-changed. However, I saw it on DVD and I must have been in the mood just to watch hot girls slice apart Nazi samurais in giant mech-armour suits. That's the kind of level you need to set your brain on to appreciate it.Don't think about story. Don't think about character development or deep and meaningful story arcs. Just watch the action scenes and enjoy the dark and brooding soundtrack. If Sucker Punch is an example of Zack Snyder's writing ability then perhaps he should stick to directing a little longer while he hones his art. However, it's still a lot of fun. If you're me.",8,3,5,27 December 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," I'm now a 'Cloverfield Convert!'
","A few years ago, 'Cloverfield' was released. If you missed it, it was one of those 'found footage' films where everything is shot by the point of view of one really annoying character who won't put the camera down no matter how much danger comes their way. Sorry, I digress. I really don't like the 'found footage' genre. I find it cheap, annoying and just downright implausible. It was because of this that – despite 'Cloverfield' being a massive hit, I hated it. A giant Godzilla-like alien monster started rampaging through a major U.S. city and the story was about a small band of survivors fleeing the area. One of them had to film the hold experience because I don't know. I just remember getting really frustrated with the film because he wouldn't stop filming even when his leg was being eaten by little monsters. Anyway, it was because of that which meant I wasn't that bothered about seeing this sequel. Only it's not a sequel. Or is it? For a start it's not 'found footage' any more (hooray!) and we meet a girl who gets into a bad car accident on the way home. She's dragged from the wreckage by good ol' John Goodman who takes her home and they live happily ever after. Only joking. He's actually a paranoid nut-job who built a 'perfect' survival bunker just in case the world should happen to end and he wanted to go on living. So, our heroine wakes up there, injured and a little frightened. Especially as Mr Goodman won't let her leave. The closest she gets is the reinforced steel door where she can look out over the stricken world. Only it's not that stricken. It looks quite normal, but Goodman swears that there's enough fallout out there to nuke a cockroach from the inside out. So, she's trapped, with no idea what's happened. Can she get out? Should she, even if she could? Anyway, because most people have either seen, or are aware of, the first movie with the giant monster etc, we assume something bad has indeed happened to the rest of the world. Only this film doesn't really follow on from the original 'Cloverfield.' So, the longer it goes on, you wonder whether you're actually watching a sequel at all, or another film that has sort of piggybacked off its name/fame and has created something different all together. 'Cloverfield' was a big budget monster/horror movie whereas '10 Cloverfield Lane' is small, low budget and confined to the bunker for the whole time.And, in my opinion, it's the superior movie by far. John Goodman is excellent as the paranoid nutter who is probably the last person you want to be stuck on Earth with and you're rooting for our heroine to escape (assuming there's a world left to escape to!). It's more psychological horror than giant-monsters-crushing-New-York-horror and it's all the better for it. I hear that some people weren't too keen on the ending, but, even if you hate it, you should hopefully enjoy the preceding 90% enough to just ignore the very last few scenes. I wouldn't watch Cloverfield again, but I'd definitely watch this in a few years time.",7,0,0,17 June 2017
The Equalizer," Seen it all before
","Okay, maybe I'm missing something, or I've become simply too cynical to appreciate 'The Equaliser.' If you check out the reviews you'll notice that they're overwhelmingly positive. I'm not going to slate the film, but I certainly wouldn't say that it's as good as the majority of people seem to think.In fact, I can't really think of anything negative to say about it, but then I also can't think of anything positive to say about it either. We have Denzil Washington as the star. Naturally, he's a great performer and puts in a decent enough show as a man with a dark past who has lethal ways of getting revenge on those who set out to harm the innocent. The film is shot nicely stylish. Every now and again you'll get a fast paced montage of images with highlight the director's flare. The action scenes are nice (if violent, naturally) and everyone gets what's coming to them. And there's a decent enough amount of other stars, ala Chloe Grace Moretz and Bill Pullman to make this a little more than just a mindless B-movie action flick.Yes, for all the plus points, I found the film pretty average. Bad guys hurt the innocent. Once man stands up to them. Despite everything that's good about it, I just felt that I've seen it all before and, no matter how flashy and violent the action scenes were, I still found it was one of those films where you could do the ironing while you were watching it, or nip out for a drink and you wouldn't have missed that much.Perhaps the most average thing about the film is the bad-guy. How often have we seen Russian gangs bullying their way around America? The lead bad-guy is just a bad-guy. He's completely generic. Yes, he's evil and will kill anyone who gets in his way, but aren't all villains? Seriously, he could have been replaced by any actor and the film wouldn't have changed much.So, I'll end by saying that most people seem to like it. So maybe you should take their word over mine. I'm clearly in the minority here. But I didn't hate it. I just didn't see anything that I hadn't already seen a hundred times before.",6,3,4,28 February 2015
The Expendables 2," Q: How do you turn grown men into boys?
","A: Let them watch Expendables 2.Okay, let me just say that, as a grown man, I felt suitably ashamed for loving The Expendables 2 as much as I did. Perhaps it was growing up in the eighties with Schwarzenegger and Van Damme as action heroes to my generation? Either way, for the first time on screen, we get to see Stallone, Arnie and Bruce Willis fighting side by side... in a Smart car.And there we have it - a Smart car. That alone should tell you not to take The Expendables 2 too seriously. It's deliberately over the top, silly and daft. Chuck Norris is so hard he can wipe out an entire army in one go. Too much? If you think so, you'd better not watch this film. As for me, I find it perfectly plausible that someone as tough as Chuck can take out a tank and a platoon in less than five seconds, so, that's why The Expendables 2 is for me.Men and boys will be one and the same when they watch this. The action is wonderfully over the top and the cheesy one-liners flow almost as much as the fake blood from the hundred and one stooges who get used as cannon fodder for our heroes.I can't see how any self-respecting action junkie won't love this. I'm sure it's one for the boys. Especially as a female friend of mine watched it and commented how she wasn't happy that Jason Statham wasn't in it as much as he was in the first one. With more heroes, the screen time for Statham (and Jet Li) is cut slightly short.Either way, it's action-packed fun that you shouldn't take too seriously.Roll on Expendables 3.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,0,0,25 May 2014
Source Code," Yes, it is 'Groundhog Day,' but with explosions
","There's no other way to describe 'Source Code,' without comparing it to the classic comedy film, Groundhog Day. However, whereas Bill Murray was stuck in a day and had to get out, Jake Gyllenhaal's take is a little more specific: he's a member of a top secret military project who has to find out who planted a bomb on a crowded commuter train by 'living' the last eight minutes of one of the – now deceased – passenger's life.So, ala Groundhog Day, we get basically the same scene endlessly repeated with Jake learning a little more about his surroundings and the various perils he'll have to face as he goes along. There's not an awful lot more you can say about the film without giving important points away. And, with Source Code, less is definitely more. It's certainly not a long film and it's well shot and paced, largely to its director, Duncan (son of David Bowie) Jones. It's basically a simple, no-frills film and, if you're in the mood for some – slightly more – intelligent science fiction, then you could do worse than this one.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,3,29 May 2014
Skyfall," It's won me over
","I'm one of those people who despises Daniel Craig's 'Bond era.' Not because I don't like him as an actor, or that I think he isn't the right man to play Bond. It's because I pine for the old days of loads of over-the-top gadgets, silly stunts and cheeky witticisms, delivered with a wry smile (or a raised eyebrow). In short, I liked pre-Craig Bonds.I watched both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and barely considered them entries in the Bond franchise, yet I still came back for more and watched Skyfall.I'm glad I did. Bond is back. Yes, it was still gritty with a fairy revolutionary narrative structure (well, for a Bond film, anyway), but they've finally got round to inputting a little bit more humour in there. I'm not talking about gags all the way, but the (re)introduction of Q and Moneypenny are long overdue, as - like always - they play their part in verbally sparring with Bond (and sometimes putting him in his place). Plus the film-makers seemed to have remembered to play the 'Bond theme' a lot more. I felt this certainly helps remind me that I'm not watching just another 'Bourne' film starring Matt Damon or that other bloke who took over.Basically, I won't go into details about the plot too much. If you don't know already, it's not about someone in a volcano lair, trying to take over the world. If anything, it's much smaller, but better with it. It certainly brings global terrorism down to a personal level.Skyfall is definitely the best of the (new) Bonds. Long may it continue in this style.(I still miss John Cleese though).",9,3,6,2 April 2015
Ghost," You will believe (that it's a timeless classic)
","I first watched 'Ghost' back when it was released in 1990. I was a typical teen in those days, only really interested in films involving Austrian musclemen beating villains to a pulp. Yet there was something about a supernatural, romantic comedy that just shouldn't have appealed to me - but it did. And I'm as pleased to say that 'Ghost' is still as perfect today as it ever was.I'm pretty sure most people know the plot by now, but, on the off-chance you've never seen it (or figured out the basic premise via the title!), it involves one of the central characters dying before their time and therefore carrying on existing in spectral form in order to take care of business before they can cross over to the other side.The main stars all perform some iconic roles here - don't think that it's just Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore all the way (who are both brilliant), but - as the Oscars showed - it's Whoopie Goldberg who steals every scene she's in as the larger-than-life psychic/con-woman who finds she has a sudden knack at speaking to those on 'the other side.'Don't go thinking that this is just a 'rom-com.' Yes, the 'love aspect' is an integral part of the story, but it has an appeal that's far broader than your average Jennifer Anniston flick. Hopefully, anyone of any age and gender should appreciate this. It even gets a little creepy towards the end with two instances that have brought a shiver down my spine every time I watch it.I can't really stress just how perfect 'Ghost' is. There's so little to say that's negative about it (unless you count my Mum's comment about how Demi Moore just spends the whole movie crying!). Perhaps there are some 'green screen' effects that are more noticeable today than when they were first released, but that's about the only vaguely-negative thing I can think of saying. You really should have watched 'Ghost' at least once in your life. It really is a timeless tale that hasn't aged a bit in its thirty year lifespan. Should I say it will probably live forever?",10,0,0,28 April 2020
Iron Man 3," A new type of Iron Man movie
","The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors. I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,31,48,24 August 2014
Deja Vu," Thinking Man's sci-fi
","'Deja Vu' is definitely a film that you haven't felt like you've seen before *boom boom* - it's actually as 'original' as any modern Hollywood film is going to be. And by that I mean it's probably quite similar to a few others, but presented differently enough to make it worth a watch. And, if that's not enough of a recommendation, it has Denzel Washington in it. What more could you want? The ever excellent Denzel plays a cop who has to investigate a domestic terrorism incident where someone blows up a boat full of naval servicemen and their families as it draws into port in New Orleans. However, instead of taking witness statements and making public appeals, he chooses to team up with a shadowy government agency who have invented a machine that can 'look into the past.' However, just because they can peek into the past, doesn't mean they can easily identify the killer. Unfortunately, the machine can only look into the past exactly four and a half days ago – and time is constantly moving forward. Even in the past. Confused? Don't worry. Denzel will explain it better than I can.Although, it is one of those films where you do have to pay attention. It's not one where you can check your Instagram account and wander off for a cup of tea. I'm not going to go into how the plot unfolds, as there's more to it than I've mentioned. If you're slightly put off by the sci-fi element, don't be. It works on many levels. Obviously, there's a strong sci-fi feel to it, but nothing too over-the-top and the machine has a 'real' look to it, like it could really exist in our world. However, it's primarily a cop movie where the good guy has to track down the bad guy. So, hopefully it should appeal to more than just fans of the sci-fi genre. And, obviously, you have Denzel. He'll probably never win any Oscars for his performance here, but it is definitely enough to lift the film to even higher heights.Don't expect wall-to-wall action. This is definitely not a 'Transformers' movie. And it's all the better for it. Get ready to follow closely and see what the future holds for the war on terror. Or should that be the past?",8,0,0,31 October 2017
It," A competent little remake
","I suppose my enjoyment on the 2017 remake of Stephen King's classic novel 'It' is based on two things (1) the fact that I'm very familiar with the original film adaptation and (2) I saw it a few weeks after it came out in the cinema, therefore I'd already been exposed to the numerous positive reviews claiming that, in a summer of lackluster Box Office performances, It 'saved' the summer's takings. However, once I left the cinema, I was left a little disappointed. I'm not saying that I hated the film, just that it didn't – quite – live up to expectations.It's about seven youngsters who discover an evil creature has been stalking and killing kids throughout the history of their town and need to survive the summer holidays before it gets them, too (think 'Stand By Me' but with a monster). Films with children as the leads do sometimes tend to struggle, however, I'm pleased to say that all the youngsters rise to the occasion and perform admirably and you'll have no problem believing that this band of self-confessed 'losers' would hang out in real life.Despite all the kids being good at what they do, there are seven of them and a couple seem to get overshadowed and pushed to the back burners. I know the original source material had seven, so they had to kind of keep to that template, but a couple could have quite easily been left out. I think the one girl of the group, Beverly, (played by Sophia Lillis) is the stand out star and probably one to watch for future films.But, no matter how good the kids are, most people are there to see the monster – aka 'Penniewise' the clown. He was made famous by Tim Curry's excellent performance in the original and many wondered how this could be topped. Despite some people objecting to how the clown looks now (yes, he's slightly different, but no less scary), the major difference is how he acts. He isn't as vocal as Tim Curry was. Curry was constantly gabbling his gibberish while stalking the youngsters. This time Penniewise relies more on transformations to intimidate his prey. However, this links nicely into the involvement of the special effects which are used well to convey the dread Penniewise inspires in his victims prior to killing them and feasting on their fear.I guess my major gripes came with the fact that it stuck a little too closely to the original, therefore I kind of knew who lived and who died, therefore taking away any worry I felt when one of the kids was in danger. Plus, as I've already said, it's quite a long film (or it seemed like that to me!). By 'long' I mean that I felt like it should have ended numerous times before it actually did. I kept expecting the screen to fade to black and people start leaving the cinema, only for it to start up again and continue.But, ultimately, it was still a pretty watchable film. I can actually see the point in remaking this classic horror flick. I guess it's probably not really meant for me, as the original Tim Curry version will always be my 'It.' However, I can see new audiences who have never watched the audience really enjoying it (as other reviews suggest).Probably a 7/10 from me, but a 8-9/10 from new audiences as there are some genuine scares which transgress old and new audiences alike.",7,1,3,25 September 2017
Hereditary," The ultimate in 'slow burning' horror
","I'd heard quite a lot about 'Hereditary' before I actually watched it, most of which stating that, although marketed as a 'horror' movie, it wasn't so straight forward. Now, having sat through it, I can - sort of - see what they mean.When you think of 'horror' you probably imagine monsters, slashers or something similar. Now, although 'Hereditary' definitely has a strong supernatural element running through it (not to mention some pretty disturbing imagery which I would definitely describe as 'horrific!), it's certainly not your average run-of-the-mill horror.When questioned, even the film-makers go to great lengths to describe it as more of a 'family drama' (plus supernatural, etc). It weighs in at just over two hours, which is certainly longer than your average tale about a guy in an ice hockey mask slicing up teenagers. Instead, we have a story about what, on the surface could be described as a 'traditional' family of four (Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne as the mother and father and Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro as their children) and the way they're coming to terms with the recent loss of the grandmother of the household.It's certainly a 'character-focused' piece and all four (or at least three - I did feel that Gabriel Byrne was given the least to do of the four) major characters get their chance to shine and also develop. We see how the death of the 'matriarch' affects them all and their dynamic, plus the problems her loss causes among them. For the most part, what 'horror' is displayed is due to their various mental breakdowns and how they see things (although there is one particularly graphic scene - only for a second or two - which will stay with me forever). Any supernatural threat comes in the final act when the weird stuff really starts going down.It was certainly nice to see a horror movie try to be a little different and I felt compelled to watch it to the end, simply to see where it was going and, perhaps more importantly, what the hell was going on! Yes, it's not completely black and white and the story does make you work for a few answers here and there. I even went as far as to watch a YouTube video on its 'ending explained' just to make sure I had actually understood it (and I'm pleased to say that I had!).If it has a fault (for me, anyway) then it's the film's run-time. Yes, it does do a good job of building tension, however I did feel I'd like to get to the 'meat' of the story a little quicker than I actually did. However, that's just a minor gripe and there were more than enough shocks and surprises that I never saw coming (and I've seen a lot of horror films!) which made the (long) journey worthwhile. If you're in the mood for something long, drawn out and a little different in terms of horror, then it's definitely worth sitting down for.",7,0,1,11 March 2019
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The 'history' they won't teach you in school
","Yes, as the title says, Abraham Lincoln is a 'vampire hunter.' It's obvious when you think about it. And the civil war was fought against vampires. Again, how did you NOT know? Okay, this film is silly. But then the title is unforgivably silly, so the film-makers assume that you know it's silly before you spend your money watching it. And they're right. It is silly. However, not THAT silly. For a start (believe it or not) the film follows Lincoln's life pretty closely (yes, apart from the inclusion of vampires... obviously), almost to the point that it's historically accurate! Then there are the action sequences. The undead hurl themselves in droves in Lincoln's direction, only to be sliced and diced in trendy slow motion effects with blood splattering everywhere - hardly traits of a comedy.Despite the film's kind of cheeky title, there aren't that many laughs (or even tongue in cheek moments) along the way. That's possibly what made it feel a little odd for me. From the title I was expecting a much dafter movie. What I got was an oldie-worldy action film with some reasonably high production values and attempts at remaining true to the historical text (again, if you don't count the vampire inclusion).If you like vampires and action, you'll probably like this. Think 'Blade set in times past' and you probably get the idea. However, if you're expecting something quite cheesy and tongue in cheek, then this isn't really it.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,1,19 May 2014
John Wick," Mindless action fun
","I think I'm a little late to the party on this one and I guess it must have cost me. I'm an action-movie fan. I grew up in the Arnie/Sly era of the eighties and I have plenty of mindless action flicks in my DVD collection – everything from 'Commando' to the mode recent 'Shoot 'em Up' pleases me to a degree and Keanu Reeves pops up a fair times in my watchlist. However, somehow his film where he plays the titular 'John Wick' slipped past me. I've only just seen it after its sequel was released and, during that time, I've seen many a positive review saying how great it was. Therefore, by the time I got round to watching it, my hopes were high.I guess what happened is the reverse of when I watched 'Sex Tape' and the big screen adaptation of 'The Dukes of Hazzard.' Both had been absolutely slated by the critics so my expectations were suitably lowered by the time I saw them. And, weirdly enough, I actually took some small amount of entertainment in both! I'm not saying either were particularly good, but enjoyable enough if you were in the right mood. This time, my hopes were so high, I found that what I got didn't really live up to what I was expecting. I was waiting for something truly revolutionary and different from anything I'd seen before. What I got felt like just another action movie.Don't get me wrong – it's not bad. It was enjoyable enough, but it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. John Wick is a retired hit-man who's forced out of retirement when a baddie (played by 'Game of Throne's' Alfie Allen) kills his dog. Yes, that's basically the catalyst and motivation for the entire film. What follows is your average (and I deliberately use the word 'average') roller-coaster of violence and revenge. Everything you'd expect is there: gunfights are plentiful, there's at least one car chase, a betrayal and eventually Wick comes face to face with the evil head honcho. So it's all there. And it's well done. The violence (and there is violence – no PG13 here!) is believable and gritty and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch (even when he's trying to be moody and miserable he's still that long-haired 'bogus' surfer-dude we all fell in love with back in the early nineties). So, I can see how there's much going for it. I was just expecting more. And that's a shame really because my hopes were so high that, even though everything I like was – technically – there, I still came away with the feeling like it wasn't that much of a big deal. But, like I said earlier, a sequel has been made and I will definitely watch that, too.At the end of the day, this film may not have entirely clicked with me, but I'm glad that Keanu Reeves is back in a decent franchise and it puts him back in the spotlight – maybe John Wick can team up with Liam Neeson in a Wick/Taken crossover? ;o)",6,0,2,1 July 2017
Gravity," An experience more than a film
","Okay, 'Gravity' is amazing. That makes it sound like a film that you have to watch, but, on reflection, I'm still not so sure. I sat through the whole ninety minutes of it and I'm still not sure whether I liked it or not.I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not sure I'd ever want to watch it again. It's about two astronauts stranded in space when their shuttle gets struck by debris. First, the good: the two (and only) leads, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, are both worthy of their A-list reputation and turn in excellent performances. You'll really feel for their plight and be rooting for them to get back to Earth. In fact, the only thing better than their acting is the special effects themselves. Sometimes it feels like you're really there with them as explosions and weightless tools float all about the place.However, the only thing that lets this masterpiece down is the story (or lack of it). They get caught up in one explosion. Escape. Move on to the next explosion. Escape. Then rinse and repeat for an hour and a half. Having only two characters in the film kind of means that you know both won't die otherwise the movie will have to end.'Gravity' is truly an epic movie in all aspects (apart from the story... possibly). It's definitely in the same league as '2001: A Space Odyssey' in terms of scale, drama and awe. However, what made it so good was also its drawback. Having long drawn-out shots and minimal cast never really felt like a 'story-film' (if you know what I mean). Sometimes I felt like I was at the Epcot Centre in Disney World watching an exhibition on what space was like.Yes, Gravity is breath-taking and will certain be hailed as a modern day classic by many. And, I'm definitely glad I saw it. Will I watch it again? No. Once is enough, thanks.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,1,3,21 July 2014
Lone Survivor," It does what it says on the tin
","I know you really shouldn't put 'spoilers' in film reviews, but the title itself must give you a bit of a clue regarding what eventually happens. 'Lone Survivor' is the true story of an ill-fated U.S. Navy Seals mission to root out the Taliban.Mark Wahlberg plays the leader (or at least the main) Navy Seal on the mission, so no prizes for guessing who's the one who makes it to the final credits. However, just because you probably already know what happens, doesn't really detract from the film's tension. No one really stands out as giving the performance of a lifetime. All the main characters (who speak English) are functional, i.e. the play battle-hardened soldiers as you'd expect.It's actually pretty scary stuff. There aren't exactly a million different special effects used (or required) to tell the story. It's quite a simple affair, i.e. a small squad of soldiers in the woods, deep behind enemy lines. But, when they finally come into contact with those they're there to destroy, things do not go according to plan and they end up being the ones on the receiving end.Being a true story helps. It does make you ponder what troops go through and the lack of big budget special effects give it a much more gritty feel (although, sometimes watching guys run through a wood did make it feel a little like a 'made-for-TV' movie).It's nothing revolutionary, but, if you're into true life war films or are generally interested in modern armed conflict, it's certainly worth a watch.",7,0,0,29 September 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Blessed is this film (and the cheese-makers)
","The Monty Python boys have had their ups and downs – mainly within their ranks, while their output has remained pretty solid – from revolutionising TV comedy with their surreal and 'anything can happen' way of doing things to their big-screen epics (and by that I mean 'The Holy Grail' and, of course, 'The Life of Brian' (notice how I kind of forgot The Meaning of Life – which is basically a sketch show where some scenes work better than others).I was pretty young when Brian hit the cinemas and I didn't know anything about it – only that I wasn't allowed to watch it (not just because I was about fifteen years too young) but because my local cinema refused to show it and you had to drive to the next town to see it. Yes, it's that (allegedly) controversial. The reason being is because it makes fun of Jesus/Christianity. Only it doesn't. That's basically what people who didn't see it and didn't want to like it said about it. Yes, it is set during Jesus' time (and Jesus himself is never ridiculed, shown only twice – once as an infant surrounded by angels the way you'd see in any nativity play and once on a hillside, preaching to his numerous followers).No, Life of Brian – as you may have guessed by the title – is a film about Brian – just an average guy of the time who becomes hopelessly out of his depth when he's accidentally mistaken for the messiah. What follows is typical madcap Monty Python humour. No, it never makes fun of Christianity, only the way things (in that time period) can be misinterpreted and distorted into what others want them to be.If you like Monty Python – you'll love this. If you like comedy – you'll like this. If you haven't seen it yet and have an appreciation for satire – you'll also love this. There are so many classic scenes and phrases that you've probably already heard and yet never known where they come from contained within. There's hard to pick a stand-alone performance from the cast – John Cleese's height and general loudness puts him up there, but, seriously, it's well and truly a team effort.Life of Brian is one of those rarest of films – one that stands up to the tests of time and is still as relevant and funny today as it was when I wasn't allowed to watch it. Brian may not be the chosen one, but this film certainly should be.",10,0,2,1 May 2016
The Death of Stalin," So many British Russians
","I've been a fan of Armando Iannucci ever since his early satirical 'Friday Night Armistice' shows making fun of political events. He's always displayed a wry take on modern life which has showed through in his own shows and, of course 'The Thick of It.' Therefore, I watched 'The Death of Stalin' simply to continue watching his output. Now, having seen it, I am left feeling a little disappointed, but I can't help but think that's it's my fault.I studied post Second World War history, but only the WESTERN aspects to it, i.e. European and American. I knew little of what was going on in the Soviet Union, only that the 'Cold War' kicked off and the Russians were always the baddies in the Bond films. As the title suggests the story charts the last days (or even hours!) of Soviet dictator's Stalin's life and then the subsequent power struggle which ensued from all his deputies and surrounding high-ranking staff.There's quite a large cast and, impressively, they're all played by excellent actors (mainly recognisable faces from British film and TV output, but you also have Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor in there somewhere). Each of these plays the part of a real-life person from Stalin's inner circle. And, just to help out those of us (like me!) who know nothing about this aspect of history, they all get their own caption reminding us who they are and what they do in Stalin's dictatorship. However, despite these clues, they didn't go far to help me understanding who they are, what they do, or what their political motivations are.I get the feeling that if I knew about the real events which inspired this film, I'd be able to watch it and therefore point knowingly at the screen from time to time and say 'Ah, Michael Palin is playing so-and-so. He was responsible for this, that or the other in Stalin's regime.' However, seeing as I know nothing about anything relating to this time period, all I could say was, 'Oh, that's Michael Palin. He was good in Monty Python.'Then there were the accents. Yes, I know this is possibly the most 'pickiest' of flaws that anyone can find in a movie. But, because 90% of the cast were British (and therefore come from all over the country) they all speak with various (British!) accents. I know that not every actor is gifted with the ability of putting on a convincing Russian accent, but it just felt really weird to me watching someone with a northern accent pretending to be a Russian cabinet minister. For example, because Steve Buscemi doesn't try to disguise his natural US accent, I thought he was some sort of American ambassador to the government, until I realised he was part of it.The cast is excellent. They're clearly all having fun and you can see they're all having a good time working on this story. And, if you know even a tiny bit about the historical events behind it, you should love it as much as I wished I did. However, for me, personally, I just couldn't seem to get behind it, no matter how good the cast is. Just check out the general ratings for the film - they're pretty high. If you're wondering whether to watch the film or not, I think you should definitely go with their views over mine. Sorry, Armando - but, don't worry, I'll still watch everything you go on to write.",6,0,3,5 July 2018
Unbreakable," The most subtle superhero movie ever
","It's hard to believe that 'superhero' movies ever existed before Marvel's 'shared universe,' but, before bunches of superpowered heroes flew around New York throwing nukes at alien armies, was 'Unbreakable.' To use modern day terminology, it could be best described as an 'origin movie.'However, instead of this origin movie explaining an existing superhero's beginnings, M. Night Shyamalan (back in the year 2000 when every one of his films was Box Office gold) brings us an original take on a person with extra special powers. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, by all accounts an ordinary man who gets caught up in a train crash which kills everyone on board apart from him. This would be weird enough, but then he's immediately contacted by Elijah Price (the ever-awesome Samuel L Jackson) who claims that David is possessed with the ability never to get hurt by anything.Now, if you're so used to superhero movies where it's wall-to-wall computer-generated action then you're probably not going to enjoy this. It's the very definition of a 'slow burner.' In fact (and I hope that this doesn't come as a 'spoiler') there isn't a single shoot-out, car chase or ensemble cast of superheroes coming to the aid of our protagonist. What you have here is a very 'grounded' take on a person who discovers that they aren't quite as normal as they first thought they were.Samuel L Jackson is always good in whatever he does and whereas Bruce Willis' career is more 'hit and miss,' this is a time when the sheer chemistry between them shines through and both are a joy to watch.I enjoyed it at the time and, in these days of over-the-top Marvel movies, I still think it deserves its place up there with the best superhero movies, even if this is so low key' you may be pressed to put it into that genre.",9,1,1,17 January 2020
Star Trek," A great Trek (begrudgingly)
","I have to confess to being one of those people who never thought they should 'reboot' the original Star Trek franchise. William Shatner and co were so engrained in their respective roles that I didn't think anyone could fill their exact shoes (even if they were supposed to be their younger selves).I was wrong.Star Trek (XI) is undoubtedly the best of the franchise since The Wrath of Khan. If follows the early years of the most famous crew in sci-fi history. Yes, every actor nails his or her character (possibly with the minor exception of Simon Pegg as Scotty, but that's a minor gripe). Also, this isn't just 'Star Trek The Early Years' - the story cleverly weaves in the old mythology - I won't say too much on that in case you're not aware of how it all plays out.I will say that (if you can forgive JJ Abrams slightly overused 'lens flare effects') it is the most exciting of all the Trek movies. There's plenty of action and decent special effects. It doesn't quite rival Star Wars - it seems to be able to maintain its 'alternativeness' to the other great sci-fi franchise. It doesn't just breathe new life into the franchise (Star Trek X was a little disappointing), it makes 'Trek' accessible to the masses. If you don't know your Tribbles from your Borg, it really doesn't matter - this starts everything again and you don't need to know the backstory - you only need to be in for a good, popcorn-munching, sci-fi ride.May this franchise live long and prosper.",9,1,1,22 March 2015
Fury," Pretty impressive war movie
","Okay, so I'm not the biggest fan of war films – my main motivation for watching 'Fury' was that it was filmed in my home town and I wanted to see which bits of my village I recognised! However, I was actually pretty glad I did. I'd heard mixed reviews on Fury – much of the negativity based around how 'unlikeable' the characters are. Well, that may be true, but it was sort of refreshing in a way.'Fury' itself is the name of our 'heroes' tank – part of a battle-worn American division deep inside Germany in the dying months of World War II. Basically, this tank crew (led by Brad Pit) have seen it all (and killed much of it). They aren't particularly nice people. If they once were then the constant slaughter has taken its toll on them and all they know is war. However, when they lose one of their crew a youngster is added to the mix, who doesn't share their particular attitude to the war.I suppose you could say that there's not much story here. It's pretty much one (rather impressive) tank battle after the next. Fury's crew were pretty grim, but seeing as all of them have been fighting it out for years and could be killed any day, I felt that that was kind of understandable under the circumstances. Whatever 'character development' comes from Brad and the 'newbie's' characters. One must learn to 'toughen up' and the other must relearn his sensitivity.It's probably a guy's film, as it does rely on the action scenes to 'wow' audiences. Although, maybe it was just me, but when the machine guns were firing, they kind of looked like either red or green lasers (definitely something out of Star Wars), but that could just be me.About the only time I felt it slowed down was during a scene in the middle of the film. I'm guessing it was meant to emphasis the two main characters and the change in their attitudes, but I felt it did just drag a little longer than it should.Overall, 'Fury' is a good watch, but you'll probably need to be into some pretty dark and bleak war films in order to truly appreciate this.",8,7,16,2 April 2015
Fight Club," Often parodied, seldom bettered
","Chances are, if you've watched any popular movie over the last fifteen years or so, you've probably heard the line, 'The first rule of *whatever* is do not talk about *whatever.*' This is of course the most famous line from the Brad Pitt/Edward Norton 1999 classic, 'Fight Club.' In a nutshell, Fight Club is so good it's spawned many parodies and rip-offs, none of which have even come close to emulating just how good it is.I'll give you a brief plot synopsis, but leave it there, as if I go into too much detail, I start running the risk of letting slip some major spoilers. Edward Norton plays a bored and run-down salesman who spends his days flying across America selling his wares. However, his dull life takes a turn for the interesting when he happens to bump into Tyler Durden (or rather Brad Pitt) on a plane. The two of them form an unlikely bond and come up with a novel way of dealing with male stress in the modern age – they beat the hell out of each other for fun. And, believe it or not, this idea soon spreads across the nation and 'Fight Clubs' start springing up everywhere.It's about now in the review where I list the good and bad points of the film. However, I can't actually think of anything negative to say about Fight Club and, if I listed all its plus points then I'd probably be here all day. There's very little wrong with this film in general – it has everything from great central performances from Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham Carter (and even a sterling performance from Meat Loaf – who'd have thought!) to wry social commentary, snappy dialogue and those plot points I refuse to mention for fear of being hounded off the internet for spoiling movies.As I've already eluded to, there's definitely more to it than the synopsis, but anything more may ruin the surprises in store. Whether you like dark, intelligent thrillers or just want to see Brad Pitt topless, you really should check this film out at some stage. It's already a classic and, even after all these years, holds up very well with its themes of fragile male ego, bonding and the establishment in general.When I watched it last I felt it had an almost 'Hitchcock-vibe' to it all, which would explain why it all feels so dark and timeless. If you haven't seen it, don't ask people about it, as they may well give away bits of it that will stay with you forever. Just watch it. Then re-watch it again with a completely different view of it all when you know what it's really about.",10,0,3,19 January 2017
Darkest Hour," Oldman's finest hour
","I've just come back from a screening of the new Winston Churchill film, 'Darkest Hour,' and I have to say I'm pretty blown away. It might as well have been a one man show, as Gary Oldman appeared better than ever as the man himself. It says it's 'based on true events' which is pretty accurate. Oldman seemed so lifelike and believable as the wartime leader of Britain that sometimes it almost felt like it was a documentary.It begins a year or so into the Second World War where Britain is already at war with Germany. Current Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, has lost the confidence of Parliament and the King is forced to allow Churchill to take over the war effort. I didn't know much about the film before I watched it (apart from the obvious, i.e. that it was about Churchill) and did assume that it would chart his time in office throughout the entire conflict. However, it only really focuses on about a month or so of time - I guess the part of the war which could indeed be described as Britain's 'darkest hour' when the British army looked lost, no one was coming to help (the army or the country!) and a deal with Hitler looked like the only way out.I'd like to think that cinema goers all over the world will appreciate this piece of (dramatic!) history not only for Gary Oldman's Oscar-worthy performance. Being British it did stir up just a smattering of national pride, but I'm guessing that won't be the case for other nationalities.It's worth noting that a film so 'character-based' (as opposed to simply having superheroes destroying a major city) doesn't have many special effects or amazing 'set-pieces,' however, what sets it up isn't just Gary Oldman's acting, but also the make-up team who turned him into the hunched, balding old man he was portraying.The only thing that irked me about the whole film was one scene near the end. It felt totally unbelievable and scripted. It was more like a scene from a romantic comedy where the lead character learns a valuable, life-changing lesson. I have since Googled it to see other people's opinions on it and, as I thought, it was a moment of total fiction that was put in to 'represent' this defining moment in Churchill's life.The film is a couple of hours long, but it certainly sped past for me. It's rare that a modern film can capture a person so greatly and it's all down to Gary Oldman (and also the team of make-up artists!).",9,1,5,13 January 2018
Monster," The Hitchhikers' Guide to Hooking
","Not much that hasn't already been said about Monster - Charlize Theron bagged a (deserved) Oscar for her performance as lesbian serial killer and hooker-hitchhiker 'Aileen' and Christina Ricci played her part too (she was great, but there was only ever going to be one winner out of the two).As reported in the press at the time, Theron gained plenty of weight to make herself look almost indistinguishable from her normal (Aeon Flux catsuit-wearing) self, but it wasn't just the weightgain that scooped her the prize. She plays a killer - traditionally someone audiences would find it hard to root for. And, rightly so, the majority of people knew that she was in the wrong. However, Theron plays the part to show why she became the way she was. She wasn't born bad, but she had a hell of a nasty upbringing. At first, some (Charles Bronson fans) might even say her killings were justified, putting her in the 'anti-hero' category. However, like similar anti-hero Carter (Michael Caine in Get Carter) she pushed her luck and crossed the line from doing bad to bad people to doing bad regardless. Therefore Aileen must face the consequences for her actions.If you haven't already seen it, you really should. If you need any more recommendations, check out the DVD to buy on Amazon. It's one of those rare films that (as of the time of this review) hasn't received a single 'One Star' rating.Just watch out the next time you see a hitchhiker (unless it's Charlize Theron looking like her normal self - most guys wouldn't drive by then).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",9,0,1,18 May 2014
The Maze Runner," Not great (so why did I enjoy it?)
","'The Maze Runner.' I would start by saying that it's one of those 'teen sci-fi romance' films. Ever since 'Twilight' came along – where the basic premise is that you take a supernatural (or science fiction in some cases) event then add a teenage love story and you have a highly successful (and therefore profitable) franchise. I was going to say that, as when it started it certainly felt like one. Only it had an 'all male' cast (yeah, you could add a bit of romance to that, but you'd have to be one brave screen writer).Anyway, 'The Maze Runner' is about a bunch of young lads, all of which have been captured and imprisoned in a field, surrounded by a maze. Why? We don't know, but obviously we'll find out. And, when a new guy arrives in a box (that's how 'new arrivals' get there, apparently) he decides that they should do more than just farm, eat crops and get eaten by giant cyborg spiders. Did I mention those? There are a load of giant robot spiders living in the surrounding maze who have a tendency to eat the kids if they stray too far.Okay, so it's a reasonably simple premise – kids have to find a way out and work out why they were put there to begin with. However, it's far from perfect. Its problems are simply that there are too many plot holes everywhere. Seriously... you just can't actually allow your brain to think about anything for too long. Because, if you do, you'll realise that most of it doesn't make sense.Then I realised why it felt like a 'teen romance.' A girl arrives in a box. Guess what... she falls for the main guy. But I still enjoyed it. Even though the maze (and everything in it) is heavily computer-generated, but I overlooked that.I guess my brain was obviously tired and I wasn't thinking about all the negative elements contained inside it. Then there's the ending. Obviously I can't go into that in too much detail without giving away things. My advice... the film is about an hour and fifty minutes long. After an hour and FORTY minutes, just turn it off – you don't need the ending. It really is the worst bit.So, if you have kids, they'll probably enjoy it. The romance element isn't too central, so I suppose it must be for younger boys than girls. Plus people like me who can allow themselves to dumb down enough to appreciate the action scenes and general atmosphere may get something out of it. As much as I know I should hate it, I just don't. And I can't really say why.",7,1,3,26 April 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Weirdly epic
","Even though I'm a massive fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I have to admit that he's had a few 'misses' here and there. However, I'm pleased to say that, despite possibly nothing ever reaching the dizzying heights on 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Inglourious Basterds' comes about as close as it can in terms of entertainment value.Before I watched it, I have to confess not knowing an awful lot about it. The fact that it was a 'Tarantino movie' was enough for me to know that I was going to watch it. All I knew, from the posters mainly, was that it was a World War II film. And, seeing as I do occasionally dip into that genre, I figured it would be Tarantino's take on that particular period in history and that, like most war movies, it would attempt to be 'historically accurate.' How wrong I was.I'm sure most people know the 'basics' of history surrounding that dark period of 20th Century history and that's all this film relies on. You have the setting, i.e. Nazi-occupied France where fearsome German SS officers ruthlessly hunt down Jews, up against the local resistance and an American platoon dropped behind enemy lines to generally disrupt the occupation. However, don't expect much in the way of 'historical accuracy' after that.You've probably seen Brad Pitt's face on much of the marketing material surrounding this film. Yes, he's the biggest star so why not promote that fact? And, yes, he gives good value as the leader of the American Nazi-hunting band of brothers. However, what this film never anticipated was how well Christoph Waltz would play Pitt's opposite - the fiendish Colonel Hans Landa. He steals every scene he's in and you'll be hard pressed to find a more terrifying movie villain in recent times. He's right up there with Darth Vadar, Hannibal Lecter and Heath Ledger's Joker. And, even if you don't enjoy anything else about this film, you should watch it just for him.The 'structure' of 'Inglourious Basterds' is typical Tarantino. It's split into about six (quite long) 'chapters' through the film's two and a half hour runtime. Each of these could almost be a separate story on their own, if it wasn't for the fact that they all link up in the end perfectly. This sort of story-telling may feel a little disjointed at first, but the way they're told makes them impossible to look away. I may go as far as to say that this film could possibly be the 'tensest' ever made. Because the stories all have their individual characters, you never know who may or may not make it out of the chapter alive. The tension in every scene is cranked up to the max and you probably won't guess everything that's to come.Whether you're a die-hard fan of Tarantino, Brad Pitt, or the genre in general, it doesn't really matter. You only have to enjoy good story-telling, fantastic memorable characters and good films in general to appreciate this (just be warned about the no holes barred violence and bad language, ala every Tarantino movie ever made).",10,1,2,11 October 2018
Underworld," The dark side of Twilight
","There was a time (somewhere before 2008 I believe) where if you mentioned vampires fighting werewolves, you would instantly think of the Underworld saga. Sadly, vampires started to twinkle and werewolves used to run around topless and Selene and her Underworld buddies were forced to take a backseat.However, if you're bored of vampires gazing at each other longingly and only breathing through their noses, then you may still enjoy watching the two undead races slug it out with guns. Think 'Resident Evil' only darker and better.Underworld tells the story of a vampire assassin (or 'Death Dealer' as they're called) who, during her war with the werewolves (or 'lycans' to use the technical term) falls in love with a human who may just be destined to play a bigger part in both races' lives.It's dark like The Crow, has fight scenes like 'The Matrix' and, if you're a guy, Kate Beckinsale running around in skintight rubber. If any of that sounds like you're cup of tea, then you'll probably enjoy Underworld. Amazingly, two decent sequels were also spawned off the back of this (and a fourth instalment that can be taken or left, depending on taste). Either way, give it a go - it's what vampires and werewolves were supposed to be before they used to go to high school together.",10,1,4,22 February 2015
Kickboxer," A true classic (somehow)
","When it comes to those musclebound heroes who were so popular in the eighties/early nineties, you kind of remember their breakthrough roles. 'The Terminator' is still a classic to this day and you can see how it catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger into super-stardom. The same can be said for 'Rocky' and 'Die Hard' for Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis respectively. It was fair to say that Jean Claude Van Damme hadn't done much before he starred as the lead in 'Kickboxer' (and a brief turn as the Predator before he threw a hissy-fit on set doesn't count – seriously, look that up). In 'Kickboxer' he plays a ballet dancer who turns professional kickboxer to avenge the crippling of his (also kickboxer) brother in the ring at the hands of a psycho. No, really. That's the plot.Okay, so you can expect a certain amount of training, in-ring fighting and romantic love interest thrown in there for good measure. That's all taken for granted in pretty much any film. However, all these tropes can't hide the fact that Van Damme isn't really that great actor. Okay, so he's hardly improved dramatically over the years, but he's definitely got better to justify his casting as a lead. Here, he can barely look like he understands other characters' lines, let alone form a facial expression that relates to them. I guess what I'm trying to say it that, even if 'Kickboxer' isn't the worst film ever made, it's quite hard to see how this was a springboard for his rise to stardom.I suppose he was cast simply because of his looks (which my girlfriend tells me are pretty hot back then – not to mention other areas of his anatomy!) and his ability to throw a kick or two. That, he can do for sure. Yes, the film-makers may have felt the need to overlay a sound effect reminiscent of you hitting a sponge sofa really hard over every punch, but you can tell he's really got the moves in the ring.'Kickboxer' is a classic. Everything about it should make it bad – reading back over this review I can see how scathing I sound. And yet, after watching it, I really don't feel like I've wasted my time and even enjoyed much of it. Yes, it's quite silly in places and the songs played over (alleged dramatic moments) sound like something Trey Parker and Matt Stone would spoof in 'South Park.' Plus the overall story plays out like a slightly more violent 'Karate Kid' movie, but it's still fun. You'll have seen it all before and know exactly where it's going, but if you're a fan of JCVD, or are just happy to sit through martial arts movies or general eighties overblown cheese, you should find some enjoyment here.",7,3,3,10 May 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A long time ago (but not quite as long ago as those pesky prequels)
","And lo, did Disney acquire the rights to arguably one of the most famous film franchises ever created (in this galaxy and all those before it). And, as everyone guessed, they began to milk it for all its worth. However, unlike the prequels, they did their best to appease everyone (i.e. the 'soft reboot' that was 'The Force Awakens'). However, along with what is technically the 'main' Star Wars story, they also decided to make one about just about everything from those little rodents you see briefly outside Jabba's palace, to why that Stormtrooper didn't see a door in front of him.And here we have 'Rogue One' – the tale we all know the end to about how the Rebels got their hands on the plans to the Death Star. So, if you've seen any previous Star Wars story, you basically know the end – which is technically a 'spoiler,' but never mind that. Despite us all knowing how it turns out, it's actually pretty fun.We join a young girl who has tenuous links to both the Rebels and the Empire and see her lead a band of misfits on a raid to steal and delivery the plans for the Death Star. And that's about it plot-wise. Like I say, if you've seen any of the others, you can probably guess how it all turns out. However, what's good about it is basically how well it ties the (depressing) prequels to the (excellent) originals. There are so many, not so much 'in-jokes,' but 'nods' to the original that only forty-year old fogies like myself will get. It's great to see all the faces who were in the original 'New Hope' film back here, even if some are a little 'CGI.' Rogue One in some ways is nothing new in as much as you know the story, however it is a worthy addition to the franchise due to it keeping with all the 'rules' of the universe (and not mentioning those 'midi-chlorines' or whatever they're called). Much of the talk surrounding the film centres on the use of computer graphics to restore dead actors (or 'un-age' them). I thought it was done pretty well, but there are those who say it's either disrespectful or just plain bad.But, whether you're a die-hard fan like myself, or a casual cinema-goer who can't name every single X-wing pilot in the battle of Yavin, you should enjoy this story as a fun, action-packed romp which is suitable for all the family (assuming you like action/sci-fi of course). Let's just hope all those other Disney rumours about 'prequels' and 'back-stories' live up to this one. My hopes aren't high for the 'Han Solo origin story.'",8,1,2,17 January 2017
Coraline," Brilliantly creepy
","First of all I will start by saying that I absolutely loved 'Coraline.' It has a fantastic look and feel to it and, despite being (amazingly crafted) 'stop motion' puppets, contains more depth and storytelling than many 'live action' films. And, if you're in the UK at least, you'll see that it has a PG (parental guidance) certificate. That translates to most people that it's suitable for kids. Or is it? The answer is of course 'yes,' otherwise it wouldn't have got that rating. However, it's worth noting that the general 'themes' are pretty dark in this movie, meaning that parents who have children who aren't really into anything too heavy may want to research this film a little deeper before deciding on whether their children should watch it or not.Many people have – pretty rightly – said that it's like something directed by (typically Gothic) Tim Burton and seeing as Coraline also utilises puppets compares it to 'A Nightmare Before Christmas.' The two certainly do share a lot of similar traits, namely the dark creepy atmosphere and pretty frightening overall feel.In Coraline, the titular character is a young eleven year old girl who moves to an old (spooky!) house in the middle of nowhere with her parents. Now, although her mum and dad aren't the worst people in the world, they're pretty busy with their jobs (aren't we all?) and don't always have as much time for their daughter as they would probably like. This, in turn, leaves Coraline to her own devices. And, while exploring her new home, she comes across a door to another world – one where everything is the same, only better. She has a perfect house, populated by different (i.e. perfect) versions of her parents who love and dote on her. Or do they? Naturally, as the story progresses Coraline discovers the old saying 'Better the devil you know,' because things in this 'other world' are certainly not all they seem (and I'm not just talking about the fact that everyone there has buttons for their eyes!).I won't do into too much detail regarding the plot, as I wouldn't want to spoil it. I will only say that the look and feel of the film is perfect, as is the acting and storytelling, making it pretty much as perfect as it can get. Also, just because the film is rated a PG, don't think that adults won't enjoy it. I often wonder whether if you were to remake Coraline with real actors as opposed to puppets, it might actually get a 15 or 18 rating, as the story would end up being something more like 'The Ring, The Grudge,' or 'Dark Water' in its theme and tone.So, if you like your horror films, don't write this one off as just another 'kids' movie' – it's so much more. But, as I said to begin with, if you're thinking of watching it with very little children, check what's in store for them before you let them watch it. This may be stop motion, but it's nothing like anything the much-loved Aardman studios have ever done!",9,0,0,16 February 2015
This Is the End," Dumb, adult fun
","Every once in a while a film comes along that seems to have been made for such a 'niche' audience that I'm amazed it ever found its way into the mainstream cinema. 'This is the End' is one such film. The amount of areas of film and popular culture you have to be into to really appreciate this film knows no bounds. Basically, it's a group of comic actors who have appeared in a string of adult-natured comedies, playing - apparently exaggerated versions - of themselves during a party that happens to coincide with the end of the world.To enjoy this film you're going to have to be okay with adult humour, bodily-function gags, appreciative of the humour of Seth Rogen, graphic violence, celebrities sending themselves up, frequent drug references i.e. 'stoner humour,' have at least a reasonable knowledge of Rogen's (and James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill to name but a few) filmic career, pop culture, comedy, sci-fi and general stupid movies that only exist to purely entertain and munch popcorn to. If you're into all those, give this one a watch. Luckily for me, I'm - believe it or not - able to appreciate all that, so I thought 'This is the End' was great!I don't know why, but I'm a sucker for actors who play themselves in films and generally lampoon themselves. Here, so many famous faces send themselves up (and in a biblically-apocalyptic setting!) that I was in heaven (assuming that 'blue light' chose me... which it probably wouldn't). There's little to say about 'This is the End' apart from if you're into most or all of the themes I've mentioned then you're probably going to have a blast with this film. I know a lot of people will not like it and consider it a little too 'self-indulgent' from the actors, but I didn't care. You don't need much of a story when then (adult!) gags come thick and fast. Just put your brain on hold and enjoy spotting one cameo after the next.",7,0,0,19 October 2018
Dawn of the Dead," A remake they actually got right
","It's become very fashionable to knock every single remake/reboot/re-envisioning that Hollywood comes up with. The idea it that they basically take a film that was popular a few years ago and film it again. Although what's churned out has very little to do with the source material apart from the name. It normally ends up being a soulless attempt at cashing in on the original's success via its name.Dawn of the Dead is one of the (few) exceptions to the rule.The original George Romero version is largely considered as the best zombie film going. It is indeed epic in length and has a smattering of social commentary regarding people's obsession with consumerism and spending all their time in shopping malls. The 2004 remake still has the zombies and the mall and, although some Romero die-hards will lament the lack of social commentary, most will appreciate it as a truly modern re-telling of the story. At least quite a few of the old 1979 version's cast make cameo appearances in the new version (playing new parts) which give us 'old school fanatics' a few in jokes to pick up on.Perhaps the 2004 version has its roots in the English film 28 Days Later which took the concept of zombies (or 'infected' as they were technically known) and made them run. Gone are the 1979 slow-moving 'shufflers' and here are some really nasty zombies who will even chase down a fast-moving car in order to rip apart their human prey.The 2004 version also has more characters. Granted some are a bit under-developed, but the majority play their parts well. The director, Zack Snyder, also deserves some credit at putting his own stylish spin on the direction, giving it a distinctive 'look' about it which elevates it over its numerous competitors.Granted Dawn of the Dead 2004 is not perfect. There are a few moments where daft things happen which are purely there to move along the plot and not really based on what would actually happen in such a situation. These faults I believe lie with the screenwriter. If you listen to the director's commentary, even he questions the characters' (and even zombies') motives for doing what they do. However, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a case of there is so much good and right about it, that I think most people should be able to see past the few flaws and just enjoy it for simply being a decent action/horror film.If you only want to see one modern zombie film, I'd watch this one (or 28 Days Later, but, as any zombie enthusiast will tell you, there's NO zombies in 28 Days Later... technically).",10,2,3,15 February 2015
Iron Man 2," Solid sequel
","Yes, the original 'Iron Man' movie was Marvel's 'surprise hit.' They were probably going to do a sequel anyway, but I'll bet they never thought they'd be pushing so heavily towards this side of the franchise. Anyway, it's fair to say that a sequel needs to give 'the same and more' and, to be fair, 'Iron Man 2' achieves this.It's bigger, louder, more special effects and more heroes/villains added into the mix. Personally, as a casual comic book-movie fan, I quite enjoyed it. I always thought most people did, until I read the online message boards, where it turned out that opinions were pretty divided on its merits.So, just to let you know that there's a sizable proportion of people out there who will disagree with me when I say that it's a pretty fun romp. No, it's not Shakespeare and it doesn't really try to be. I guess it's supposed to appeal to young fans (dare I say male fans?) who will buy the obligatory Iron Man T-shirts, Iron Man lunchboxes and Iron Man pyjamas. No, I didn't buy any of those, but I still enjoyed the film.Unlike other superheroes (think Batman, Superman and Spiderman), the 'secret' identify of our Iron Man isn't that secret, for at the end of the original film billionaire playboy Tony Stark decided to reveal to the world that he was the man in the iron mask – so to speak. Therefore, in Iron Man 2, he's an even bigger celebrity than he was simply for being the owner of a multinational arms manufacturing firm. It's actually quite nice to see an 'alter-ego' who's actually more 'ego' than anything else. Yes, he's a bit of an idiot. You probably wouldn't see Bruce Wayne getting drunk wearing the Batsuit at a party and using his Baterang to slice watermelons thrown from an adoring crowd. You see that here.Perhaps that's Iron Man's appeal – he's a bit of a plank and we can relate to his love of adoration? He is definitely a flawed – if very lucky – individual and he makes a change from the usual brooding hermit that most superheroes are portrayed as.Naturally, it's Robert Downey Jr's charm that carries the film through, but it's fair to give his supporting cast a mention. Naturally, seeing as the film's not called 'Iron Man and Friends' they have a lot less to do and a lot less material to work with. But they do okay to play off the star. If it's not a bit odd to say that Sam Rockwell's villain came across as a bit too 'comic-booky' for my liking (yes, I know it's a movie based on a comic book) – it just felt like he was trying a bit too hard.I know 'Iron Man 2' has its critics and I guess it's not perfect, but it is fun. It's nearly two hours and I always think one of the true tests of a movie is whether if feels like its runtime. And, in my opinion, Iron Man 2 flies by like a man in a yellow and red metal suit.Bust out the popcorn and enjoy.",8,2,3,26 May 2015
Alien: Resurrection," So close (and yet so far)
","I doubt there are many people who are new to the Alien franchise, but, on the off chance you are, 'Alien: Resurrection' is the forth instalment, charting the life of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her seemingly endless struggle to rid the universe of the monstrous aliens.The first film, Alien, was heralded as a classic horror movie. Its sequel, Aliens, cranked up the action and is also regarded as one of the best sequels ever made. However, Alien 3 started a downward trend that fans were left wondering how this happened when there was so much rich source material to build on. Alien 3 was not up to the quality of its predecessors, but it had its moments and, if you look at it as a 'stand-alone' piece, it's better still.Therefore, Alien: Resurrection is the studio's attempt to make up for part 3. Do they? Well, sort of. For a start they realise that having only ONE alien and NO guns was a mistake in part 3. Now we have guns and about fourteen aliens. Unfortunately, this still means it's a step backwards from the planet full of aliens we saw in part 2.Ripley is back and, seeing as she's now part alien herself, is enjoying playing her 'duel role.' Plus the supporting cast are good. But, again, if you've seen Aliens, they you'll probably realise that they're all just there to make up for the characters (needlessly?) killed off in Aliens.At least the direction is good (as per all its predecessors) and the film looks brilliantly dark and foreboding.Alien: Resurrection is a good film, but, as keeping with part 3 rather than parts 1 and 2, it's better more as another 'stand-alone' film. An Alien film shouldn't just be 'good,' it should be absolutely amazing, setting the standards for adult sci-fi/horror to come. This one is a nice effort at the mistakes made in part 3, but it's still inferior to Aliens, sadly.",7,1,2,16 September 2014
World War Z," A mainstream 'gore-free' zombie epic
","World War Z is based on a book from back in the dark ages where every horror film wasn't about zombies. Since roughly the millennium, we've seen every type of zombie movie - romantic ones, humorous ones, ones from the zombies' perspective. Once upon a time a movie would be a sure-fire success just for having zombies in it. Now the public are getting a little sick of the undead. So... is WWZ too late to be of any importance? No, it's actually pretty good.The closest film to liken it to would be 28 Days/Weeks Later in style and content. Only here we have a much bigger budget, played out not just in England, but all over the world. The zombies (and yes, they ARE zombies - there's no going to great lengths to NOT call them that here) can run, ala 'the infected' and you won't find a 'shuffler' in sight (oh, apart from when they're not chasing people - then they seem to happily go on 'shuffler-mode').I was struck by how little gore there was here. A staple of zombie movies is blood and 'head shots,' yet, despite numerous battles between soldiers and zombies, you barely catch a glimpse of the red stuff. Plus, any close-range zombie kills are skilfully edited to avoid seeing any physical damage to the corpse. I can only assume this was to assure the 15 certificate rating which would put more bums on seats in the cinema. There's also barely any bad language (I didn't count a single profanity). So... what is there? WWZ wins out on sheer scale. Its scenes specialise in terror and mass destruction, presenting 'what if' scenarios of what the population would do amidst such an unexpected ordeal. The film follows (former UN health inspector) Brad Pitt as he travels the globe in search of a cure to the zombie virus. Brad Pitt can act (Kalifornia and Snatch being proof of that) yet there's little for him to do here. He's not a ninja, or Superman, so he spends his time running away from zombies most of the time. If I was being harsh I could say that any actor could have played his role, but the film-makers needed a big name to carry the film.If you like zombie movies then definitely give this one a go. If nothing else it's the biggest and most epic zombie movie to date. If you want straight horror, you may come away feeling a little short-changed. I would almost call this a 'thriller' over a horror, due to the lack of gore being replaced by tension and terror.Slight gripe: I watched this in the cinema and there was a fair few people who found the zombies quite funny when they were up close. For some reason zombies 'chatter/clack' their teeth together when they're sniffing the air. It is rather odd and probably more funny than scary.",8,4,7,11 November 2014
The Hunger Games," One for the kids
","The Hunger games is rated a 12 Certificate (in the UK at least) and that's probably for a reason. I'm guessing it means that no one OVER the age of twelve should bother to watch it.I imagine that any twelve-or-under will be well and truly wowed at the terrible vision of a future gone bad, where the poor are hunted and laughed at by their evil rich oppressors. However, being a man in my thirties, I kind of found it all a bit patronising. The rich are portrayed as evil. The poor good. This (pretty unsubtle) message is then repeated for almost every one of the hundred and twenty minutes this film runs for.A girl (with a silly name) is selected from one of the noble, long-suffering poor communities and forced to compete (i.e. kill) another twenty-three kids from neighbouring noble and poor districts. If fact, she wasn't even selected. She was the first ever volunteer for certain death, because her equally (but slightly more weedy) noble and poor younger sister was the one selected, but this noble and poor girl offered to die on her behalf. All the time this is beamed across the world for the evil rich people to enjoy.Luckily, the film's noble and poor heroine is so noble and poor that, despite being a crack shot with a bow and arrow, she's too noble and pure to actually kill any of the other noble and poor kids (okay, she kills about one, but that's it). They kind of do each other in for her, making sure she stays noble and virtuous at all times.Anyway, the first half of the film shows us how badly the noble and poor people are exploited by their evil and rich oppressors and the second half shows us how the noble and poor girl with the very silly name runs about not killing people in order to win.I kept hearing other reviews talk about how The Hunger Games is 'the new Twilight.' And they're probably right. Twilight was 'vampires for children/teens' and The Hunger Games is sort of an action/romance film for teens. They'll love it.Remember: poor = good. Rich = bad (just in case you didn't get the film's particularly unsubtle message).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,2,5,22 May 2014
12 Monkeys," Python meets Terminator
","'Twelve Monkeys' is Terry Gilliam's mind-bending time travel epic which tells the story of convict, Bruce Willis, being repeatedly sent back in time to discover the cause of a mysterious virus which wiped out 99% of humanity.It doesn't have Terminator's action sequences, but the plot is kind of similar, plus Gilliam shows his flair for depicting his weird vision of the future by showing us a world that is a cross between Brazil and Time Bandits.Despite Bruce Willis not always receiving that much praise for his acting abilities, he comes across pretty well here as a vulnerable and confused man, trying to make sense of the weird situation he finds himself in. (A very young) Brad Pitt also co-stars and steals every scene with his odd eyes and borderline psychotic personality disorders.It's a great film, but you have to be in the mood for it. I've watched it about three times in the space of nearly twenty years and loved it every time. I have to feel like sitting down and really trying to get my head around who's doing what and why.Like I said, it's not just like Terminator where bad guys fight good guys. You may have to think a little with this one. If you're a fan of Terry Gilliam's work, you should love this. If you've never seen anything he's done before, you may have to tread carefully with this one and check out some more reviews before you decide to commit over two hours to looking into his twisted mind.",8,1,1,27 November 2014
The Impossible," A drama over a thriller
","If, like me, you've become accustomed to Hollywood's recent obsession with disaster movies, then you might have expected The Impossible to be more of a fast-paced, tension-driven thriller about people trying to survive against the elements. However, this is actually more of a thoughtful, uplifting piece. Yes, we have some special effects near the beginning where a huge tidal wave decimates a holiday resort in Thailand, leaving numerous dead or missing, but the rest of the film is about a family who have become separated with each other, undertaking the monumental task of trying to find each other again in the midst of the aftermath.With Ewan McGreggor and Naomi Watts as leads, you can expect decent performances, but the stand-out character who steals many of the scenes is the young boy who plays their son and shows how he was forced to cope with growing up far sooner than he ever should have.It's a good film, if you're looking for drama and a real story of survival against the odds. Just don't expect a roller-coaster of excitement with many thrills and spills along the way.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,1,8 June 2014
Shaun of the Dead," The 'Cornetto Trilogy' Part I
","Many a film – and in particular zombie film – seems to be based on a pun ('Flight of the Living Dead' I'm looking at you). However, few actually exhibit enough originality to be worthy of the film they're based on. 'Shaun' changes all that. In 2004 zombies were still relatively uncommon on the cinema screen. You had the 'Resident Evil' films and that was about it. Therefore, being dumped by one's girlfriend on the same day the dead come back to life and start eating the living, was definitely something a bit different back then.It's fair to say that 'Shaun of the Dead' is a classic. Since its release it's been imitated plenty of times and none of them have really done as well. The fact is that 'Shaun' is just damn funny, while at the same time being pretty horrific when it tries and even touching and sentimental when the mood takes it. Therefore, despite largely being lumped into the 'horror' genre, its appeal actually stretches much further to those looking for a good comedy, or even a 'date movie' to share with someone.Simon Pegg plays not exactly a loser, but certainly an underachiever. His titular character, Shaun, is generally coasting through life, never really applying himself. All he wants to do is hang out at the local pub with his mate, Ed (who definitely IS a loser!). It's no wonder his girlfriend, Liz, is getting more than a little sick of his lack of drive. However, that all changes when the dead rise from the grave and he hatches a plan to save those he loves (and even a few of those he doesn't – Liz's flatmate to be precise).What follows is a jaunt across a zombie-infested London as they desperately try to get to safety. And, in Shaun's mind 'safety' equals the local pub where he spends pretty much all his life. What works best about the film is the way the characters play off each other. They're pretty much all friends in real life (check out some of the other films and TV they've been in), therefore they're all used to working with each other and, more importantly, playing off each other. You really get the impression that they really are a bunch of friends, caught up in a life or death situation.Bottom line, if you like horror, you'll like this. If you like comedy, you'll still like it. And, in case you're wondering what the 'cornetto' reference is in the title – this happens to be the first film in the fabled 'cornetto trilogy.' Simon Pegg wrote the film with his friend (and director) Edgar Wright. Together they wrote a further two films, all subtly working in a nice ice cream into the mix. If you like Shaun of the Dead, try 'Hot Fuzz' (comedy and action) and 'The World's End' (comedy and sci-fi), all the time watching out for the cornetto reference.",9,0,3,7 February 2015
Argo," Ben and his beard to the rescue
","'Argo' is one of those films 'based on real events,' which basically means that Hollywood has beefed up various aspects to put bums on seats.It's set at the end of the seventies when six Americans are left stranded in Iran, leaving Ben Affleck and his beard to hatch an ingenious plan to make them pose as science-fiction film makers and fly them out of there.If you want to know how it ended, Google the true story. What you have here is Hollywood's interpretation of it. And, looking at it from an entertainment point of view, it does do the job. It's pretty intense in places, which, if you're after an edgy thriller, should leave you satisfied.However, if you're looking for something a little more true to life, then you may find it hard to get over some of the major Hollywood views. As usual, the Americans are ultra-heroic, whereas the Iranians are presented as bungling incompetents who are too busy burning US flags to be any more terrifying that your average Scooby Doo villain. Of course there are the little alterations, too. In real life, the escaping Americans were temporarily sheltered by the British. In the film they take great care to point out how the British turned them away - grumble, grumble, grumble.Bottom line: if you look at it as entertainment with some terrible seventies haircuts and a fantastic beard co-starring on Ben Affleck's face (which definitely should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, in my opinion) then it works. Historically - well, let's just say it will pick up more than its fair share of criticism for its version of 'the truth.'",7,0,1,26 November 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," The posh of Khan
","Star Trek: Into Darkness pretty much continues where the 2009 reboot took off. It's hard to imagine there are too many people watching Into Darkness who don't know what to expect. This film is very 'JJ Abrams,' i.e. it's full of flashy computer special effects and even more flashy lens flares.However, if you can look past the polish then you'll find that there's actually a pretty involving story behind it. The actors - once again - put in excellent performances, imitating their 'older' incarnations perfectly (some even getting better the second time around - Simon Pegg as 'Scotty' being the main improvement). There's plenty of room for character development as the film is over two hours long as Kirk and co take on John Harrison (aka a new British (?) 'Khan') who has sworn to destroy the Federation.You don't actually need to have seen the last big screen outing where Kirk and Khan squared off. However, if you have seen 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' then you'll probably enjoy watching how the 'tangent universe' we're now watching, mirrors the old Star Trek universe.The best thing about both new Star Trek films is that they both retain their 'Star Trek feel,' even with updated special effects. You would probably never confuse these movies with any from the Star Wars franchise. The new Trek movies play to their strengths, rather than try to imitate Star Wars.Perhaps the only criticism may be that 'we've seen this all before.' But that would most likely be from those of us who watched the Star Trek films the first time round. Yes, some bits feel a little too recycled, but there's definitely enough that's original here to make this an excellent, high-budget action movie which should - hopefully - appeal to long-standing and new fans alike.",9,3,6,3 February 2015
Hostel," Sets a new – and disturbing – standard among modern day films
","In case you didn't already know... 'Hostel' (the second major film by Eli Roth) kind of spawned the rather dubious genre of 'torture porn.' This is where gratuitous on-screen violence is displayed for our – the audience's – entertainment.And that's basically the premise of the film. If you're okay with that, you'll enjoy it. As, believe it or not, there's also a story woven somewhere in there. Two American teenagers are backpacking across Europe where they hear of a 'legendary' hostel in Eastern Europe where the girls outnumber the guys and do all sorts of other stuff (to put it mildly). Naturally, they head off there and – even more naturally still – they fall foul to all sorts of unspeakable scenarios.And, if you can get over of the violence, it's not actually that bad. You'll like the characters – they're dumb enough to be believable as your average backpacking teenagers, but not so stupid enough that you'll be shouting at the screen when they make the wrong decisions. Plus the 'threat' element is pretty original and based on numerous urban legends.So, just to check, if you're okay with gratuitous sex and violence and generally like horror films then you should probably enjoy this (and part II even, but just don't bother with part III – it went straight to DVD).",8,1,4,14 October 2014
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy, Stupid, but quite funny
","In a world where Hollywood repeatedly churns out 'comedies' which are about as amusing as bowel cancer, it does seem that Steve Carell is actually becoming as sure fire bet as you can get in the movie industry to be actually funny every time.Okay, so Crazy, Stupid, Love is not a laugh-a-minute fest, but, right from the start, it raises a fair few chuckles. It's helped by having a decent cast. Although, I would say that everyone apart from Carell should be described as 'supporting cast,' as all the best laughs are generated from him. He takes his 'loveable, but bumbling' character we're so used to seeing him as, and applies it here to his cringeworthy attempts at dating.Ryan Gosling is good too. However, he's merely Carell's straight man and the movie does slow down a bit in the second act when the story focuses more on Gosling over Carell.However, it picks up near the end, before ending how you've probably guessed it would (assuming you've seen a romantic comedy before).All it all, some decent fun with a fair few adult situations and gags.Small criticism: might have benefited by being cut in length by about twenty minutes - just to tighten the comedy up and stop it dragging in places.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,2,3,27 May 2014
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A rom com worth watching
","I'm not much of a fan of 'rom-coms' (maybe being a guy?!), but I am a big fan of Steve Carell, so I figured I'd give 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' a go and, I'm pleased to say, that I wasn't disappointed. If you've ever watched one romantic comedy then you've pretty much seen the formula, i.e. boy meets girl, boy loses girl etc. And, 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' doesn't really deviate from this (is that a 'spoiler?'). However, just because it doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, doesn't mean it isn't fun.In this case, 'boy' has already met 'girl,' as the film opens with Julianne Moore telling Steve Carell that she wants a divorce. From there on he goes off the rails, spending his nights in bars, drunkenly lamenting his failed family life, until he's taken under the wing of (near 'professional!') pick-up artist, played by Ryan Gosling, who then helps him learn the ways of the Force (in 'Star Wars' terms), or at least talk to women.The distinctly A-list cast makes up for the tired format and the bottom line is that 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is funny. Yes, if I was going further I'd say it was 'uplifting' and has a 'positive emotional message.' However, ultimately I was looking to be entertained and this film did just that. The characters are decent enough for you to care about them without ever becoming caricatures or cliches. It mainly focuses in the three stars I've already mentioned, but you also have Emma Stone and Kevin Bacon in there as well (who aren't used possibly as much as they could have been). If I can one main criticism it's that the film is actually quite long for a romantic comedy (I even thought it was coming to a close around the hour mark!) and it does slow down in a couple of places (in fact, it was around the hour mark that Emma Stone's character - properly - comes into it). The ending is what you'd expect, so if you can forgive the lulls in pace here and there, it is actually quite good fun - especially if you're happy with plenty of sexual gags and situations.",7,1,2,12 October 2018
Green Room," I obviously didn't get it :/
","I've seen pretty much every type of horror movie, meaning I've seen every different type of monster (or mutant=-redneck) stalk pretty much every cliché of teenager across every different type of landscape. It's fair to say that after – roughly – fifty years since the (original) 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' popularised the 'slasher' genre, there isn't really anything new to expect. The best you can hope for is an enjoyable rehash of something you've already seen that brings a sliver of something new to the table.I looked at the reviews for 'Green Room' and was pleasantly optimistic as it's rated very highly on many websites. I've always been a massive fan of Patrick Stewart and Ashton Yelchen usually turns in a decent performance (still say he was the best part of 'Terminator: Salvation') so, even if it wasn't that original, I was expecting something pretty entertaining. However, I've left it a couple of weeks to write this review and I'm finding it pretty hard to actually remember much of what happened – in short, I found it pretty forgettable! It's about a young, up and coming band who – as hard as it is to believe in this day and age – doesn't use social media to promote themselves. Therefore, they're pretty much unknown, touring up and down America in pretty low-key venues. But, they think their luck is about to change when a contact offers them a gig where they can headline (and earn a bit of decent money in the process). Unfortunately, and this is a lesson to us all, the gig is in front of a group of white-supremacists who are hardly people you want to entertain. But, they almost get away with it if it wasn't for the fact that they witness a murder and their (not particularly adoring) crowd isn't too happy to just let them walk away as witnesses. Therefore, the band are forced to lock themselves backstage in (you may have guessed it) the green room and try and figure a way of escaping before they just get 'disappeared' long before they ever get the chance to win their first Grammy.Basically, it's a 'siege movie' (think 'Assault on Precinct 13' or something like that) with 'band vs Nazis.' It's an acceptable enough premise, but it's, as I've already mentioned, kind of forgettable. The band are just not that likable (or even memorable!). Without wishing to spoil things too much, one dies and it took me a while to even notice! I must have just blinked and they just vanished. They really were pretty forgettable. Obviously, the extreme ring-wingers were naturally nasty so you'd probably be a bit strange to root for them over the band, but it wasn't as violent as some of the reviews had made out. Yes, it is pretty dark and hardly a 'feel good' movie, but I was expecting even more heads to roll than were on offer! It wasn't' a bad film. It was just nothing I hadn't already seen before. Patrick Stewart is the head bad-guy and he's – naturally – always worth a watch, but, in my opinion, this wasn't the greatest swansong for poor old Ashton Yelchen. If you haven't seen that many siege movies, or are a major fan of any of the leads, you may find this quite good (or shocking!). However, if you're a grizzled veteran to the genre then there's little here you haven't seen before. I've pretty much already forgotten most of it (but then again with my age I could just be getting senile!).",6,2,4,20 January 2017
Public Enemies," Okay, but not what it could have been
","Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are probably two of the best-known actors around at this time. Between them they have clocked up a wide range of varied characters and have proved their acting might on more than one occasion. Therefore, the temptation by studio bosses to get the pair of them in the two leading roles must have proved too much to resist.Therefore, we have Johnny Depp portraying real life gangster John Dillinger, with Christian Bale as the FBI agent hell-bent on bringing him to justice. Naturally, as the film's about Dillinger himself, Depp gets the lion's share of screen time. In fact, fans of Bale may feel a little cheated regarding how much they get to see the man behind (arguably) Batman's most successful incarnation. He's little more than a figure who turns up every now and again to narrowly miss Dillinger. We never really get to see what makes him tick – he's just a particularly driven lawman, who has to catch his man. I don't recall ever seeing anything that shows us if he has any real life outside his work.Depp too feels more than a little underused. Dillinger's not a particularly nice guy. Okay, he doesn't rob 'regular' people, only banks. But he's prone to acts of extreme violence and doesn't think twice about killing if it suits his needs. So the audience might find it hard to relate to him, let alone support him in his side of the story. Depp's better at playing larger than life characters. Dillinger is pretty one dimensional. He steals and he hits people and has little else to his personality.I haven't read Dillinger's life story, so I can't comment on how close the film is to portraying the real man, or how accurate is, but there were a couple of scenes which didn't seem to fit – namely when Dillinger finds it easy to walk among entire departments of the very police officers charged with bringing him in and yet they don't actually recognise him.But, despite the film not really utilising its two trump cards, i.e. Bale and Depp, it's not a bad watch. I'm sure it's a reasonable account of Dillinger's life and, even if it isn't, it's a decent enough crime drama.",7,0,0,7 January 2015
The Babadook," Functional little horror
","'Babadook' has come in for some 'high praise' from a lot of the people who have seen it. I'm not sure that I'd go as far as to praise it highly here, but it's not that bad. I think that the reason it's been so well received is because it is slightly better than the average horror movie. Let's face it... just because there are load of horror films around right now, that doesn't mean that most of them are totally forgettable.The 'Babadook' is vaguely better than the average modern horror film. It's dark and moody, yet at the same never really reveals the 'time period' it's supposed to be set in – people dress and speak like they're from the nineteen forties then use a mobile phone (couldn't spot an iphone though).It's about a single mother and her son. The youngster clearly suffers from various 'behavioural problems' – many of which stem from his father's untimely demise on the day of his birth. He's expelled from school and his mother does her best to raise him. Only there's a bad book (or anagram of 'Babadook' if you noticed?) in their house that seems to bring on an equally bad presence in the house.And the 'bad presence' is pretty eerie and nicely done. That's another plus point. Then you also have the child actor. Now, ninety per cent of kids in films deserve to be eaten by monsters and, despite this young boy spending much of the early part of the film screaming, he just about does enough to stop you from completely hating him.There's nothing new here. It could almost be 'The Ring' under another name. If you don't watch much horror, you may enjoy it more as you probably won't have seen as much like it before. However, if – like me – you've seen a hundred and one different spooks tormenting a hundred and one different families, then there's a certain amount of de ja vu going on here. It's not bad. I didn't resent sitting through it. I just can't promise not to forget it totally in a few months time.",6,1,4,5 April 2015
Us," Don't think, just enjoy it
","'Us' is the second film written and directed by Jordan Peele (the first being the awesomely-creepy 'Get Out') and I was pretty interested by what I'd heard online about his new film. A family goes on vacation, only to get stalked and attacked by an identical family - in every way!I was going to see it no matter what, but I never got round to watching it in the cinema. However, from various online sources, not only did I get the impression that it was one of those films that people either absolutely loved or really despised, but also I basically learned the entire plot - practically beat for beat. So, by the time it came for me to watch it on the small screen, I knew everything that was going to happen, including the overall premise as to what was occurring in this unsettling world I was witnessing.However, even though I'd deliberately removed all forms of 'mystique' from what was going on in the film, I still enjoyed it. Even though I sound like a bit of a hypocrite, I would recommend NOT finding too much about the plot before watching it. I've already given the briefest of synopsis and that should be all you'll need.'Us' is a bit of a 'mish-mash' of genres. Overall it's a horror and, if you're looking into more of a 'sub-genre,' you could call it a 'home invasion' movie. However, this 'sub-genre' then changes into yet more variants of the overall horror theme.The main cast are all believable as a unit and play off each other nicely and you won't question that these are a group of people who have lived (and put up with!) each other for many years.What I liked about the film was the premise. Yes, it borrows from many sources, but the overall theme of what was really happening was original enough for me to really appreciate as something new and not a topic that had been done before (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!). Of course it's not perfect. One of the main reasons I saw people online saying it was far inferior to 'Get Out' was its lack of answers to some questions.Like I say, the plot is pretty original, but with it brings many things you could ask yourself about how this all came to be. The film doesn't offer any answers and you could well not come up with any feasible ones yourself if you ponder too long on it.However, almost all films require a certain element of 'suspension of disbelief' when it comes to enjoying them. For any horror fan out there who wants something a little different, just make sure you're in a forgiving mood and settle in for a really creepy premise which is well worth a watch.",7,1,2,3 June 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Meet some friends of mine
","People have argued that, after 16 seasons, South Park isn't as fresh as it once was. Its creators/writers (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) are self-confessed 'Python fans' and many of the early seasons were made in the a similar vain. As the seasons progressed, it moved away from simple wackiness and into 'causes' and 'celeb-bashing' (the wackiness remained, but seemed to take a back seat). This lost a certain amount of viewers, leaving only the die hard fans remaining (not that that must have particularly worried Trey and Matt, as South Park has a LOT of die hard fans left out there).But, if you really haven't seen South Park and are wondering what all the fuss is about, then its movie incarnation is as good a place as any to start.Don't be fooled by the crude animation. You've probably heard that South Park is simply smut and crudeness. And it is. And yet it's so much more as well. The wonder of South Park is that it's an adult world seen through the eyes of a child (or four children, to be precise). They are forced to navigate a pretty weird and frightening world with only the guidance of a sex-obsessed chef and a school teacher with split personality issues. The four boys sneak in to see an X-rated Canadian movie which teaches themselves all sorts of naughty words. This, in turn, leads to America declaring war on Canada.Yes, it's pretty wacky, but there are plenty of cultural references and takes on modern life thrown in there among the smut and depravity.If you want to want South Park, you need an open mind and shouldn't be easily offended. It's not an 'adult' cartoon for no reason. However, if you're looking for something that is - secretly - intelligent and mad in the best sort of way, then you can do worse than spending an hour and a half watching Satan and Saddam Hussain battle it out with the residents of a small mountain town in Middle America.",10,0,0,25 February 2015
Ted," Juvenile, infantile, puerile, stupid - I absolutely LOVED it!
","There are some films that are so low brow they make you want to chew your own neck off (Keith Lemon: The Movie, I'm looking at you). Then there are others which are also pretty low brow, but actually work. I'm pleased to say that Ted is one of them.Ted is the tale of a young boy's magical wish to bring his cuddly teddy bear to life so that they can be best friends forever. He gets his wish and Ted stays with him until adulthood, which causes more than a few complications with his long-suffering girlfriend.If you didn't know, Ted is Seth (Family Guy/American Dad/The Cleveland Show) MacFarland's first big screen outing and the bottom line is that, if you've seen and enjoy any of his shows, you'll probably enjoy Ted. His writing is not meant to be subtle. Some of it can be shocking, other bits offensive. He (like Family Guy) has an 'open insult' policy, where no one is beyond being made fun of. Although he does cover some controversial topics, he mainly makes fun of eighties movies and TV, plus some healthy ribbing of B-list celebrities.It's crude, but it's funny. As long as you set you mind at that level and know what you're getting, you should have more than a few laughs with a bear who swears and engages in recreational drug-taking (not to mention is quite a hit with the ladies - you'll have to watch the film to see that bit).Enjoy a real life 'swear bear!'http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",9,0,1,25 May 2014
Oldboy," Disturbingly dark
","I recently saw another Korean film 'I Saw the Devil' and, in light of the fact that I've now watched a film made by the same people, 'Oldboy' I'm glad I did. Because I think that many of us have been kind of lulled into believing that the only way to make a film is 'the Hollywood way.' I didn't like 'I Saw the Devil' when I started watching it, but, after persevering, I was glad I did in the end. Plus, now I feel I know Korean cinema a little better (or how it's done) I was able to enjoy (if that's the right word) 'Oldboy' from the off.And it's certainly a difficult film to describe, let alone say who's its target audience is. A man – and not a particularly nice one – doesn't bother seeing his estranged wife and baby daughter in favour of generally going out and getting drunk. However, things quickly catch up with him when he's swiped off the streets and locked in a room for no less than fifteen years without explanation. However, during this time he's had more than a few changes of heart. Now he's not only ready to find out and punish whoever imprisoned him in the first place, but also make amends with his daughter, who is now basically grown up in his absence.It would be easy to label Oldboy as a 'revenge thriller.' Yes, there are certainly aspects of hunting down those who wronged him. But it's the way it's done that makes it so different. I would go into specifics, but it's one of those films where if you say too much about the plot you will give away vital points which will lead to you predicting what's to come. It's fair to say that there are more than a few twists and turns to keep you interested (or disgusted?) and you will not only need to be ready for those, but also have a strong stomach in terms of content material.Which brings me back to my thoughts on who it's marketed at. I don't really know – people who like revenge movies, but can tolerate some pretty disturbing story lines mainly. Oh, and subtitles. It's got subtitles – but then you probably guessed that. However, even though you have to read the dialogue it's still easy to tell that the cast are pretty impressive and there are performances that are going to stick with you – even if some of them are for the wrong reasons.Basically, if you like your foreign revenge films dark then give this one a go. Just don't blame me for any therapy you may require after sitting through it. A classic, but a dark one.",8,1,2,4 August 2015
Point Break," Point Break – 'Point-less'
","I'm sorry, there must be tonnes of reviews out there that have used the 'pointless' pun. I couldn't help it. It's just too obvious. In case you didn't know, 'Point Break' is a classic action/cop movie of the nineties. Therefore, because of its 'classic' status, it was deemed 'remakeable' by our good friends - those wonderful Hollywood executives. Now, I like to think I'm not a 'remake snob' – there are arguments for remaking a film, normally if you have a fresh take on something, or if the film was made so long ago that people have practically forgotten the original. However, 'Point Break' was only made in the nineties and is still pretty dear to many people – namely me. I may be able to forgive this new version for anything other than a cynical cash-grab if the original source material was particularly outdated, but unfortunately the sad fact is that the (dare I say 'proper?') 'Point Break' still looks as good today as it ever did.In case you don't know, both 'Point Breaks' are about a young FBI agent (Johnny Utah) who has to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers led by 'Bodhi' who indulge in extreme sports, in order to gain their trust and catch them, obviously. Whereas the original had Keanu Reeves playing our FBI hero and Patrick Swayze as the lead robber, the new one has er, actually I don't know either of them. I like to think I'm reasonably good with actors, but I've never seen either of these two in anything! But, I won't hold that against them. I'll save my disdain for the chemistry between pretty much everyone on screen. Everyone just seemed to be trying too hard to steer away from what we already know about the film, but never really achieving it. This new 'Point Break' incarnation is like a meteorite that's got hopelessly trapped in a planet's gravitational pull and is fighting against the odds in a losing battle to escape.The new 'Point Break' does its best to try and create something new. The bank robbers don't just surf like they do in the original and it's set across multiple locations around the world, rather than just a single beach in America, but it's simply not enough. I've briefly touched upon the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, but this really becomes obvious when they try and throw in the obligatory 'love interest' in there for Johnny Utah the 2nd. It's truly painful. Almost as bad as watching (the usually awesome) Ray Winstone as Johnny's partner Angelo Pappas. It's just weird hearing these names again, only seeing different faces associated with them.Believe it or not, I didn't hate the remake. It's a decent enough film and, if you're into anything from extreme sports to cops and robbers films, you'd probably get some entertainment out of it. But there's a MAJOR but. This only applies if you've never seen the original. If you've watched that you'll be crying out for a slice of Reeves and Swayze. So, if you haven't already seen the original, go and watch that – it's a true classic of its time which still holds up today. Let the remake be a message to Hollywood that we're not interested in seeing all our favourite movies redone just to make a quick buck.",4,1,1,1 July 2017
Batman Returns," The dark Dark Knight
","Tim Burton's second Batman film has been largely regarded as the 'darkest' of all the Dark Knight's big screen outings. In fact, according to many, it was 'too dark' and, because of that, somehow less worthy than the other movies. Yes, the tone is pretty bleak, but, when you compare it to many of the films today (including Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy) I can't really see the problem.Where some people see 'darkness,' I simply see realism. Yes, people get killed in 'Batman Returns' (shock, horror – even good people!). If that shocks and disturbs you so then you really should stick to watching Disney cartoons where everyone lives happily ever after.Besides, if you're contemplating watching Batman Returns then you've probably already seen Tim Burton's first Batman offering, i.e. 1989 smash hit with Jack Nicholson as The Joker. If you haven't, I'd start with that one first, as it sets the tone nicely for the sequel. Today's audiences may be more familiar with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the 'killer clown,' but, back in 1989, Jack Nicholson WAS the Joker. It was fair to say that he owned the role and whoever followed him in taking on the Dark Knight would have to be pretty damn evil to top him. Enter Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't care what Batman's modern day fans say... I still think Pfeiffer is a better 'Catwoman' than Anne Hathaway. Both of the new villains stepped up to the challenge and scared and slinked their way around the screen at all times.With two such great villains you could be mistaken for thinking that Batman himself might be a bit eclipsed (a common complaint about the first film). However, he too has upped his game (maybe Michael Keaton demanded more screen time and better lines after being so outshined by Jack Nicholson?). Either way, you'll be hard put to find anyone letting the side down.At nearly two hours, Batman Returns isn't a short film, but it seems to fly by. Maybe it's not a 'family friendly' movie and it certainly doesn't have the 'happy-go-lucky' feel of today's modern (Marvel?) superhero movies, but it is one of Burton's best 'twisted fairy tales' to date, so if you're in the mood for something nicely dark with a cracking Danny Elfman soundtrack, give this one a go and don't go thinking that Nolan's Batman was the ONLY Dark Knight out there.",10,2,4,29 May 2014
Blade," The Marvel movie that set the ball rolling
","Back in the nineties, DC (comic book) movies seemed to rule the big screen (i.e. Batman and Superman being the main two) whereas Marvel (comic book) movies seemed to be destined to fill up TV stations with men in skin-tight lycra running around throwing weak punches here and there.Then came Blade. Blade is not your typical superhero and this isn't your typical superhero movie. He's half human and half vampire and he spends his time ridding the world of the undead. And he does this in more of a brutal way that your average superhero.Since Blade, Marvel seemed to realise how to make a superhero movie and since then, it's overtaken the DC universe. Maybe it's because Blade is such a broad movie - it's action, horror and superhero movie all rolled into one. Of course it's definitely not a comedy. There are few moments of light relief as it's pretty serious through and through.If you like 'classic vampire movies' (i.e. before Twilight) then you should give this a try. It's quite an epic from start to finish. It spawned two sequels, the first of which was actually almost as good as the first (some say better), whereas the second one left audiences split.However, the original is definitely a stand out movie. Anyone who likes horror, action, martial arts or superhero movies should love it.Now all we need is a 'Blade vs Twilight' movie. I for one would pay good money to see him rid the world of creatures with big, sculpted hair who twinkle while they pout at teenage schoolgirls.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,3,5,11 June 2014
Superbad," The clue is in the name ;o)
","I first watched 'Superbad' and I didn't like it much. In short: totally forgettable. It was only as the years went by did I realise quite how much of a 'cult following' it had, so I decided to give it another go. I have to say that it gets better each time I watched it. I can only assume I was in the mood for something a little more serious and 'high-brow' when I initially sat down. However, now I know what I'm getting, I'm quite happy to watch and rewatch it every few years. Think 'American Pie' only less intellectual!It's difficult not to mention the (sort of) 'ground breaking' 'American Pie' film when talking about 'Superbad.' Any story that centres around young High School-age lads who are on a quest to - er - 'get better acquainted' with members of the opposite s3x in a short period of time, will always draw comparisons with the 'Pie' franchise. Here, we have three boys (Jonah Hill as 'Seth,' Michael Cera as his best mate 'Evan' and Christopher Mintz-Plasse stealing every scene as 'Fogell' (or rather 'McLovin' I should say). They are the archetypal nerds who never really know what to say around girls and are reduced to working out ways to 'trick' the fairer s3x into liking them during a graduation party before they all leave for college (that's 'University' to us Brits!).Naturally, their plot doesn't go to plan and what follows is everything from singing (badly!) in front of drug dealers, to throwing Molotov cocktails at police cars - so you typical night out when you were about 18. It's all in very bad taste and if you're in any way offended by s3xual-related gags, swearing and generally 'adult' situations and humour then you should stay well clear. However, if you're in the mood for something pretty low-brow then you'll definitely find it here.I liked the relationship between Seth and Evan. Yes, it's hard to make stereotypical 'nerds' that different from any other depiction you've already seen, but they certainly have chemistry and you do feel as if they would be the type to hang out together in real life. They're flawed and not totally 'heroic,' but then aren't we all? In short - they're relatable. However, as I mentioned it's Christopher Mintz-Plasse who is the real star of the film. His character gets separated from the other two early on and has his own little adventure with a couple of... well, not exactly corrupt, but also hardly 'untouchable' police officers, played by Seth Rogan and Bill Hader. Somehow, everything about this completely mismatched pairing of cops and nerd works and is a true joy to behold. As I eluded to, it helped cement 'McLovin' as a term/name we all know and love.Personally, for me 'Superbad' is up there with those few films that I really didn't like on first watch and yet I totally changed my opinion after time ('Anchorman' is another, curiously). I'm not sure if this experience resonates with anyone else, but all I can say is that it's dumb, rude and - yes - super 'bad' ('bad' being slang for good in today's youth - so I'm told).",7,1,2,27 November 2018
Hot Fuzz," Action has never been so much fun
","'Hot Fuzz' is one of those - rarest of - films which not only spans numerous genres, but is also enjoyable to many different demographics. It's easy to say that 'action' films are a 'male dominated' niche and 'Hot Fuzz' certainly has plenty of action contained within. In fact... it may ever have more shoot-outs and set-pieces than your average straight-to-DVD B-movie with an once well-known muscled leading man at the helm. However, why 'Hot Fuzz' succeeds on so many levels is because you don't have to be a fan of action movies to appreciate it, largely because of its humour. Yes, it's also a comedy. And a 'buddy-cop' film. And has large moments of character development and, dare I say drama as well. Because of this, I can see it almost appealing to any adult of any age. I won't say 'fun for all the family' as, because of its 'adult language' it probably wouldn't be suitable for youngsters. However, if you don't mind the odd swear word, then join London's best police officer (Simon Pegg) who is, in fact, so good at his job that his superiors decide to transfer him to a sleepy little country town because he's making all the other officers look bad by catching too many criminals.Naturally, the move makes him a little uncomfortable, being used to dealing with drug dealers and murderers and now forced to - effectively - rescue cats from tall trees. However, the local 'bobby' (Nick Frost) is on hand to 'acclimatise' him to his new life. But, as fate would have it, this idyllic little town soon shows it's hiding some dark secrets which need the pair to investigate.I'm not going to go into the plot any further as it's a film that you really do need to see to enjoy. The village is also home to plenty of colourful characters, all of which add to the story and bring their best performances to the table. You may have also seen the Pegg/Frost collaborations 'Shaun of the Dead, The World's End' and 'Paul,' so you'll probably know the type of film you're going to get here - a genuinely funny film which lovingly pokes fun at a genre the film-makers clearly hold in high regard",9,1,1,7 April 2018
The Mummy," Fun, fun, fun
","Okay, before I begin the review proper, I must warn you that I'm probably going to be using the word 'fun' a lot to describe 'The Mummy.' Because that's all it is – fun. A lot of people liken it to the Indiana Jones movies and I can see where they're coming from. Then again, an equally high proportion of the audience detests how the two movies are likened to each other. No, I'm certainly not saying that The Mummy is anywhere near as good as the Jones trilogy (notice how I'm leaving out the Crystal Skull out of that statement!), but it is similar.The Mummy is one of those 'family fun' kind of movies – an adventure which should most likely be screened on a Saturday afternoon for everyone to cheer along to. Brendan Fraser takes the lead and is at his best when he's acting big and dumb, but, in doing so, he's also completely lovable and easy to root for. Rachel Weisz is his 'love interest' and, apart from being able to read/speak the ancient texts, doesn't do that much for the portrayal of women in cinema, as she spends much of her time in need of rescue (you'll have to watch the sequel if you want to see her kicking some a$$!). John Hannah is her on-screen brother and he's the main 'comic relief' of the film – a part which sometimes goes horribly wrong if it's handled incorrectly. However, fortunately, despite being the coward of the bunch, he's funny enough not to be annoying (and even fires a gun or two near the end if you watch closely).So, our blundering trio of heroes only go and wake up an ancient mummy when they're raiding a tomb in Egypt. And he's not happy. Not only does he want to 'borrow' the bodily parts of those who woke him up, but he also wants to take over the world – typical, huh? The creature itself is actually CGI for the most part. I guess they couldn't get an actor who was decomposing to play the part. However, when he's fully formed, he's played by Arnold Vosloo, who does the job to act menacing (even when he doesn't say a word of English).So, expect gun fights, undead creatures chasing our heroes, the odd car chase and pretty much everything else you'd come to find in a PG action/adventure movie. Yes, nothing here is that new, but when something's handled correctly that doesn't matter. It's still a fun a film that should please everyone. Basically, there are two ways of watching The Mummy – you can either nitpick the whole thing and pull it apart, or you can simply gloss over any of the plot holes and simply enjoy it from what it is – the filmic equivalent of Brendan Fraser himself – big, dumb, silly fun, fun, fun.",8,5,5,8 January 2015
Constantine," Not quite 'Hellblazer,' but still quite good fun
","In case you don't know 'Constantine' is actually based on quite a famous cult comic called 'Hellblazer,' but had its name changed when 'Hellboy' came out the year before and the film-makers were concerned with non comic book fans getting the two confused. So, Step 1 of how to alienate your core fanbase is change the name! The fan boys were not amused. They were even less amused when other changes were made to the script and story in general. It was fair to say that 'Constantine' was off to a bad start.But it's certainly not that bad. Keanu Reeves plays the titular (John) 'Constantine' – a man who's soul is damned to hell for all eternity, but hopes he can get out of the inevitable afterlife in hell by doing God's work and sending as many Earth-dwelling demons back to their fiery origins. So it's a kind of action/horror/demon/supernatural affair. It certainly has elements of all of those genres, just don't go expecting much 'horror' in this horror movie.Perhaps producers were aware that many people wouldn't recognise the franchise from its comic-based roots and decided that one way to get bums on seats would be to make it pretty tame. Yes, if you're really afraid of possessions and general monsters you may find this scary. It's hardly a kids' film, but its primary market is probably fully-grown men, many of which expect a little more gore and darkness from the big screen.Keanu Reeves is hardly known for his acting, but he does his best and for whatever he lacks in dramatic ability, he makes up for by simply being Keanu Reeves. He's instantly able to be rooted for and you don't have to be a genius to recognise that he's going to fall for Rachel Weiss' character (sporting a not-so-great American accent).So Keanu generally goes about the place, despatching one demon after another. If you squint at the screen you'll probably help yourself fail to notice how much CGI is used with each baddie he slaughters.Constantine isn't a classic. It won't be remembered in cinema's history books. However, if you're generally in the mood for a little monster-bashing (and not a die-hard fan of the comic books it's based on) then put this on. You probably also check your phone a couple of times during the run-time and still known what's going on.",7,0,0,20 April 2015
Ed Wood," The Johnny and Tim we all know and love
","Back before the public seemed to generally go off the once-bankable combination of director Tim Burton and leading man Johnny Depp, they made 'Ed Wood,' the biographical drama of the now 'infamous' Hollywood auteur of the same name. If you know your film history, you may have heard of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' largely because it has often been heralded as the 'worst film ever made.' Personally, I think that's a little unfair as Michael Bay is still alive, but it's hardly a masterpiece.It was Ed Wood himself who wrote and directed this *ahem* 'epic' which he basically blagged his way to get funded. Burton tells this story using Depp as the titular character. Who is also a cross-dresser. Did I mention that? Yes, not only does Ed Wood truly believe that he is destined to become the next Orson Wells, but he also likes wearing women's clothes. Cue Depp turning his quirky on-screen charm up to eleven.For some reason, Burton chooses to shoot the whole film in black and white. At first some may find this a little weird and jarring, yet, before long, you probably won't notice that colour has been drained, especially when the 'films within the film' start rolling and you see Wood's sci-fi flick in all its colourless glory.Yes, it's based on the real Ed Wood, but does that mean it's a true story? Well, it's as true as the next Hollywood 'true' story. A few liberties here and there have obviously been taken to further the plot, but, on the whole, it's reasonably accurate. You don't have to know much about Ed Wood or his work to enjoy this, you just have to appreciate a role that seems to have been written for Johnny Depp, who plays the man with so much wide-eyed wonder that you can't help but root for him, even if he probably hasn't got the talent to back up his ambition (but then that can be said for pretty much ever reality TV show participant ever).Depp carries the film on his own, but, besides Burton's behind-the-scenes presence shining through, it's worth mentioning the bunch of misfits Ed Wood brings along with him, all of which are allowed to have more than one moment where they shine.The real Plan 9 From Outer Space was a flop. However, it has since found an audience with the 'so-bad-it's-good' audiences, plus Burton/Depp's take on Ed Wood have furthered its reputation. You may not want to see the source material after watching this (although I did and I enjoyed – or appreciated at least – it for what it was), but the time spent with Depp and his band of freaks and desperates should keep you comically entertained with its mix of pathos and fluffy pink sweaters.",9,0,0,26 December 2016
Orphan," Proof that not ALL child actors are bad!
","I've just watched 'Orphan' for the fourth time and, as usual, I'm left pretty speechless at the performance the titular 'orphan' Esther (played by the extraordinarily-capable Isabelle Fuhrman). It's one thing to cast kids in a movie FOR kids. Children don't really pay much attention to 'acting ability' and it's up to the adults in the cinema audience to cringe and roll their eyes at what they're forced to watch. However, so many times when child actors are used in a film for an older audience, they can quite often bring down an otherwise good film. I'm so glad to say that the reverse happened here.A brief summary of the plot would be that a family (mother and father played respectively by Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) adopt a child to add to their existing two children. The girl in question is - you guessed it - Esther and, it's fair to say that they get more than they bargained for.I didn't know anything about this film before I sat down to watch and I definitely recommend you know as little as possible before seeing it. The marketing surrounding it kind of makes it look like a horror film, but, trust me, it's nothing like your standard 'hack 'n slash' affair (it's much better than that!).Maybe it was destined to be average, but Isabelle Fuhrman just elevates it to exceptional levels. I almost found it quite difficult to believe that a child could pull off such a part. It's worth watching for her alone.If you like horror/thriller films in general, you should definitely check this out. Just don't find out too much before hand.",8,1,2,20 April 2018
Terminator Salvation," Could have been so good
","Ever since Kyle Reece explained to Sarah Connor what the future would look like when the machines ruled the Earth, Terminator fans have been desperate to see more of those dark, gritty, laser-filled scenes that James Cameron dropped into the first two movies. Now, we finally get to see a whole movie showing us what the future world would look like. And it basically looks about as much as James Cameron's original vision as Christian Bale looks like Edward Furlong, not bothering to retain either the look or feel of what has gone before.'Terminator: Salvation' is the film that fans asked for, but didn't ask for the way they got it. While it was made, the Terminator himself was busy running the state of California, so couldn't really reprise his role (and don't get me started on any CGI work used to correct this – it really isn't up to the 'Rogue One' standards we're now used to). However, that's not so bad, as the story isn't just about the indestructible machine of metal, but also the Connor family, so most people were relieved that a decent actor like Christian Bale was going to be playing John Connor. Unfortunately, the film takes the weird route not to follow him, instead choosing to be mainly about Sam Worthington's character – a death-row inmate who somehow wakes up in the future and also helps trash a cyborg or two. I won't spoil too much of Worthington's character, especially as the trailer basically did that for me. However, I will say that this film would have been a damn sight better if it simply omitted his character completely. I'm not having a go at the actor. He did all he could with what he was given. It's just people weren't going to watch this film based on ANY new character – they wanted to see more of the old ones (even if they had been recast!).I could pick out various personal annoyances that I had with this film – the helicopter pilot who wears sunglasses at night, the silent child who's used as a plot device to show how caring our central characters are, or the fact that the end battle completely rips off T2 beat for beat. All of these I could have overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that 'Salvation' completely ignores various plot points that have been clearly stated in previous films. Maybe those not so 'up# on Terminator lore won't notice, but for me I found myself asking too many questions as to why things were happening this way. I know you could say that timelines got changed here and there so things are now different in the future, but, in my opinion, that's just lazy writing and a cop out.There were at least a couple of stand-outs, namely Ashton Yelchen's excellent take on how Michael Biehn portrayed Reece, Skynet City looking pretty cool and the nod to T' by playing Guns and Roses again. However, this film was almost damned before it was released as much of the publicity surrounding it was directed at Christian Bale's bizarre outburst on set at a fellow crew member.I guess that 'Terminator: Salvation' isn't as bad as I'm making out. It's an okay sci-fi/action film. However, because it has the Terminator name attached we – the fans – are just hoping for more than we got. And, if you're interested, you may want to Google it's alternate ending, as it is much darker and interesting than what we got.",7,2,3,11 December 2017
Insomnia," Nolan's 'training wheels' film
","Right now, most people know Christopher Nolan for his critically-acclaimed Batman trilogy. Others who know a little more about his work link him with some pretty intense science fiction, fantasy or generally twisted movies like Inception, The Prestige and Memento.However, before all of those classics, he did a remake of a Scandinavian film, Insomnia. I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare to that. Although, as it wasn't originally his story, he didn't have as much input on the screenplay as he normally does. It's about a couple of cops from LA (one being the strung-out Al Pacino) who come to a small town in Alaska where it doesn't get dark for six months of the year, to investigate a murdered girl. Enter Robin Williams - the main suspect and Al's nemesis.With those two acting heavyweights, you can never really say that Insomnia is a bad film. It ticks all the boxes. Everyone puts in a decent performance and I can't really see anyone who likes detective-type movies being disappointed. However, when you compare it to Nolan's other work, it does seem like a step down in quality. I can only think he prefers working on his own screenplays. Either way, don't let that put you off. It does the job and it's definitely worth a watch (as are most of Al Pacino's films!).",7,0,1,29 September 2014
X-Men," Quite good... for its time
","'X-men' was the long-awaited 'comic book to film' adaptation of the popular superheroes of the same name. For years fanboys debated who should play the iconic roles of the mutants (superheroes), therefore, when it finally came to production, casting was always going to be an issue. As a so-so fan of the source material, I can't really say how well ALL the mutants were transferred, but most of them seemed pretty faithful – most.However, what let it down for me was the fact that it's called 'X-men' – i.e. plural. There are numerous mutants – some fighting for the noble Charles Xavier (the X-men themselves) and those fighting for the dastardly Magneto, known as the 'Brotherhood.' Therefore, because there are multiple stars in a ninety minute movie, you can't really give them all the screen time they deserve. 'Wolverine' (Hugh Jackman) is arguably the fans' favourite, so he gets much of the screen time. The others are just kind of there for him to bounce off of.Basically, it's good superheroes versus bad superheroes. So if you generally like your superhero movies then you should get something out of this.Of course it was made a fair few years before 'Marvel' superhero movies really took off, therefore it does feel a little dated compared to today's modern Thor, Iron Man and Avengers films.I have my own grips with X-men – I never approved as Sir Ian McKellen as the villain 'Magneto.' I always thought the baddie should have the body of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the face/temperament of Al Pacino's Scarface. Having an 'English nobleman' as the supervillian just didn't seem to work for me – he wasn't physically intimidating for me (sorry, Sir Ian!).But, overall, most people liked it and it spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs. I can watch it every now and again. It's not too long and it fills a void if I'm in the mood for something light.",7,0,0,25 May 2015
Thor: Ragnarok," There is no justice in the film industry
","As little as ten years ago, if you were to ask the average film-goer which film they would think would be better out of the third instalment of a lesser known Marvel comic book star, aka Thor, or the first outing for DC's 'Justice League' featuring some of the biggest comic book names in superheroes ever created, ala Batman and Superman. I'm guessing most wouldn't ever have heard of a Norse god when compared to Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent. However, in late 2017 'Thor (part 3): Ragnarok' was released a few weeks before 'Justice League' and completely sunk all hope for Batman and co at setting the Box Office alight in terms of superhero-related movies.I know there's quite a heated debate between the Marvel and DC community, but I like to think of myself as one of the 'neutrals.' Batman is probably my favourite superhero, so I was hoping beyond hope that Justice League would live up to its potential. I even saw it before Thor: Ragnarok and thought it was pretty good. However, when I then went and watched Thor, I kind of realised why Justice League was flagging.I can think of a handful of 'elite; sequels that surpass the original, but they're the minority (Aliens, T2, Empire Strikes Back and so on), but I can't quite recall any third instalments that blow both predecessors completely out of the water. In shortÂ… Thor: Ragnarok is epic. It feels like it's been given a much bigger budget and the freedom to really have some fun with the characters. I think it's the general consensus that it's the 'funniest' of all the Marvel cinematic universe films to date. It never really takes itself too seriously and is all the better for it. You really get the feeling that the cast were generally having a laugh while they were doing this. All the old faces you'd expect from the previous Thor outings return, i.e. Anthony Hopkins, Thor's mates (all of which names escape me right now!) and, most importantly, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. It's kind of a thing that Marvel doesn't really know how to do its villains too well and most people feel that Loki has been the one and only highlight of the enemies the Avengers have had to face. Therefore, Ragnarok plays on this perfectly and beefs up his screen time even more than ever. That's not to say that Cate Blanchett isn't good too as 'Hela.' In fact, she actually has some decent lines and we may be witnessing the film with both the best and second best villains in at the same time!However, no matter how good the supporting case is, the film is called 'Thor' after all and it wouldn't be anything without Chris Hemsworth's (disgustingly perfect) shoulders to rest on. He has really settled into the character and his interaction bounces off characters new and old alike. There's only a small amount of new faces added to the film, but they feel like they've been there all along. And, without getting back into the Thor versus Justice League debate again, the fact that these new characters seem so easy to relate to compared to JL's characters who feel like they've been crowbarred in just to add to the 'hero-weight' â€“ just shows how well-written Thor is.As much as I wanted to enjoy Justice League more, I just couldn't. Thor was simply too much fun, much more action-packed, wonderfully light-hearted and literally a more colourful film to watch. If I had to pick a fault I'd say that the CGI still looked a little fake in all of the newly-built worlds, but the fun you can have with this mammoth of a popcorn movie more than made up for that.I'm not saying that I haven't enjoyed Marvel's previous output, but I really hope they make more like this. Oh, and did I mention the electro music is awesome as well?",9,1,6,28 November 2017
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident Evil jumps the shark
","The first Resident Evil will always be remembered as helping to reignite the 'zombie genre.' Its sequel wasn't as well received (but I liked it, as it was the first zombie film that dealt with the 'middle stage' of an undead outbreak, i.e. not the start of it and not the desolation it eventually causes, but the panic as it slowly takes over).There's no arguing that writer/director Paul W S Anderson had direct a stylish movie, filled with classy action scenes and blazing guns. However, just because something is stylish, doesn't mean it's that good. By the third outing, I was hoping for something a little more than Milla Jovovich just shooting and kicking hordes of zombies (and dogs... always dogs). Unfortunately, that's all this is - one shooting/kicking/knifing zombie scene after the next.What makes it worst is the baddies - they're almost too comically bad to be believable. They all seem to come from the 'Monty Burns School of Villains.' They're so evil, they wear sunglasses indoors and wilfully sacrifice scores of their henchmen without batting an eyelid. They should be in an Austin Powers movie, or something a little more tongue-in-cheek. However, the Resident Evil films are dead serious and the baddies just make me laugh (almost as much as the truckload of zombies which can fit a thousand of them in a simply trailer - watch the Las Vegas scene to see what I'm talking about).Sadly, even with all its flaws, the third Resident Evil film is actually better than its successors - films 4 and 5 are even worse (or as completely identical, making them all just blur into one).Unless you're a die hard fan of the franchise, I'd just stick to films 1 and 2 - either that or you can never have enough of seeing Milla perform one flying roundhouse kick after the next in slow motion.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,0,2,9 September 2014
A Bridge Too Far," One of the best accounts of a military failure ever
","'A Bridge Too Far' was never a blistering success at the box office when it was originally released in 1977. People felt that World War II films were a little 'old hat' by then, so there wasn't as much interest in it as there possible could have been if it was released a couple of decades earlier.Plus, when the history textbooks are studied, you hear a lot about the D-Day landings, the Battle of Britain and so forth. However, 'Operation Market-Garden' rarely gets a mention. It was an audacious plan by the Allies to take four bridges in only a few days time in the middle of German-held Europe, thus ensuring a vital route of supplies is maintained to the Allied forces fighting on the frontline.A plan of this magnitude and intricacy could only be done justice on an epic scale. And, to the film's credit, it does just that. It has a stellar ensemble cast, including such greats as Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins and Michael Caine, all of which play different Allied military personnel at various points of the mission.Without wishing to give too much away, perhaps one aspect of the film's success may be down to the fact that the 'goodies' don't necessarily win. It's unlikely that most of us would appreciate a World War II film where the Germans come out on top, however, history was not kind to Operation Market-Garden. It went ahead and, in one Allied General's own words 'Was over 90% successful.' Unfortunately, a catalogue of errors – some manmade and others beyond the Allies' control – contributed to it being labelled one of the biggest mission failures of the latter half of the war.If you like your war films, you should love this. It's big, powerful and doesn't pull many punches when it shows the horror of what soldiers on all sides went through. You need to be okay with ensemble casts. There could probably be a film made about every character featured in this film. But there isn't enough time for that, so we do have to sacrifice a little character development in favour of condensing the mission down into a watchable viewing.'Saving Private Ryan' may have a better budget, but A Bridge Too Far has a raw, epic feel that really makes it come across like a history lesson which more battles and stars.",9,7,9,8 November 2014
The Prestige," Abracadabra!
","The Prestige' tells the tale of two rival magicians at the turn of last century who constantly try to outdo each other at every turn. The premise may sound a little so-so, but, trust me, the finished product is anything but. It's magic. First of all it's a Christopher Nolan film - a writer/director who is one of the most respected and profitable working today. But, no matter how well he does in the director's chair, it's the cast who make it what it is.I know that the term 'assemble cast' is normally associated with films like 'The Avengers' where every major character is a star in their own right, but 'The Prestige' isn't far off attaining this label. The two magicians in question are played by Christian 'Batman' Bale and Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman and, obviously, the film focuses in on them. However, there's plenty of extra acting talent supporting their personal grievances with each other, namely Michael Caine, David Bowie, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall - all of which play their parts to perfection no matter how much screen time they're given.It's really a story about obsession - how two men start off as friends, but, through a string of unfortunate events (and the desire never to share a stage and be 'the best' in their own rights!) they dedicate their lives to outdo each other, no matter how much it costs them. There's a fair amount of tragedy to the tale as both men suffer blows to their personal life in pursuit of their quests for revenge (and to introduce the perfect magic trick to their audiences) and you can't help but feel for them on more than one occasion.I really would recommend 'The Prestige' to anyone wanting to watch a truly great modern classic. However, if I was to try and find a few flaws in it, I'd probably warn people that it's hardly fast-paced and quite long compared to the average ninety minute runtime. Plus the story does bounce around in time, meaning you'll see the end first and find yourself having the middle narrated by one character, before popping back to the beginning and finding a different member of the cast telling you what's happening. It does work, but it will force you to concentrate on what time period you're watching (check your phone at your peril and you may run the risk of becoming totally confused!).However, perhaps my personal only gripe with the film was that all the way through I thought it was based in reality. The magicians are just that - tricksters like any other stage show act you'd see today. However, without straying into 'spoiler territory' I have to warn you that this film's genre ends up being 'science fiction.' But, if you know what you're watching you should really get quite a lot out of this film on many levels.",9,2,3,13 August 2018
The Terminator," Often imitated, never bettered (apart from T2 perhaps)
","The term 'pulp sci-fi' might have well been invented for The Terminator. Originally, it was a little-known sci-fi action film with equally little-known stars. However, it just happened to strike a chord with audiences and catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to super-stardom and writer/director James Cameron to become one of the most powerful men behind the camera in Hollywood.It's easy to say that The Terminator would be best enjoyed by men and those who are well into their science fiction. However, perhaps one of The Terminator's major plus points, is that it seems to appeal to almost everyone who likes a decent film. Maybe it's to do with it having a well-acted leading lady who the female audience can identify with, but there are few people out there who haven't seen this film.In case you don't know... an indestructible cyborg is sent back through time from a world where machines have all but wiped out humanity. His mission is to kill the mother of the only man who will oppose the machines' rule in the future, Sarah Connor. Now, ordinarily, she probably wouldn't stand a chance against such a killer, but, luckily for her (and humanity) the humans of the future have sent back their best soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect her. And so ensure a cat and mouse game of chase where the two humans are constantly on the run from the relentless killer robot.Like I say... it would be easy to just say watch this if you like dark sci-fi/action. However, if you like film and generally good films, this one's only just over an hour and a half and you only have to read the other reviews to see that I'm not the only one who regards it as a classic.It's possibly the perfect action movie for adults and - amazingly - it possesses one other (almost) unique trait in the film industry - it has a sequel which (most people believe) surpasses it. If you like The Terminator (and most do) then you should check out its sequel, imaginatively titled Terminator 2. Bother are classics. Part 3 and 4 maybe go a little downhill, but, trust me, 1 and 2 have to be seen.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10,1,2,8 August 2014
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," What should have been the 'middle chapter'
","Those nasty Nazis only tried to resurrect a demon to help them win WWII! Lucky we - the Allies - put a stop to that, but figured the demon in question was only a nipper, so we might as well keep him and get him to help us out instead! So goes the basic plot of 'Hellboy' - a superhero movie that came along sort of before this major superhero trend became so popular.Despite not everyone clamouring to see it (let's face it... the promotional posters of a red demon sporting an oversize claw and pistol hardly made it as 'family-friendly' as 'Spiderman!'), but it certain did well enough to deserve a sequel.The titular 'Hellboy' is played by (self-confessed) 'grumpy old man' Ron Perlman whose natural (grumpy) charisma shines through and brings this reluctant anti-hero to life. Familiar faces from the first outing also return to help out our demonic saviour including Selma Blair, Doug Jones and John Hurt and, although they all play their roles well, it's Perlman whose big red face steals every scene. So, Hellboy goes about his 'normal' business of saving us humans from those things that go bump in the night and there's as much action and hideous monsters as you may expect. However, before you write it off completely as just another action movie, it's worth mentioning that visionary director Guillermo del Toro is at the helm and his natural flair for visuals shines through and brings the world to life.Of course there are plenty of computer-generated special effects, but there's also more 'practical' effects on show here (most likely del Toro's influence, based on his previous body of work) and it's nice to see that models, masks and sets can still be used to great and very effective use when building a fantastical world like this.Creator of 'Family Guy' Seth Macfarlane pops up for some moments of levity (or rather his voice does) as a friendly German spook whose misty form can inhabit various metal bodies, but if the film has a weakness then it's something that the Marvel films would later suffer from - the villain. We have Luke Goss thrown in there as the new baddie - an elf with a grudge against humanity. Yes, he looks suitably evil and is pretty deadly, but he feels a little 'generic' when compared to everything else around him that's so much above average.'Hellboy 2' is certainly worth a watch, whether you're into superhero films or not. It's just a shame that del Toro and Perlman never got the third instalment they were so desperately pushing for. I hear there's a 'reboot' on the horizon. I'm sure it will be okay, but it's going to have to be VERY okay to beat either of the existing 'Hellboy' movies.",9,0,0,6 September 2018
Silent Hill," A film that's TOO based on a video game
","Ever since 'Super Mario Bros,' films that have been adapted from video games have faced harsh criticism from cinema goers (and even more scorn from the critics!). 'Silent Hill' was a game with more 'plot' than Mario, so at least there's more to work with when it comes to trying to create a coherent story for the big screen. Unfortunately, whereas Mario was critisied for straying away from the source material, 'Silent Hill' sticks to it a little too much (for my liking at least).The game features a town that's filled with monsters and a hero that has to navigate their way through it. And, without wishing to indulge in 'spoilers,' that's basically the first hour of the movie. A couple (Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean) have adopted a young girl (Jodelle Ferland), only for her to go missing in - you guessed it - the cut-off town of Silent Hill. Mitchell visits the location first and spends basically an hour moving from one spooky location to the next, crying her daughter's name and then getting chased on to the next set-piece by some slavering computer-generated beast or other. Later, when Bean arrives there, he repeatedly shouts his wife's name over and over again.You may be able to tell from my tone that I wasn't that taken with the film. I found it very long (nearly two hours), a bit predictable in terms of plot and very repetitive. However, there are definitely some plus points, too. The casting is good. I've already mentioned Mitchell and Bean, but there's also Laurie Holden in a pre 'Walking Dead' role and Alice Krige. Plus the special effects are quite gruesome. Yes, the film doesn't have a perfect budget when it comes to CGI monsters and a lot of the time you can tell they've been added on in post production, but it does do a good job of creating a bleak and fearful atmosphere.It's not a bad film overall, just one that you seriously have to be ready to invest two hours of your life in (or be a mega fan of the game, I guess). Fair play to the film-makers for trying to stick ardently to the source material, but whereas with many films a 'director's cut' may add more scenes and give a better idea of the original vision, this is one film that would benefit from having a few scenes taken out of it to move the pace along, as (certainly the first half) feels a little like they're retreading the same old ground again and again. I wanted to press the 'START' button and skip these 'cut-scenes.'",5,1,2,19 November 2019
Ready Player One," A future family favourite
","Growing up in the eighties, there were plenty of movies which I watched with my friends and an assortment of parents. These began at the cinema and gradually found their way to the small screen where we continued to enjoy them on those lazy Sunday afternoons we all had during our childhoods. Now, several years later we look back on those films with a sense of nostalgia. Now we can see they're not perfect, but we love them anyway.'Ready Player One' is like that and, perhaps more importantly, will be like that. As an adult, I can say that it's far from a perfect film, but there are undoubtedly millions of youngsters all over the world who would disagree with me and tell you that it's the best film ever made. And it probably is to them. To me, it's a fun little outing that I enjoyed, despite its flaws.Stephen Spielberg is possibly also enjoying this resurgence of nostalgia, as he seems to have gone back to his hey-day and given us a family-friendly adventure-romp with a more modern day spin. It's set in a broken world where the population practically lives in a virtual reality-style world called 'The Oasis.' It's basically like the internet meets VR. However, one large corporation wants total dominance over this cyber world and will stop at nothing to achieve this. Lucky we have some plucky youngsters on hand to thwart these terrible 'suits.'The VR world naturally lends itself to some fantastic visuals and, for once, it's impossible to complain about the overuse of computer-effects because 75% of the movie is set inside a computer simulation. The youth of today will enjoy watching their peers 'stick it to the man,' but there's also plenty of things to enjoy for us 'oldies.' This film possibly contains the most 'pop culture' references from yesteryear since that episode of South Park called 'Imaginationland.' You can't go more than thirty seconds without spotting a reference to things you loved from the seventies, eighties and nineties. The young cast do well. Sometimes, when a film rests heavily on inexperienced actors' shoulders, it can sometimes fail, but I didn't find any of them annoying. The only flaw I really saw was that it's a bit drawn out in some places. I would have cut about ten minutes out of the middle section and then massively edited the ending by about fifteen minutes (it's one of those films that has - what you think is - an ending, only for it to start up again. And again).But that's a minor gripe. I will be buying it on DVD and doing my best to spot yet even more references to my childhood (watch various YouTube videos to find out the full list of everything in there), but I may skip the odd chapter here and there - especially towards the end!)",8,0,2,4 April 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Spectacles Paperwork Meetings Suits
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is slow. Sometimes that's a bad thing, but, on this occasion, it's deliberately so. It takes some of the best British actors (and Colin Firth) and uses them subtly as spies and spy-catchers in an interweaving spy story. I might use the word 'thriller' to describe it, but I don't think it's meant to be particularly thrilling.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not James Bond. It makes no bones about that. Don't expect car chases or Bond girls (the best you get there is Kathy Burke!). Instead, you have a more realistic portrayal of spies in the midst of Cold War Britain, showing us the 'old boys' network that lurks among the corridors of power in British politics.If you like your mysteries deep and your performances intense then this is the film for you. It's already received rave reviews and award nominations for its cast. Basically, you're looking at either a 4/5 rating of even a 5/5.Sadly, I'm a philistine and I crave noisy explosions, exotic locations and bikini-clad lovelies collecting shells on sandy beaches. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy bored the hell out of me and I turned it off on about the hour mark. I just got sick of men in glasses and suits walking in and out of rooms to talk to someone or pick up some paperwork.Many people will love this film. Fair play to them - they're probably right. It just wasn't for me. All I was left with was a gasping craving for a Vodka-Martini and a sports car that drove underwater.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5,1,4,13 May 2014
The Hateful Eight," Almost more of a film of 'two halves' than Kill Bill
","Film-lore goes that Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' was running so long that the studio took it upon itself to split it in two, hence giving us parts 1 and 2. That was probably true, but I get the feeling that the same could have been applied to Tarantino's latest offering The Hateful Eight.' However, perhaps one reason this never happened was because no one ever bother watching the first half! As much as I do love Tarantino's work, I do sometimes think that portions of his various epics can be a little 'overblown' and wordy for the sake of it. I know that good dialogue establishes character motivation and development. But then if it's done too much then I start fiddling with my phone until it's over. I felt that this was the case for the first half. We're treated to one long dialogue-heavy scene after the next. Yes, they're well-acted and everything, but I have to confess that my attention started to wander. We're introduced to the eight (all-star!) cast members who are all assorted Wild West types destined to get trapped together in an out-of-the-way wooden house by a blizzard. And, once they're stuck with each other's company, they don't just rely on their sharp tongues to spar with each other – they have guns, too.Samuel L Jackson's (arguably) breakout role came in Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' and, although he's never had a quiet day since, he has occasionally struggled to be quite as formidable his former hit-man. Not here. The coolest dude in Hollywood is back with a vengeance. Despite great performances from Tarantino 'stalwarts' Michael Madson, Kurt Russel, Janet Jason Leigh, the wonderful Tim Roth (and even Channing Tatum!), it's Jackson who steals every scene. Although Walton Goggins does deserve a mention – I just can't remember him in anything else.I did enjoy The Hateful Eight, just more the second half. It's where everything comes together. I won't go into the hows and whys of everything and who's going to double-cross who as that will run into 'spoiler territory' but when the bullets do start flying it is a welcome relief from the constant dialogue.Overall, I'd describe The Hateful Eight as a longer version of Reservoir Dogs set in the Wild West. It's basically a violent, claustrophobic little number with much dialogue and plenty of characters stabbing each other (or rather shooting to be precise) in the back for reasons that only eventually become apparent. Just don't zone out too much in the first half – the second act more than makes up for the talking (although Reservoir Dogs did have a better soundtrack in my opinion!). Just get ready for yet more bad language and blood splattering across your screen!",8,0,4,8 March 2017
"I, Tonya"," Harley does figure skating
","I know it's really bad to typecast an actor, but all the way through 'I, Tonya' I couldn't help but see Harley Quinn from the -debatably-popular - 'Suicide Squad' wielding her baseball bat all the way through. However, don't take that as a negative. Whether the cinema-going public loved or loathed DC's villain ensemble, most seemed to agree that Margot Robbie was a stand-out point.Back in the early nineties I remember hearing about the story 'I, Tonya' was based on, but never really knowing too much about it, i.e. an American Olympic figure skater was so determined to win the gold medal that she had a rival on her own team beaten up. Now, upon watching that brief summary stretched out into a two-hour movie, I'm still little clearer about the details of the event, but then I think that's the point. Many stories that are based on real life (or 'inspired by true events' as seems to be the popular phrase these days) are debateable as to how true they really are. However, right from the beginning, this film states in some opening text that it's based on multiple versions of many unbelievable events. I liked that. Not only does it suggest that what you hear is subjective, but it also sets the tone of the movie.Once the 'characters' have been introduced, the story progresses and, quite often, we see different versions of the same event - as seen by the different person who witnessed it/is telling that portion of the story. I know I mentioned that Margot Robbie gives off a real 'Harley Quinn' vibe, but it works. I hope she's not actually going to just get typecast as the - borderline nutty - woman of the big screen, as I'm sure she can play numerous roles. However, in this case, I dose of 'Daddy's Little Monster' is just the ticket and she steals every scene she's in. And she has to work for that accolade, as the supporting cast all do their best to upstage her. There wasn't a single bad performance in this movie and it was a real treat to watch.I'm not sure how much actual skating Margot Robbie did and how much is some form of CGI trickery. I did my best to stare intently to see if I could pick out anything that would give the effects away and either my eyesight isn't that good, or the CGI was just better, as it looks like she's on the ice the whole time.I don't know how true to what really happened this film is, but I do know it's great entertainment and has a great cast on display. Special mention to Allison Janney, who plays possibly the worst on-screen mother since poor Carrie White's single parent! Only after I'd seen this film did I understand that one marketing quote was something along the lines of 'The Goodfellas of ice skating.' I'm not sure I saw the similarities, but I would say it's an epic tale that's definitely worth watching. It's like Harley Quinn gave up crime, became a figure skater and then took up crime again (maybe!).",9,1,1,27 February 2018
Molly's Game," Game on!
","'Molly's Game' is one of those 'based on a true story' films where you never really know quite how much has been based on true events and what's been added to make it a better story. However, whatever the split, I quickly found I was able to suspend my scepticism and just enjoy the film for its entertainment value.Jessica Chastain plays the titular 'Molly' - a professional skier involved in a freak accident on the slopes at a young age. Then, and this is one of those moments where something is so unbelievable it is probably totally true, she changes her career and becomes host to exclusive high-stakes poker games for the rich and famous. Yes, there is a bit of a leap there, but, don't worry, it's not quite so glossed over in the film.The story itself is one of those than bounces around through time. One moment you're with the adult Molly who's standing trial for taking back-handers at the table, the next you're with her teenage incarnation who's in the middle of a row with her - slightly overbearing - father, played by Kevin Costner. However, that's not as jarring as it sounds and you shouldn't be confused as to what time period you're in. However, because of this way of telling the story, you're - sort of - told how it ends near the beginning, but, again, there's enough intrigue to make you keep watching.Plus, of course, Molly's lawyer is played by Idris Elba, who, of late, I felt hasn't been getting the 'meaty' roles he deserves. Well, he's not in it as much as fans may like (being that he's only in the 'present' and never in her past), but when he is there he does what he does best and steals the spotlight.Then you have the direction - it's possibly more stylish than your average biographic drama is used to. It comes across as something between a Guy Ritchie film and 'Ocean's Eleven.' But then it is - technically - a crime caper, albeit a 'real life' one, so perhaps the style of direction is fitting. It works either way. It's over two hours long, but never really feels as long as it could do. You'll find yourself rooting for the characters and maybe even trying to Google who the mysterious 'Player X' really is. I have my ideas.",8,0,2,7 January 2018
Crash," As contrived as it is a classic
","'Crash' is about the tensions between various races in Los Angeles. Yes, hardly a topic for a light-hearted romp through the city. You'll probably have to be in the mood for something a lot darker (and at times poignant) which will make you think (just don't think too hard... but I'll get to that).The first thing you'll notice is the wide range of A-list actors on display here. Yes, it's one of those 'ensemble' casts and even those who don't have their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are definitely also 'recognisable faces' meaning that even those who don't have quite as much screen time as the major stars are all capable of turning in a strong performance.Sandra Bullock may be the 'biggest' star on the cast list, but, in my opinion, it's Matt Dillon who steals the show. What you get is a selection of random - some average, some more privileged - people in L.A. whose lives are all due to 'crash' into each other in one way or another. Yes, that's where the title comes from, but, just in case you miss this meaning, there are also at least a couple of literal car crashes in there as well!Personally, I loved the film. It shows good and bad people of many different races and gives you a bit of a 'whistle-stop' tour of what it's like to be them. You could be expecting one hell of an epic film with so many people on the cast list. Surprisingly, it's not overly-long and, although this is good that it never drags, many of the characters never really get 'fleshed out' as they probably could have done (had this be made today and given its own Netflix TV series, or something).I don't see that as a gripe, but those who didn't enjoy 'Crash' as much as me do tend to dwell on how it's all a little too contrived. They ask, 'Would all these life-changing events really happen in such a short space of time?' The answer: probably not. But who cares? Do we stop watching 'Eastenders' because too much happens in such a small area?It's a film. It's making a point - and quite a brave one. It shows that no one race is all good and always right, possessing the 'correct' way to live their lives. We all have flaws and we all have people of our own 'kind' who are good and bad. I remember it even won some awards when it was first released. I agreed with that decision, but I also recall people disagreeing. However, if you want to see something that is as dark and tragic as it is funny and poignant then definitely give 'Crash' a go.",9,3,3,25 December 2019
Snatch," Lock stock and a much more A-list cast
","It's widely regarded that Guy Ritchie's first film, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is pretty much a classic modern British gangster film. Therefore, much was riding on the – er – 'sequel', simply titled 'Snatch.' Now, first of all, it's not a sequel, although some people may think it felt like one.Alternatively, if you're feeling even less charitable, you could even call it a 'remake' (or 'soft reboot' as has been used post 'The Force Awakens'). Because, even die-hard fans (of which I confess to being one) have to admit that it's basically the same story as Lock Stock, with basically the same characters, shot in basically the same style. Only with Brad Pitt thrown in there (and he's awesome).So, despite a fair amount of cynicism associated with Snatch, it's actually pretty damn good. Yes, it is a slight copy of Lock Stock, but, when a film was so perfect as Lock Stock, it's difficult to hate anything that replicates it so well. To use another term, Snatch feels like it's set in a 'shared universe' (only with gangsters instead of Robert Downey Jr).The characters, despite most being copies of its filmic predecessor, are still pretty memorable – despite Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham playing almost the same roles as before and the evil mob boss not really straying far from type, we also get a trio of hapless pawn store owners, a Russian hit man who just won't die and Brad Pitt. Did I mention he's in it? Brad Pitt is the standout for me. Too many times he's been written off as a pretty face only, but (as with 'Kalifornia') he proves that he's as good at acting as he is looking (and I sort of hate him for that, but still...). He steals every scene he's in as the hard-as-nails gypsy bare-knuckle boxer and has everything from the mannerisms to the accent down perfectly.If you like gangster films of any nationality then you have to watch Snatch. Yes, it may not be quite as original as Lock Stock, but it's still worth a place in anyone's DVD collection.Pity about 'Revolver' though. Don't know what happened there.",10,2,4,4 January 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Where we all wanted him to be
","Everyone seemed to like the Tobey Maguire 'Spiderman' trilogy (although less said about 'Part III' the better), some people were okay with the Andrew Garfield reboot, but then all five films came along before Marvel's 'shared universe' really kicked off. As soon as it became 'the norm' to see Captain America crossing over with Iron Man, Thor and the like, everyone wanted to see their favourite web-slinger swinging alongside them. However, it seemed that there was one force more powerful than a thousand Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Thanos - studio film rights. Sony held the rights to Spiderman, rather than Disney, so, after much wrangling, it was decided that Sony would allow Disney to include him into their 'shared universe' (hence creating the 'Homecoming' part of the title). And the result is pretty good.At least the film-makers were aware that, seeing as we've already had two 'origin stories' in a matter of years, most of us are already aware of how teenager Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider and it gave him superpowers (plus he had a kind of extended cameo in 'Captain America: Civil War' to remind us all of his roots). So they don't waste any time with how he came to be and we join him already 'webbing' local muggers around his home city of New York.
I think out of all the Marvel films in this current batch, 'Spiderman Homecoming' seems the most designed 'for kids.' It's predominantly about teenagers and I would say its primary audience would be pre-teens. That could be a criticism, if it wasn't for the fact that it's one of those rare filmic beasts that can also be enjoyed by adults, whether you're heavily into the MCU or just casually aware of it.It's worth noting that if there's one weak point the MCU has, it's lack of decent villains (excluding Loki and Thanos, of course). Therefore, not only do they get (former awesome Batman himself) Michael Keaton as the villain, but they give him some half decent motivation for his actions - he was a contractor employed by New York council to clear up the debris left by the alien attack which the Avengers thwarted, only for him to lose the deal after investing heavily in it. This makes him no fan of Iron Man and co! Now Spidey has a feeling that he's about to start selling weapons based on alien tech to the highest bidder, regardless of the cost to human life.Of course, having Spidey in the Marvel universe wouldn't be worth doing unless we could have some decent cameos from other superheroes and who better to add in than everyone's favourite billionaire, Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Naturally, Robert Downey Jr is excellent, even in small doses, but, more importantly, adds a much-needed sense of a 'bigger world' at work for Peter Parker to exist in. And who doesn't like seeing Iron Man and Spiderman teaming up to fight side by side? Tony Stark also acts as a kind of mentor/Uncle Ben figure to our young hero, further helping to do away with repeated backstory.There's obviously a great deal of special effects needed to show the destruction caused by flying fighters and teenagers swinging all over well-known monuments, so expect plenty of CGI. However, it's certainly improved a lot since the first Sam Rami Spiderman movie where the effects looked more like cut scenes from a Playstation game. Here, much of Spidey's movements almost look natural (almost, I'm being generally forgiving).Overall, 'Spiderman Homecoming' is a worthwhile addition to the MCU. It's certainly the most 'happy go lucky' of all the colourful films and hopefully Sony will release some of Spidey's other characters who they also own the rights to.",7,0,1,1 October 2018
The Expendables," Enjoyed and disappointed in this movie all in one
","Maybe I enjoyed action movies in the eighties and nineties too much. Basically, when I heard that this film was being made, I expected it to be the greatest action movie of all time. I mean... how could it possibly be anything else, based on the star-power included in the package? However, by the time the credits rolled, I was left with a sense of 'oh, was that it?' Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film immensely. It's about a team of unstoppable mercenaries who have to overthrow a fictional South American dictatorship which is secretly being funded by a rogue CIA operative. It was all good; I just expected more.It's not that long and the action scenes, although they come thick and fast, were nothing that I hadn't seen a hundred times before.I read somewhere that The Expendables was a 'homage' to action movies of the eighties. I can see how that applies. The film feels right at home in the eighties, i.e. a time before inflated studio budgets and when all 'action' was were big musclemen shooting a thousand faceless baddie troops. I suppose I expected modern day action scenes that were so big that I'd never seen anything like them before.I've now watched The Expendables twice. I actually enjoyed it more the second time around because my expectations were lowered. Plus I've since seen the sequel (the imaginatively titled Expendables 2) which, in my opinion, is what the first film should have been.If you like action movies, or are a fan of any of the many action heroes contained within, you'll probably enjoy this film. Just don't expect anything too new (and make sure you watch the sequel!). Stallone will be back (or is that Arnie?).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,0,9 September 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," A classic fantasy film (in some people's opinion)
","Personally, I loved 'Pan's Labyrinth,' so much so I recommended it to my friend (who's also well into fantasy films). His verdict: it was a war film. To be fair... he had a point. It's set in the dying days of World War II in fascist Spain where the ruling powers are hunting down any rebels who still believe in democracy. Amidst all this is a young girl whose mother has married the Captain of the fascist troops. And, having moved to his home/woodland base, starts to meet all sorts of weird and wonderful visitors.Yes, it has the 'feel' of a war movie. You have the uniforms, the period in time and the soldiers fighting it out. However, if you can't see the 'fantasy' elements then you're obviously as blind as my friend!When it comes, it comes. I will admit to the fact that most of the film is very 'period,' but when the fantasy elements appear on screen, they're really pretty spectacular. The sets and magical characters have been brilliantly designed and create a great counterbalance to the more mundane setting of 'real life.' Also, I should mention that – in case you didn't know – the film is Spanish, so you'll have to put up with the subtitles. But, if you're okay with that and generally like fantasy epics (with more than a healthy dose of good old-fashioned fairy tales) then you should love this. It really is a classic. Enjoy it before it gets remake by Hollywood (please no!).",9,2,6,14 October 2014
Blade II," Am I the only one who thought this was better than the original?
","I remember when Blade II came out - everyone was saying how much better it was than its predecessor (that's not saying the original was bad - it was excellent, too). However, now I look at the other reviews, I see many pretty scathing appraisals of the film, so I thought I'd readdress the balance.Blade II makes the bold decision to team the titular character up with those he has sworn to destroy - namely vampires - in order to hunt a new super strain of the undead who plans on feeding on both humans and vampires.What follows are some pretty good action and fight scenes against a race of monsters who are well-designed enough to actually be pretty horrific. Besides some of the non-English speaking actors (who's lines are purely understood with the aid of subtitles) all the cast play their parts well. Wesley Snipes finds it easy to keep going as the half-vampire, Blade, but Ron Perlham deserves a special mention for generally being nasty to Blade and getting away with it (or does he?).A good sequel should offer the same and more. Blade II does this. It's easily recognisable as a Blade film, yet takes the story in a fresh direction to the original, meaning it isn't simply a rehash of old ideas. I would rank it alongside other such great sequels as Terminator 2 and Aliens. It's just a shame they couldn't repeat the magic with what followed: Blade Trinity (but that's another - sad -story).",9,1,13,15 November 2014
Alien," The film that started it all
","I'm writing this review not because I think 'Alien' needs another 5* review, but because I read a post on an internet message board by someone saying, 'I can't believe this piece of junk is considered scary!' So, I re-watched Alien, trying to see if I could see where this poster was coming from. I guess there are now two types of viewers. The first - like me - grew up on Alien in the late seventies/early eighties, where it was one of the most ahead of its time films ever made. It started off the whole 'monster-munching' movie genre, where a lone creature stalks and eliminates a team/crew/whatever one by one. There have been countless B-movies made since its release in 1979 which have tried - unsuccessfully - recapture its look, feel and financial viability, but pretty much all have failed.Then you have the new generation - those who have grown up with 'Avatar' as the 'normal' quality of film. It's fair to say that Avatar is a vastly superior film to Alien, but only because it has the budget etc. If you're used to seeing thousands of alien creatures fighting over a mystical landscape, watching a single creature (which, as some times, comes across very much as a bloke in a suit) jump out of the darkness about five times in two hours, comes as a bit of a let-down.However, when it comes to purity, Alien will beat pretty much every movie ever made (even its highly-regarded successor, 'Aliens,' which - although also excellent, is not as pure as the original, as it blends genres more).If you know Alien and generally appreciate horror and/or science-fiction, you'll probably already love it. However, if you're new to the genre and primarily are used to modern filming techniques, you may have to put yourself in the place of the audiences back in 1979, who had never seen such a claustrophobic and tense piece of horror.The xenomorph itself, now looking a little dated (in my opinion the dragon-thing at the end of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland looked more horrific!) may not cut it compared with modern special effects, but - again - it was way ahead of its time. Alien will stand the test of (cinematic) time. Film history will always have a place of it (and Aliens), just don't go thinking that films have always been made the way Avatar and Lord of the Rings have.",10,7,13,28 September 2014
Horrible Bosses," How would you kill yours?
","How has this movie never been made before? With all the horrible bosses in the world and all the employees wanting to dismember them, surely someone should have committed it to film by now! Basically, the story follows three downtrodden employees working for three horrible bosses (Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell and Jenifer Aniston - who, if you're a man, does not count as a 'horrible' boss and would relish the chance to work alongside her in her dental practice - amen to that.) One night they decide they've had enough and that the only way to go through with it is to murder their tormentors.The three bosses manage to steal every scene they're in, but the three employees do well on their own. This is a great film to unwind to. Sure, you can probably pick out a few plot holes and the humour is dependent on how bigger pinch of salt you take with this whole movie, but I loved it anyway (and that goes double for Ms Aniston) and has given me plenty of food for thought with regards to how I can work my way up the career ladder.Short and sweet - simply great fun.",8,0,1,2 January 2015
Black Mass," Wigs won't cut it
","I know there's a fair school of through that says Johnny Depp's star has waned over recent years, but I was surprised that I'd never heard of 'Black Mass' until it was on sale on DVD. It sounded pretty good - a true life tale of how a gangster turned Government informer, plus it had a stellar cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon and that creepy guy out of 'Breaking Bad' who looks a bit like Matt Damon. However, when I started watching it, I soon realised why it never really set the Box Office alight.It's dull. That's it. This is going to be a pretty short review. There's really not that much I can say about it. It's just boring. I suppose I've watched a lot of these gritty true-life gangster/snitch films in my time, therefore I couldn't see anything new here. However, I really do think that anyone fresh to the genre would find this a little slow and hard going. It may have a decent cast, but that almost becomes a problem. The film bounces around from actor to actor and from present to past and feels completely disjointed, like each scene doesn't really relate to the one that's gone before. Then, because every scene doesn't feel like it should follow the one before, the whole film comes across like one big series of mini stories where the actors are never allowed to show their considerable talents because none of them are ever allowed the time to do so.Whatever the public mood is towards Johnny Depp right now, he's always been one of my favourite actors and I'm certain he has plenty of good roles ahead of him. Just like I know he loves to immerse himself into whatever part he's playing and is more than happy to do whatever it takes to 'look the part.' As with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' he's almost unrecognisable as the main character, sporting a balding hair piece and more than a few added wrinkles. However, it takes more than a good set of prosthetics to make a movie and, unfortunately, his passion for his craft doesn't save the film.It's not terrible, but for the cast that's been assembled for this production you'd be expecting something along the lines of 'Goodfellas.' Sadly, the only two words that come to mind here are 'boring' and 'forgettable' (sorry, Johnny).",4,2,3,6 March 2018
The Town," Somehow better than average
","There are so many films out there about gangs of bank robbers versus the law that it's hard to come up with anything vaguely different. And, to be fair, 'The Town' doesn't really succeed. Now, although that may sound like a 'down-point,' despite its mediocre premise, it's actually quite good (if you're into gritty bank robbing films, anyway).Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner play the lead bank robbers, while Jon Hamm heads up the FBI task force whose job it is to bring this particular gang to justice in Boston, which is - apparently - the city in America with the most bank robberies in the country.Again, it's weird, but I can't really think of many major plus points. Yes, the lead cast are pretty 'A-list' (plus you have Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively and Pete Postlethwaite) to add to the heavyweights, but the story really is so little new that I don't understand quite why I like it so much!I hear the original cut was around a massive four hours and director (also Ben Affleck) had to work hard to trim down the final edit to slightly under two hours. You may think that such a drastic loss would mean that it all feels really rushed. But, again, it doesn't.There's just something about the film that really does work, even though it never really brings much that's new to the table. Personally, I really enjoyed Jon Hamm's performance, but it was Jeremy Renner who received a nod to an Academy Award for his supporting portrayal of a Boston gangster.If you like your gangster films dark, gritty and - strangely - watchable, then you should definitely give this one a go. At least then if you like it I'll know it's not just me.",8,0,2,21 November 2019
Underworld Awakening," Great film (if you liked the first three)
","Okay, for those of you still wondering what Underworld is all about... it's about a war between gun-totting fit female vampires in tight clothes and big ugly werewolves. So, if you've seen any of the first ones and liked them. Then watch this. You'll like this too.If, on the other hand, you think that women in spandex leaping off buildings while firing twin pistols at a monster that, deep down, you know has been added post production via computer is a pretty dumb premise - steer well clear.Luckily, I enjoyed the first three and loved this one too.Twelve years after Selene's last battle, humans have only gone and figured out that vamps and werewolves are real and hunted every last one of them down (apart from the ones they missed). Selene's been frozen in ice and studied, but, luckily, she gets woken up by... you'll have to watch the film and see. But, anyway, she's more than a little cranky and being prodded while in ice by humans in lab coats for over a decade. Luckily for her (and us I guess) she's defrosted right next to her famous black slinky costume and quickly puts it on and goes to express her disgust with humanity by a strongly-worded blog and some scathing tweets (only joking, she grabs the nearest knife and gun and starts piling up the bodies).Oh, and it's 3D this time. My only gripe. The 3D was even more pointless than every other 3D film that's designed purely to make you spend more money.From reading other reviews the general consensus is 'more of the same.' And I can't add to that. It is. There's not a lot new here and some have criticised it for not adding to the overall story enough, but, what the hell, it's still fun and Kate Beckinsale is still gorgeous. They could make a film about vampires in spandex sitting there blowing their noses for ninety minutes and I'd watch it if Kate was in it. Biased. Yes, probably.Bottom line - this film may be the forth instalment of the Underworld franchise, but it's still head, shoulders and biteable neck over the Resident *yawn* Evil films.",8,1,2,13 May 2014
Suicide Squad," Bad guys have all the fun
","'Suicide Squad' is one of those films that's surrounded by 'filmic politics' before you ever enter the theatre. You have the fact that it's based on a comic therefore there is an army of fans who are ready to pick apart how their favourite bad-guys are portrayed on screen. Plus it's part of DC Comics' attempt at playing catch-up to Marvel by creating their own shared universe. Then you have it as a – loose – sequel to Batman vs Superman, which is a film that has totally divided the entire world right down the middle as to its quality. And it seems that Suicide Squad is going to go down that route.It doesn't have Superman in and Batman is merely a cameo. Many will at least expect the Joker to be a major player, but his appearances amount to little more than an extended cameo. Plus you have people who will berate Jarred Leto's performance before they've seen it because a 'new Joker' is still a little too close to Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning portrayal of the 'Clown Prince of Crime.' What we have here is a superhero film about the villains. And, again, that is a difficult premise to sell. Marvel's universe was based on heroes and gave each their own movie to set them up before bringing them all together for the Avengers movies. Here, we're introduced to characters who all but the most ardent of comic book fans, will never have heard of.Anyway, the premise is simple (if a little far-fetched) – a government agency decides that, in the event of an evil superhero threatening the world (or 'meta-human' as they're called) a task force of 'expendable' soldiers should be assembled in order to combat this. Therefore, all the villains currently in custody are brought together (just in time to combat such a threat!).You've probably already seen Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn (i.e. the Joker's long-suffering female associate) and, just because you haven't heard of 'Deadshot' you've probably heard of Will Smith, who plays him in the film. These two are basically the stars and will probably go much further in the DC shared universe. Both get the most screen time and for good reason – they're the two who are most fun to watch. Harley Quinn is wonderfully bonkers and Will Smith plays a bad guy who still has enough good in him to save the universe while being bad at the same time.The action scenes are well done, but not excessive (maybe for budget limitations) and CGI isn't too prevalent, but, sadly, when used does come across as a little blatant. It's hard to say whether anyone will definitely love or hate the film, as – like Batman vs Superman – it seems to completely divide. I enjoyed it. It's harmless fun and does the job. Plus it's probably better than the Batman vs Superman film itself! However, for every person who loves it, someone else despises it. Even die-hard comic book fans won't be guaranteed to embrace it whole-heartedly.I see it as good, old-fashioned popcorn-munching fun. If I had one complaint I found it a little slow to start, but a film with so many characters needs to find a way to introduce their backstory somehow. If you're unsure of whether to watch it, read as many reviews as you can, or just wait until it appears on Netflix in a couple of year's time.",8,2,5,11 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The Bourne Avenger
","Who'd have thought Captain America would actually work as well as it has? Everyone was a little sceptical about how well a modern day version of Captain America would work on today's cinema-going audience, but, to many people's surprise, all of the 'Cap's' outings have been successful. And this is no different.Although, it is a little different in as much as the film-makers are doing their best not to make it just a generic clone of every other recent Marvel superhero movie (and let's face it many of the latest crop of Marvel movies do follow a bit of a template). Instead, it decides to use a different 'tried and tested' film format – the 'Bourne' movies. We've all seen Jason Bourne being wrongly accused of something and then finding himself pursued across various cities by the people he was supposed to be working with. Well this is one of those films (only with superheroes instead of spies). Poor ol' Cap finds himself doublecrossed and 'outed' as a bad-guy. Therefore, he has to team up with (fan-favourite) 'Black Widow' and some guy he met in the street (who we later discover is 'Falcon') to prove himself innocent (not to mention take down the REAL bad-guy who you'll work out who he is loooong before the on-screen characters do!).Yes, it may be a bit of a copy of the 'chase' movies, but it's still pretty good if you're into your Marvel universe. For a start we get to see the Cap doing what he does best a lot more than the first movie, i.e. kicking bad-guy butt. In the first movie, much of the action was kind of glossed over and they used montage sequences to portray the fact that he was out there hurting villains. Now, we get to see him hurt the right people more.Of course it's not perfect there are some plot devices that are a bit overused. The main one being people who 'die' only for it to be revealed later that they actually hadn't. And, possibly mainly, is the title. Here we're watching 'Captain America: Winter Soldier.' Only the titular 'Winter Soldier' doesn't really show up that much. In fact you could probably watch the whole movie and the Cap would have plenty to do without ever having to face his frosty foe.So, if you can ignore plot holes from former films (like the 'Avengers') regarding why Tony Stark didn't learn of Hydra's existence when he downloaded 'every dirty little secret SHIELD possessed,' you should enjoy this film as a decent entry into the Marvel/action/adventure/spy-chasy-type movie universe.",8,0,0,31 August 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," If only 'The Dark World' was like this
","I don't know why some people didn't really go much for the first 'Captain America' film. Yes, I know it was a success, but it's never really talked about as one of the MCU's vest offerings. Maybe it was because it wasn't set in the present and therefore somehow felt less relevant to some cinema-goers? Anyway, I liked it. But, for those who wanted to see our (now UNfrozen) 'First Avenger' getting to grips with the modern world, they really got what they were looking for here.I think the best way to describe the 'Captain America' sequel is by calling it a 'Jason Bourne film with superheroes.' If you're familiar with the 'Bourne' franchise then you'll know the titular character is a spy who uncovers some disturbing truths in his own intelligence organisation and has to go on the run, pursued by rogue agents who were once on his side. This is basically the plot to 'The Winter Solider.' It may not be completely original, but it is damn good fun.There's all the action and chase scenes you'd expect from a spy thriller, plus it's naturally 'beefed up' as many of the protagonists have a multitude of special powers to give the action an added boost. Plus, because it's all set in our modern surroundings (no need for a 'Ragnarok-style' alien planet to be created here) the computer effects required aren't too overbearing and noticeable.I guess the best thing about 'Part 2' is that it has more 'character development' that your average superhero movie. We last saw 'Cap' in his 1940s world, so there's plenty of time for the story to show us how a man from the past deals with present day, not to mention the fact that he was once used to fighting for an 'honourable' power system whereas now the lines of good and evil can sometimes get a little blurred, even on our own side.If the film has a flaw then it kind of falls into that oh-so familiar trap than many Marvel films do (or at least the ones not featuring Loki) and that's the fact that the villain is a little underused. I guess you could say that 'The Winter Soldier' has two villains - one you'll probably forget completely and the other is the titular 'Winter Soldier' himself. The problem is that he just pops up here and there to cause a bit of bother for Cap and then we don't see him again for a while until the next action scene is upon us. There's also a bit of an over-used plot device in which characters 'die' only for us to find out that they're not really dead later. I won't say who or how many as that runs into 'spoiler' territory.But, don't let those minor gripes detract from what is one hell of a fun ride. It really does cover more than a few genres, i.e. superhero, action, spy, chase, thriller and does them all justice here. There's pretty much something for everyone here and Marvel show that not all second instalments have to be a 'Dark World' (that's a 'Thor' joke, that is!).",8,0,2,7 September 2018
Doctor Strange," The Marvel formula lives on
","Once upon a time there was a conceited rich man who frequently cracked jokes at other people's expense. However, he only got away with it because of his status and that he happened to be brilliantly good at what he did. However, his charmed existence all came to an end when a tragic accident happened to him which forced him to re-evaluate the way he'd been living his life and, in turn, made him into the superhero he is today. His name was Tony 'Iron Man' Stark. Or do I mean Dr Strange? Actually, it doesn't matter – it's basically the same film. I may be being a bit flippant, but, when you're basically copying the original 'Iron Man' film, it can't be that bad. And it isn't.'Dr Strange' is yet another superhero movie in Marvel's – seemingly – never ending connected cinematic universe. Here we have Benedict Cumberbatch taking on the titular role as an arrogant (but brilliant!) surgeon who gets his career (and life) dashed when he's involved in a horrific car accident and therefore loses the use of his hands and therefore livelihood. However, all is not lost – a trip to a spiritual guru on the other side of the world turns the arrogant Dr Stephen Strange into the 'Sorcerer Supreme,' ready and willing to protect Earth from all those dark dimensions out there (and Mads Mikkelsen!).As I mentioned, the story is pretty much what you'd expect from any of Marvel's recent offerings. However, this one is the first one that really centres on actual 'magic' with its plentiful psychedelic effects which are used for both the battles and trips into other dimensions. A lot of people have commented on how much they look similar to the way the worlds 'fold' in the film 'Inception' and I have to say that it was instantly recognisable. Whether you consider that a drawback or not is up to you. Either way, they are pretty impressive (as you'd probably expect from a big budget Marvel movie) and make a change from the usual beating up of endless CGI robots in New York! If there's one constant criticism that's always levelled at Marvel movies, it's that they have a distinct lack of decent villains. We've had Tom Higgleston's 'Loki' and that's about it. Perhaps that's why they went an employed the extremely talented Mads Mikkelsen as the antagonist here. He, as you'd expect if you've seen him in anything before, he's as good as he can be with what he's given. However, in the grand scheme of things, he's just the guy Dr Strange has to defeat at the end, leaving most of us lamenting the fact that Loki wasn't included (again!).When the casting was announced for Dr Strange, there was some minor controversy regarding using white actors for Asian roles. I guess this is only a problem if you know the source material. I wasn't sure who they were referring to as I hadn't read the comic; instead I just enjoyed the romp and the pretty colours used in the magic scenes! Benedict was good and a welcome addition to the Marvel shared universe. Apparently, his accent was a little off here and there (as my girlfriend said he sounded 'Scottish' at one point!). Overall, Dr Strange isn't anything new, but it is good fun and plenty to build on in the expanded universe.",8,1,1,13 March 2017
Pacific Rim," Release your inner child (and enjoy)
","Okay, being a fully grown man, perhaps I should have grown out of enjoying watching big, over the top monsters smashing big, over the top robots to bits by now. Sadly, I haven't (which also probably explains why I'm single).If you're looking at Pacific Rim (a film where big, over the top monsters come out from a portal at the bottom of the ocean and start laying waste to our cities, therefore meaning Earth creates an army of big, over the top robots to stop them) on an action-only basis, then it's a sure fire winner. Yes, I loved the action - it was truly amazing special effects wise and I was instantly a twelve-year-old boy again.Sadly, I'm also a thirty-six year old adult, which means that my logical brain does demand some sort of cohesive plot to tie a two-hour film together. This is where Pacific Rim fell down. It seemed to take every action cliché from the last two decades and put them in here. A fair part of the story is told in a 'Lord of the Rings-style' monologue at the very beginning of the film, eliminating the need for any complex plots - it just tells us what's been going down. Then we have the need to recruit the burned-out ex robot pilot who's quit the service, but is the only hope we have now (a cliché so old it was lampooned in Hot Shots Part Deux), plus, when our hero does step up to the challenge, he's met with suspicion and downright hostility from the other pilots (think Team America of all films!). Then throw in the obligatory 'love interest' and dialogue that seems as if it's been completely lifted from Independence Day and you have a weird mish-mash of action films.However, all this may be cliché, but you still have the epic battles to fall back on. I forgave all this and just let my inner child enjoy itself. The only real downside were the (yes, clichéd) scientists. Seriously... they're 'uber-geeky' to such an extreme they wouldn't look out of place in a cartoon. In my opinion, if you're looking for a silly, over the top, all action film then you'll enjoy what's on offer here (I just fast-forwarded the scientists in the end - they could well be related to Jar Jar Binks - they're that bad!).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,3,11 August 2014
Ant-Man," Iron Man is an awesome film
","No, you read the title correctly – this isn't a review of Robert Downey Jr's first outing as the man IN steel. This is a review of Paul Rudd's turn as the titular 'Ant-Man' – yet another entry in the – seemingly – never ending 'Marvel Cinematic Universe.' Basically, Marvel has a formula where you have (a) (conflicted) hero (b) incident giving him superpowers (c) nemesis who happens to be the sort of bad version of himself. Now, before any Marvel fans jump down my throat and point out that NUMEROUS superheroes follow this template – I know this. DC and various independent efforts have all done this, right back from their comic origins. However, no other franchise is this prominent and turns out one film so quickly after the next, making it hard to forget what's come only just a year or so before.'Ant-Man' follows Paul Rudd's character who's a down on his luck ex thief, freshly-released from prison, who gets more than he bargained for when he steals a top secret suit which allows him to shrink down to the size of an ant, along with all the benefits of super speed and strength which goes with it. Now, first of all many people wondered whether Rudd would pull this off. Typically, he's been known for his romantic comedies, rather than his action films (let alone leading man status). I'm pleased to say he did well. He brings a lot of humour to the role without making it an outright comedy, often poking fun at the genre, not to mention the general ludicrousness of being known as 'Ant-Man.' Besides, the typically forgettable villain that Marvel films seem to be known for (whenever Loki's not trying to take over the universe) we have Michael Douglas as the Obi-wan/mentor role to Rudd's fledgling superhero. I was delighted to see him back on the screen again as it seems like a long time since he's been at the forefront of the industry and he brings the charm he used to exhibit back in the nineties to the proceedings. Yes, there's a love interest in there, too and some 'comic relief' characters who you won't be able to remember their names once the credits have rolled.Then, once the cast is assembled, they proceed to go on what is effectively Marvel's take on a 'heist movie,' i.e. think 'Ocean's Eleven' but with more insects. Did I mention Ant-Man can also control ants? Well, he can. This leads to – in my opinion – is one of the film's only real let-downs – the special effects. Now, for ninety per cent of the film the effects are up there with what you'd come to expect from a big budget film. It's just sometimes the insects do look a little 'drawn on' after the footage has been filmed. I guess I should just forgive this on account of how unfeasible it would be to train an army of bugs to put in a convincing performance (although, saying that – didn't Disney do that in 'A Bug's Life?).So, 'Ant-Man' hardly reinvents the wheel in terms of cinema or its genre. However, its biggest flaw is also its strongpoint. It goes with the 'winning formula.' It certainly feels like a modern Marvel movie and, when you hold it up closely to others like 'Iron Man' and 'The Hulk,' you'll see that it copies them practically beat for beat. Normally, this would feel like a let-down, but when it copies something so good and just so happens to be such great fun in the process, I really can't bring myself to hate this film as much as I might have wanted to. Ant-Man will never be as big as Iron Man or Captain America, but this film's existence (and success!) proves that there is scope for the lesser-known heroes to also shine. Don't think too hard about this film, just break out the popcorn and enjoy. Oh, and apparently Ant-Man WILL return!",8,0,0,21 April 2017
21 Jump Street," A pleasant surprise
","Sometimes I find that the best films I see are those I know nothing about. Apparently, 21 Jump Street was based on a TV show from... (I don't know when, but it was, apparently). Anyway, I've never seen it, so I can't say how faithful the film was, compared to the TV series. Either way, it doesn't matter. The point is I knew nothing about the film and watched it anyway.And I'm glad I did.It's about two high school clichés - the nerd and the jock, spending their youth hating each other, only to become best friends when they both enrol in police training school. Then, after a botched bust, they're recruited by '21 Jump Street' to go undercover back to high school and crack a major drugs ring.Based on the plot, I would say it sounded average. However, it does have one ingredient that most modern Hollywood comedies seem to be lacking these days - it's actually funny! I don't know why it is, but it is. Something about it just works. I think it's best not to try and overanalyse a film like this. If you do, you'll end up finding plot holes and ripping it apart for no good reason.Just go with some adult humour and plenty of silliness (and watch out for the unexpected cameo near the end - okay, so if you know the TV series, maybe you're expecting it - but I wasn't, okay?).",7,1,1,19 February 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Solid superhero
","It seems that a modern day superhero movie has to follow certain rules: the hero/s must be flawed, the villain must maintain a parallel existence until the final confrontation and, most recently, Samuel L Jackson must pop up to make a cameo that links the whole film to a greater body of work.Captain America follows these trends quite closely, leaving not an awful lot of shocks and surprises. Now, this may seem like a bad thing, but, actually, the film is pretty good fun to watch. The characters are all likable, Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones add a certain heavyweight star-power to the proceeding. Perhaps the only drawback is that the film seems to take quite some time for Captain America to actually become 'proper' Captain America, but then that leads me on to the movie's real purpose.Like Hulk. Like Thor and like the Iron Man movies, Captain America is largely one giant prequel for the upcoming Avengers movie. If The Avengers wasn't being made, the whole of Captain America's story could probably have been shown as a flashback. It felt like - and this is a criticism of all the recent Marvel movies - they all seem to be holding their true potential back, presumably so as not to burn themselves out and leave nothing for the Avengers movie.However, looking at Captain America as a stand alone movie, it was pretty good. I don't know much about the origins of the character (in other words I've never read one of his comic books), but I liked the way the story was linked to real historical events.Good to see that computer-generated effects wasn't overly used (I'm still scarred by Transformers 3), so, if you fancy a decent romp, give the Capt a try.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,0,2,27 May 2014
American Hustle," Balding Batman
","American Hustle is a pretty good crime/con caper, but I can't go on without mentioning Christian 'greatest Batman ever' Bale's getup. He looks truly ridiculous. However, this is totally intentional, as he plays someone as far away from Bruce Wayne as he's ever likely to get (his hairpiece alone deserves its own credit at the end of the film). Bale plays a conman, operating in the swinging seventies with his lover (behind his wife's back, by the way), Amy Adams. They're happily scamming away when the fall foul to FBI Agent, Bradley Cooper (with almost as great seventies hair as Bale, only more of it). To keep them out of prison, he enlists their help setting up a scam to catch the big, political fish with their fins in the proverbial cookie jar.It's fair to say that things don't go according to plan (for anyone!). And, what you're left with is watching all the main leads doing their best to stay one step ahead of those who they're trying to rip off, while also staying one step ahead of each other, before finally staying one step ahead of anyone who might be trying to put a bullet in the back of their heads.When you get a film with a fair amount of main characters (all vying to make their mark on the picture), you get more plot lines than your average ninety minute movie. Therefore, you have to stay focused to work out who's currently double-crossing who. Plus, despite all the A-list leads giving naturally excellent performances, it doesn't mean you'll go away actually liking any of them. It's hard to find too much sympathy for people who make their living ripping others off. Even those representing 'the law' are a pretty shallow (and some might say 'borderline psychotic') bunch.However, if you're looking for an adult con/crime caper with plenty of great (if a little weird-looking) A-list stars then you'll certainly find what you're looking for here.Oh, and if nothing I've said convinces you it's any good, it also has Robert DeNiro thrown in there for an extended cameo – always a bonus!",7,0,2,13 January 2015
Fargo," By far the Coen brothers' best film
","In case you don't know, the minimalistly-titled 'Fargo' cemented the Coen brothers' reputation as auteurs of modern cinema. There was something about the film which just simply worked. I've already used the term 'minimalist' once and I can't really think of a better word to use to describe the film.William H Macy plays 'Jerry,' a married man in financial trouble. Feeling he has no way out, he decides to hire a couple of unsavoury characters to stage a kidnapping of his wife. During their first meeting, the two 'hoods' aren't as dumb as they may look and enquire as to why he wishes to 'pay his own ransom.' Jerry's idea is that it will be his rich father in law who will pay and the cash will be split between himself and the 'kidnappers.' What could possibly go wrong? Well... quite a bit, actually. I won't go into too many details about what happens (or more importantly all the different ways things don't always work out the way you plan) as that's half the fun. The only thing you really need to know is that there are no car chases and the one shoot out is hardly akin to something you'd see in a Matrix film. The film ambles along from one beautifully-bleak winter's setting to the next, as the people go about their (sometimes pretty shady) business.It's fair to say that Fargo is pretty slow moving. Now, sometimes that comes as a drawback, yet here, it just seems to work. Soon a police officer is on both Jerry and the kidnappers' trail, which brings added heat on everyone concerned. And, in my opinion, this is the film's only drawback. Frances McDormand plays 'Marge,' the local sheriff who starts putting two and two together. It was on about the second viewing of Fargo that I realised what I didn't like about her. She was pregnant. Now, my reason for feeling this way is because Fargo is a pretty dark affair – you won't know who's going to come a cropper at the hands of a madman at any time. However, it's a brave film-maker who dares to harm a pregnant woman. Now, Marge is clearly the only truly 'good' character – she's smart, kind, clever and likable, but, being pregnant, you kind of know that nothing bad is going to happen to her. This, for me anyway, took away a little bit of tension from the 'chase.' But, that's just a minor gripe. If you like your crime films slow and bleak then you'll be one of the many who've enjoyed this. The Coen brothers have made plenty of good films since (and a few slightly more forgettable ones), but this one is definitely their finest hour. And, I've managed to come to the end of the review without managing to mention Steve Buscemi – he's in it too. And, as always, he's great – just in case you needed an extra reason to watch.",7,0,0,9 February 2015
Rush," Thor takes to the wheel!
","I have no interest in motor racing (or the history of the sport), however, I will confess to actually enjoying this film. Yes, it has enough of a budget to include some (pretty realistic) re-enactments of motor racing from the seventies (when it's set), but don't think that that's all there is here.It's based on the real life rivalry between two formula one drivers in the seventies. Now, normally when you have a film like this, one of the drivers is the 'goodie' and one is the 'baddie.' However, here, both have their pros and cons and sometimes you'll find yourself rooting for Thor (joke) and sometimes for the other one (not Thor).It's basically a good drama with some entertaining driving scenes thrown in. If you can forgive Thor's (slightly dubious) 'British' accent, then you'll probably have a good time. I hear from what I've read on the internet that it's actually quite a historically accurate representation of what went on in the seventies, so bonus points for – apparently – getting it right.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,1,1,22 July 2014
Predator," One day, all movies will be made like this
","And if that day comes then I'll be very happy. Nearly 25 years on and 'Predator' is still as fresh and gripping as it was in the eighties. Simply, everything works. If you don't know the plot (then you've probably been hiding in the jungle trying to avoid head-hunting monsters) it's about a team of commandos (lead by Arnold Schwarzenegger at the height of his fame) who get stalked by a particularly nasty alien hunter.Put simply... if you're a fan of either/or action or science-fiction then you'll love this. But what makes it work when so many similar films have come and gone and been chalked up as nothing more than glorified copies? First of all is Arnold - an actor not always known for his acting abilities, but, when it comes to looking tough and firing guns (let alone mud-wrestling aliens) there can be no one better. His team, although never really given much screen time to really establish their real personalities, are also equally likable. Then there's the plot. There isn't really one. It's so simply, it barely needs explaining, i.e. alien vs soldiers in jungle (there are some sub plots about deceiving and male bonding, but they're over before you realise they're getting in the way of things). The creature itself is impressive. It was the first on screen baddie to really make use of 'invisibility' and its movements are all very 'alien' and different to anything ever before it. Then you have the action: it's pretty relentless. The direction is simple and effective all the way through. It doesn't need today's flashy 'MTV' style editing to make it look cool. It is cool all by itself.The film's marketing tagline was, 'Nothing like it has ever been on Earth before...' and, in some ways, that could describe more than just the movie. There has never been a sci-fi action film as pure as Predator and anything that follows it will always have to pay homage to this - the original. Its successors (i.e. Predator 2, Alien vs Predator 1 and 2 and Predators) are all reasonable, but, even though they're about the same alien, they will never truly match up.Like sci-fi? Like action? Then you've probably already seen Predator. If you haven't - then do it, do it NOW!!!",10,0,1,28 October 2014
Nightcrawler," Nothing to do with X-men
","Okay, so please don't tell me that I'm the only person who, every time he sees the word 'Nightcrawler,' thinks about the blue, vampire-like teleporter from X-men? All right, just me then. Anyway, this film – also entitled 'Nightcrawler' has absolutely nothing to do with superpowered mutants and more to do with the dark, seedy behind-the-scenes world of modern newsrooms. I do like X-men, but I like this more.Jake Gyllenhaal – once again – plays a brooding and possibly damaged character. We're never really given much backstory regarding how or why he's like he is. He just is. And he's just dark – possibly a modern day sociopath. While I was watching this film, all I could think of was 'American Psycho.' Not that Jake spends his evenings slicing up ladies of the night. He's far more subtle than that. He doesn't set out to cause misfortune, he simply realises that there's money to be made from other people's suffering and therefore decides to exploit this situation by becoming an independent cameraman on the streets of L.A.It's fair to say that this is hardly a 'noble profession' and he quickly discovers that he has to cut the metaphorical throat of anyone who stands in his way. Watch out rival cameraman played by Bill Paxton – it's not just aliens, Terminators and Predators who are out to get you! Gyllenhaal's character adapts with ease to this lifestyle, happy to step on anyone who gets in his way in pursuit of the next big scoop. In many films they say you have to 'relate' to the central character in order to enjoy the story. I doubt many of us will 'relate' to a man who is quite happy to trample anyone who gets in his way in order to further his own ambition, but then I doubt many people felt like they identified with Patrick Bateman and 'American Psycho' was a pretty big hit! If you watch 'Nightcrawler' you need to be prepared for a pretty bleak and dark insight into the way the world (or rather modern day news) works. It's hardly a 'feel-good' film and the whole show rests on Gyllenhaal's shoulders, but, as with many of his films before, he carries it all the way. It's weirdly hypnotic and you'll want to see just how far he'll go to achieve his self-serving ends.Ultimately, it's another notch on Gyllenhaal's impressive range of deeply disturbed characters. Don't expect a laugh a minute, side-splitting two hours, just get ready to descend into the underbelly of society and what it takes to get those 'exclusive' pictures on CNN or Sky News.",9,0,0,23 January 2017
Oblivion," When will aliens learn not to mess with 'our Tom?'
","A race of intergalactic nasties (who obviously didn't watch the War of the Worlds remake) has only gone and waged war on Earth. However, despite the fact they trashed our planet, our man Tom stands defiant against their hordes. C'mon, they don't stand a chance, do they? I may be being flippant, but I actually really enjoyed this film. I won't go into details about the story, as there are a few cool twists and turns along the way. All you need to know is that aliens are trying to mix it with Tom Cruise. When will those xenomorphs learn? You have cool space ships, decent CGI effects, mean-looking robots, space-age costumes and quite a novel spin on the (somewhat tired) alien invasion movie. All in all, the two hours goes by pretty quickly. I did get a bit confused around the midway mark, but I must have been being a bit dim, because, by then end of the film I knew the hows and whys of the movie (and enjoyed them).My only major gripe was that (for the most part of the film) there are only two characters - Tom and his on screen other half. Having such a small cast means you really do have to invest in both of them completely. Tom does tend to overact on occasion and his female partner is a little 'too cold.' By that I mean Tom goes around thinking with his heart and she's all 'head.' Therefore she's the polar opposite of him in every way. And, being Tom Cruise, he's always right.However, that's a minor gripe. It's still a cool sci-fi film. If nothing else, it will act as yet another warning to other aliens not to mess with Earth while we still have Tom on our side.",8,0,0,8 July 2014
Bird Box," Nearly a classic
","Ever since 'Demolition Man' I've been a fan of Sandra Bullock (I'm ashamed to say). I actually think she's a far more versatile actress than many give her credit for. She's been in many different movie genres over the years, but - to my knowledge - she hasn't done too much in the way of 'horror' (or at least memorable horror films! I seem to recall that 'Premonition' didn't do that well). So, when I saw her in a new horror movie on Netflix that I could watch from the comfort of my own home that was picking up a lot of praise from audiences, I definitely thought I'd give it a go. Overall, when the credits finally rolled, my initial thought was, 'That was pretty good.' I only had one major problem with the film throughout its runtime (I'll get to that later). It's now been a few days since I watched 'Bird Box' and, the more I've thought about the film, the more additional flaws I seem to keep coming up with.Sandra Bullock plays 'Malorie' - a woman who's heavily pregnant when something very strange/bad happens to the world. Basically, everyone starts committing suicide in very gruesome ways. I've seen this film compared to a couple others, but no one seems to mention the similarity in premise to 'The Happening' (perhaps because many are still trying to forget that film?). Anyway, she seeks shelter in a large house with a group of random people and there, they try to wait out, or at least survive whatever is causing this.The only gripe I came up with while watching this film was that the 'time period' isn't just the goings on at the house with the group. It's split with a segment four years later where Malorie is trying to get two children down a river and the story keeps flicking back and forth between the two time periods. The reason I didn't really go for this method of story-telling was for the same reason I don't like most prequels, i.e. you know what's coming. Because she's on her own (besides the kids), we basically know that no one in the house is going to make it this far for whatever reason and so it removes all tension as I found myself just waiting for other characters to die.You may see a lot of the marketing behind 'Bird Box' depicting people wearing blindfolds. Hopefully it's not too much of a 'spoiler' to say that the story revolves around the fact that if you look at the monster then you'll kill yourself. What monster you say? Yeah, well, there's a monster - apparently. I read another critic's review online after watching the film and I'm going to blatantly steal their phrase when I say that 'Bird Box' is a monster film without a monster. If you've seen any of the 'Evil Dead' films then you'll know there's that thing that flies through the woods and chases Bruce Campbell. You never see it right? But you see a hell of a lot of other nasties along the way. Here, you just have the thing you never see. It rustles bushes, moves trees and if it gets you... er, well, I'm not sure. Apparently, if you close your eyes you'll be okay. Apart from the times when characters just don't and aren't. In short, there seemed to be a few discrepancies about how the 'world' worked and the rules people had to follow for survival.Bird Box' clocks in at around two hours and about an hour and a half of the film is set in the house, compared to the final half hour showing how Malorie got to the river and why. Personally, I preferred the stuff in the house. Yes, I had a fair idea regarding what was going to happen to everyone else around her, but I felt there was more conflict within the humans than there was with whatever this thing was that we couldn't see or understand. In specific John Malkovich is about the most famous 'housemate' to share the screen with Sandra Bullock in the house and he's definitely the best to watch. Yes, he's a bit of an idiot, but he's an entertaining idiot and that's what we want to see in our films! The rest of the group seem to have been hand-picked to be as 'diverse' as possible, meaning all races and s3xualities are accounted for and, of course, portrayed favourable - besides John Malkovich and later Tom Hollander - go figure.I also mentioned that other people have compared it to other films, namely the (really awesome!) 'A Quiet Place.' Yes, I can see there's similar themes here and there and I read somewhere that 'Bird Box' is based on a book that was written well before 'A Quiet Place,' meaning that it couldn't possibly have lifted anything from John Krasinski's surprise hit. Perhaps if 'Bird Box' had have been released first then it would have been considered the better of the two, but, despite my enjoyment of Bullock's performance, if you asked me which one was better, I'd pick 'A Quiet Place' every time.Overall, weighing up the pros and cons of the film, I can see that it's definitely up there with some of the best Netflix has come up with. However, it does feel sometimes like a little bit tighter writing and shuffling the order of the scenes could have made it into a film that explained a little more about what was going on and didn't leave so much up in the air, or the situations generally to chance as to whether the rules of the phenomenon actually applied at that time or not. If you have Netflix and like horror, give it a watch. It's like the 'Quiet Place' of online streaming services.",7,0,1,2 January 2019
American Pie," There was this one time – at band camp – when we watched a really funny film
","Okay, so I know that 'teens behaving badly' is hardly a revolutionary genre when it comes to film-making. However, sometimes a film comes along that, while not really offering much that's new, sort of revitalises the genre (and naturally spawns one hundred and one poorer imitations). 'American Pie' did just this. Four horny teenage boys vow to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school and, as the old saying goes 'with hilarious consequences.' But, unlike all those times where that worn and weary phrase never really quite lives up to its boast, this time it does.There are times when a film probably shouldn't work, yet it does. This is one of those times. The story relies heavily on 'gross-out' humour. You will need to have an appreciation for rather crude and toilet-based gags to fully enjoy this. Plus, as 'sex' is a major component to the plot, you'll need to be okay with quite a few dirty scenes.Nearly fifteen years later, you will probably recognise many of the cast, but, back in 1999, they were largely unknowns, the only real recognisable face was Allison Hannigan who played 'Willow' in the Buffy the Vampire TV series. However, despite being a load of non-stars, they all played their parts really well. You'll actually care about everyone here, no matter how dumb they are.If you're really looking for faults, you could say that it's riddled with clichés. The four main lead characters aren't exactly 'fleshed-out.' They're all walking/talking caricatures and pretty dumb (but then they're teenage boys, so I guess the lack of I.Q. can be forgiven). The females on the cast fair a little better. They're slightly more smart and sensitive, but at the same time are largely only there as potential candidates for the four boys' adolescent lusts.American Pie will never be 'high brow entertainment' yet it is enormous fun for anyone with an appreciation for silly (definitely low brow) humour. Many other films were made after it trying to fit the same mould and recapture the magic. Some were okay. Others were good, but all fell short of this one. Even the official sequels themselves slowly degraded and I didn't even bother to finish all of the fourth instalment 'American Wedding.' I'll stick to this one thanks. And possibly part II.",8,2,2,11 October 2015
Burn After Reading," It's a little bit funny
","I think I've watched the Cohen Brothers' 'Burn After Reading' about four times now and, although I find it a weirdly enjoyable film, I still can't get my head round the beginning. I guess you'd call it a black comedy/drama, filled with mix-ups and adulterous relationships, yet the catalyst for how it all begins seems to be one of those 'blink-and-you-miss-it' kind of moments. A CIA analyst (John Malkovich) gets fired and ends up being blackmailed by a pair of gym employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), one of which is sleeping with a married man, George Clooney (who is also sleeping with John Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton). Confused? You may well be.It's a pretty confusing plot, not because anything's that difficult to understand - it just has a real air of confusion about it all. And, I think that's deliberate. For we, the audience, are treated like the CIA agents in the film, left to look in on this series of odd developments and wonder what the hell is going on here.Of course the film's storytelling style may not be to everyone's liking, however you have to admit that it has a stellar cast. With those names in the lead you'll be hard pushed to not enjoy their performances. Although, I have to say that (no-so-famous) Richard Jenkins stole every scene he was in and brought a real air of tragic pathos to the cast. In fact, he may well be the film's 'heart,' as, despite the other lead actors being big names, you may find it difficult to empathise with anyone besides Jenkins.Although everything ties up with these characters lives, like I said, it does it in a deliberately vague way which leaves you with question marks over your head (making you see the events through the bewildered eyes of those men supposed to know everything that's going on ever). Oh, and don't read too many spoilers - as there are definitely some moments that you won't see coming!",7,1,3,8 January 2018
Watchmen," Not for everyone (but definitely for me)
","'Watchmen' is based on one of the most popular DC graphic novels of the eighties and it's been kicking about in (film) production limbo practically ever since. Many people have even gone as far as to call it 'unfilmable.' Therefore, many of its die-hard fans were sceptical when Zack Snyder took on the job of bringing it to the big screen.The result: a faithful adaptation and - in my opinion - a good one. However, that doesn't mean that it hasn't attracted more than its fair share of criticism.For a start, you have the fans of the graphic novel. They claim it's still not as faithful as it could have been. Yes, there are a few changes here and there which may leap out at the faithful. My counter argument is that - yes - the source material was so filled with sub-plots and excessive narrative structures, that all of it was never going to make it to the big screen. What we're given is a story that - while being complicated - is also accessible to the masses (and therefore commercially more lucrative - hopefully) and easier to follow.Then you have the people who have never read the graphic novel. They may not like it because they may be expecting something else entirely. If you look at the promotional poster, you may think that you're going to watch an 'X-Men' type film, filled with lots of superheroes fighting it out with various weird and wonderful superpowers. Warning: Watchmen is NOTHING like X-Men.Watchmen is a multi-stranded narrative which is more of a conspiracy-thriller-who-dunnit than an action movie (there's only two real action sequences in the whole film). Yes, the film happens to be about superheroes, trying to decide whether there's an assassin killing off their numbers one by one, but only one of the superheroes actually has superpowers (the rest are just basically good fighters in masks).So, if you're expecting either an exact replica of the graphic novel, a straight out action movie, or something like X-Men, you will probably be sorely disappointed. However, if you're wanting to watch a violent, visually-stunning thriller which twists and twines while it introduces various damaged ex-heroes, give this a go. It's dark, moody and certainly different enough to be appreciated for not adhering to every superhero clichÃ© around right now. This is nothing like the 'Marvel universe' which is currently so popular!",10,1,3,22 October 2014
Baby Driver," Nearly disappointed
","One of the problems of not watching a film soon after it was released (and hearing a lot of positive praise about it in the meantime!) is that you expect it to be absolutely amazing. I like (writer/director) Edgar Wright's other work (i.e. 'the Cornetto trilogy' - Google it if you don't get the reference!), plus I'm a fan of slick heist films and the actors on display here, so I figured that this would be the film for me. And it was. But only just.'Baby' is a young (18-21 year old, I'm guessing - I don't think his age was ever officially disclosed) man who has a natural gift at stealing cars and then driving them away at high speed. He's currently working for a criminal mastermind, but only to 'work off a debt' - after that he's gone. However, the criminal life is never that straight forward.I was about 20-30 minutes in and I was really contemplating turning it off! Yes, Wright's style and direction is uber-slick and a joy to watch. The cast was shaping up nicely to be as good as advertised and the dialogue wasn't that bad either. The problem was 'Baby' himself (Ansel Elgort). We soon learn that he doesn't talk too much, mainly because he deliberately excludes himself from conversations by plugging himself into his personal musical device. However, later we learn there is a deeper meaning behind this. I've never seen the actor before, so I can't comment on how good he normally is, but here (with pretty much the entire film resting on his young shoulders) he just doesn't seem that charismatic to really carry the film (especially when he's hampered by being practically mute for long periods of time). Worse still, he started coming across as rather smug with these weird little 'song and dance' numbers that were particularly noticable in the first half of the film.Luckily, when the tension starts to mount, Baby seems to glide into being the 'leading man' a little more. There is - the obligatory - romance element, which does seem a little forced and, believe it or not, the film would probably have been just as good without it. But, what really makes it is the cast. If you have seen Jon Bernthal's name attached, don't get your hopes up - his scenes are almost just an extended cameo. The 'real' stars are the ever excellent Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. They're long-standing appeal and screen presence saves the film and picks up and slack left by Elgort's inexperience with shouldering the burden of an entire film's weight.I have read a couple of reviews which stated that the film is a 'film of two halves.' I can agree with that completely, although many of the other reviews seem to like the first half and say that it then fell apart in the second. I was the other way around - I was bored with the first half and then found that when the action picked up around the midway mark, everything got a lot better. The chases and car stunts are excellent and worth watching on their own, plus there's a little kid that totally steals the show - pity he's in it even less than Jon Bernthal! Overall, I'm glad I watched the film and stuck with it. If there is a major fault it's that it feels about 10-15 minutes too long. I reckon you could have cut down the romance element and made it a tighter film.",7,2,2,19 June 2019
Justice League," Simpsons did it
","Right now, the long awaited 'Justice League' is taking a bit of a hammering at the Box Office. People are already claiming that it signals the (premature) end to comic giant DC's 'shared universe' (which, in case you're not up on the cut-throat world of comics and their filmic interpretations) was Warner Bros' answer to the seemingly unstoppable juggernaut that is Disney's 'Marvel cinematic shared universe.' And, they may be right, but sadly for possibly the wrong reasons.The tragedy is that DC has – arguably – the most famous and beloved superheroes in its arsenal, i.e. Batman and Superman (whereas Marvel was forced to rely on (due to licensing issues) a rag-tag band of its lesser-known stars such as Iron Man and Thor). Twenty years ago if you had told the cinema-going public that they were about to witness Bruce versus Clark slug it out on the big screen it would probably have been seen as the cinematic event of all time. However, 'Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice' kind of whimpered its way through the public's consciousness, leaving no one that excited (and die-hard DC fans more worried) about the film that was supposed to bring all their most beloved heroes together for their first major outing.Critics have already slammed 'Justice League' for being a 'directorial mess,' citing a change of directors for the post- production phase and general studio interference. Now, I'm not saying they don't have a point. Original director Zack Snyder wanted a film that was closer to three hours, yet the studio wanted as many showings per day as possible, therefore made the cinematic cut just under two hours. So the finished product does feel decidedly unfinished. Also, a few weeks before 'Justice League' came out, 'Thor: Ragnarok' sneaked out in cinemas. And, despite it being about one of my afore-mentioned 'lesser' heroes and it was the third instalment in Thor's personal film career, it was amazing. It performed better than even Disney had hoped and forced 'Justice League' onto the back foot in the public's and critics' eyes alike. There are plenty of other minor gripes like the 'forced' humour that secondary director Joss Whedon seemed to feel the need to add, JK Simmons being very underused as Commissioner Gordon, continuity issues, things that aren't properly explained due to the harsh cutting to save runtime, the – slightly cheesy – CGI, especially in the film's villain himself, Steppenwolf and that one terrible line poor Jeremy Irons is forced to utter during the final battle. However, I felt the real problem lay in the fact that 'Justice League' was released too early. Superman was only given one solo film, before sharing the stage with Batman (for a new caped crusader's first outing after Christian Bale refused to reprise the role and link Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy into this new shared universe). Aquaman was decent enough, but he would have benefited from having his own stand-alone film shown BEFORE he was put into JL. The Flash makes his first film appearance, despite DC giving him his own (highly- prised) TV show and then choosing to create a new version for the big screen. And, as for Cyborg, personally I liked him, but no one besides die-hard fans of the kids' cartoon 'Teen Titans' will know who he was. Wonder Woman was about the film's only real character people felt they connected with due to her having a hit film (or should I say the ONLY hit film) prior to this get together. Therefore, whereas much of the audience this film was meant for has already seen this kind of 'superhero shared universe' played out by Marvel characters. All of which had their own solo films to build up their characters and bring a sense of grandeur to the point in time when they finally come together as one unit. Here, it just felt rushed for the sake of 'playing catch-up.'If you're wondering what my 'Simpsons-related' title refers to, it's about a little-known episode of 'South Park' which made fun of itself and 'The Simpsons' where the jokes come from the fact that the Simpsons has been on TV for so many years that they've done everything and there's nothing that 'South Park' can do that feels original. This was how I felt watching 'Justice League.' Every time something happened a little voice in my head said 'Marvel did it, Marvel did it, Marvel did it' and that was kind of disappointing. Whether it was watching Aquaman fly and fight like Thor or the team chasing Infinity stone-like cubes to stop them falling into Thanos' hands (sorry, Steppenwolf), everything felt like I'd already seen it before – and, sadly, better.I didn't hate 'Justice League,' in fact I found it an okay movie and definitely not as bad as many of the online community is making out. However, it is definitely a missed opportunity and could have been so much better if handled with just a little more care and forethought.",7,0,0,27 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The start of something epic
","The word 'epic' probable gets used too much these days to describe films. However, in this case it's definitely right. For those two people out there who don't know, 'The Lord of the Rings' is (primarily, excluding various 'spin-off' books) a trilogy of long books set in a fiction world called 'Middle Earth' which is filled with everything from wizards to dragons (yes, think 'Game of Thrones,' but with less nudity.It had long been considered that J. R. R. Tolkien's books were 'unfilmable' due to no screen adaptation being able to bring his lavish world to life (properly). There was an animated attempt (which wasn't as bad as people made out), but due to budgetary reasons, it was left unfinished (a concept which left me particularly confused when I watched it as a child). However, now the source material has finally been given the big screen treatment it deserved and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the start of the trilogy's life in mainstream cinema.Despite the long backstory (shown in a brief montage/history lesson at the beginning of the film) all you need to know is that the spirit of a 'dark lord' wants his magic ring back in order to become whole again and generally take over the land. However, by luck the piece of jewellery in question is in the hands of a gentle race of little creatures known as 'hobbits.' They, together with an assortment of men, wizards, dwarfs and elves, vow to prevent the dark lord Sauron from getting his property back and set off on a quest to destroy it in the fires of the volcano where it was once forged.I suppose you could call the cast an 'ensemble.' With a story that requires so many characters, quite a few familiar faces will pop up. Primarily you have Sir Ian McKellen as the iconic wizard, Gandalf the Grey, but he's backed up by everyone from Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee to Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen. In fact it's more a case of the more 'famous' Hollywood actors are secondary to the two hobbits who are at the centre of the tale, Frodo and Sam, plays by Elijah Wood and Sean Aston respectively. They're possibly less well-known that the affore-mentioned actors and yet rise to the challenge and prove that they're more than capable of having a major cinematic franchise rest on their (miniature!) shoulders.The cast is perfectly surrounded by some of the best sets, scenery and special effects ever to be committed to the big screen at the time (yes, you can - sort of - see a bit of 'green screen' work these days, but they still hold up!). Some say that the whole trilogy is one giant advert for the New Zealand tourist board, as it makes use of all the country's different landscapes to great effect.Of course seeing as 'Fellowship' is the first in a trilogy, there a certain amount of 'set up' contained where some story threads are mentioned but never expanded on - yet. However, this never really stops anyone from understanding what's going on and I'm sure once you watch this installment you'll want to know where it all goes!I know that the real 'Tolkien purists' will argue about which bits from the book have either been left out, or slightly changed, like making an Elf maiden an outright warrior in the film. I've read the books and, due to their length, it would probably be impossible to commit every last page to screen (unless you make every film about six hours!) and what they've done is taken all the most important points and used them to great effect to make the story as accessible to as many people as possible.I think it was writer/director Kevin Smith who said in 'Clerks II' that the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was just basically 'people walking.' Okay, so funny as that may be (and - technically - true) there's so much more to the film that just that. The best part about 'Fellowship' (and indeed the whole trilogy) is that it can be enjoyed by most people, not just fans of the book or the genre, but also appreciated by (nearly) everyone with an eye for good cinema due to its achievements in world-building and sheer scale.",10,1,1,8 January 2020
Man of Steel," The lovechild of the Avengers and the Dark Knight
","Now that Marvel superhero films are stealing the limelight at the Box Office and the only (successful) franchise left in the DC stable was Batman, there was a lot of pressure on to 'reboot' Superman (or reboot the 2006 reboot which didn't really hit the mark with fans).So, seeing as 'The Dark Knight' was a more serious and darker take on the Batman legend, they decided to go the same route with Superman and give him the 'Dark Knight' makeover.And, it has worked to a degree. Henry Cavill was definitely the right choice to play the 'Man of Steel' and totally nails it in the role. All the other cast members are good, too, but it's Henry who carries the film. Yes, Man of Steel is darker than the average Marvel superhero film, yet not as dark as the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. Plus, because Superman's story/powers are more 'fantastical' than Batman's, it has an 'Avengers feel' to some of the (many) action sequences.As a modern and darker reboot of the Superman legend, it definitely works and fans of the comic shouldn't be too disappointed with the direction it's heading. A lot of people weren't happy with the choice in director (Zack Snyder – 300, Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead 2004), but he seemed to handle the big budget and the various – expected – action scenes. My only gripe was that a lot of the action felt quite computer generated. It would have been nice if it looked as gritty and real as the rest of the film was trying to be. But, overall, I'm looking forward to seeing how the franchise continues.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,1,6,2 July 2014
28 Weeks Later," A rare sequel that works
","Whether you like the follow-up to cult horror hit, '28 Days Later' will depend on whether you prefer 'Alien' to 'Aliens.' Producer, Danny Boyle, said that '28 Weeks Later' is to '28 Days Later' what 'Aliens' is to 'Alien.' And, I can't think of any way to sum it up better.28 Days Later, as it told the story of a plague sweeping Britain turning the population into zombies (okay, 'infected' if you want the technical term), it was dark, tense and moody. However, 28 Weeks Later goes in the other direction, being loud, brash and exciting.The action picks off when Britain is starting to be repatriated by a UN team. Of course things don't go smoothly and the human population soon finds itself at the mercy of a horde of flesh-eating, rage-infected zombies (infected). If you like your horror explosive and non-stop then you should like this. It has a good cast, good special effects and, thanks to the soundtrack, makes sure it feels like it's set in the same universe as its predecessor at all times.In fact, the only downside I can think of is that it's probably a little too short. The characters - although good - never quite get the chance to be fleshed out as they might have been. Whereas most films go on too long, this one could have done with some extra character-development to go with the excellent action.It may not be Aliens, but it is a worthy sequel in a world of endless, terrible additions to horror franchises.",9,2,4,5 October 2014
The Thing," A film that's so good, it survived being remade!
","Most people will already know about 'The Thing,' but, if you don't, it's about a monstrous shape-shifting alien running riot among an American base in the arctic.And it's fantastic. That's all you need to know. However, instead of listing all its many plus points (of which there are probably too many to mention), I will simply point out that, as it was popular, it probably wasn't long before some Hollywood money-man decided to cash in on its success and remake it.It never happened (well, it sort of did, but it didn't). Even Hollywood was at a loss as to whether they could attempt to 'better' such a work of horror genius. So they didn't. They left it as it is and it's all the better for it. They did make a 'prequel' which you can take or leave, depending on your taste. The original is obviously far better, so, if you choose to only watch one, definitely go for John Carpenter's 1982 original.Bottom line: if you like horror, if you like sci-fi, if you love bizarre and monstrous creatures and spine-tingling tension, then this is for you. It may have been made over thirty years ago, but it's still as fresh and chilling as when it first came out. For the few people who haven't seen it, I won't mention its best parts, but the special effects - for their time - were truly breath-taking (and hideous).",10,1,4,4 January 2015
The Village," M. Night Shyamalan's last decent film (in my opinion)
","The Indian auteur burst onto the scene with the classic 'The Sixth Sense' and followed it up with the equally impressive 'Unbreakable.' However, since then, his record at the box office has been shaky to say the least.In my opinion, 'The Village' (despite receiving mixed reviews) was his last excellent film, although I can see how it's not everyone's cup of tea. Those expecting a straight out horror film will be disappointed. And anyone hoping for bucket loads of blood and guts will be sorely disappointed. The Village is a slower affair, moody and well-shot as a group of people refuse to leave their village for fear of the creatures who live in the woods all around them.Perhaps The Village could be best described as a 'love story,' as the relationship between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is central to the story.The film boasts an impressive cast, all of whom play there parts subtly and with great understatement, all of which adds to the overall creepy, isolated environment.It's very possible to enjoy this movie, but only if you're in the mood for something a little more subtle. It's a slow burner if ever there was one, well shot, well acted and often overlooked. Give it a go if you're up for something a little different.",8,2,3,25 September 2014
Split," Contains the most well-publicised 'twist' ever
","Once upon a time, film-maker M. Night Shyamalan could do no wrong. Then, almost as abruptly, he could do no right. He made 'The Visit' which some claimed went some way to regain his previously excellent reputation, but it wasn't until 'Split' which really reinforced that he was back in business.His early films became synonymous with having a 'twist' at the end - one that you never saw coming. However, once audiences got wise to this trait, he stopped trying - especially when the twists became a little too over the top to be believable. 'Split' has, what you might call, a 'twist.' And, once this became common knowledge, it seemed to help the film snowball and become much bigger than its initial predictions. Whereas most people respected others enough not to let slip the ending to Shyamalan's earlier films such as 'The 6th Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' reviews seemed to be only too happy to give the ending away in order to help promote it. So, with that view mind, I too will let everyone know that the ending implies that 'Split' is actually (a kind of indirect) sequel to 'Unbreakable.'However, it's definitely not a requisite to have watched Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson's 2001 outing in order to understand 'Split.' Here, James McAvoy plays a man who suffers from 'multiple personality disorders.' To be precise he has 23 personalities, most completely bonkers, but even his worst doesn't compare to the 24th personality which is on its way. He then kidnaps three teenage girls and they have to work out how to escape before this psychotic 24th personality comes into play.And that's about it. You can kind of guess how everything plays out (especially now I've given away the ending - sorry!). There's actually not that much there in terms of story-telling. However, it's not all bad - mainly due to McAvoy's performance. I know that some people have called his switching from one personality to the other 'Oscar worthy.' I'm not sure how much he should have at least been nominated, but I did enjoy his performance and he puts his all into the role.This contrasts to the three girls who are pretty forgettable. One gets more screentime and backstory than the other two - guess why that is? But, anyway, seeing as the film can't just be the girls failed escape attempts piled on top of each other, until one or more ultimately either gets away or dies trying, it gets padded out by plenty of flashbacks of McVoy's character visiting his psychiatrist for various exposition segments.I know a lot of people have loved this film and heaped praise on it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again some time. However, I wouldn't say it's as revolutionary as some are making out. It's long and a little drawn out at time. But, McVoy is clearly able to carry the film and the fact that it's linked to 'Unbreakable' add extra points, so to speak. It also sets up the final part of what is going to be a trilogy and will certainly get me ready to watched the upcoming concluding part, 'Glass.'",7,0,0,21 January 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," Actually quite good – by remakes' standards
","Yes, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a good film. Doesn't that mean it's a classic? No, it's a remake. And, seeing as – seemingly – every film needs to remade/re-imagined or have Spock home back in time to create an alternate timeline, most of them fall nowhere near 'okay.' Therefore, remakes need to be judged through more lenient eyes, so it may not be a good film, but it's a damn fine remake! The plot from the 1977 original remains the same – a nice, happy family gets stranded in the middle of an American desert and is slowly picked off by the local mutants who generally want them dead for varying reasons. Nice and simple. The family must therefore fight to survive.And that's all there is to it. With a plot so simple, it could be great or it could fail. Luckily, the cast of actors save it. They work pretty well together and generally annoy each other (as most real families do). They bicker, they moan and get at each other, but ultimately come together to overcome a greater threat. Plus, most importantly, they don't make too many ridiculous judgements meaning they're the architects of their own demises. There's nothing worse than yelling at the TV screen to the protagonist because they're making ridiculous calls which simply further the plot. Here, the family do basically what we'd do in such a grisly situation.And it is grisly. First of all there is gore (and strong violence) aplenty. Not only are the kills pretty extreme, but the make-up on the mutated locals is suitably gruesome. 'The Hills Have Eyes' certainly isn't for everyone. Its strong gore and adult content will certainly put some people off. It's not for the squeamish, but if you like your horror films brutal and violent then this one is for you.",7,2,3,13 June 2016
American Psycho," Bale's finest hour
","Yes, many enjoyed Christian Bale's (excellent) turn as Bruce Wayne in Nolan's Batman trilogy. However, there are few occasions where an actor shines so bright that it becomes impossible to see anyone else ever playing the role. In this case... yuppie, eighties serial killer 'Patrick Bateman.' 'American Psycho' started off life as a book (which I strongly recommend you read if you enjoyed the film) and sat around in filmic-limbo for years before it finally made its way to the big screen. The book was one of those titles where die-hard fans argued so hard that it was 'impossible' to make into a film that no studio dared go that extra mile and attempt it.Now, the end result is certainly different to the book. The book had numerous complex points and sub-plots which would have stretched the film out for hours. However, just because the film skips vast areas, doesn't mean it doesn't hit the nail on the head. What you're left with is a 'summarised' version of the film (and a very good one).Patrick Bateman is the titular 'American Psycho' who works on Wall Street in the eighties and leads a double life as a high-flying businessman and a complete nut-job who, by his own admission like to 'dissect women.' And he does just that.Feminists have given many labels to this film which indicate that it's misogynistic and demeaning to women. They may have a point here and there. Bateman (along with his cronies) regularly objectify women and are basically only after one thing (two in Bateman's case, as he also likes to murder his dates). However, we're never shown that this is some sort of example for men to adhere to. We only tolerate Bateman's madness because he entertains us. The only thing that equals his brutality is his charm (as, apparently, is a trait of many a convicted killer/psychopath) and he, like Bale who performs him, is a joy to watch.There isn't as much gore as you may expect (certainly the book is a million times more graphic) and much of the violence is left up to the viewers' imagination (what did he do with that coat hanger after all?), so gore-hounds beware – if you're just looking for the 'red stuff,' you may be left feeling short-changed.Fan of Bale will probably already have seen it. It's certainly a vehicle for him to keep on his C.V. It never claims to be nice and you're going to have to be into 'serial killer' type movies to get something out of it. Just – whatever you do – don't watch the sequel (or feed me a stray cat).",10,0,0,3 November 2014
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," No matter what you say... it's still better than Part IV
","One of the main problems with 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' was that it had to follow not only the original 'Terminator' movie, but its (arguably better) sequel, 'T2: judgement Day,' therefore whatever came next had not just one, but TWO tough acts to follow. In short – it didn't.It does its best to follow the plot of the first two movies, i.e. bad cyborg sent back through time by the machine-rulers of the future to kill humanity's last hope for survival versus protector (also from the future), however, it comes across as a Terminator-made-for-TV movie. If it wasn't for the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the titular cyborg, it has a real sense of being a lot less epic than its predecessors.For a start, it's shorter, secondly, the effects don't seem to have improved much since the groundbreaking 'liquid metal' SFX from T2 and it never really makes us care much about the characters. Linda Hamilton did not want to reprise her role as the iconic action heroine Sarah Connor, leaving Claire Danes to do her best to fill her shoes. And, if you've been following Edward Furlong's 'career' since he made his name as the young John Connor from T2, you'll know that he wasn't in much shape to reprise his role. Instead, Nick Stahl tries his best to play humanity's future leader and, although credit for making him look like his (on screen) father, Kyle Reece, is never really given much to do apart from look confused at the fact that the Terminator has returned. In other words... T1/2 produced real characters who stuck with us through the ages whereas T3 rushes us from one chase scene to the next and it's over before you know it.Don't get me wrong – I didn't hate Part III. I own it and watch it every few years (just not as much as the first two, obviously!). It has its good parts – mainly Schwarzenegger. He still holds his own, even playing – technically – a new cyborg from the last two instalments. It's also worth noting that Part 3 is a '12' certificate, therefore don't expect the overall dark tone from the other two. There are more wisecracks here which lighten the mood.But, even if you do hate it, it's still pretty good fun watching two indestructible cyborgs go toe to toe and the ending is actually quite good. Perhaps the worst thing about it was that it's great ending leads us effortlessly into Part IV (aka Salvation) and we all know how that one turned out (sorry Christian Bale, but a Terminator is not a Terminator movie without Mr Schwarzenegger taking the lead role).",8,3,6,26 June 2016
The Orphanage," Creepy little ghost story
","In ghost story terms, there's nothing particularly new about 'The Orphanage' – it follows the modern ghost story formula pretty well, i.e. family moves into new location, strange things happen, no one believes them, contact expert to clarify supernatural element and then climax. The Orphanage ticks all those boxes and in that order. However, just because its story isn't that original, doesn't mean it's bad.It's Spanish, for a start. I don't know why I always give foreign films more leeway when it comes to acting terms. Maybe it's the subtitles that mean I can't really tell a 'good' foreign actor from a 'bad' one. But, the acting certainly seems well up there to me. It's about a couple who have adopted a young boy and move back into an old orphanage to refurbish it and open it up for taking on new children. However, things go more than a little wrong when their son starts developing 'imaginary' friends and then vanishes completely during the opening event and, no, they don't find that he's been taken into the TV, ala, Poltergeist.See? Nothing particularly new there, but it's the film's overall tone, direction and acting which elevates it about the – literally – thousands of similar clones which infest DVD bargain buckets at your local petrol station. The setting is great and I've already mentioned the acting. But it's simply the foreboding feel of dream and despair that keeps you watching.Basically, if you like your ghost stories slow-burning and creepy (and don't mind subtitles) then give this one a go. It moves slowly to a sensible ending and doesn't have any hordes of CGI monsters or major action sequences, so don't be expecting a horror marathon of epic proportions. Just expect something subtle and dark.",7,0,2,17 July 2016
"I, Robot"," Aging just about okay
","Just because Will Smith still looks only about a week older than he did in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it doesn't mean that all his films do. I remember watching 'I Robot' back in 2004 and being pretty impressed, so much so that I eventually bought it on DVD and have watched it a couple more times over the years. Now, some twelve years later, I put it on my big-screen TV and have noticed that a few cracks are beginning to show.No, not cracks on Will Smith's face. He still looks as (annoyingly!) young as ever, more cracks in the overall production – namely the CGI. Yes, a futuristic world partially-populated by robots was always destined to require a fair amount of computer effects to bring it to life. I guess I just didn't realise quite how many at the time. Now it's kind of looking like a Star Wars prequel – you can almost spot every single 'blue screen' behind the principal actors.Anyway, I'm just starting with my (new) gripe because I noticed it more this time around. I should really be saying that – despite now obvious CGI – 'I Robot' is actually quite fun. Will Smith doesn't really stretch his acting abilities playing basically Will Smith in Men in Black, Will Smith in Independence Day and Will Smith in I am Legend, only this time he's a cynical cop who dislikes robots (despite them never actually have been charged with committing a crime in this near future world we're watching). Anyway, when a robot is accused of murdering someone, Will Smith's paranoia goes into overdrive and he goes on a witch-hunt to prove our alleged metal helpers have a darker agenda.Basically, if you like Will Smith in general, you'll love this. If you like sci-fi and action combined (loosely) with a kind of conspiracy movie then you'll also probably love this. It's good, harmless fun. I did see on the internet people moaning that it wasn't as 'faithful' to whatever source material that it was based on by Isaac Asimov, but since when did Hollywood ever follow the source material that faithfully? What you have here is a fun little popcorn blockbuster movie. It's designed to appeal to as many people as possible and if you're not expecting too much then you should be pleasantly surprised (just don't expect lavishly-built sets – it's all CGI!).And it does leave you wanting your own robot to walk your dog, do your laundry and generally all those boring chores that get in the way of surfing the net, Playstation and all those really 'important' things we have to do!",8,0,1,12 April 2016
BASEketball," Live action 'South Park'
","Okay, so 'Baseketball' hasn't really got anything to do with the adult cult animated TV show, but it stars both its writers/creators and is basically the same sense of humour, i.e. adult. In short if you like South Park, you should like 'Baseketball.' It's about two losers (Trey and Matt – the men behind South Park) who invent a new game which is basically a cross between basketball and baseball in their driveway.Before long it becomes a national pastime. As with South Park, a lot of the humour is vulgar, crude, disgusting and totally 'adult' in nature. You could be forgiven for thinking that Baseketball is nothing more than a low-brow gross-out comedy (and you may have a point!), but, also like South Park, it has its moments of satire and social commentary that raise it to more than just Trey and Matt's version of 'American Pie.' The jokes come thick and fast and, if you've seen Trey and Matt in action, you'll realise that they're basically playing themselves. Yes, there is some character development (believe it or not!), but the film is geared towards laughs over story and plot. And, because of this, it totally succeeds. As soon as you sit down to watch it, you'll be able to predict where exactly it's going, but don't let that put you off. So I'll end where I basically began by saying that if you like South Park (and I do!), you'll enjoy this.",8,4,4,15 June 2015
Wanted," One of those movies that is very underrated
","Maybe 'Wanted' wasn't as successful as - I thought - it should be when it was released back in 2008 because these sorts of (semi) superhero movies were only just coming into fashion? Maybe it's because it was based on a comic book that wasn't that well-known and the film's producers annoyed the die-hard fan by changing various elements? Or maybe it's because it's got a pretty 'uninspired' title which doesn't really tell you what the film is about? It could just be someone posting something on Craig's List! Either way... I loved it then and I'm pleased to say that it stands up to this day.It's about a young man Wesley (James McAvoy, before he really hit the big time in Hollywood) playing a young man who doesn't know his place in life. He medicates himself daily while working in a dead end job (don't we all?) and is routinely victimised by his boss while his girlfriend is having an affair with his best mate. However, his life takes a slightly more wild turn when a femme fatale known as Fox (Angelia Jolie) inducts him into a super secret society of assassins known as 'The Fraternity' led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and together they'll... well, you'll have to see, but there's naturally various bad guys to kill and noble causes to fight.I suppose the plot isn't that radical to attract much attention, however, it has all the look and feel of a good comic book you could ever want. Now, I call that a plus, whereas I think a lot of people saw it as a drawback. Largely, because these assassins are pretty damn amazing - their main 'special ability' being the knack of 'bending bullets' so they can bend the missiles around corners. Yes, it's a little far-fetched, but this is a comic book movie and if you can get over this then I think you'll have a really good time.If you're expecting something uber serious and gritty then look away now. There are more than a few times where the film does things simply for laughs and to not just bend bullets, but also the movie's reality. It never really takes itself that seriously and so is a lot more fun and popcorn-worthy than some type of 'darker' modern action movie like Daniel Craig's 'Bond' franchise or the 'Bourne' moviesYes, there's nothing that new here, but the fact that it's a great action movie with A-list stars and set pieces that make the most of the unique 'fighting premise' that exists in this movie world should be enough to give it at least a 'cult following' and stop it fading into complete obscurity.",8,3,4,13 July 2019
Warrior," A bit like Rocky, but with kicks as well
","Warrior tells the story of two brothers who, throughout a turbulent period of growing up, no longer get on. One is a marine, the other a school teacher. And, they both happen to be extraordinarily good at cage fighting. They enter a tournament. Who will win? I don't normally like these sorts of fighting films (I'm about the only child of the 80s not to like the Rocky saga!), but I have to say this one kept me watching. It does follow the 'Rocky-style' ideal of the underdog working his way up and winning against the odds.It's a bit long. There were a few scenes that I felt could have been cut, but, for some reason, overall I found it compelling. I wasn't that drawn in to the characters, but the feel was something pretty epic about the whole affair.I'm not sure whether I'd want to watch it again, but I'm certainly glad I saw it. Maybe if you're into these sorts of fight movies, you'll appreciate it more than me?",7,0,1,8 February 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Even my mum likes this film
","Terminator 2: Judgement Day is possibly the perfect film – well, if you're into science fiction seamlessly blended with the exact amount of action. And, to be fair, most of us can quite appreciate that sort of genre if it's done right. And it's done right here. This list will be little more than a list of everything that's perfect about this film.In case you don't know (and there must be one of you), T2 is a sequel, concerning some particularly nasty machines who have all but wiped us humans out in the near future and intend to make sure we stay well and truly exterminated by sending a unstoppable (human-looking) killer cyborg back through time to kill the only man capable of stopping them while he's still a child. Luckily, for us fleshbags, the last humans of our future have captured a (slightly less) unstoppable cyborg and have sent him back through time to protect our future leader, John Connor.All four lead actors give pitch-perfect performances here, but perhaps the most forgotten actor is Robert Patrick who plays the bad cyborg, aka the T-1000. He doesn't have that many lines, but his creepiness is portrayed through his movements and sheer coldness. Plus he's overshadowed by his own special effects. T2 set the bar pretty high in terms of special effects for its day. The computer generated moments where the T-1000 morphs into various people (and objects!) is blended with the live actors around it.Our heroine, Sarah Connor, starts off incarcerated in a mental institution for constantly raving about then end of the world when she's not trying to blow computer factories up. But don't let that fool you into thinking that she's merely a damsel in distress. Linda Hamilton has become the ultimate in female action heroes (possibly only coming second to Aliens' 'Ripley'). Not only can she handle any sort of firearm, but she's as determined as the Terminator to protect her son, John. He's played by newcomer Edward furlong and, for someone who has never acted before, he plays his role brilliantly. So many films centred around a child are hard to watch because you actually end up wanting the whinging/screaming brat to be skewered by a cyborg assassin. Not here though. The only thing negative about Edward Furlong was that he displayed so much talent and promise here that he never lived up to it (I'm sure if you Google him you'll find out what I mean).But, everyone is overshadowed by Schwarzenegger himself. Out of all the films he's done, this is Arnie's most memorable. Some say he can't act, but I wouldn't be that harsh. The trick is giving him a part that suits him. Sir Ian McKellen or Anthony Hopkins are great actors, but I doubt they could carry playing the T-800 himself.Finally, Terminator 2 hast heart. It's not just a mindless action flick; it actually has quite nice morals to it and reminds us that hurting other people is wrong and, unless we intend to blow each other up in all out nuclear war, we better start remembering that.If I had to say one negative thing about T2 (and I suppose I ought to, simply for balance) it's that the plot is basically recycled from the first film. Although this sequel is in the minority of sequels where it does surpass the original, it does copy exactly the same timeline of events. Still, once you start watching two emotionless cyborgs throwing each other through walls, you probably won't care! T2 is for everyone. If you like Arnie, you'll love it. If you like action or sci-fi, you'll love it. And, if you're not into any of those, I dare you to watch it anyway. It might not change your mind about the genre, but I think you'll have a good time.",10,3,6,3 June 2016
We're the Millers," Not as funny as I thought it would be
","I have to say that, judging by the trailer, I was looking forward to this. It had a simple premise, i.e. a bunch of misfits masquerade as an 'all-American' family in order to smuggle drugs across the border from Mexico. Every step of the way I was waiting (and wanting!) it to get better, but it never really seemed to.Don't get me wrong - it's not terrible. I wasn't left feeling like I'd wasted nearly two hours of my life on it. However, there just weren't enough jokes in the film. Sometimes it felt like it was going whole scenes without anything funny happening and, when the jokes did come, they were a bit predictably and I felt like I'd seen them before in other films.It wasn't the actors' faults - they'll all good and they've all played better in other films - the film was just seemed like it was so meant to be funnier, yet didn't seem to pull it off. The film tries to add an element of danger by having the family pursued by real 'hard core' drug dealers, but the 'baddies' were only in a few scenes and every time they popped up, it had been so long since I last saw them, I practically forgot they were even in the movie! Yes, the (now infamous) 'Jennifer Aniston stripping scene' will always make the film stand out in the mind of many guys (embarrassingly, me included), but I'd have happily swapped it out for a few more decent jokes. The story deserved to be funnier, yet seemingly the best the writers can come up with is a big spider biting a guys on his...This is a film you'd probably want to rent over own.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,1,2,4 August 2014
Van Helsing," Good, but somehow not as great as it should be
","'Van Helsing' has always been a bit of an enigma to me. I own it and have watched it every so often and I can never quite put my finger on what exactly is wrong with it. Obviously, I quite like it, but it always leaves me with the feeling that it should have - somehow - been so much better.The film was practically made for me - I love Hugh Jackman and he makes a great 'monster hunter.' Kate Beckinsale is naturally sexy as his kick-a$$ love interest. David Wenham adds some comic relief as Van Helsing and Richard Roxborough is brilliantly campy as Count Dracula. Then there are more monsters crammed into this film than Jabba the Hutt's palace. What more could I want? Um, I don't exactly know, but I'm not alone in my confusion. Van Helsing was supposed to be the start of some sort of action/horror franchise. It was certainly given the budget and star-power to launch such a venture. However, it was - almost - a financial flop. It was sort of successful, but not enough to get a proper sequel (there is a lower budget animated one, but that wasn't the original intention).Perhaps it's the overuse of CGI? Sometimes everything on screen starts to blur into one mass of animation. Perhaps it's that the characters are a little too indestructible to be believable. Seriously... these (supposedly totally human) characters get dropped from great heights again and again and just get up like nothing has happened - a minor gripe, but it always bugged me.If you're a fan of 'old school' horror, i.e. you know about the Dracula/Frankenstein myths then you might like this, because it certainly pays homage to the classics. It has a lot of charm (kudos to Frankenstein's monster and Drac himself), but somehow falls slightly short of being the modern day classic it was meant to be.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,2,4,2 September 2014
Divergent," The Hunger Games by another name
","Some girl in a dystopian future decides to buck the system when she discovers she's *vaguely* special and, in doing so, finds love while helping to bring down the corrupt regime of the time. Sound familiar? It is. Whoever wrote 'Divergent' obviously has read The Hunger Games and changed a few things here and there.But is it any good? The answer to that question really does depend on whether you liked The Hunger Games or not. If you did, you'll love this. If you didn't, this one isn't for you. It basically follows all the same rules. Instead of kids fighting it out for food, ala Hunger Games, you have kids who are split into five (supposedly radically) different factions after they complete a test in their early adolescent years. This *slightly trippy* test determines which faction they're destined to be part of for the rest of their lives.Of course if they don't agree with the test results they don't have to be part of that faction (I didn't get that bit). Then they all sit around in a big room and pick up a handful of rocks which tells them which faction they're going to be in (completely negating the test they took only days earlier). There are various factions which they could be in, all of which have names like the 'houses' in the Harry Potter films. However, about the only faction you'll remember is 'Dauntless' which is made up of some of the most annoying people you'll ever meet. They're supposed to be 'protecting' society, yet all they do is run around the streets making whooping and cheering noises while generally getting in everyone's way and practically knocking over old ladies. Our heroine (not Kaniss, but someone just like her) is conscripted into this band of nutters. However, she isn't destined to be a simple 'Dauntless' lass, she has traits from ALL the different factions, thus making her a 'Divergent'. And, apparently, being a Divergent means you need to be hunted down until you die.But, help is on hand for our Katniss-clone, in the form of a blatantly older hunky guy who'll have a love/hate relationship with her until he eventually decides he loves her.Yes, it has a budget, so the scenery is nicely futuristic and the actors play their parts well. They're either hunky and good. Hunky and evil, or hunky and annoying.I'm not sure how well this film will be received by cynical older males such as myself. However, I really don't think I'm its target audience. It's aimed at kids and, I'm reliable informed, the kids loved it.Does anyone else hear the words 'Hunger Games-sequel/franchise?' (Sorry, I meant DIVERGENT sequel/franchise!)",6,0,0,30 August 2014
Ender's Game," Ender's in school
","Okay, so I'll admit I didn't like this film as much as I wanted to. I'm a fan of big-budget sci-fi and alien invasion movies in general, so was hoping for an 'us versus them' kind of vibe.I haven't read the book, so perhaps anyone who has will already know what I found out namely that the film is basically all about Ender who's training to fight a second (alleged) alien attack on Earth. And train he does. About 75% of the film is about him in a sort of space school/boot camp. He doesn't do that much fighting of aliens.Apparently we (Earth) need kids to fight for us. This is because er we just do, okay? Moving on And, while these wonderkids are preparing to take on every last intergalactic nasty, they spend their time being bullied. Ender gets bullied at his school on Earth. Then he goes home to his family to be bullied by his older brother. Finally, when he makes it to boot camp he's bullied there, too. And, when he shines out among his peers he's then elevated to a squad of cadets including the biggest (or should I say 'smallest?') bully ever to grace the screen.This film is rated '12' here in the UK and I reckon that if I was still a twelve-year-old boy then I would have loved it. Sadly, I'm an adult now and found it all a little boring.But, it's not all so bad. This boy who plays Ender does a really good job and will doubtless grow up to become a pretty big name in Hollywood. Plus you have Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley – both of which turn in typically excellent performances.Not my cup of tea, but I'm sure it'll find an audience somewhere. Now I just need to know where I can play 'zero gravity Quasar' – I may not be twelve any more, but that looks like serious fun!",6,2,4,26 June 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Seriously... what are you expecting?
","I'll be straight with you... if you don't like this movie then it's YOUR fault! What are you expecting from a supernatural monster-hunting film, roughly based on a children's fairytale? It's not Shakespeare. It will never be remembered as a classic. There's no real character development or radical revelations about the deeper meaning of humanity.What there is, is plenty of hideous witches getting blasted off their broomsticks by annoyingly attractive people with weapons that probably didn't exist when this film was probably set.That's it. Shooting. Action. Witches screeching and the two leads posturing as they show how much sexier they are compared to us. Are you into that? Can you handle that? If so, give it a go - it's a daft, silly, splat-fest of a blast.Remove your brain (you don't need it to appreciate this) and just back and enjoy it for all its silliness.",7,0,0,28 September 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good thriller - proof that remake aren't always bad?
","I can't really justify my title. I confess... I haven't seen the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, so I can't compare how the American version fares.If you haven't read the book or seen the original (like me), it's about a disgraced journalist who enlists the help of a slightly emotionally unstable computer hacker to help him solve a murder that's been troubling a millionaire for decades. And it's fun. As it's the first in the trilogy, you don't need to have read the books first. Everything is explained and neatly wrapped up at the end (will there also be a US sequel? We will have to wait and see).It is on the long side, so you might want to allocate a good two and a half hours to watching it.It's worth it though - it could be because David Fincher directed it, but I found it pretty similar to Se7en.",7,0,3,14 September 2014
Being John Malkovich," Has to be seen to be believed
","'Being John Malkovich' had to be one of the hardest films to get made. I can't imagine how the sales pitch must have gone. I figure writer (and possible madman?!) Charlie Kaufman must have used words like 'portal, puppets, low ceilings' and 'multitude of over-s3xed old people piling into the mind of a Hollywood actor.' Yes, all those things happen.You could simply describe the film as 'weird,' but that would probably do the film a great disservice. It's simply a masterpiece and possibly has to be seen to be believed. It's so bizarre and off-the-wall that you enter a world where anything can happen, but at the same time, seems somehow relatable and 'real.'I won't go into the plot in too much detail. First of all I would never want to spoil such a classic. Once you get into it you'll soon realise that the story could literally go anywhere and you'll only get the one chance at watching it without knowing how it will all end up. Secondly, if I gave a detailed plot synopsis you probably would think I'm making it up. It sort of centres around Craig (John Cusack) and his desire to be a puppeteer which isn't really making him or his wife (Cameron Diaz) any money. So he takes a filming job where he meets a sultry co-worker, Maxine (Katherine Keener) who he immediately falls for. However, what starts off as what could just potentially could be yet another love triangle soon goes off the rails when the trio discover a small tunnel in Craig's office which leads directly into John Malkovich's head. From there, things really get weird.All four of the central protagonists are brilliant and memorable in their own right (the fourth main cast member being of course - Malkovich - playing a warped version of himself as he struggles to figure out what's going on inside his head. There are a few peripheral characters too who also play their part and whose kookiness all help add to the surreal madness.For all 'Being John Malkovich's' brilliance, it's probably not a film you can have on in the background and fully appreciate. It's something you have to invest a couple of hours into to get the most out of it. And, if you do, I think you'll find a film that is just as good (and a damn sight more novel) than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood these days. However, if you're looking for a 'negative take,' I was once discussing this film with my friend and he didn't like it. I couldn't believe anyone could hate this film and, when I asked him what he found so bad, he simply said that the whole premise was too 'unrealistic.' What does he know, eh?",10,2,2,6 April 2020
Face_Off," One of the most over-the-top films ever made (and great fun too)
","'Face/Off' is a kind of simple film for simple people (and I'm including myself in that demographic). Take one bad guy (Nicholas Cage – cranked up to 11) and then, through a series of bizarre and totally implausible events, he finds himself with his face – literally – swapped with the good guy/cop (John Travolta –also doing his best to crank his performance up to 11) who's out to catch him. Now, no one believes which one is which and the two of them start trying to take over each other's lives (while trying to murder each other, obviously).If that brief plot summary hasn't made you ask more than a few questions regarding the hows and whys of it all, then you really are an expert at suspending your disbelief. Most people would already be picking holes in the story. So, if you're looking for a watertight plot with no holes in it, you probably should really skip this one.Luckily, Face/Off his just so much fun that you'll find it easy to gloss over the general absurdities of it all, sit back, break open the popcorn and just roll with it. It is one of the most obviously over-the-top films ever made and, if the plot wasn't over-the-top enough, then the two leads – Cage and Travolta – spend the film constantly trying to outdo each other as to how extreme they can make their performances. So, take the over-the-top film, add the completely over-the-top performances then, just to finish it off, add the completely unrealistic gunfights and those weird 'Hollywood-type' explosions where fireworks seem to shoot out of the flames.What you effectively have here is a B-movie with a decent cast and budget. It carries the film through and will always elevate it over the general mediocre action flicks that go straight to DVD. Basically, it's a classic – not in the same way as the 'Godfather' or 'Empire Strikes Back,' but it is a classic for what it is – and what it is is big, dumb, stupid fun. So, if you can appreciate that sort of film, you should definitely get something out of this.Best bit: Nicholas Cage dressed as a priest 'headbanging' in a chorus. I will remember that until the day I die.",8,2,5,16 March 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Which number is this in the franchise?
","I've just watched 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.' I notice that for a film in an ongoing franchise, it doesn't actually have a number attached to the title. I'm guessing this is generally because it doesn't matter which one it is. If you've seen any of the previous instalments (excluding the original which requires some sort of post doctorate in nuclear physics to understand the numerous double-crossing plot threads) then you'll know what you're getting. The 'MI' franchise has certainly settled into a formula and, try as I might to hate it for basically doing the same thing over and over again, I have to confess that I thoroughly enjoyed it (after all, if Marvel can do it, why can't Tom?!).Tom Cruise plays oh, does it matter? He basically plays Tom Cruise playing a sort of James Bond role where his team of secret agents has to stop (yet another) super villainous organisation from overthrowing Britain. As a Brit, I could probably take offense at us needing saving, but my fellow countryman Simon 'Shaun of the Dead' Pegg is helping him out, so I guess I'll let that one slide. He accomplishes this through numerous high-octane car chases, gun fights and stunts – none of which leaving so much as a scratch on our hero.Oh, dear – three paragraphs in and I'm already running out of things to say about 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.' I'm guessing that's because there's not much that can be said about it that you haven't already seen written about the others. In all the film franchises of recent times (including the reliably similar Marvel movies) this is just about as identical in structure as those that have come before it. In a nutshell: if you like Tom Cruise then you'll probably like this. If you've liked any of the previous instalments (2-4) then you'll also like this. Of course if you haven't seen any of them and you're just a fan of action movies with a pinch of spy/doublecross involved, again you'll get something out of it. You don't really need to know what's come before. You can join the franchise here or at any point after the first film. Just put your brain in 'neutral' and enjoy the nicely-choreographed action scenes and Tom Cruise fighting wave after wave of useless henchmen. Sheer popcorn fun.Oh, and I've just checked online. It appears that yet another 'Mission Impossible' film is pencilled in for 2018. Gee, I wonder what that one will be like?! It's fair to say that I'll be watching it either way. The only downside will be that when I come to review it I'll probably have even less original observations to make about it than I did here!",7,0,0,19 May 2017
Jarhead," Excellent war movie - without much war!
","I can take or leave war films, however, I have to say this one is pretty good, especially as it contains a real lack of any actual fighting.It centres on one man's - Anthony Swofford's - personal tale of life in the modern (well, early nineties) American army. He's not an officer, or in any particular position of authority - he's a grunt, a foot-soldier, or a 'Jarhead.' After Saddam Hussein first invades Kuwait, the US ship out their Jarheads to wait for the order to attack. This is the story of the wait.Therefore, we never see our Jarheads charging heroically over the top or anything similar. It's just about the wait. Now, that may not sound like the most exciting premise for a movie, but I think that's the point. Jarhead isn't really meant to be exciting. It's more of a drama about men from lower class America, who don't really have many career options and enlist as a way of making a living.I really enjoyed it. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as the put-upon Jarhead at the centre of the film and, overall, it's well worth a watch, even if you're not a fan of war movies in general.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,1,20 May 2014
Dark City," The Thinking Man's Matrix
","It's hard to imagine the classic 1999 film 'The Matrix' starring Rufus Sewell in the lead, fighting an evil Agent played by a pasty bald Richard O'Brian. Yet, believe it or not, there is an 'early version' of the film that's just like that. 'Dark City' was released only one year earlier and it's basically the same premise, only it never achieved such greatness or Box Office success. But don't let that put you off.I love 'The Matrix.' It's very cool and you can't help but be wowed by the cyber-tech and, back then, the 'bullet-time' special effects were revolutionary for their day. Plus you had the highly-bankable Keanu Reeves in the lead and, no matter how wooden his performance, we all love to watch him. Therefore, 'The Matrix' just seemed to hit all the right notes at the right time (don't get me started on the sequels - that's a whole other story!). 'Dark City' didn't really have any of that. Rufus Sewell is a competent leading man, but you get the feeling that his part could have been played by any good looking guy, the same goes for his love interest Jennifer Connolly. It also doesn't have special effects that will make you think that you've never seen anything like that before. It's leads are competent, as are what effects the film utilises (nowadays I see a precursor to 'Inception' in there, too). It's dark (as the title suggests) and Gothic, portraying the film as a sombre and depressing affair, as opposed to 'The Matrix's' high-tech and uber-coolness. Therefore, 'Dark City' doesn't look or sound like anything that original. However, if you don't dwell on any of that (or just haven't seen 'The Matrix' - there must be a couple of you out there!) then this is really something pretty special.Yes, the film is quite (and I hate to keep using this word, but there really isn't any other that sums it up) 'dark.' It is certainly not a 'feel-good' film, but where it really succeeds is its sheer concept. Rufus Sewell wakes up in a flat with no memory of who he is. The only thing he knows is that there's a dead body in the apartment and it looks very much like he's the killer. Therefore, he sets out to find out who he is and whether he did it. Now, along the way he discovers that it's not just him who has a dark (there's that word again) past, but also his whole world. And that brings me nicely on to the baddies of the film - the 'Strangers.' Instead of 'The Matrix's' 'agents' you have a horde of black-trenchcoat-clad bald men with pasty faces hell-bent on thwarting our hero's efforts at every turn. And they really are great. Whether it's the fact that they refer to each other by weird noun-like names, i.e. 'Mr Hand' and 'Mr Foot,' or its' because they have one little boy-version of themselves who is just downright creepy (and don't get me started on their 'powers'). All in all, they're some of the best movie-villains ever created.If you like your sci-fi 'action-packed' and full of explosions and battles then you probably won't really enjoy this. I love it, but I don't watch it often - that's because you really need to be in the mood to sit down and watch quite a thoughtful film that really gets under your skin. There are some small fist-fights and superpowered skirmishes just in case you're wondering and I'm glad it seems that this film has found its own place in the world with a dedicated cult following. However, it will always be overshadowed by 'The Matrix,' but I believe that 'Dark City' is different and special enough to warrant its own place in your collection alongside Keanu trilogy.",9,2,3,2 March 2018
Dunkirk," Great style, less substance
","'Dunkirk' is a great film. And it's not. I really enjoyed a lot of it. And yet I can't see me ever watching it again. It's a two-hour account of one of the most famous 'retreats' in modern warfare (or, if I'm being cynical... a longer version of the opening credits to 'Dad's Army' - boom, boom!) where British and French troops were forced to fall back across the English channel after a failed attempt to recapture occupied France from German forces.It's a 'Christopher Nolan film' and he is undoubtedly an amazing writer/director, meaning so much care and attention has been put into every last scene. He chooses a majority of 'practical effects' over computer-generated ones and it really does add to the 'realism' of it all. The overall look and feel of the film really is up there with 'Saving Private Ryan' in terms of how closely it resembles the actual events it portrays.There were so many moments of real horror when thousands of young men are - literally - 'sitting ducks' for German forces to simply pick off at their leisure. You really do get a sense of how terrible it must have been for the soldiers when faced with such inevitable death.So, if everything is so atmospheric, why do I feel a little let down by it all. Like I said, it's around two hours long and made up of three different stories, all relating to the conflict. One is about how the war was fought in the air (mainly through the eyes of Tom Hardy's Spitfire pilot), the second is about the boats crossing the English channel to rescue the stricken troops and the final is about Kenneth Branagh's General who is trying to get his men off the beach and onto some sort of safe transport back home.Nothing wrong with having multiple stories, but - when it comes to characters - it seems like this film is trying to be more of a documentary/recreation, rather than a story with a cast of characters we can relate to. I know there have been other 'historical' films ('Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour') that have tried to inject a (love!) story into the proceedings and got critisised for that. 'Dunkirk' is the exact opposite of those and you'd think it would be all the better for it. However, there just didn't seem to be any real 'star' of the film to really get behind.Yes, One Direction singer Harry Styles is in it and actually does pretty well at acting. You could argue that Tom Hardy is the star, but seeing as he spends the film - technically - on his own in a one-man Spitfire, he doesn't get much in the way of other characters to play off. It's also worth noting that there are never any German characters to see. Here, they're just a 'faceless enemy' who we never see, other than the destruction their artillery causes.If you're looking for a film that really captures the atmosphere of a very horrific battle in World War II then this ticks every box. However, if you're looking for a dramatic cast of characters it does fall a little short. Overall, it's memorable scenes will stay with me for a long time, so I certainly don't feel like I've wasted my times watching it.",7,0,1,12 August 2019
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher (good fun)
","Okay, I'll admit I'm a bit fan of Cameron Diaz (please don't ask why), so you must appreciate that this review is heavily biased.Comedies are fun, only many aren't funny. This one actually is. Okay, so it doesn't offer anything particularly original and it is a bit vulgar at times (even I was shocked by the language - without the few four letter words, it could have been cut down to a 12 certificate!), but it's just fun - fun, fun, fun. Daft, silly, frivolous and perfect to unwind to.Like most people, you're probably used to seeing Cameron Diaz as a nice girl-next-door type. She probably relished the chance to let her evil side shine (and shine it does). She should be bad more often. She's even better bad than she it good.In short, don't expect spectacular, just chill out and expect fun.(I also wish that Cameron Diaz was my teacher when I was young - again, don't ask why)http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,2,5,28 May 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," My Spidey senses were tingling, but this film was surprisingly good
","Okay, no one was more cynical than me when I heard the news that Hollywood was 'rebooting' Spiderman only a couple of years after Spiderman 3 was released. I thought it was a complete pointless waste of time. Tobey Maguire's version was so popular, I didn't see how it could be repeated.Yes, The Amazing Spiderman is a repeat, but, amazingly, it's not as bad as I thought. In fact, I almost enjoyed it more than the original.I read a lot of internet message boards which criticise BOTH versions from not staying truthful to the source material, i.e. the comics. But, seeing as I've never read any of those, I can't tell which one sticks closer. One of my main gripes with Tobey Maguire's version was that it felt a little too 'cartoony' with its bad computer-generated special effects and teen-choice feel.The Amazing Spiderman is also centred around high school kids (from what I knew of the comic, Peter Parker was a MAN, not a boy, but anyway...). However, the whole affair seems a lot darker. The Lizard is a good baddie to start off with. It would have been nice to see the (proper) Green Goblin (i.e. not just a man in a green suit of armour), but I'm guessing he'll crop up later on in the franchise.Andrew Garfield is a better hero than Maguire. Despite both playing teenagers, Garfield is also moody and darker, revelling in his newfound powers and even taunting his (lesser) enemies. It seems that the makers of this film looked at Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise with its 'flawed hero' mould and decided to borrow that style to make Peter Parker a little less 'squeaky clean.' My opinion: it was all the better for it.Yes, you cannot escape the fact that this film is basically the same one you probably watched ten years ago, but with a different cast. However, if you can get over that and accept that that's just how Hollywood rolls these days, you should enjoy it as a decent entry into the superhero genre.",7,0,2,1 January 2015
Aliens," Not bad for a... human (made film)
","If you're into sci-fi then you should have seen Aliens by now. It's the - not particularly imaginatively - titled sequel to the 1979 'haunted house is space' film Alien. And, depending on how you like your science fiction, will determine exactly which of the two you'll like the best (it's worth noting that whichever one you pick, you'll probably agree that they're both up there with the best science fiction films ever made).Alien is dark, quiet and moody. Its successor is loud, brash and big as it follows the sole survivor of the first film, Ellen Ripley, as she returns to Earth after floating in space for 57 years, only to find that the planet where she first encountered the xenomorph has been colonised. Then - guess what - all contact is lost with colony and she has to accompany a team of space marines in a rescue mission (that does not go well).Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for her performance. However, it's hard to pick out a stand-out performance here. It's rare in a movie when you know that half of the cast are going to end up on the wrong end of a monster's teeth to really care about them. Yet, here you find yourself rooting for even the lowliest of cast members.The best part of Aliens (just like Star Wars) is that it's 'timeless.' We're now nearly thirty years on from its creation and yet it still looks as good. The special effects (and general atmosphere) beat anything made today and current films could really take a lead out of its book when it comes to using miniature models over excessive CGI.If you haven't seen Aliens, you should. Normally I would recommend it for fans of the action/sci-fi/horror genres. However, this is a film that defined the genre and has been copied (poorly) to this day (think the Resident Evil films to name but a few). Therefore, I truly believe people that don't always want to watch horror may ever enjoy it (maybe not as much as me, but I think most will appreciate that this is a behemoth in modern film history and should at least be respected, if not adored as much as I do).And remember... there's something moving in here and it ain't us!",10,4,6,19 October 2014
Goon," Sean William Scott's softer side
","Sean William Scott - an actor famous for playing idiots (no offense, Sean). Here, in 'Goon' he plays a bouncer called Doug Glatt - not your stereotypical 'touchy-feely' type, so, true to form, he takes a job that basically requires hitting people (albeit while playing ice hockey) because it's just about the only thing he's any good at.It would be so easy to class Doug Glatt as a thug - spending his days constantly attacking rival ice hockey teams. However, for some reason, he also comes across as quite a vulnerable character. He freely admits to not being a genius - fighting being the only thing he was ever good at. He constantly lives in the shadow of his - highly intelligent - brother and, as a result, is slightly looked down upon from his father. It's these qualities that allow us to feel some sympathy for a man who is always knocking other men's teeth out.Don't expect one of Sean William Scott's typical wacky American Pie type comedies - it's more of a drama, but with the odd humorous moment courtesy of the predicaments Glatt finds himself in.Worth a watch, even if Stiffler's 'softer side' does involves punching people's lights out.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,0,1,23 May 2014
Now You See Me," It's not often that a tag-line is true
","However, in the case of 'Now You See Me,' the marketing line which accompanies the promotional posters reads, 'Original, exciting and unpredictable.' And, amazingly, it is! It's certainly a novel concept - four magicians rob banks while they're on stage and donate the money to the audience - live! Naturally, the FBI has something to say about this and a cat and mouse game ensues.The first thing to say is that it's an 'all star' cast. Of course the only trouble is that, having so many talented actors in one place, means not all of them get the screen time/character development they deserve. The direction is slick and the film looks and feels like part of the 'MTV generation.' It is a case of 'style over substance,' but there's so much style that you should just sit back and enjoy the ride. Once you get involved in the chase then you'll forget about any slight lack of substance.With any big budget movie, you may have to 'suspend your disbelief' a bit, but, again, if you're munching popcorn and just enjoying trying to guess what's going to happen, you should be able to forgive the film for one or two leaps of faith.Now You See Me is absolute 'mind candy' - simply something to enjoy. Don't take it too seriously and you'll be guaranteed a couple of very entertaining hours film-watching.It is 'original, exciting and unpredictable,' but don't go adding 'realism' in there, or you may end up being a little disappointed.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,0,1,10 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," You may need an 'X-men refresher' course first
","I've already seen (and even own a few) of the X-men movies (and they various spin-offs/reboots). However, maybe I should have watched a few of them before I sat down to see 'X-men: Days of Future Past.' I will admit to getting a little confused with the plot, but, eventually, I settled into the film.I never could really work out whether the previous film 'First Class' was a reboot, or a prequel. Now I find it was just a prequel, as 'Days of Future Past' now cements the two universes together with that modern lynchpin of science-fiction, time travel.Star Trek got a lot of praise for merging the old and the new cast together (or at least the majority of the fanboys didn't kick off as much as the possible could). So, it seems that every sci-fi franchise feels okay using the 'time travel to create an alternate universe' scenario to gloss over any glitches merging the two films may throw up (Terminator: Genisys, I have my eye on you).We start in the future when giant robots (Sentinels) are mercilessly hunting both mutants and humans alike, cue a trip for our favourite cigar-chomping hero, Wolverine, to take a trip back in time to the seventies in order to make sure this future never sees the light of day. Therefore, the film-makers can crowbar in both the old cast (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and all) with the new lot (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender and so on). And, yes, it works – if you're okay with that sort of 'plot device.' It all feels well at home with the other X-men movies, not to mention distinctly different from Marvel's 'cinematic universe' of Iron Man, the Avengers and co. It's generally darker in tone and more serious, with less one-liners and colourful action. Not that the action isn't colourful (and even spectacular towards the climactic scenes), it just feels pretty computer generated. You get the CGI fiery person, the CGI icy person and the CGI sort of discount T-1000-type person as they battle their way through various CGI robots.But, if you can live with a CGI that probably should be a little better for the budget involved (not to mention (future) Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman's bad haircuts) then you should be able to appreciate this movie. Like I say, I got a little confused by the timelines and what everyone was doing. However, that would probably have been cleared up by watching what came before a little more recently. There's plenty of action, explosions and twists and turns in the plot. Plus – perhaps best of all – is that there's plenty of (fan favourite) Wolverine. Many had criticised his two stand-alone movies, whereas here he seems like the natural star who the film is basically all about. But, it's not just about him – there are plenty of other recognisable faces to entertain – just make sure you know your 'X-men lore' before you spend two hours watching this lot.",7,1,1,14 January 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Civil disobedience
","It's hard to believe that anyone would go and watch 'Captain America: Civil War' without actually knowing what it's about. And, in most cases, already seen the eight or so million previous films in the 'Marvel Shared Universe,' so I won't really go into a major recap – that what's Google is for! I'll just assume that you know about every superhero in great detail and tell you to watch this film.Whereas the first 'Cap' film was more or less a period piece with a bit of sci-fi/fantasy thrown in, the second was a kind of 'Jason Bourne' clone (with a bit of sci-fi/fantasy thrown in). Now, we're treated to what, although is technically the third Captain America movie, it could be looked at as being more akin to a third Avengers movie, due to the amount of other superheroes are given screen time.But, our 'Cap' is definitely the star. It's his team that trashes one major city too many in pursuit of a villain, meaning the powers that be decide superheroes need legislating. It's fair to say that Cap America disagrees, but not all of the Avengers to, hence the split in direction.Perhaps the best part of the story is that the opposing viewpoint is headed up by (fan favourite) Tony (Robert Downey Jr) Stark, aka, Iron Man. You've probably seen the promotional posters of Iron Man and Captain America squaring off, so you can see who each has on their side there. What we're then treated to is possibly the longest build up ever to what we really want to see.Most people have probably already been tipped off to the massive fight scene that takes place in an airport between rival sides. In any other film, people may get bored waiting or possibly find that it wasn't worth the wait when it finally came. Not here. You won't get bored. Civil War is not a short film, but it goes pretty damn quickly and you'll be totally entertained as the tension between the two factions is gradually build up in preparation for then they go toe to toe. It's all well worth it.Basically, if you have even only a little bit of interest in the Marvel Shared Universe then you'll love this. And most of us fan-boys have more than just a passing fascination with it, therefore we'll enjoy it more than most.It's no wonder that Batman vs Superman didn't do as well as expected when it was up against this. As much as I love the DC films, it just struggled to match this. I'd go as far as saying it's certainly the best 'stand-alone' Marvel film and probably better than the Age of Ulton.Yes, you can gripe about where the Hulk and Thor both are when all this is going on, but if you scour Youtube, you may just find quite a comedic answer to where the Norse god of thunder was all this time. Otherwise, sit back and just enjoy a film with more heart and soul than most people ever guessed.",9,2,10,12 September 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Looks great on Edgar Wright's CV
","The interestingly-titled 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' is based on a comic book about a young man who has to fight his new girlfriend's seven evil ex boyfriends. No, seriously. And, if the first question you're asking is 'Why?' then you're probably like me. First of all this is a movie (probably!) more for teenagers and youngsters (not bitter and cynical forty-somethings such as myself), therefore I'm guessing that most people will just go with it, rather than questioning every single plot point like I found myself doing.
I did enjoy the film - sort of. Once you allow yourself to get past just how ludicrous the plot is, you'll find that it is in fact quite funny. The titular Scott Pllgrim, played by the totally typecast Michael Cera, falls in love with a new girl in his town, only to discover that, in order to win her heart, he has to beat and pummel all her 'evil' exes one after another. And it's quite fun to watch, possibly because it knows how daft it is and therefore plays on it, deciding to shoot the film almost like a computer game from yesteryear. Expect 'life gauges' to appear on screen every time Scott picks a fight with someone new. Plus plenty of visual comic-like clues as to the fact that it wants you to know that it's based on a comic book, such as written text on the screen to emphasise sounds and feelings.
I'd probably forget the film quite quickly if it wasn't for the fact that it's co-written and directed by Edgar Wright, best known for working with Simon Pegg on various film collaborations. I think it's fair to say that Wright has a visual style that really works with this type of film. Every scene he emphasises silly little things in order to draw your attention to little details that most films overlook. I found myself enjoying how the film looked even more than the actual film itself. Sorry for the generalisation, but I do think that younger cinema audiences will enjoy the story aspect, however it was funny enough to keep me entertained and had a visual flair that is often missing from mainstream Hollywood. Just a pity Edgar Wright never got to do his vision of Marvel's 'Antman!'
If nothing else, it's worth watching Captain 'Chris Evans' America take the beating that even Iron Man himself couldn't manage!",7,0,0,13 December 2017
Inside Out," A great film for adults (and some kids, I guess)
","Normally, when I take my ten-year-old daughter to the cinema to see a 'children's' movie, I normally just sit there praying for it to end as it's just a load of colourful sentimental nonsense designed to fill an hour and a half's time. My daughter, and most of those who are around her age, all sit there laughing and enjoying the film. I just want to go home. This is because – naturally – children's movies are aimed at children (no surprise there then!) and, as an adult I have to accept that and just go along with it. That was until I saw 'Inside Out.' Here the film seems to be written the other way round. Yes, I loved it. I had a great time during the screening. And, although there were plenty of colourful characters for my daughter to watch, I didn't really think that she (or 90% of the under elevens in the audience) really appreciated it.We're shown that, right from birth, we have little characters in our heads controlling different areas of our personality – a happy little character for 'joy,' a depressed little character for 'sadness' and so on. These quirky little creatures control and dictate our actions and therefore life throughout our lives. The little characters we meet here reside inside a little girl called Riley's head. And, when she moves house and her life gets turned upside down, the little people inside her mind go on an adventure throughout her body – in particular various aspects of her mind.And this is where things get a little complicated. Well... not for me, but then I'm an adult. However, some – in fact quite a lot – of the gags start to fall flat on the children's ears when the characters on screen walk into the 'subconscious' and you're treated to the 'horrors' which reside buried deep in all our minds. And this is how it went on. More and more of the story seemed to be designed for those with a least a better understanding of the way our minds work that your average 'Pixar-watching' child.I've read other reviews and I see that a lot of kids did actually enjoy this film. However, I just wonder on what level they did? My daughter loved it, but the characters were pretty and 'good' was easily distinguishable from 'bad.' Personally, I loved Inside Out and would happily watch it again. I thought it was clever and different. I also couldn't help but think I was watching some sort of Christopher Nolan film like 'Inception.' Adults will love it. Kids should love it. Just be prepared to explain some metaphysical aspects of a Disney film during the drive home from the cinema!",8,15,45,30 August 2015
Avengers: Endgame," A fitting (if long!) conclusion
","Where do you begin with this film? I doubt there's that many people who turn up to the cinema (or pick out a random DVD etc) and see a film called 'Avengers: Endgame' and decide to watch it without really knowing anything about it. Basically, it's the finale to a series of 21 (I think!) films which have spanned over an eleven year period. So, do you need to watch all those films before watching 'Endgame?' No. But it sure helps!However, to give the most briefest of summaries, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a superhero movie where Earth's mightiest heroes come together to right the wrongs of a bad purple dude called 'Thanos' who has only gone and wiped out exactly 50% of the universe by collecting a load of magic (on 'infinity' to give them their proper name) stones and then putting him in his equally magic glove and snap his fingers to achieve this feat. Luckily, Earth still has enough heroes left to stop him.If - and I find this hard to believe - you have never watched anything that has come before it, you may just about get what's going on. There are battles, shocks, surprises, plenty of action and computer-generated characters in crazy worlds and locations. So it's fun. But I think that's a severe minority who will view it like that. For the rest of us - particularly people like me who have been following the franchise from the very beginning - will see it through completely different eyes. We will get every last reference and portion of 'fan service' (and there is plenty of that).I won't go into details because this could well be the biggest cinematic/filmic event to date. Franchises like 'James Bond' may have had more installments, but they were individual stories and didn't all link up and come together in one almighty conclusion. So this is the longest-running story ever on film (yes, I know you can probably watch the previous entries on their own and understand them as one-offs). In contains all the endings you'll need for your favourite characters, such as Thor, Iron Man and Captain America. All three superheroes are played - as usual - to perfection by Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. If you've followed these characters since the beginning, you won't fail to be moved by watching their various conclusions.I loved it, but it's not without it's flaws. It's worth noting that it's over three hours long and, for all its fan service, it does tend to drag in one or two areas. Plus it's quite 'exposition heavy' meaning characters have to explain the 'science' of various fantastical events for us - the audience - to properly understand the ways they're going to dig themselves out of such a hole as restoring the other half of the universe's population.However, if you've watched the majority of what's come before 'Endgame' then you'll probably sit through this and enjoy it to various levels. I've seen plenty other reviews and most - if not all - have been positive about the film. I don't know where the MCU (or 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' to be correct) will go from here. I'm sure it'll be good, but - for some reason - I just can't see it ever living up to the hype and novelty of this first 'phase' of the overall story.Oh, and for those who weren't too taken with Brie Larson's 'Captain Marvel' character - don't worry - she's not in it that much.https://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.com/",8,0,2,30 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," Sort of: Casino Royale (part 2)
","Yeah, well, Quantum of Solace is the first (and possibly last) Bond movie which is actually a direct sequel to the one that went before.Casino Royale redefined Bond for the modern age, making it grittier and darker (and dare I say more realistic?). It had a very different narrative structure, delighting some and enraging others who still pined for more gadgets and tongue-in-cheek action.Well, Quantum picks up where Casino leaves off... literally. Less than an hour has passed between films and QoS is effectively the continuation of the story. It tries its best to be 'self-contained' and you certainly can watch it without watching Casino Royale first (but I would recommend that you don't).And it's all good stuff. If follows the style of Casino Royale closely and most should be satisfied. However, whereas Casino Royale was met with pretty much universal praise, Quantum was labelled with phrases like 'Taking its foot off the pedal.' Casino Royale had an epic feel to it, whereas Quantum holds the - debatable - title of 'shortest ever James Bond film.' Therefore it feels less like a film in its own right and more like an afterthought for Casino Royale.It's a good spy thriller and, if you're a fan of the 'new style' James Bond that Daniel Craig is taking the franchise, then you'll probably like it too. However, Casino Royale was a tough act to follow and QoS doesn't really live up to it.Luckily, reviewing this after seeing its successor - Skyfall - it's only a temporary set-back. Skyfall even eclipses Casino Royale.",7,0,5,2 February 2015
Independence Day," It is what it is
","I watched 'Independence Day' back in 1995 during the 'height' of the X-files-induced 'alien fever' that was so prominent in popular culture that even the President of America at the time had to address the world and point out that the Government wasn't really stashing away bodies of little grey men. Therefore me, like many, were absolutely blown away when marketing material showed a giant alien spaceship hovering over the White House and promptly blowing it to pieces. That one iconic image sold the film alone. However, I distinctly remember the sense of disappointment I felt upon leaving the cinema. I'd seen the (fleeting!) clips of aerial dogfights between fighter jets and UFOs and expected them to make up more of the film. However, what I got was effectively a two and a half hour story about one stupid decision after the next.Despite being one of the most profitable movies of all time, it hardly won any prizes for logical storytelling. If you search Google for articles about the film's numerous plot holes and daft developments (Apple laptop being the highpoint!) you'll see what I mean. I didn't hate the film at the time. I appreciated the amazing special effects (for the day) and a great deal of work had gone into showing the carnage caused by an alien attack of populated areas. No faults there. So, if the effects were really the only stand-out aspects of the film, why did I end up buying the film and still watch it to this day? Well, I guess I appreciate it for what it is. It's the very definition of loud, dumb and stupid. It's a 'popcorn' movie, designed to entertain and keep your mind vaguely occupied while you check Instagram on your phone. Granted today's generations will probably not appreciate the effects, based on the numerous superhero movies where entire cities get reduced to ruins over a period of a half hour battle sequence, but what still holds up is the general sense of eagerness. This is arguably the film that launched Will Smith's career and you just can't help but warm to him. Yes, no matter how dumb and unlikely every situation he's placed in is, he's still brilliant to watch and, along with Jeff Goldblum (who's basically playing Jeff Goldblum – again), the pair of them make the movie still relevant to this day.So, if you want to enjoy 'Independence Day' you'll definitely have to put your brain on hold and know that you're getting what became the template for disaster movies (certainly nineties ones anyway, but then 'San Andreas' was pretty much the same story). You'll also have to be okay with healthy doses of 'pro-America' scripting. If you've watched (the brilliant) 'Team America: World Police' you'll probably be singing along that song of theirs 'America *£$% yeah!' all the way through, as it really is applicable. And then, when you're done enjoying the stupidity, treat yourself to a YouTube video on how these are the dumbest aliens ever to invade our planet (with the possible exception of that lot from 'Signs').",7,1,1,4 December 2017
The Dirty Dozen," Dozens of reasons to watch this film
","Well, maybe not 'dozens,' but here's a few at least...1. It's a war movie which doesn't really contain an awful lot of 'war' stuff, meaning that fans of the genre will appreciate it as much as those who aren't into the Second World War 2. The stellar cast. Okay, so some of the twelve prisoners conscripted into Lee Marvin's secret task force aren't that memorable, but there are plenty who are... Charles Bronson and Telly Savalis to name but two. 3. Naturally, a great cast produces great performances. There's no room for a 'weakest link' here. 4. Everyone roots for the 'antihero.' And here we not only have twelve convicted felons to cheer on, but also their leader – the allegedly pure Lee Marvin – is also as prone to 'rule-breaking' as his new charges 5. Black humour. Yes, there may be a war on, but there are a handful of light-hearted moments dotted about here and there that to lighten the tone enough. 6. It's epic. The two hours it runs for don't feel like it. 7. It doesn't pull any punches. As I said... there is a war on and you may find yourself grinning one minute before being completely horrified by the level of brutality that transpired during the historical period. 8. One hell of a tense finale – when the mission comes, it's worth the wait. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you cheer all your newfound antiheros on.Basically, 'The Dirty Dozen' is a war film that's more akin to simply being put in the 'action' bracket, rather than classed as a straight 'war film.' The mission never actually happened. This film is total fiction. But there's always that feeling at the back of your mind regarding how, although it never transpired, it probably very well nearly did.You don't have to be a war film fan to enjoy this, just enjoy a mismatched bunch of rag-tag antiheros, working together (and sometimes against each other!) on a mission to kill Nazis.",9,0,4,1 December 2014
The Butterfly Effect," Surprisingly deep sci-fi
","'The Butterfly Effect' may not be remembered as one of the all-time great science fiction films - probably because it's (a) not an epic blockbuster with wall-to-wall action (b) limited star power and (c) contains a bit of a mind-bending plot that isn't necessarily as easy to follow as some of the other sci-fi films that deal with time travel. Therefore, I guess it was always destined for more of a 'niche' audience. Luckily, it's developed a reasonable cult status - and deservedly so.Normally, when I write a review I tend to use the second paragraph to give a brief summary of the film. However, I really do think that if I say too much I may give away a 'spoiler' that may well ruin your enjoyment of the film. You could say it's a love story which involves time travelling and one man's (Ashton Kutcher) attempts to right various wrongs of the past - and the consequences which messing with time brings about.Obviously, it's science fiction, but not overly so. There are no trips to space age futures or flying cars and a fair proportion of the 'whys' of how time travel is possible isn't really explained. You just have to go with it. If someone walked in halfway through the film they could be forgiven for thinking it was a 'teen love story,' but just because a relationship between Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart is paramount to the overall narrative, don't think it's a 'date movie' or will ever get too soppy for a guy's taste. In fact - quite the opposite - it's pretty damn dark!I know that Kutcher has a bit of a reputation for more goofy comedic roles, but here he plays it straight well and it's a pity he didn't take more parts like this as he's quite capable of headlining a film like this, yet these days he's pretty much dropped off the radar (as has Amy Smart!).It's probably a little longer than your average film, but there's a lot to it and, although much of the marketing for this movie centres on Kutcher and Smart, at least a third is spent in the company of their younger incarnations (who are all nicely believable and not at all annoying as some child actors can be!).Ignore what you may think of Ashton Kutcher (or 'MR Demi Moore' as he's normally heralded as). He holds the film together and there's definitely chemistry between him and Amy Smart. The plot is never a rollercoaster/action epic - it's far deeper and brings up areas of the genre designed to make you think. Definitely worth a watch when you're in the mood for a deep-dark-dive into time travel (just make sure you get the 'director's cut' - I hear the ending is very different in other versions and not half as good).",9,1,1,19 April 2020
Alien vs. Predator," Ahh, it could have been so good
","The 'Aliens versus Predator' storyline has been with us ever since the 'Predator 2' when Danny Glover huffed and puffed his way across what looked like an alien's skull in the Predator's trophy cabinet. This brief image sparked a storm among fans, whose dreams and wishes were subsequently realised by volumes of comics and graphic novels regarding the subject matter. And they were actually pretty good! Having read a fair few of them, it seemed no end to the possibilities of pitting two of the big screen's most famous monsters against each other. With so many ideas as to what could be done, how could they possibly lose?The answer: they gave it to Paul W S Anderson. Now, Paul W S Anderson is a very competent director who can stylishly bring action scenes to life. However, his films' major flaws all are that they're 'almost great.' They're not bad. They're watchable. And that is their major crime. They leave you thinking that if you were given $60 million to make a film (in this case one starring the aliens and the Predator) then you could do better than him. And there's a reason for this - you could. And so could I.Aliens vs Predator sports the tagline 'Whoever wins - we lose.' Isn't that the truth? The film gets its rating taken down from an 18 to a watery 12A, removing all gore and much of the suspense with it. Instead of brutal tough Predators we have a trio of young, inexperienced ones who are - quite frankly - a bit rubbish at killing aliens. Instead of the gun-totting Colonial Marines from Aliens, we have a team of bland, disposable scientists who are there simply to increase the body count. At least the aliens perform on camera, but the battles you may expect between the two races are few and far between. Also, if you saw the trailer and witnessed a million aliens tearing towards some Predators on top of an weird and wonderful pyramid, that's only a flashback. That's about the best bit of the film.It sort of tries to tie into both the 'Aliens' and 'Predator' mythology, but fans really don't want it to. Like I say, it's not bad. I know I'm making it sound terrible, but it really isn't. It has action, special effects and, um, that's about it. It's perfect for your average sci-fi monster-munching movie. However, when you have either an Aliens film or a Predator film, people expect a little more than something that's 'just okay.'At least it was more understandable than Prometheus I suppose.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,1,1,24 July 2014
No Country for Old Men," Slow and steady wins the race
","I normally hate slow films. If I say that a film is 'slow' then I normally mean that I'm completely bored with it. Or, if it's deliberately slow then it's probably just being pretentious with ideas above its station. 'No Country For Old Men' is slow. And I really enjoyed it.It's a little hard to describe. I guess the basic plot is that Josh Brolin finds a suitcase of money in the middle of a drug deal gone wrong and decides to keep it. The only problem is that there's a complete psychopath on his trail who will stop at nothing to recover what is his (think 'The Terminator' but with a worse haircut). Tommy Lee Jones plays the local Sheriff on both their trails and, using the Terminator analogy, it's just a question of which one gets to Brolin first.It's quite a long film with minimal dialogue. A lot of the time you're just watching the character as he goes about his (ill-gotten) business. When there is dialogue it's that kind of 'Tarantino-esque' rambling monologue which makes you wonder where it's going and is supposed to heighten the tension and show us important information regarding the character talking. This can sometimes get annoying, but, again, it works here.Yes, it's slow, but it's brilliant (and nasty). Be prepared for some pretty grim and dark moments thrown in there and it certainly isn't a 'feel good' epic, but if you're in the mood for something a little less 'action-packed' than your average Hollywood blockbuster (and a lot nastier) then definitely give this one a go. It won't be for everyone and your current mood will probably dictate how you feel towards it afterwards.",8,1,1,15 June 2015
District 9," Avatar for grown-ups
","Every now and again, two films with similar themes will come along within a short space of time completely by coincidence - District 9 and Avatar are a prime example of this. Both tell the stories about how a (reasonably) ordinary man ends up getting his life entwined with an alien race and - kind of inadvertently - becoming their saviour.Avatar still stands as the highest-grossing film of all time, but then it had pretty jungles, cute aliens and gave birth to the 3D culture. I don't begrudge it its success, nor do I hate it - it's just that I LOVE District 9. Here, instead of being set on a far-flung planet, an alien space ship arrives over Johannesburg and its alien crew given 'refugee status' on in the city itself. However, after twenty years, the aliens haven't shifted and people are getting pretty mistrustful of them. So, when a camera crew follows in an office pen-pusher to help evict them, he quickly discovers more than he bargained for.If you're into sci-fi or action then there's no reason you won't enjoy this. The acting is top notch. The direction is superb. You'll care for all the characters and it even manages to make you look upon the (computer-generated) aliens as real people and feel for their plight, too. Then of course it has action, much destruction and incredibly cool weapons. What more does the average sci-fi nut want? More? Okay, how about the face that the story also - not so subtly - plays on existing 'racial tensions' around the world - how about that... a little bit of politics and satire thrown into the mix.Like I say, if you like sci-fi or action then this is for you. Oh, it also has big cool endoskeleton robots which shoot lasers and pigs (seriously), what more can you ask for? Roll on 'District 10.'http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10,0,1,16 June 2014
Bridesmaids," Funny enough for a GUY to enjoy!
","It's amazing that no one has thought of this before. After countless years of watching groups of men behaving like idiots on the big screen, we finally meet a gaggle of women who will put any stag party to shame. A lot of people have called 'Bridesmaids' the 'female version of The Hangover' and there certainly are similarities in the set-up, but they're both different enough to be enjoyed separately without too much comparison.There's a preconception (possibly among men!) that 'women aren't funny,' or at least women aren't AS funny as men. I won't attempt to guess at either of those statements' validity, but I will say that 'Bridesmaids' goes some way to prove that women can be pretty amusing when the setting is right.The 'plot' is pretty simple: a woman is getting married and invites her various friends to the various pre-wedding preparations. Mayhem follows.Yes, there is a strong element of 'rom-com' in there, but it never overshadows the general humour. There are six central (female) characters and not all are as 'fleshed-out' character-wise as they possibly could be. However, the film plays to its strengths and gives more screen time to the funnier of those among them.Basically, you have a light-hearted comedy/romance that should appeal to men and women. I should point out that the humour is pretty 'adult' in nature and anyone easily offended by bad language may be in need of earplugs (and that's just from the women!).Of course it's not for everyone. I'm guessing its primary audience will be women. My (male) friend warned me from ever watching this film, telling me how awful it was (I haven't admitted I've seen – and enjoyed – it to him yet).Special mention to Melissa McCarthy, who steals every scene (and every puppy).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,3,5,15 July 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An unexpected addition to 'the Rings'
","I read the book of the Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings. When I was a child, I enjoyed its light-hearted approach at introducing 'Middle Earth.' However, when it came to transferring books to films, the Lord of the Rings was certainly a safer bet when it came to box office returns.Therefore I didn't know what to expect from this 'prequel,' especially as I - like so many fans - were a little sceptical about how and why the producers felt the need to turn a much smaller book into a three-film epic - almost to try and rival the original trilogy.The good news is that the look and feel of Lord of the Rings is all there when it comes to sets, special effects and even most of the useable cast have returned to play their respective roles again. All the cast do a fine job of portraying their characters - Ian McKellen finds it easiest to play Gandalf, while Martin Freeman has a harder job of playing not only a younger version of Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins, but also to add his own touches to the role (which, I'm pleased to say, he pulls off).However, most people feel they have been proved right about expanding the original source material so much. There is a lot of 'padding' - mainly at the beginning which simply isn't necessary and can start to get a little boring, bringing the pace down considerably.Then there's the comedy. Only it's not comedy, it's more out-of-place dialogue that seems way too light-hearted to fit in the Lord of the Rings universe. For every epic battle and great touch The Hobbit offers, there are equal amount of moments that make you cringe and just wish would end as quickly as possible.I hear there's a director's cut coming out soon and that it's going to be even longer. I feel this is one of the rare occasions where a movie would benefit from a SHORTER director's cut. It's not a bad film. I actually quite liked it and enjoyed seeing my childhood book brought to life with a fitting budget. Just, if you're going to watch it repeatedly, you may want to have one hand on the remote control to gloss over some of the less important scenes which really don't matter and just shouldn't be there.A good film, possibly only not a great film due to the producers trying to add more material than is necessary simply to justify turning the overall story into a new trilogy.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,4,5 September 2014
Non-Stop," Surprisingly, more than just 'Taken (in the air)'
","Okay, I, like many, enjoyed Liam Neeson's film 'Taken.' And, like many, I thought the sequel was a little bit of a let-down/cash-in. Therefore, my hopes weren't that high for 'Non Stop' – a film where, from all trailers and promotional material, Neeson basically plays the same aging tough guy, albeit now he's an air marshal trying to stop a terrorist highjacking/blackmail plot.Perhaps that's the secret to enjoying this film, i.e. don't expect too much, because, as it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised (and very entertained). Yes, Neeson's character isn't that different to how he acted in Taken, however, the story is executed in a different enough way to make it not feel like a cheap rip-off of the Taken franchise.It's sort of a 'whodunnit' on a plane. One of the passengers is texting Neeson, threatening to kill a passenger every so often unless his (monetary) demands are met. This means that there are plenty of 'red herrings' to constantly throw the audience off the scent.Naturally, with any sort of film like this, there are some moments where you have to suspend your disbelief and accept that – sometimes – things just happen to move the plot forward in the right direction.So, don't think too hard about the (few) minor plot holes, just enjoy the pretty tense ride as Neeson proves that, once again, you don't have to be 'expendable' to be an older statesman of the action genre.",8,0,1,5 July 2014
The Transporter," 90s style action in the 00s
","'The Transporter' may not be Jason Statham's introduction into the world of on-screen action heroes, but it was certainly the film that cemented his potential as more of an 'old school' tough guy. Since the early 2000s, action films developed a severe case of over-seriousness. Gone were the days of witty quips and wry smiles of the Arnie and Stallone era, replaced with grim protagonists and gritty surroundings.That's why 'The Transporter' is so great. It totally knows what it is, i.e. big, dumb fun that's only trying to entertain, rather than deliver any sort of 'message.' Jason Statham plays 'Frank' an ex American marine with possibly the most 'questionable' American accent ever (seriously, it flits between London and New York approximately ever other word!). He specialises in driving for a living, or rather driving anything illegal from point A to point B in a severe hurry.However, his professional attitude to his work is severely tested when he begrudgingly opens the boot of his car during a job, only to find a young Chinese girl tied up in there. Naturally, his conscious is tested and it's up to him whether to deliver this girl to her - obvious - fate, or help her out. Luckily for her, she's quite pretty and therefore makes up the perfect love interest to our bald, rugged anti-hero.I would probably say that there's zero original content in this film. If you've watched enough action films then you've pretty much seen everything here and possibly done better. However, that isn't really too much of a criticism as 'The Transporter' is just such damn good fun. It has good looking heroes, evil dastardly villains, beautiful locations, great action and punch-ups. But, most of all, it never takes itself seriously in the same way as the 'pre-Craig' Bond movies did.And, if all that isn't enough to get you sit down and watch it - for the ladies - you get one hell of a look at a totally oiled-up Jason Statham, beating one goon after the other while he slips, slides and slaps his way through the bad guys - all gooey and topless. Obviously, I was just there for the action. Obviously.",8,0,0,25 March 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," How many more 'Impossible' missions are actually possible?
","Yes, Tom is back for a forth outing and saving the world from an assortment of baddies in the process. MI4 definitely follows on from parts 2-3, as it's more action orientated and has a plot that you can actually follow (I've seen the first one three times and I'm still confused at who was double-crossing who!).Plus, Tom takes Brit actor Simon 'Shaun of the Dead' Pegg along for the ride, which adds an acceptable dose of humour into the mix. There are stunts, shootouts, car chases - everything you'd expect from a MI film (or Bond movie) and it's all held together nicely.It's a solid action film with enough gadgets to keep old-school Bond fans happy. If you liked parts 2 and 3, give it a go - it's good silly fun.It looks like there will be plenty more 'Impossible' missions for Tom to prove otherwise. No bad thing if they all end up like this one.",8,0,2,16 November 2014
28 Days Later...," Two horror films for the price of one
","It's pretty much taken for granted that '28 Days Later' is a seminal British horror film. And it is. It helped revitalise the 'zombie genre' by making the undead into more than just - George Romero-style - 'shufflers.' It also started a trend in 'disaster movies' showing well-known locations (in this case London) eerily deserted.Everyman, Jim, wakes up from a coma to find a disease has spread through Britain turning everyone into zombies (or the 'infected' if we're being technical, as they're still alive). Now he must look for survivors and stay one step ahead of the psychotic enemy.You'll find not many people will say anything too negative about 28 Days Later. It's actually pretty good from beginning to end. However, there is a distinct change of tone midway through the film that does seem to grate on even the most die-hard of fans. It's like two horror films stuck together. The second could be completely independent to the first.However, both halves have their merits. The first half is creepy and sets the tone for a different type of ending that what's to come. The second half is more action-orientated and the infected (of which have been the bad guys during the first half) seem to take a back seat to human adversaries.But no matter how much the change annoys you, the acting is still fine, the sets terrifically creepy, the characters charming enough for us to care about their fates and the direction - naturally - slick, courtesy of Danny Boyle.All in all, this is a British classic horror that has spawned numerous inferior imitations. If you like your horror gritty, then this one is for you.",10,0,1,23 November 2014
It Follows," It really is pretty good
","I really do hate using someone else's words when it comes to reviewing a film, however the phrase 'It really does breathe new life into the horror genre' does seem – almost – applicable. Okay, it may be overstating the film's brilliance. It's no work of art, but, if you enjoy your horror yarns (and are as sick and tired of every new horror film using 'found footage' as a tool with which to scare us) then you may at least want to give this one the time of day.It's long been a cliché in horror films that if you have sex you die (notably pointed out in the 'Scream' films), so it may come as a surprise that our lovely, blonde female lead manages to jump into bed (or a car, technically) within the first few scenes. Granted, she's not immediately bludgeoned to death by an ice hockey mask-wearing maniac, but her new boyfriend does have some bad news for her (and he's not just confessing that he's actually married!). He informed her that he's 'passed on' more than just something she needs to report to the doctors about.An evil spirit/presence is now destined to follow her everywhere she goes until she dies. Or should that be until the evil spirit/presence in question murders her horribly? Either way, she has two options: sit around and wait for the grisly end, or 'pass it on' (and we all know what she has to do in order to get rid of it!).However, seeing as our stricken heroine is a nice girl, she doesn't want to 'pass it on' or wait for the end. So she enlists the help of some of her mates and, together, they set about doing their best to make this spirit wish it had picked on someone else.And, it's a pretty enjoyable ride. For a start, the title 'It Follows' is nicely applicable titles. The spook does just that. It never runs, it just walks. Not only does that give the victim a decent chance at escaping, but it does play on the psychological horror of having something totally unstoppable which never gives up until it has killed you. Plus the cast is good. Most horrors since the seventies have had a cast of youngsters and most of the time they're pretty bland and annoying (or just put there for the offending killer to pick off one by one). However, here the friends interact quite nicely and come across as a believable bunch.'It Follows' has been successful, therefore it's pretty much guaranteed to be the start of a franchise. And, with most horror franchises, I dare say that the quality will drop with each one until it's ultimately rebooted. So, before the quality diminishes completely, I say watch the original quickly before your memory of the story is overshadowed by countless spin-offs, sequels and remakes. It's actually pretty good if you're already into your horror. Plus it's a nice take on the 'have-sex-and-die' horror premise!",8,2,11,5 August 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," How the monkeys control the zoo
","Rebooting movie franchises are one thing. Rebooting a movie franchise that is still comparatively new is another. Rise of the Planet of the Apes cunningly ignores Tim Burton's misfire of a remake and decides to become a sort of remake/prequel to Charlton Hestern's original classic sci-fi movie.If you don't know or don't care where (chronologically) this movie comes in the series and look at it as a stand-alone work (although, it was a commercial success - not prizes for guessing they'll make a sequel or five), it's actually quite good.The opening twenty minutes or so are a little slow and I was wondering what I was getting myself into here. However, once the central ape, aka Caesar the mentally genetically-enhanced chimpanzee starts growing up and showing signs of things to come, the story picks off. In fact, it kind of makes the human characters redundant as Caesar steals every scene with the help of a menacing look of bitter resentment towards his cruel human masters. Soon he leads the others apes to revolt against them and, if you can get over the fact that apes can take on gun-totting humans, you'll enjoy the action scene on the Golden Gate bridge (which I'm presuming has been recently rebuilt after Magneto destroyed it in X-men 3).All in all it's not overly long and, if you like sci-fi and the premise of super-apes potentially taking over the world, give it a shot (of course we hope this film won't give any terrorist factions ideas - we don't want them bringing the world to its knees by releasing a couple of hundred angry monkeys into any major city and watching humanity crumble).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,2,4,15 May 2014
Legend," Yes, it's another 'Kray film' (but it does have Tom hardy in!)
","'The Krays' are possibly one of the most 'filmed' real-life personalities Britain has ever produced. It seems we can't get enough of their antics as the twin brothers terrorised the London underworld scene all those years ago. There has been countless films made about their dastardly exploits and now we have 'Legend' – another one.Basically, it's another 'true' story of their lives. In other words it's based on what people have said about them over the years and bits and pieces of fact mixed with a better and more concise way of telling their story. The brothers' tale has been put on film so many times it's hard to get that excited any more. However, this one has Tom Hard in. And not just Tom Hardy, but Tom Hardy AND Tom Hardy (i.e. he plays both twins!).And, in true Tom Hardy style, he brings a newfound excellence to the roles. Just because the twins are (basically) identical, their personalities are definitely not. One is – slightly – cooler and more calculating in his dodgy deals whereas the other one just wants to beat the hell out of anyone who opposes them. Both Krays might as well be played by different actors as Hardy does each of them justice and you'll never be confused as to which one is which.If you already know about the loves and lives of the Kray twins, this film probably won't tell you anything new. However, it's still worth a watch just to see Tom Hardy's take on them (can you tell that I'm a fan?!). Also, if you're generally a fan of gangster films then this one should pretty much tick all the boxes you're looking for. There's probably a reason as to why this is the second highest-grossing British 18 certificate (after Trainspotting) – and that's because it really is a damn good biopic. Okay, they'll always be the questions asked as to how much is made up for the story and how much really happened, but, from what I know about the real life drama, a lot of the major plot points are covered and, whether it all happened exactly as portrayed here, it still makes for an entertaining ride in the gangster genre.",8,0,2,27 January 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," What we've all been waiting for
","I can't help but think of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' after watching 'Avengers: Infinity War.' The two of them may have been made by Disney, but they are worlds apart when it comes to giving the fans what they were after. The latest 'Star Wars' may have been okay, but it was generally disregarded by many die-hards. However, despite the Avengers - technically - pumping out more films in its franchise and therefore potentially suffering from fatigue regarding its premise, it's been hailed as a classic - and for good reason. It shows that, despite having numerous previous (and dare I say similar?) outings, a sequel doesn't have to be stale.I suppose there must be some people out there who have never seen an 'Avengers' movie before (or even one from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), so, for the two of you, this is the third outing where Earth's mightiest superheroes are forced to come together to defend the planet from an alien, hell-bent on wiping out 50% of the universe.You may be thinking that this is just another modern action film, filled with computer-generated special effects and scripted one-liners. And you'd be right. However, I always find that computer-generated battles are only bad if the effects are bad and they drag on and scripted one-liners only don't work if they're forced and there's no chemistry between the actors. I'm pleased to say that, although 'Avengers: Infinity War' has both, they only add to the proceedings.With a cast as big as is needed to bring characters from every Marvel movie together, there's always going to be a couple who don't get quite as much screen time as some of us would like. However, you should really expect that and realise it was going to be difficult for the writers to please everyone. Personally, I've always been a fan of Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of 'Iron Man' (I don't think I'm alone on that one), so I was happy to see that he was - possibly - given the most screen time out of anyone.However, no matter how good the goodies are, they need a good bad-guy to fight. The Marvel movies have often been criticised for a lack of real threatening baddies (Loki excluded), so we finally get to see he who has been in the background for so long, Thanos. And he's worth the wait. He's a bad guy we can not only love to hate, but also - in a strange way - see that he has a point, or at least a point of view from his own perspective. Josh Brolin portrays him brilliantly and you'll forget that most of him is computer-generated after a while.Yes, 'Infinity War' is part of the overall franchise, but you don't really have to have seen every previous movie to 'get' everything that's happening here (obviously, the more Marvel movies you've seen the more you'll get out of this one, but it's not essential). I suppose if there is one complaint of mine it's that I know which characters are truly in danger here, due to the actors' contracts either due to expire, or only just being picked up. Either way, it's a definite improvement on the previous 'Avengers' movie, as the 'Age of Ultron' felt strangely 'meh' for one that should have been so much more.If you like the MCU, you'll like this. If you like action film, you'll also love it. It's - sort of - a family movie in that a lot of families will go to see it, but, either way, it's so epic in scale that most should appreciate it for the sheer spectacle it is. Poor Justice League - it never really stood a chance.",10,1,2,1 May 2018
Behind The Candelabra," Bourne with gender identities
","It's hard to imagine super-spy Jason Bourne in a sparkly thong, throwing a hissy-fit at his older male lover. Perhaps that's why Matt Damon's performance has got him quite a lot of praise for his portrayal of the young man (Scott Thorson) who lived (and loved) Hollywood icon Liberace. Michael Douglas too is on fine form as the man himself, displaying the voice and the mannerisms of the flamboyant entertainer to a tee.It's a 'rise and fall' tale of love that was probably doomed from the start. It's based on the 'kiss and tell' book that Thorson wrote once Liberace had died, so we only have his word on it that this is the 'truth.' But, truth or not, it's an entertaining piece of tragic drama that allows both him and Douglas to put in some stellar performances.It probably isn't for everyone. If you look at internet message boards, you'll see a fair few people who found it 'overly gay' in subject matter. However, if that sort of thing offends you, you really shouldn't even be considering watching a semi-biopic about a gay couple's life.",7,1,4,1 October 2014
Gone Girl," Gone, but definitely not forgotten
","Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care. I just enjoyed the ride.'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what's coming.Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together before the film's ready to reveal what's happening.If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.",8,69,98,22 April 2015
Django Unchained," A difficult watch, but ultimately rewarding
","Django Unchained is a Quentin Tarantino film. That is all most people need to know to get them to watch it. Most of us have seen (and probably loved) Pulp Fiction and therefore that's enough to get us to keep watching his films forever in the hope of reliving that classic movie. However, over the years, this eclectic film-maker has dabbled in various different types of film - most of them have been hits and all of them have been hits to someone. Just because you liked his last one, won't mean you'll automatically like his next.Django Unchained is about a slave (Django) in America - pre Civil War - who is trained up to hunt down and rescue those responsible for abducting and torturing his long-lost wife.The biggest similarity I can make with this film would be Tarantino's previous outing - Inglorious Bastards. IB was Tarantino's take on World War II and DU is his imagining of the slave trade in the deep south of America. It's a long, rambling epic of a movie, filled with erroneous dialogue and gratuitous violence (not to mention racially offensive language in this case).It's quite exhausting to watch, but, once you've say through it, you'll hopefully feel that it was worth the journey. Obviously, you'll need a strong stomach. Tarantino is not one to do things by half measures. Expect a LOT of violence and a LOT of bad language.If you've enjoyed Quentin's previous dark humorous epics then you'll probably like this one. I don't claim to know how factually accurate it is, but it's still a ride-and-a-half anyway.Note the hilarious - if a little out of place - scene with the lynch mobs discussing their 'wardrobe malfunctions' - classic.",7,0,1,30 December 2014
Get Out," Good horror isn't dead
","Let's face it, the horror genre seems to have got even more stale than ever lately. Sure, ever since 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' kind of launched the 'slasher' sub-genre of mainstream horror, many films have followed that particular layout, especially when teens were the leads. However, I'm pleased to say that 'Get Out' is actually a breath of – pretty horrific – fresh air.I'm going to get the word out the way straight away – awkward. Yes, this film's primary emotion it generates in you is not fear, disgust or dread. It's awkwardness (an emotion we've all felt from time to time and one more associated with turning up to work in trainers in an office full of people in smart shoes than full blown horror). However, there's more to it than that.We meet a young mid-twenties couple who are returning to her parents' house in a small, but 'respectable' town in 'Middle America.' Nothing particularly out of the ordinary there, but Chris Washington is a black man and his girlfriend, Rose Armitage, is white. Again, nothing that would raise an eyebrow in most places these days, but this is – at heart and despite its overall awkwardness – a horror movie after all.When this black man arrives in his potential inlaws' house, there's quite an uncomfortable feeling in the air. They're not racists or bigots, just people who haven't really experienced people of other cultures and races – queue the start of the awkwardness. They do their best to make him feel welcome, constantly referencing supposedly 'black' culture in an effort to make him feel at home. But there's still that awkwardness in the air that something else is going on. This is the point where I can't say too much more without dipping my toe into the territory of 'spoilers.' I will just say that if you thought Ben Stiller had it bad in 'Meet the Parents' you won't believe what poor Chris Washington has to go through! Eventually, the awkwardness and uncomfortable atmosphere cracks and 'Get Out' turns into what it's meant to be – something pretty horrible. It's definitely a pleasant change from the slasher/zombie horror films which seem to be infesting the cinema these days. The closest film I could liken it to may be a certain other dark classic from the seventies starring (amongst others) Nannette Newman, but I'll leave you to wait and see any slight similarities. It does touch on quite a few modern issues with race and the perception thereof, however it's never preachy or annoying by trying to put its message over the fact that it's a dark, disturbing film first (social commentary later!).'Get Out's' primary strength is its two young leads. They have to be believable as a normal couple who you can relate to in order for us to buy into their plight. And they do. Daniel Kaluuya (Chris Washington) ultimately carries the film and it's impossible not to sympathise for him when the bad stuff really starts to happen. All in all, whatever your politics, as long as you enjoy good, solid, slow-burning horror films which gradually crank up the tension, you really do need to watch this.",8,9,17,11 May 2017
Drive," An interesting ride
","I have to say that I was surprised at what Drive turned out to be (but pleasantly so). I didn't know much about it. Driver. Bank robber. Stuntman. That was basically the premise - not that original, but well done and suitably different to be very watchable.First of all, don't expect wall to wall action. The action is subtle and certainly not the central focus (Transformers 3, it is not). And there is violence. Not a lot, but when it happens, it does hit you.The thing you have to know about Drive is that it is SLOW. That may sound like the wrong word to use to describe a film that uses fast cars as a main element to it. However, it's not the car chases that are slow, it's the dialogue. No one says that much. Words are replaced by looks and some slightly obscure shots (any more and it may almost be considered 'art house.' If you've seen David Lynch's 'Lost Highway,' I couldn't help but draw comparisons. Drive has a very similar look and feel to it (minus the supernatural element).If you're looking for fast paced action and snappy dialogue, you probably won't like this film. However, if you're in the mood for something a little different with underplayed performances, interspersed with some violence and car chases, then give it a go.A pleasant surprise.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,1,26 May 2014
Insidious," Not original, but not bad either
","I think it was 'Poltergeist' which set the template for modern horror, i.e. family finds out house is haunted, doesn't believe it, does believe it, calls experts and then resolution. 'Insidious,' like so many other post eighties horror films, follows that formula to the letter. However, whereas most are pretty forgettable, this one has just about enough scares and creepiness in it to make it worth watching.It's hardly worth going into detail regarding the plot, as I'm reasonably smug that I've summed it up sufficiently in my opening paragraph. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the mum and dad. Yup, they're happy, successful and have three children. They play the parts well from everyday doting parents to disbelieving and supernaturally-harassed protagonists and they do nothing to make you not want to root for them. Especially when one of their children slips into an unusual coma and his housebound ever after. But that's when the haunting begins...Instead of being sucked into the TV-dimension, he's stuck in another afterlife and spirits want to get into our world via him. Those dastardly spirits (including one that looks like Darth Maul from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – so it's nice to see the poor Sith Lord can still get work after that depressing inclusion into the sci-fi franchise) follow the family from house to house until the mandatory local paranormal expert is called in to sort the spooks out.Cue the resolution. I won't spoil it as sometimes the family wins and sometimes they get horribly murdered and it ends on a downer, but, once again, the resolution follows. Like I say, this is 'horror by the numbers' but it's good enough to watch. If you're a horror fan then you've probably seen better, but that's because you've probably got classic horror films among your DVD collection. However, you probably won't see many – recent – horror films that create a creepy/tense atmosphere. Give it a go.",7,0,0,20 June 2016
Ghost Rider," Oh, Nick... where did it all go wrong?
","Once upon a time, the name 'Nicholas Cage' could be associated with setting the cinema box office alight. Then, after one weirdly-awful choice of film after the next, he's been reduced to this - Ghost Rider. You can probably see what he was thinking... recently the 'Marvel' stamp has been very lucrative, what with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and, of course, The Avengers. Nicolas Cage probably thought this film would be spoken of in the same breath as them.He was wrong. Poor old Nick - just his luck to pick the one 'Marvel turkey.' Ghost Rider is an example of a comic book character that should probably stick to the pages of a comic book. Nothing really works here, even though everyone does their best to make it happen.The acting is average, with the actors doing their best with the lacklustre script. But the script doesn't give any of the characters much depth and Nicolas Cage just looks a bit embarrassed to be wearing a blatant hairpiece throughout.However, who cares about the acting if there's plenty of fun action to keep us entertained? Well... there isn't much here. When Nick changes into the 'Rider' the flaming skull just looks bad and the set pieces of action don't really shout out to you that they're really that special.Ghost Rider is one of those films that, if you have nothing else to do and happen to catch it on telly, then you might think it's okay. But that's all it'll ever be - okay. Although, saying that... if you compare it to its sequel - it's actually a masterpiece of film-making!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,0,0,14 July 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," The whole is NOT better than the sum of its parts
","Amazingly, X-men 2 - being the sequel - actually surpassed the original. It was longer, fleshed out the better characters a bit more and generally improved on the original. People awaited the conclusion of the trilogy with baited breath. Then came the news that the behind-the-scenes staff were not happy. Bryan Singer left. Other directors came and went, as did other crewmembers and X3 limped onto the stage trying to convince us that all was still well with the franchise.To be fair - it's okay. The action is good, as is the special effects. However, overall it seems like a backwards step for the story. It's quite short (just over an hour and a half) - nothing wrong with that, apart from the fact that it's X-men and the clue's in the name. The X-men is about multiple characters and, when turning it into a film, you have to try and cram as many of them in as possible. You can't please everyone. There will always be some left out ('Where's Gambit?' many cried before he showed up later in Wolverine's own film). However, there are still too many to really care about. Characters - good and bad - come on screen for one or two scenes and that's all we get of them.Old favourites Wolverine, Professor X and Magneto get the most screen time and do their best to try and hold things together. But none of their characters are pushed forwards in terms of development. Wolverine has some cool fight scenes. Magneto shows his dastardly side with a brilliant scene involving the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and X reminds us of the X-men's overall message.But these are just scenes. They're all good, but they're interspersed with second-rate, under-developed characters taking up screen time just so the producers can say, 'See, look, there's Collossus!' It's a fun action film, but, after X2, just leaves you thinking it's not much of an improvement (incidentally the same thing I said about Terminator 3's relationship to T2).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,0,12 May 2014
Hellboy," They don't make 'em like they used to
","If ever there was a film that probably shouldn't work, it was one about a reformed demon, born during World War II and designed to help the Nazis take over the world, but now spends his time slaying monsters and saving the world instead. 'Hellboy' was a film made in 2004 and came just before the massive resurgence in comic book adaptations which, to this day, still dominates the Box Office with superhero movies. It's a strange kind of film that, although popular enough to generate (and equally good, in my opinion) sequel, it never got the third part to send off the character and give him the trilogy of films that us die-hard fans felt that he deserved. The reason I say it's 'strange' is because (like many, I guess) I never knew much about the film before watching it at the cinema. I didn't know it was based on a comic and merely saw the posters advertising the movie prior to its release. I knew that (the ever brilliant) Ron Perlman was in it and that was enough for me. The fact that much marketing material centred on a giant demon silhouette sporting a huge firearm was merely a bonus for an action/horror fan like myself. I watched it, really enjoyed it, and didn't think that much more of it. However, now I can see in these days of 'mega-franchises' why it didn't quite set the Box Office alight like it should. By its initial marketing, it looks like an outright horror film. However, it's actually a superhero film that borrows horror tropes, plus it was made before the superhero/MCU really took off. Nowadays, we're well used to rooting for our heroes after they've been granted some sort of special power enabling them to fight the forces of darkness, but most of them look like Chris Evans or Chris Hemsworth, rather than a giant, ugly, red, semi-horned monster. I guess what I'm saying is that 'Hellboy' was destined to have a real 'niche audience.'However, if what I've already said intrigues you, I do recommend giving it a watch. First of all, it stars Ron Perlman as the titular anti-hero. Now, he's normally good in whatever he's in, but it's fair to say that he carries this film completely on his broad (red) shoulders. The other cast members, including John Hurt and Selma Blair, are good too, but it's Ron's show (although I should probably give a nod to Jeffrey Tambor as the long-suffering head of Hellboy's secret Government unit).There's not an awful lot to say about the plot. If you've seen one superhero movie (regardless of when it was released) then you can probably predict what will happen - evil megalomaniac wants to take over the world, hero has to put the brakes on that one. However, Hellboy does it slightly differently simply because of its general 'horror' look and feel. But - don't worry - it's not all Gothic darkness - there's plenty of top-notch action scenes, cheeky one-liners from our cigar-chomping, cat-petting red hero and special effects that look more on the 'practical' side, rather than an excessive use of CGI. It's worth mentioning the effects because Hellboy's make-up is particularly simple, yet flawless in bringing the character to life. He's pretty scary at the best of times and the only things more ugly are the beasties he's sent to despatch before they destroy the world (that clockwork assassin-Nazi still gives me the creeps!).Even though I stand by my belief that 'Hellboy' stands up today as it did when it was released, I know there's a reboot in the pipeline. I'll watch that too, simply because I like the way the film is done. However, I have my doubts that anyone can fill Ron's big red boots and whatever we'll get next (instead of the much desired third part in this franchise) will be nothing more than a studio trying to cash in on the superhero craze and going for an easy cash-grab.",9,3,3,20 March 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The continuation of 'epic'
","It's unlikely that many people will decide to enter the 'Lord of the Rings' world in the 'middle' of the story. The 'Rings' books numbered three, therefore it was always known that the films would follow suit. Most people (whether fans of the book, or those just interested in the hype of the first installment 'The Fellowship of the Ring') started with 'Fellowship' and watched 'The Two Towers' to see where the story went next. For them - the majority - they wouldn't really need much of a 'recap' to the plot. For anyone else, they may be a little confused.Personally, I'm a huge fan of both the books and the big screen adaptations, therefore I loved 'The Two Towers' and 'got' every reference. However, if it does have one major flaw it is that it relies on the audience knowing what's come before. It doesn't really spend much time reminding everyone of the events leading up to what's happening now.It continues the tale of a fictional land known as 'Middle Earth' and a dark lord trying to retrieve his magic ring so that he can become whole again and rule all. Luckily for the free folk (such as elves, men and dwarfs) the ring has been sent to the one place it can be destroyed by two pluckly little creatures known as Hobbits.Basically, if you enjoyed the first film, this one is the (almost - and I'll get to my personal gripe with this one) 'perfect' continuation with the epic Middle Earth journey. All the characters you loved from the original return for this one, even the ones who died are given their screen time due to flashbacks and minimal sub-plots, but, due to the members of the 'Fellowship' taking separate paths throughout the land, now you have three different stories to follow.All of which are skilfully woven together as the characters interact with new and interesting people. All the new cast are great, but if there's one reason to watch this film it's for the computer-generated creation of the - much troubled - 'Gollum.' Andy Serkis 'plays' him thanks to his skills in a 'motion capture' suit, plus he does the voice and, if you ever wanted to see a 100% computer generated character steal every scene, then this is it.Gollum is definitely the high-point for me and the special effects used to create him still hold up to this day. I criticised 'Fellowship' (mildly) for its effects looking a little 'green-screen ish' some twenty years on and the same can be said for a few scenes in 'The Two Towers,' but - again - the scale of the film and how it's all put together totally overshadows any minor gripe like that.Most people (or those I've spoken to!) seem to either like the first book/film or the last the best. For some reason 'The Two Towers' was always my favourite. Which was why I was always a little annoyed to see that - in my opinion - this was the film version that had the most liberties taken with its story. There are a couple of scenes towards the end which are definitely not based on J. R. R. Tolkien's work and make absolutely no sense to me. In fact, they even go as far as to totally fly in the face of the concept of the point of the movie, i.e. keeping the ring's whereabouts a secret. These scenes still irk me to this day, but the rest of the film is so good I can hardly claim not to enjoy it.If you haven't seen it, watch 'The Fellowship' first. I'll be surprised if it doesn't make you want to watch this one, too.",9,0,0,10 January 2020
Stardust," A classic modern fairytale
","There's really little I can find that is negative about 'Stardust.' For what it is, it's possibly as perfect as a film could be. It's a fairytale - pure and simple. It has everything you'd probably expect to see in a 'classic Disney' cartoon - dashing princes, beautiful princesses, evil witches and more magic than you could shake a wand at. There really is nothing new regarding the plot. If you've seen one fairytale then, technically, you've seen this story and nothing will come as much of a surprise when it comes to the plot. However, 'Stardust' isn't your average fairytale.If you check out the tagline on the marketing, you'll see it says something like, 'The fairytale that won't behave.' I can see where they're coming from. It's a cheeky little number that accomplishes what few films can - it's very watchable for both adults and children. Kids will love the simple 'boy meets girl' story. Characters are very easily identifiable as either 'good' or 'evil.' But the film's really bonus is its much darker undertones. There are simply dozens of visual and scripted gags which will probably go way over children's head and be picked up by adults. But, it's not just the script that's fun - every cast member is a recognisable face in their own right. Whether it's the narrator - Sir Ian McKellen, or the dodgy seller of lightning in a bottle (and other magical goods), Ricky Gervais. Naturally, the film likes to highlight its two 'trump cards' - none other than Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro. Of course they turn in as excellent performances as you'd expect (I won't go into DeNiro's performance for fear of spoiling it for people who don't know what he gets up to on board his flying lightning-harvesting ship when his crew aren't watching and Pfeiffer smoulders as the evil witch, ruthlessly hunting our young couple). But it's the film's two leads that really have to carry the film. Clare Danes is more recognisable than her heroic counterpart, Charlie Cox, but their chemistry is just perfect. All in all, you'll be guaranteed a good time with this film whether you're young or old. You'll have to have a heart of stone not to be enchanted by its simple tale of princes and princesses, told to perfection for a modern audience. And, is it just me, or is the soundtrack one of the most uplifting ever in recent times?",10,3,3,25 April 2018

A Quiet Place," It's the quiet ones you have to watch
","It's fair to say that the horror genre has the most forms of clones and clichés about it, meaning every 'new' version that comes out feels less and less new than the last. However, I'm delighted to say (as a long-standing fan of the genre) that 'A Quiet Place' actually finds a new way to package an old story. The tale about monsters hunting humans is nothing new, but the way lead actor/director John Krasinski tells it is definitely worth a watch if you're into this kind of film.Like I say, we join the proceedings a few months after monsters (aliens, maybe - it's never really dwelled upon) have completely taken over the Earth. Only they haven't got the 'tech' you may expect from 'superior' beings. They're more like your run-of-the-mill 'chase-you-and-eat-you' monsters who rely on their physical strength and speed, rather than their brains. And, it looks like us poor ol' earthlings only figured out that their one - sort of - weakness was that they are blind, hunting by sound alone. But, if you think that gives us much of an edge, let me inform you they have REALLY GOOD ears.Now, real life husband and wife John Krasinski and Emily Blunt play an on-screen couple who are desperately trying to survive and keep their children safe on a farm as they adapt to this new way of existing.First of all, I like the fact that our human heroes - technically - can't 'win.' The Earth is lost. The five humans are never going to 'take down' a planet-load of monsters singlehandedly. All they can do is survive as best they can. The first thing you need to know is that you could almost call 'A Quiet Place' a 'silent' film. Yes, there are plenty of music and natural sound effects, but dialogue is at an absolute minimal. This is down to the simple fact that if you talk - even on a farm in the middle of nowhere - chances are a monster will hear you from across the town and have you for lunch. This means that a lot of the 'interactions' between characters are by way of either facial expressions and body language, or sign language (yeah, one of the children is deaf, so the family already knew how to communicate this way). This gives the actors quite a challenge to portray enough emotions via these means. You may expect the adult actors to be up to this, but it's rare to see the kids pull it off with such apparent ease.What I really enjoyed about the film was the way that all characters behave in a way that seems real. Another cliché of horror films is that people act so dumb in whatever horrific situation they find themselves in we end up shouting at them on screen and lose patience with them. I'm pleased to say that all characters here don't make dumb decisions (oh, unless you count getting pregnant in a world that's gone to hell!).All in all, 'A Quiet Place' was a joy to watch for a horror fan like me. Whatever flaws it may contain are barely worth noting as it's a complete breath of fresh air for the genre.",9,3,6,8 April 2018
22 Jump Street," The most 'self aware' sequel ever made
","The first film, '21 Jump Street,' was a surprise hit. How do we know? Because the cast of '22 Jump Street' tells us as much in the script. At first I wondered whether I was imagining it, but then I realised it was basically the 'running joke' of the movie that the film-makers were only too aware how lucky they were to get the chance to make a sequel.In fact, the story is exactly the same as the first – two junior cops must infiltrate high school in order to catch the bad guys. This could be considered a 'weak point' in the plot, yet the film happily exploits its own 'failings' on order to draw laughs from the fact that it's basically the same as before.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have really good chemistry as the two leads and their dynamics is what saves the film. I didn't expect to like the first film and was as surprised at how good it was. However, I did think that – despite the good, self-aware gags – it was less funny than its predecessor. That's mainly the middle of the film when it does tend to drag a bit. The first and last third seem to play better when it comes to laughs.If you liked the first film, I'd say you might as well see this one, too. It's not quite as sharp, but there is just enough laughs (apart from the 'self aware' stuff) to warrant your time, although I didn't think it was as good as some critics have been saying. I heard a lot of people saying how it surpassed the original. I wouldn't agree with that, but it is okay, just not great.",6,2,5,18 December 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," Certainly not a 'dog's dinner'
","Perhaps if you sat down to watch 'Dog Day Afternoon' you may come away claiming that it's totally unbelievable to be a good film. I might have done if it weren't for the fact that I was alerted to it being based on a true story by someone else. It's about a bank robbery in the seventies that was carried out in broad daylight. It's safe to say that it would be a pretty bland film if everything went according to plan. However, in this case, nothing went according to plan and it was a total mess from beginning to end. That's what makes it such a damn good film (well, that and Al Pacino).
Pacino plays the lead robber (well, out of the two of them) who managed to bungle his way through raiding a bank and taking hostages at the same time. Of course his ineptitude means that the police have plenty of time to show up and Pacino is forced to hold out in the bank with little idea of how to escape a secure building surrounded by marksmen. The film clearly rests on his shoulders and, as the majority of his performances show, he can more than handle the responsibility (which is probably more than can be said for his character!). He clearly enjoyed himself on set and much of the dialogue ended up being improvised as he almost becomes institutionalised over the period of a matter of hours, before almost succumbing to the brief stint as 'minor celebrity' that his dodgy deed affords him. There are a few twists and turns which I won't go into for fear of giving plot points away, although I will say that it's an interesting commentary on the issues of the time and would be equally interesting if something like this happened today - I'm guessing plenty of #bankheists would be posted from bemused onlookers. 
If you're in any way a fan of bank robbery/heist movies, or just a fan of Al Pacino then you really have to watch this. It is a little long and may have benefitted from a harsher editor here and there, but apart from that, it stands the test of time.

Kick-Ass," I must have watched a different film
","I really feel like I shouldn't bother writing this. It's nearly 2013 and I've only just got round to watching Kick Ass. Since it was released everyone I've ever spoken to about it (and I speak to most people about films!) has said how great it is.I should leave the review there, with the words 'Everyone says it's great.'However, it just left me cold. There was something about it I didn't get. I thought it was going to be funnier. It's not that funny. It's also not action-packed enough to be an action film. The action is over-the-top as if it's trying to be silly, but 'silly' and 'action' don't really go together for me.That's about it from me. I didn't like it. I didn't like the characters. I didn't like the action or the attempts to crowbar some drama into something that's, for the most part, trying to be silly and take off the superhero genre. But I'm definitely the minority. Like I say, everyone else I've ever spoken to loved this.For the record, I also don't like Bladerunner or the Godfather. I can't tell you why either.",6,1,4,11 November 2014
Ghostbusters," Never to be bettered
","'Ghostbusters' was one of those films where lightning just struck in all the right places and was - seemingly - impossible to recapture. The story is so simple that it's amazing no one ever tried to do it before - four men set up a business capturing ghosts. End of. It could have been awful. I'm pleased to say it was perfect.Recently, I've read that all sorts of actors were attached the to the project before the final cast was signed. I don't know what it would be like with anyone but Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson (oh, and Sigourney Weaver is along for the ride, too - no bad thing to also have 'Ripley' on the cast list). They made a direct sequel which - sort of - worked (I liked it, but the popular consensus is that it was vastly inferior to its predecessor) and then a half remake/half reboot in 2016 (and the least said about that, the better). Neither direct attempts, nor any half-baked rip-offs ever lived up to the original and I doubt any ever will.Like I say, it's first and (possibly main) selling point is its simplicity. We get to know all major characters straight away and none require any lengthy plot explanations to 'explain' who they are and their various motivations. The action (i.e. appearance of the ghosts) happens almost within the first quarter of an hour and this is probably as good a time as any to make mention of the special effects - they're pretty fantastic, not just for 1984, but - believe it or not - basically stand up to scrutiny to this day (okay, so the 'dogs' look a little 'stop motion,' but apart from that...).I could say that the uber-catchy theme song and subsequent cry of 'Who you gonna' call?' went some way to establish the film's hold on popular culture, but, ultimately, it wouldn't be anything without humour. The cast are - as mentioned - perfect and play off each other like few ensembles can ever do. Just as the special effects hole up today, so does the humour - effortlessly.If you're looking for comedy - look no further. The fact that it's - loosely - sci-fi is secondary to the charm of its stars. In many of today's films (and I'm thinking of the Marvel movies, mainly) many lament the lack of a 'strong villain' for our heroes to go up against. Here, interestingly, there isn't really one central bad-guy to fight. I suppose you could argue that a pen-pushing civil servant who's constantly trying to shut the Ghostbusters down is a 'semi-baddie,' but the 'true' nasty doesn't really show up until the final act, but, that doesn't really matter. The film is perfect and will truly stand the test of time. I can't see today's generation being any the less taken with its brilliance.",10,1,1,21 June 2019
The Longest Day," Possibly the greatest ensemble war movie ever made
","There's not much that hasn't been written about 'The Longest Day.' It's arguable one of the best World War II movies out there. It charts – predominantly – the 8th June (or 'D-Day' to most of us) when the Allies finally stormed their forces into France to liberate it from German rule, but the first part (of the film's near three-hour runtime) tells the story of the events leading up to the fateful day itself.The film is generally an 'ensemble' with multiple actors appearing for – in some cases – quite brief periods of time. However, due to the general talent of the actors, that never really feels like a problem. Yes, I'm sure that any of them could have had an entire film made just about them, telling their individual story, but we have to make do with their minor performances. It's hard to pick a 'stand-out' performance as they're all so good.Apparently, according to some who have lived through the day itself, the film isn't always factually accurate (and even a former President of America apparently left a showing due to technical inaccuracies). However, even if some creative liberties have been taken, it still gives a no-nonsense feel of what the troops had to go through when entering the French beaches and countryside for the first time.Due to the film's length, there's even time to fit in some scenes with the Germans themselves. It's important to see what was happening on the 'other side' as it relates specifically to how the Allies managed to pull of the (overall) victory.Of course it is black and white, so for those who find it unable to watch anything that isn't designed for 3D and/or IMAX will find it hard to take! The Longest Day may seem a little dated by today's standard, but, if you're a fan of war films, or are even just interested in what went on during World War II, then you should definitely check this one out.",9,3,5,14 November 2014
Moulin Rouge!," Spectacular! Spectacular!
","I know it's a terribly stereotypical thing to say, but many guys prefer cyborgs smashing into each other and car chases through Tokyo over a musical about the 'merits of love.' I am definitely the former. In fact, most of the titles in my DVD collection ends with the phrase '...of the Living Dead.' However - and it's a BIG 'however' - I will make a massive exception for 'Moulin Rouge.'I'm certainly not a fan of musicals in general (and I'm sure 'South Park: The Movie' doesn't count as one, despite having plenty of songs contained within), so I'm not sure why I love 'Moulin Rouge' so much. It's set a hundred years or so ago in Paris when a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman) in the - kind of infamous - nightclub, the Moulin Rouge. Naturally, true love never runs smooth and the pair have plenty of highs and lows along the way.I suppose it helps that I'm a fan of Ewan McGregor (who can sing probably better than you imagine!) and, possibly what aided this musicals place in my heart was the fact that all the songs they sing are actually 'modern day' songs which work surprisingly well for what is - effectively - a 'period piece.' Nicole Kidman also deserves a nod for her singing voice, although I'm not a massive fan, but she did everything she had to well enough. Although, the two definitely do have chemistry, even leading to rumours of being 'more than just friends' off-screen, too!Although however much you like or dislike the film's leads, what often gets talked about more than who's in the production is the way it's directed. It truly is a film student's dream to watch. Baz Luhrmann does a fantastic (and most of all creative!) job at bringing this old tale to life and injecting more energy than Renton every experienced from 'jabbing a vein' in 'Trainspotting.' The songs/dances are the true definition of 'high energy' and the whole film is awash with vibrant colours and glamour.The supporting cast are also good: John Leguizamo does well for a 'normal-size' man playing a dwarf and therefore acting (and dancing!) on his knees. Jim Broadbent always stood out for me and definitely deserves a nod. The film's primary antagonist is Richard Roxburgh, who, in my opinion, is delightfully campy as the villain. However, I did hear that he took a lot of criticism for his performance and some saw him as the film's 'weakest point.' I guess he does chew up the scenery in some places, but in a film so over-the-top as this, I couldn't really tell the difference.Overall, there's nothing really new here in terms of storytelling. After all... the 'boy meets girl' story is a tale as old as time. However, it's not the story that stands out, but HOW it's told. You definitely don't have to be a fan of musicals to appreciate the volume of energy and love that's gone into making this. It really is a spectacle to observe.",9,2,2,3 July 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Stuff happens
","I've been a fan of the 'X-Men' films since they first appeared on our (big) screens way back in 1999. The first two were great, I didn't even mind the third that much and the spin-offs were better (in my opinion!) than most people made out. Naturally, I was sceptical of the franchise's (soft) reboot with a new – much younger – cast. However, thanks to JJ Abram's style of rebooting a franchise, i.e. shove in aspects of time travel and a parallel universe to keep us die-hard fanboys quiet and it sort of worked out, blending old and new cast members alike. Then came the awkwardly-titled 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and I got completely lost. That may come from me not seeing its predecessor ('First Class') for a while, so I had kind of forgotten who's who. However, you would think that any film would need to be reasonably accessible to a new audience (or someone like me who had just forgotten what had happened before). Basically, it was a bit all over the place and people who were dead were now alive and people who were alive were now recast. Unfortunately, the latest 'X-Men Apocalypse' movie kind of feels more like 'Days of Future Past' than 'First Class.' It's quite a long film and so at least they try to give some of the characters a bit of an introduction. Even if you – technically – know who these characters are/were, they've most likely been recast, so you'll probably need a refresher on who they are and whether they're still playing roughly the same role as before. I guess the new cast are pretty good/relatable, but I'm afraid I'm used to the 'old lags' and it's like watching 'Muppet Babies' or 'Tiny Toons' only with mutants instead of miniature Kermit the Frog or Bugs Bunny (there's even a – practically – teenage Striker trying to hunt the mutants down!). We see our – now young – heroes going about their daily life, getting picked on by that clichéd bully we see in every Hollywood movie with a high school in it and the once fearsome Nightcrawler looks like he's about to cry most of the time. It just feels so far removed from the original 1999 'X-Men' movie that this is completely unrecognisable.Then – as my title suggests – stuff happens. We're treated to one scene after the other where someone does something. That's my main gripe with it. The story doesn't really go anywhere. Sure, the effects are good and the make-up believable, but it almost comprises on a load of stand-alone sketches that don't seem to follow on from the one before. We see the titular ('first mutant') 'Apocalypse' get released and then start recruiting for his higher-management team by generally making them 'level up' quicker than usual and a new haircut for free. Then we bounce back to the fledgling X-Men and so forth until they have to face off against him. I may enjoy the X-Men films, but I have to confess that I've never read the comics, so I can't really comment on how authentic Oscar Issac's look or performance is. All I know is that he looks pretty unrecognisable as the bad guy and is reasonably cool when it comes to villains and the villainous stuff they generally do, but as far as I understand the real comic book fans felt a little short-changed at his overall role.However, it all feels a little samey when you place 'X-Men Apocalypse' next to every other recent superhero movie these days (and also some NON superhero movies, too) as Apocalypse's big plan involves the almost mandatory 'skybeam' i.e. the giant computer-generated beam of light coming down and laying waste to a populated area. Yup, it does seem that that's every super villain's masterplan these days.So, did I hate it? Well, no. It's okay. Like I say – stuff happens. And, despite most not really following on from whatever stuff happened right before (and don't get me started on the whole film not really following on from the rest of the franchise!), some of the stuff that happens is kind of cool. So, it does have that going for it. I just think that it's all a bit of a wasted opportunity when you're presented with such great characters and none of them ever really feel like they're allowed to shine. I didn't think I wasted my time watching it, but out of all X-Men-related films, I think this is the one I'm least likely to bother watching again.Oh, and is it just me or is there a weird 'Mother Theresa cameo' near the start?",6,0,1,5 May 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," General popcorn viewing
","Maybe I'm old, but I didn't enjoy Spiderman 2 as much as I wanted to. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate it, nor did I regret watching it. I just felt that there was an element of 'seen it all before' in there.I'm not going to go into the plot of a Spiderman film. If you can't guess that our web-slinging superhero star comes up against another baddie then you really need to watch more movies! I wasn't expecting some deep and revolutionary film, filled with perfect character arcs and plot twists, but I did think it would be a little more original than it was.It seemed to want to cater for the 'tween' generation, pushing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey's relationship to the forefront of the film, as if it was nothing more than a 'teen drama.' Yes, there's the 'fantasy' element to the story of how being a superhero interferes with your 'normal' teenage romance, but when Peter and Gwen are doing their 'make-up/break-up' routine, it comes across as a 'Twilight' movie with more cobwebs.The fact is that a Spiderman movie is at its best when we see Spiderman. Andrew Garfield is much better (and much more interesting) as the superhero than when he's wandering up and down the halls of his school moaning about Gwen. The film-makers really should have learnt from 'Iron Man 3' about how the public feels about superhero movies where the hero doesn't spend enough time 'in costume.' However, when the action starts it gets going. You may have seen the advertising promoting 'three' villains. Well, that is technically true, but the only one you'll really get to know properly is Jamie Fox's 'Electro.' He's the main threat to Spiderman (and the best). And when he starts kicking off then our web-slinging friend is in trouble. Everything is better when things explode. Jamie Fox plays the tragic villain with sympathy at first, before slipping into full-blown menace. The 'Green Goblin' is also in it, but he's secondary at this stage to Electro. And don't even bother mentioning 'Rhino' – he's barely got more than a cameo in the film.It's a long film, stretching over two hours and, although the action is exciting and when it's good it's good, there was still what felt like a lot of 'filler' in there that could have been trimmed out to make it a little less irrelevant.Probably loved by kids and enjoyed by me on only some of the levels it was meant for.",7,1,4,3 October 2014
Ex Machina," It gets better
","'Ex Machina' is one of those films where, upon watching the whole thing, I'm glad I stuck with it. It tells the – slightly slow-moving – tale of a young computer programmer who works for a huge, multinational tech company and is then apparently picked at random by his reclusive billionaire boss and asked to join him in his mountain retreat for 'special duties.' Of course that slightly sounds like he's got a case to sue for sexual harassment, but it's not like that. His Bill Gate-likes founder has only gone and created the first ever artificially intelligent robot/android/cyborg (call it what you will) and wants an independent source to witness this feat.Luckily, for our hero – Caleb – this artificial life form isn't the kind of muscle-bound cyborg who typically comes back in time to kill your mother. Instead, she – or 'Ava' – is more designed around the 'female form' (well most of her, anyway – there are still parts of her on show that are blatantly wires and circuit boards). Anyway, this makes their interaction a little more 'complicated' – if that's the right word to describe getting a crush on what is technically an iphone with eyes. So, will our hero fall head over heels for her, or declare her simply just a toaster who looks good in a mini-dress? The majority of the film is basically conversations between either Caleb and Ava or Caleb and his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Now, there's nothing wrong with a film based mainly around dialogue. It does bring the characters and their motivations out and you really feel like you're getting to know them. However, I just found the first half of the movie a little slow. I 'got' the characters pretty early and it was clear to see that there was more going on here than meets the eye. Perhaps the film did too good a job in setting up the unsettling feeling as to what was going to come? I was basically dying for something to happen – or someone to die – whatever. But, like I said, when it all goes down it's worth the wait. The second half of the film changes from simply 'unsettling' to downright dark! Despite the film having little action, it does maintain a real '28 Days Later' feel. And probably for the reason that it was written by the same writer. The lingering shots and music make it possible that it's set somewhere in the same universe (assuming there's still some of the world left after the 'infected' had their way with it! Normally, like to mention one of the actors who stood out. I feel that I should say that Oscar Isaac gave a great performance, but I'm not entirely sure he does. One of my annoyances with the first half of the film came from him. I just felt he was so fundamentally unlikeable. Maybe that was supposed to be how he was, but when a character makes up basically one third of the cast and is so downright awful, it left it a bit hard to take.Still, despite all my minor gripes, I did enjoy the film (as I say, mainly the second half where I felt it sped up a bit!) and so if you're in the mood for something with no car chases or giant robots stomping through New York then give this one a go. It's got good performances and is more of a subtle thriller than Hollywood's average crop.",7,0,1,17 March 2017
Back to the Future Part III," Great end to the trilogy
","I know it's hard for any sequel to live up to the original. Yes, the first 'Back to the Future' film is definitely the best, but - come on - as far as sequels go, 'Parts II & III' are still pretty impressive. I know they may not have the same 'original feel' to them, but they at least to a fantastic job of expanding the original concept/mythology and growing the much-loved characters we met in the first outing.I doubt there are many people who will decide to watch 'Part III' of a trilogy first, so my advice is watch them all in order. Then you can experience the full magic of watching a young high school student (Marty McFly - played perfectly by Michael J Fox) get caught up in with his friend 'Doc Brown's' (played by the only person seemingly capable of upstaging Michael J Fox here - Christopher Lloyd) exploits with a time-travelling DeLorean carThere's a brief recap at the beginning of the film as to how our heroes have become stuck in the past and now they have to go further back to the Wild West in order to get home - don't worry, if that sounds confusing - it all makes sense if you've watched all three.What you have here is a movie that feels totally at home in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, but this time is set among cowboys and spittoons. It delights in poking fun of the time period and genre, plus gives us familiar faces/enemies in the form of series antagonist 'Biff Tannen's' long lost grandfather as a murderous outlaw - naturally hell-bent on causing all sorts of problems for our heroes. Plus we even have a love interest for Doc - which does add a new dimension to the story. Normally if a new character is introduced so late it feels a bit jarring - I'm glad to say that here the insertion of 'Clara Clayton' feels organic and a necessity to the overall story.You may not love it as much as the first, you may also consider this (or the second) to be the 'weakest' in the series, but even if that's true - it's still fantastic family entertainment. There are few films that can be considered 'timeless' (especially those made today), but the 'Back to the Future' trilogy can still be enjoyed by the whole family and holds up as it ever did (even if it did fail to predict what 2015 would look like and many of us are still waiting for hover boards and Nike self-lacing trainers!).'Rick and Morty' may be cool, but they'll never be as well-loved as those they are spoofing. Long may the 'Back to the Future' trilogy never be remade/rebooted/whatever. 'Part III' may only be an 8/10, but overall the series will always remain a 'perfect 10.'",8,4,4,1 April 2020
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A bit like the 'Human Torch'
","The first big screen outing for the 'Fantastic Four' hardly set the Box Office alight. Therefore a lot of people were actually quite surprised when they were afforded a second attempt. So... did they get it right the second time around? Well, sort of. Like my title states – this film is a bit like one of the Four themselves, i.e. hot and cold.I always felt the first film only really got going in its dying stages. Both movies are no more than an hour and a half in length and the first one only really sees the Four coming together to fight their nemesis, Dr Doom, in literally the last ten minutes. So, I was kind of hoping this one would continue the battle most of the way through. Sadly, it didn't. Everything kind of goes back to how it was before – the four heroes bicker among themselves and then have to use their combined powers to save a cat up a tree (or something – I may have made that one up, but you get the idea).Now, instead of just Dr Doom, we now have three baddies to contend with. However, none of them really do muc that's bad throughout the best part of the movie. We have the Silver Surfer (voiced a bit by Laurence Fishburne) who just kind of flies about a bit and causes power cuts. Dr Doom is still on the scene, but after the whole of the first film was spent turning him into Dr Doorm, he promptly drops his iron mask and cape and returns to a guy with slightly effeminate eyebrows (who has borrowed Emperor Palpadine's lightening fingertip powers). Finally we have Gallactus (I think that's how you spell it). In the comics he's a giant robot who eats planets. Now he's a kind of giant puff of smoke who travels through space squeezing worlds (and you only see him in the last quarter of an hour or so).So, without – what I would call – 'real' villains, do the heroes carry the film? Again, not really. Ioan Gruffudd may be a decent enough actor (and look the part of Reed Richards), but he's not really (action) leading man material. And, if that wasn't bad enough, the special effects used to extend his limbs always look a bit ropey. Jessica Alba looks cute, but does little else, Michael Chiklis is probably the best, utilising his decent 'Thing' make-up to add weight to his character while Chris Evans kind of just uses these films as a warm-up for his Captain America superhero outing.I first saw the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer when it came out in 2006. I have just watched it again in 2015. Baring that in mind I'd forgotten enough of it to make it okay for a second viewing. And, if I was bored and fancied something that wasn't quite up to the 'Marvel universe' movies such as Iron Man, Thor and the Avengers, I'd probably watch both Fantastic Four movies again in another nine years.Kids will probably like it the most. It does have a couple of good action scenes that gets your blood pumping, but, like the human torch, just when it heats up, it cools down equally as quickly.Probably better than the first one, but only just.",6,1,2,7 January 2015
Transformers," Guess the saga isn't for me (any more)
","I suppose in order to review the live action film of the 1980s cartoon/toys 'Transformers' (2007) I have to confess that I spent much of the eighties playing with the robots and generally gobbling up everything with an Autobot logo on it. If someone had released this film back then I would probably give it the highest rating possible. Sadly, I'm way too old, jaded and wrapped in the nostalgia of the Saturday morning cartoon I knew and loved.If you don't know anything about the series (and I can't believe anyone could NOT know who Optimus Prime and Megatron are, but that's just me!), it - loosely - follows various narratives made popular in cartoon, comic and then computer-generated TV series and then blends them all together. But that's okay. They get the basics right - a group of good robots (who can change their appearance into Earth-based vehicles) arrive on our planet, but are quickly drawn back into their endless war with their evil counterparts, the Decepticons.I never saw this film in the cinema and I'm glad. This is down to my unique way of watching my DVD copy. I will explain. The film is well over two hours long and, for the first hour, you basically don't actually see one of the titular robots. Instead, we're treated to a teen-love story which utilises every cliche in the genre. A nerd (Shia LaBeouf) falls for the hot chick (Megan Fox) and has to impress her despite the best efforts of the jock (who I don't know the name of). In short... I don't give a damn about any of these characters. Controversially, I watch a film called 'Transformers' to see Transformers. Therefore, viewing this film on DVD allows me to skip every scene which centres on the annoying and pointless flesh-bags.Now, you may be expecting me to start saying how by ignoring the humans and concentrating on the robots make the film better. And it does. Sort of. Again, I'm trying to watch the film through the eyes of kids today and I can see them loving the robots in the exact same way as I did with those in the cartoons. For me, who's love of the franchise comes from the eighties (we call this 'G1' i.e. 'Generation 1') I wanted to see the robots look how I remember them. The Autobot leader 'Optimus Prime' is awesome. Fortunately the producers listened to fans and employed voice actor Peter Cullen to give him his personality - and it's by far the best part of the film. Even I could tell who Optimus Prime was because he basically looked how I remembered him. Sadly, the others didn't. A couple of Decepticons were okay (Starscream), but even Megatron was completely underused (he's the film's antagonist and yet only came into the story in the final act).If I was given a free reign to make a Transformers movie, yes I'd base it on the eighties look, feel and story. Sadly, Michael Bay had other ideas and the robots are hard to tell apart (Optimus Prime and Bunblebee excluded) when they're standing still. When they fight, whatever epic battle scene that should be before us is akin to smashing two grey jagged lumps of metal together repeatedly while Megan Fox poses provocatively.Basically, kids who have no prior knowledge of the franchise will probably love this. For 'oldies' like me, I just watch it for Optimus Prime - who is by far the true star. I just wish he was in it more. I've never felt so ashamed to be human!",6,0,0,7 April 2019
Men in Black II," More of the same
","Er, where do I begin... probably best to start with the first 'Men in Black' film. It starred Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as two shady government agents who track down and keep an eye on all alien life forms coming and going from our fair green planet. That basically sums up the sequel, too. Not just the plot, but pretty much the entire film.In the first film, an alien with bad intentions crash lands on Earth (happens in Part II as well), the alien takes on human form (check), the alien wants a mythical device to make them all powerful (applicable to both films), if said alien gets their hands on said device then the Earth will be destroyed (yup, MIB2 has that one, too).The first film was awesome. It was funny, charming and basically fun for all the family. The chemistry between wise-crackin' Will Smith and poe-faced Tommy Lee Jones carried it through perfectly. In fact, it's the two leads who make the sequel worth watching. If it wasn't for their on-screen performances, it really wouldn't be worth the effort.It's 'Men in Black by the numbers.' The jokes are good, the performances are good, so if you can excuse the fact that the writers have pretty much taken the script from the first film and churned it out as a sequel, then you should like this outing enough to sit through it. Plus it's short, if that's a bonus. Perhaps the real drawback is that the CGI hasn't held up that well over the years. Almost every (alien-related) scene was done on computers and now you can see the green-screen behind the actors as they do their best to act against nothing.It's another Men in Black film. If you liked the first one and don't care about lazy writing (or perhaps you want to call it 'sticking to what the writers know sells?') then you should like this.",7,0,2,21 April 2016
Kelly's Heroes," True star power
","There are some films that need little introduction. 'Kelly's Heroes' is one of them. However, in today's Hollywood, movies about the Second World War are few and far between, so some may question the relevance of an ensemble piece set in the dying days of Nazi-occupied Europe. First of all, I'll probably stick my neck out and say that it's probably not that 'historically accurate' (or at least not to my knowledge!). By that, I don't mean that Allied forces are fighting zombies or abducted by vampires. From the little I know of the period, all the uniforms, military language and techniques look genuine enough to fool a layman like me. When I say it's not 'historically accurate' I mean that, whereas most films of this era concentrate (naturally) on the struggle between German and Allied forces, 'Kelly's Heroes' offers more of a 'crime caper' set during the conflict. If I could compare it to anything, I'd almost say it felt like an 'Ocean's Eleven' in the middle of World War II.Clint Eastwood plays the titular 'Kelly' – a war-weary soldier who's had enough of potentially dying any day without anything to show for it personally. So, when he learns of a bank full of gold behind enemy lines, he puts together a group of equally ambitious troops all willing to risk their lives for a slice of the bullion. As I mentioned, it's a bit of an ensemble cast, the two most notable additions are Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland, both who vie for position of the cast member who's trying to steal every scene they're in. However, just because the film is largely about the quest to blow open a bank vault, doesn't mean that it's not a war film. The setting alone means that our 'heroes' come up against all the perils associated with the period and there are some pretty impressive set-pieces when it comes to the action.I think the best thing about 'Kelly's Heroes' is that it has a pretty broad appeal. Obviously fans of war films will enjoy it, but you have the added bonus of having Clint Eastwood in the lead (and in his prime, no less) supported by some amazing acting talent. Then throw in the action element and the engaging crime plot and you're really going to invest your time into caring whether these (not so heroic) heroes get the gold or not. Don't be put off by its age. It's as good – and more importantly fun – today as it ever was. I will never grow tired from watching a tank freak out the opposing forces by playing music loudly as it comes into battle!",7,3,3,14 September 2017
The Football Factory," The British version of 'Fight Club?'
","'Fight Club' came along and showed us a lifestyle that 'bored American men' could - somewhat - identify with and a - possible - solution to the 'problem' of how to deal with their natural masculine instincts in a world where battering people to a bl00dy pulp is frowned upon (funny that!). Now, 'The Football Factory' may be metaphorical as well as literal miles away from 'Fight Club,' but there are some similarities (believe it or not!) and, no, I'm not saying that Brad Pitt is anything like our own Danny Dyer!Danny Dyer plays 'Tommy Johnson,' on the surface just another cheeky young cockney who loves what most young men do (regardless of whether they're cockney or not), i.e. drinking, women and, or course, football. Now, that doesn't sound too 'out there' apart from the fact that rather than just cheering his team on over a pint in the local boozer, Tommy enjoys smashing the hell out of opposing teams' fans along with his own little gang/army. And he even sees this as some sort of recreational activity/hobby that he looks forward to at the weekend.The parallels I see between 'The Football Factory' and 'Fight Club' are basically that the story revolves around a group of men who just don't seem to be able to fit into society and 'push back' against what most of us perceive as 'the norm' via extreme (and very violent!) methods.It would be easy to say that Tommy Johnson is not a nice guy. Anyone who indulges is violence as fun can't be a relatable hero, right? Well... sort of. He's actually quite a nice, charming guy. If you sat next to him on the bus he certainly wouldn't club you over the head and steal your phone. His use of violence is only channeled against those who also see violence as something to pass the time on a Saturday afternoon after the football's over. Therefore, although we may not identify with him and his 'vices' at least we can follow his journey.The 'story' (notice the quote marks?) is loose to say the least. Most typical Hollywood films have a definite beginning, middle and end, plus the central protagonist has grown on his journey. Here, 'The Football Factory' is almost more like a documentary where we simply drop in during Tommy's life and follow his exploits for a certain amount of time, before saying our goodbyes and leaving him no real better or worse off than when we started.It's certainly not going to be a film for everyone. I can imagine many not really wanting to spend an hour and a half watching a gang of thugs beat another gang of equally unlikable thugs to a pulp. But, it is strangely addictive. Like a carcrash I found myself unable to look away. I'd hardly claim it's a masterpiece, but, from various news reports and documentaries I've watched over the years on the subject matter, it does provide a dramatic little snippet into the lives of people who do this.",7,0,0,8 April 2019
Event Horizon," Hell is just a word...
","'Event Horizon' is basically a 'haunted house' but not a house – a spaceship instead. Many people have called it 'Alien meets Hellraiser' and, seeing as I can't think of a better description, I would say that's pretty apt.A rescue ship locates the wreckage of the lost long experimental starship the 'Event Horizon' and goes in to investigate. Not a good idea. Soon all manner of spookiness and nastiness befall the rescuers and they end up the ones in need of saving.You'll probably recognise a fair few of the cast (mainly Lawrence Fishburne in his 'pre-Morpheous days) and they all do a good job at portraying their characters. However, the real star of the film is the ship itself. The Event Horizon is brilliantly realised and the sets are amazing. This all goes to help build the film's ultimate plus point: the atmosphere. It's dark, it's brooding and you do feel that you're in a – albeit futuristic – haunted house.There's not an awful lot of 'sci-fi/horror' films about these days, so perhaps this one fits into a bit of a niche market. So, if you like the sound of something which has the atmosphere of Alien crossed with the gore and themes of Hellraiser, then this is for you.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,0,3,9 July 2014
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Well... I liked it!
","I'll start by saying that Resident Evil 2 (or 'Apocalypse' to give it its correct name) wasn't that well received. The first film was (loosely!) based on a computer game and kind of went some way to revitalise the 'zombie' genre (or at least bring the undead back into the mainstream again). However, whereas the original was widely well received by people who like a good B-movie, its second outing was pretty much trashed. And, yes, I can see why – but I still liked it! It carries on nicely from the original after a zombie outbreak occurs in a secret lab complex under a major (fictional) city. Now the virus has been released on the above ground population and the city is basically falling to the numerous walking corpses while the authorities struggle to maintain order. Throw in the only survivor from the first movie (a semi-naked Milla Jovovich) and you have your film.I'll start by listing its – numerous – faults. The cast are wafer thin cardboard cut-outs and every piece of dialogue is by-the-numbers and feels like it's been written by a first year film student. There's no such thing as 'character development' and you'll see every plot point coming. They even bring back the 'zombie dogs' from the first film and sort of rehash the scene again. The villain (yes, there's a human villain as well as the zombies) is – again – your typically badly-written Bond-villain rip-off. Then you have the 'Nemesis' – which is basically a man in a rubber suit pretending to be a monster. Everything here is 'style over substance' – the story (and maybe I should put 'story' in quote marks?) moves from one stylised fight-scene to another. You really will have to leave your brain at the door to get over the gaping holes in the plot which lead up to all the major characters getting together.Yet, despite all that – I confess to actually owning this film on DVD and watching it every few years. I found it quite fresh at the time. I've been a fan of the zombie genre since the seventies and missed them so much that I was quite glad to see a big budget film where you get to see a glimpse of society falling while the zombie outbreak is underway. The trick to getting something out of RE2 is basically lowering your expectations suitably to ignore all its faults. You'll probably have to know what Milla Jovovich's movies are generally like, i.e. superhuman female kicking the hell out of numerous faceless baddies (or zombies in this case). Don't expect too much. It's a complete B-movie where you can wander in and out of the room at will and still know exactly what's going on.I like it, but even if you do really hate it as much as the majority, it's still head and shoulders over every last sequel which follows (and there are a lot of those!).",7,0,2,3 January 2016
Mulholland Drive," A mind-bending film which makes you work
","'Mulholland Drive' is a classic, but that doesn't mean it'll be enjoyed by everyone. If you like your stories easy to follow and getting from point A to point B in a straight line, then you probably have never watched anything by David Lynch. He specialises in creating teasing, disconcerting vibes and films based on feeling and mood, rather than linier storytelling.Mulholland Drive is a dark mystery about a young girl who arrives in Hollywood to pursue her dream of being an actress, only to get caught up with another young woman who has lost her memory and has a murky past which slowly gets unravelled.If you're familiar with Lynch's work, you may have seen his previous film 'Lost Highway.' It wasn't as well received as this one. It was - although visually stunning and darkly odd - not easy to follow. David Lynch creates films that are, to a certain degree, about what you feel, rather than just telling a story. He freely admits that Lost Highway was about a 50/50 split of feelings and storytelling. This made it a lot harder to follow as a narrative. However, Mulholland Drive is a little easier - it's about 85% story and 15% feeling, making 1 hour and 52 minutes of it pretty easy to watch.Then you have 'the big change.' The last 20 minutes are the film's 'pay-off' and you will either love it for showing you what you've spent nearly two hours watching, or hate it for 'cheating' you.If you're thinking of watching some of David Lynch's work, Mulholland Drive is a reasonable place to start. It's a basic mystery story which is - relatively - easy to follow. If you like it, try Lost Highway, or even Inland Empire (which is the hardest of all his films to try and decode, based on it being about 80% feeling and only 20% story). Just be warned, all of Lynch's work is pretty dark, often violent and pretty sexually explicit.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10,2,3,4 August 2014
Dumb and Dumber," The clue is in the title
","I remember when Jeff Daniels was doing interviews for 'Dumb and Dumber,' he stated that he had to mentally 'dumb himself down' when preparing himself for the role of Harry. I think that's what anyone contemplating watching Dumb and Dumber needs to do in order to appreciate it.Okay, so Jim Carey is the star (Lloyd) and he and his equally-clueless best mate Harry set off on a road trip across America in order to return what he thinks is a missing briefcase to its rightful owner. So, basically it's a 'road movie.' Now, by definition road movies are pretty 'low on plot.' The 'story' is simply the two dumb guys moving from one daft setting to the next. Yes, it is low on story. But it is pretty damn funny. And isn't that the main thing? It was made at the height of Jim Carey's fame, therefore he was somehow still fresh. If you're looking for low-brow humour then you'll find what you're looking for here. Yes, it won't tax you mentally and, by the time the credits roll, you may actually be thinking with a few less IQ points. However, if you're prepared to trade a few brain cells in for a lot of laughs then you've come to the right place.Best dead bird laughs since Monty Python's parrot.",8,1,2,9 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I don't see why it's (quite!) so divisive
","In 2015 we - us 'Star Wars' fanboys - finally got treated to more 'proper' Star Wars (and by 'proper' I mean with characters we actually cared about in a story set after the events of 'Return of the Jedi' rather than prequels or spin-offs). 'The Force Awakens' opened to almost completely positive reviews, most completely overlooking the fact that it was a thinly-disguised reboot of 'A New Hope.' Yes, I too enjoyed it, but never really went as far as to claim it was as good as many were making it out to be.Now, 'The Last Jedi' opened to mega-praise by the critics, describing it was either 'The best Star Wars film ever,' or (at worst) 'The best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.' Then the audience reviews started rolling in and it seems they weren't so impressed. Personally, I enjoyed the film for the most part. I certainly wouldn't say it's perfect, but what film is these days?First of all the (new) cast, as they had more to prove that the returning Luke and Leia. Daisy Ridley seemed more comfortable as 'Rey' this time, however she did struggle with some of the more 'dramatic' moments, but she did play of the 'battle-worn' Luke well. Oscar Isaac was awesome as Poe and was almost like having a new (younger) Han Solo back again. Adam Driver was much more in sync with being the villainous Kylo Ren and clearly enjoying his beefed-up role. However, like I say, it's far from perfect and for every Isaac and Driver there were new faces who just didn't work. Almost all the extras (who had lines) in both the First Order fleet and the Resistance appeared to almost be reading their lines off prompt cards and, despite new face 'Rose Tico' getting high praise, I found her annoying and pointless.At least we had Luke and Leia to fall back on. The two 'old faces' (no offence Mark and Carrie!) are seasoned pros of the genre and it was a joy to watch them back in the roles that made them famous. For me, Luke was the perfect evolution of the character (I understand that statement may be shot down from many!). Leia too is awesome, however the storyline itself does seem to be troubled by Carrie Fisher's unfortunate death, leaving many (including me this time) to wonder what's going to become of this highly-prominent story arc.The film looked brilliant and was a joy to watch - visually. I felt the majority of the (large) cast worked well and played off each other, plus there seems to be a view held that there's 'too much humour' in the film and it's 'typically Disney' and 'almost like an 'Avengers' movie.' Yes, there were a few humorous moments, but I didn't think they detracted from the overall story or feel. However, the films was way too long and this leads me to the point which does seem to unite most viewers - that the Rose/Finn sub-plot was not just annoying, pointless and too CGIed, but simply padded out the film to levels which made many of us check our watches when it was revealed that the film was going on (and then on).That was my major gripe about the film, i.e. too long thanks to wasting Finn on a pointless mission. When this film comes out on DVD I will buy it, but just skip these scenes forever after. I understand that most people who hated the film were hung up on decisions made by established characters and I can sort of see where they're coming from. However, for me there were more minor grips such as how certain (interesting) characters are underused, various plot points from The Force Awakens aren't answered and, if I'm really nit-picking, The Force itself just seems to add new powers whenever it wants, making us wonder why Jedi/Sith didn't use all this a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away!).Overall, I did enjoy this film, despite its flaws (biggest of which I will personally rectify courtesy of the 'Chapter Skip' button on my DVD remote. However, no matter how bad you've heard it is, it's NOT going to be 'removed from Star Wars cannon' like that pointless petition seems to want it to be. For me, it was a decent enough addition to the Star Wars universe and I'm looking forward to seeing where they take the final part of the (new) trilogy in a couple of years time.",5,3,14,22 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel do it again
","'The Guardian of the Galaxy.' Who are they? I didn't know. Of course I quickly found out that they were based on – yet another – Marvel comic book, but a lesser-known one this time. And – yet again – we have another branch of the 'Marvel cinematic universe' which is currently best known for Iron Man, Thor, the Avengers and so on. However, what's most notable here is that 'The Guardians' is possibly the least 'linked' movie to what's already gone before. You could almost consider it a 'stand alone' film which needs no real knowledge of all three Iron Man movies (for example) to watch it.Perhaps Marvel knew they were taking a gamble, investing so much money in a film that *most* people haven't really heard of. That's why they didn't 'link' it that much. That way, if it bombed at the Box Office, they could quietly forget about it and carry on with what's popular, i.e. 'Earth-based' superhero movies.But then that's not going to happen. Because 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is great. Maybe what's best about it is that it doesn't really feel like a 'superhero movie' even though it's set in the same cinematic universe. In case you don't know... the five Guardians who find themselves forced to band together in order to stop an evil intergalactic warlord from destroying the universe (nothing new on the plot, eh?) are: Star Lord – our former resident of Earth, now all grown up and living in outer space while acting like a bad boy version of Han Solo, a green-skinned warrior babe alien called Gamora (Star Lord's obvious love interest – again, nothing new there), a muscle-bound alien, Drax, a borderline psychotic cyborg-racoon, Rocket and his tree-friend, Groot. Star Lord is basically the star, so he gets much of the screen time. He's played by Chris Pratt who enjoys being the bad boy and does it well. However, just Gollum partly stole the show in Lord of the Rings, it's the computer-generated Rocket the manic racoon who's a sheer joy to watch (Bradley Cooper who voiced him said he based Rocket on Joe Pesci's bonkers character from Goodfellas – yes, sometimes I could kind of see that there – think a furry Joe Pesci with a tree for a best mate).Now, it wouldn't be half as much fun if this lot all got on. So they don't. Like the Avengers they constantly argue and bicker and try to outdo each other as much as possible. And that's fun to watch; it's a good way to enjoy the light-hearted nature of this semi-Star Wars clone before the action starts. Naturally, there are plenty of action scenes – laser fights, chases, space battles. They come with the territory and keep the kids happy. Personally, I found all these a little too computer-generated and – sometimes, especially while in space – I couldn't tell who was shooting at who.Basically, you don't need to know much about Marvel's 'universe' to enjoy this. You only need to enjoy family sci-fi action films to appreciate this. Deep down, I know there's nothing that new about this film, it's plot or cast, yet I can't really help but love it.",9,1,6,26 November 2014
Evil Dead," The most remaky remake ever remade
","There are two ways to watch the 2013 version of Evil Dead. If you weren't watching horror in the eighties then you'll probably view this as a competent little horror flick. The acting is decent, as are the special effects. There are a few bits that make you jump and other scenes are reasonably creepy. Therefore, you may conclude that, if you were looking for a decent horror film, then you have found one.Then there's the other way of looking at it. If, like me, you were a fan of Bruce Campbell's shenanigans in the eighties, as he depicted the wise-cracking 'Ash' who was in the original trilogy, then you may be thinking why did you bother watching this? I knew the remake had no humour. I was prepared for that. I can enjoy an outright horror film without the 'tongue-in-cheekness' of the original. However, the central characters are pretty damn unlikeable. Without the humour, they're a miserable bunch who you won't really care much about - they're just a collection of stereotypes, i.e. the blonde, the brunette, the jock, the geek and the other one - 'Mia' - who is a teenager trying to get herself off drugs (and failing) and therefore hardly someone we can identify with (hopefully). The opening drags as we're supposed to 'get to know' the characters. It felt like this part occupied the first half of the film. I checked the timer and it had only been on for 23 minutes (it felt like 45). Never a good sign.So, the film plays out pretty much the same as the original. All the aspects are there - the bucketloads of blood, the tree, the thing we never see that runs through the wood and the trapdoor under the cabin. Therefore, if we've seen it before in the original, there's little point in us watching it again. Yes, the film has a more 'polished' feel, but there's nothing new here. They tried to stick to the original by keeping to the plot, which just leaves those who've already watched the original finding little new with what's been done to the new version.If you've never seen the original and you like horror, you'll probably like this. However, I just felt that 'no Ask = no point.' Another great classic plundered and failed. If you want to watch a half decent remake of a horror classic, only the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead comes close.",5,27,48,11 August 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The ultimate revenge movie
","Even if you've never seen a 'Tarantino movie' before, the only thing you need to enjoy this film (and its second part, obviously) is a sense of fun.'Kill Bill vol 1' centres on the mysterious 'Bride' who is one fifth of a team of assassins. Only the other four, plus mentor 'Bill' doublecross her and leave her for dead. Not a good idea. So... four years later, she begins to get her own back on them.Like I say, this film is never meant to be taken truly seriously. Yes, it is strongly 'adult' in its content, but everything is beautifully (and knowingly) over the top, creating a comic-book style adventure (for those adults with strong stomachs).Obviously, Uma Thurman as the central character carries the film on her own, but you won't find a dull or disappointing performance from anyone here.If you like Tarantino's other work, or just martial arts, adventure or action films in general, you should love this. The only people I can see not liking the 'Bill' saga are those who want a 'hyper realistic' film with its roots based firmly in reality. This is not real. This is fun. And fun is sooo much better than real! Perhaps its only real downer was that it was split (by the studio?) into two parts. This makes both halves just slightly longer than you feel they ought to be. Yes, it certainly forces the cinema-going public to pay twice to watch the story, but there are places where scenes feel they could have been left out in favour of making just the single story.",9,0,2,7 July 2014
Saw II," Does well (for a sequel)
","Sequels rarely live up to the originals. And in the horror genre that's even rarer. I reckon that 'Saw' (part I) will always be better, due to its originality and shock value, but its (first) successor does its best to expand on the mythology and give the audience something more. In short... it's definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the original.The first outing could be summed up best by 'two men wake up in a serial killer's lair and try to figure out how to escape.' However, there was far more to the story than just that and the amount of different twists and turns really struck a chord with audiences (that and the amount of 'body horror' that was involved.'Part II' ups the ante in every sense. There are more victims in the killer's latest 'lair,' more gore, more traps, more police officers trying to figure out where these hapless people are, perhaps most importantly, more of the killer himself (who was surprisingly not in the first installment very much). In fact... out of all the characters in the film, it's the killer 'Jigsaw' (Tobin Bell) who steals every scene.As with the first film, there's more to the story than just a bunch of people trying to escape from some fiendishly fatal death-traps. 'Saw II' does its best to keep the surprises coming and, like the first, you'll only have one chance to watch it without knowing all the plot twists that will be heading your way.So, if you liked the original then you should enjoy this one, too. In fact it's almost like these two films could have been written together and filmed back to back. After this one I only stayed with the franchise for a couple more films as the quality really does go downhill after this one. For me the 'Saw' franchise was a two-picture deal.",7,0,0,25 November 2019
From Dusk Till Dawn," So wrong (and yet so right!)
","There are some films that, in principal, shouldn't work and yet everything comes together in a 'perfect storm' of memorable film-making. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one such example. Okay, so back in 1996 Quentin Tarantino was well within his rise to fame and everything he seemed to touch was well-received, so perhaps it's no surprise at how well this film did. Or rather this FILMS (plural!) did. Basically, it started off as two of his scripts that got fused together to become one, making it - almost literally - a film of two halves.I would say that there are 'spoilers' ahead, but, if you've watched the trailer, the big 'reveal' was shown for all to see. Basically, you have one half of the film is about bank robbers, the Gecko brothers, played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself. They're on the run and take a family hostage (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and a boy you've probably never heard of!) in order to get across the border to Mexico. What you have here is a crime/road movie... until they get across the border and are awaiting in a bar to meet their criminal contacts in their new home country. Here, things get a little crazy and the genre totally changes when they find themselves under siege from a seemingly never-ending army of vampires.There's much to love about this film, whether you enjoy one excellent performance after the next (who says Tarantino can't act?! Although it is worth noting that he only writes and stars in this - he hands over the directorial work to Robert Rodrigez), the crazy and deliciously over-the-top gory effects of the vampires being despatched in one creative way after the next, or the banter and classic Tarantino dialogue (and for the real fan-boys - such as myself - there are plenty of in-jokes, nods to other works and reoccurring actors playing different characters). In fact, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is so enjoyable it's quite hard to find a flaw in it... assuming you like your films cheesy with a healthy dose of self-knowing and black humour. Don't take it seriously. It makes sure it never does. Oh, and probably best to warn people not to bother with the sequels and the belated TV show is just an extended remake. Stick to the original (and best, obviously).",9,0,1,17 July 2018
From Dusk Till Dawn," A grisly classic - not to be missed
","There are few people nowadays who don't know From Dusk Till Dawn's 'twist.' Originally, it was two separate screenplays - one about bank robbers fleeing the authorities and the other about a standoff against vampires. Quentin Tarrantino decided to combine the two and package it as one film. The result: awesome.Although not directed by Tarrantino (instead, he casts himself in a leading role), it has a totally Tarrantino feel. Two bank robbers abduct a family in an attempt to escape the law and flee over the border into Mexico. Unfortunately, they run into a whole bar-load of vampires and are forced to team up in order to survive the night.Yes, it may sound like many similar films, but for a start it has an impressive cast, featuring a (young and unusually nasty) George Clooney, Tarrantino himself as Clooney's creepy, psychotic younger brother, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and plenty of cameos from other famous faces as either vampires of those destined to drive a stake through their hearts.Expect slow-building, rambling dialogue, not to mention the inevitable foul language and violence.If you like either Tarrantino's films or general action/horror, mixed with healthy doses of black comedy, then you really should watch this.And, guys, if you haven't seen Salma Hayek's 'snakedance,' you really haven't lived. Kristen Stewart's vampire isn't a patch on her!",9,0,1,27 January 2015
Clash of the Titans," Well it could have been so much worse
","I'm one of those people who watched (and therefore loved!) the original 'Clash of the Titans' movies when I was a child back in the eighties. And, as any cynical adult, I was sceptical about a remake of one of my childhood favourites. The result – in my opinion – it could have been worse.In case you never sat through the charming Harry Hamlin version, Clash of the Titans is one of those 'sword and sorcery' epics that's a bit like Lord of the Rings, only with Gods added for good measure. Naturally an 'updated version' needs more than a few people in sandals and plastercine monsters and the remake does just that. There is a fair amount of computer-generated special effects, but they're not the problem. One of the main complaints against the new version is that it was filmed in NON-3D and then converted into 3D in post-production, therefore creating a slightly blurred and grainy effect overall.And there are some other problems with the finished product, but many of those are cosmetic. Take the lead actor's (Sam Worthington) hair. It's supposed to be ancient Greece and yet he's the only man without long flowing hair – choosing instead for a crewcut. Then of course you have a largely British cast (or at least actors putting on 'British' accents) while Worthington's natural Australian accent does tend to slip through occasionally. And maybe the most petty gripe I can think of is naming the Greek town Worthington's trying to save after a popular British 'catelogue store' – it always amused me when they're desperate to save 'Argos.'When it comes to the (all important) monsters, some of them are good and some do look a little too CGI-ish. The Kraken looked a bit much like the 'Rancor' from Return of the Jedi for my liking, but it's Medusa who steals the show. She was a tough act to follow after her portrayal in the original and, even though she is now fully CGI, she's actually pretty nasty! For some reason though the director felt the need to add too many lens flares (in my opinion) in all the scenes where the Gods were present in Olympus!But, despite all its flaws, it's actually not that bad. Yes, those of us who were brought up on the original will always prefer that version, but I imagine that there are plenty of kids (young boys I'm guessing) who will love watching Perseus slay one computer generated monster after the next. My main gripe was that I found Perseus' 'love interest' a little wooden. Yes, I see the reason the film-makers shoe-horned in a woman to go on the adventure, but she just kind of delivered her lines like she was reading them from an autocue. I don't know whether this is a fault with the director, not getting the best out of her, as I've seen Gemma Arterton in plenty of other films and she's always turned in a better performance.So, if you're not too hung up on the original and you're in a forgiving mood when it comes to remakes, you should enjoy this pretty harmless remake of a classic. The only thing I really couldn't forgive was the scorn displayed from the on-screen characters when 'Boo-boo' the clockwork owl from the original made a cameo appearance!",7,0,1,27 April 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Better than the trailer makes it look!
","I saw the trailer to the Adjustment Bureau and thought it looked more like a romantic drama! Luckily, for the story, the romance part of it isn't the central theme and it's even necessary to the story.Matt Damon is the youngest man trying to be elected as a Senator in the American elections. Before he's due to give an important speech, he bumps into a lady (Emily Blunt) who he falls for. However, apparently he was never meant to meet her and there are sinister powers who will go to any lengths to stop them ever meeting again.The front cover of the film sums it up as 'The Boune Identify meets Inception.' Yes, I couldn't put it much better than that. It's a chase film with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt being pursued by people (albeit sci-fi baddies rather than moral government agents) and trying to sort the mess out.If you like chase films or sci-fi, give it a go. There's no Oscar winning performances here, but there is a lot of fun and , without giving away too much of the plot, it's a good overall premise which gives you enough questions to talk about after the credits have rolled.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,1,29 May 2014
The Hangover Part II," A review of The Hangover Part 1...oh, wait, it's Part 2 actually
","If you haven't seen the Hangover (Part 1) then Part 2 follows the same characters as they, again, wake up after a heavy night with no memory of what happened and plenty of new problems to deal with as a result of it. If you HAVE seen the Hangover (Part 1) then you've basically seen the second one too.A lot of review of Part 2 use phrases like, 'The Hangover Part 2 uses the same jokes, just cranked up to 11.' I sort of agree. Part 2 isn't a bad film; it's quite funny actually, its main problem is just that it doesn't offer anything new.The writers (if you can call them that) have basically taken the script to Part 1, photocopied it, changed the locations and (very) slightly adjusted the jokes and sold it to the studios as a sequel. If fact, it's probably not best described as a 'sequel,' a 'remake' might be a better label. I wonder if the writers did it on purpose, i.e. keep the situations identical in a hope that lightning would strike twice. For me, as every new crazy moment passed, I just couldn't believe how similar it was. It became almost weird just how copied it was. In the end it kind of detracted from the story as all I had to do was think back to what happened next in Part 1 to know what was coming in Part 2.That said, Part 2 is okay if you liked the first and basically want more of the same silliness. It's just a shame the makers didn't wait a little longer and come up with something just a little bit fresher.The monkey is cool though. Just don't let him near your water bottle.",Null,0,0,24 December 2014
Prisoners," Dark, gritty drama
","'Prisoners' is about two young girls who disappear in suspicious circumstances and what the parents (or rather mainly Hugh Jackman) does to try and get them back.And, as you can probably tell by that subject matter, it's certainly no 'feel good' movie. You have to be in the mood for something pretty horrible and disturbing to sit through it. So, if you're in the mood for that (and don't have young children!), you'll find a decent enough thriller with powerful performances from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (who plays the cop in charge of the subsequent investigation).It's quite a long film (over two hours), so don't expect everything to be revealed at once.The only drawback is that, mainly towards the end, there are a few 'ploy holes' which the writers obviously think you'll probably overlook as you're caught up in the drama of the final act. If you don't look too closely and focus on the performances, you should still enjoy what is really a pretty bleak movie.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,1,17 July 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Average Avengers
","I've been quite happily ploughing through Marvel's 'shared cinematic universe.' I've never read a single Marvel comic, so I can't claim to say how faithful each movie is to its source material, but I just enjoy them anyway for what they are – good, popcorn-munching, special effects-fests. The original Avengers film was, in my opinion, about as perfect as it could be – it was the coming together of all the individual superheroes and it did it really well, giving each of them appropriate screen time. Therefore, what I'm trying to say is that I couldn't wait for 'part II.' Now I've watched it, I just feel a bit hollow. I didn't hate it, but it didn't leave half as much of a mark on me as the original. Again, the Earth's finest superheroes come together to fend off a new evil that's threatening to destroy the planet. In the first outing, the villain was Thor's nasty brother, Loki, played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston. Soon after part II was announced we were informed that James Spader would be voicing the new baddie – the titular 'Ultron.' Now, James Spader is a great actor and more than capable of nailing the role as a comic book villain. However, he's only there in voice. His metal, robot character is completely computer-generated and I just didn't find him threatening enough (in the same way I didn't find 'General Grievous in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith).And that was pretty much my main gripe. The Avengers themselves were still pretty cool. There was banter between the central characters and – again – Robert Downey Jr was excellent as Iron Man. Plus there was a pretty awesome fight scene about half way through between two of the characters. So it wasn't all bad. In fact, it wasn't bad at all – just muted. It all felt a bit bland and simply going through the numbers of being an epic blockbuster.All in all, it's an okay outing. I'm sure kids all over the world will love it and buy all the toys in the sequel's range. For me, the two Avengers films could be summed up by the fact that I could barely look away during the first one, but this one I found my mind wandering and tempted to check my mobile phone enough time.",7,2,5,11 January 2016
Everest," I think Marvel has ruined me
","I decided to sit down and watch a film that involved a disaster which didn't involve and army of flying robots dropping an entire Eastern European city on the locals while Robert Downey Jr saves the day. I know. I was amazed to find a single disaster movie which couldn't be described like that. However, I came across 'Everest' – a filmed based on an ill-fated expedition to the titular mountain back in the nineties. The team of climbers was left in a pretty bad way after a freak avalanche and what followed was a harrowing tale of human versus the elements as they tried to survive in one of the most inhospitable environments in the world. I have to say that I was quite optimistic. I'd watched similar films in the past like 'Alive' and thoroughly enjoyed them, plus 'Everest' boasted a cast which included Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin and the latest 'John Connor' from that 'Terminator' movie which no one apart from me liked.However, despite my optimism I was left with a feeling that this film was nothing I hadn't seen before. A team climbs Everest. They get stuck. They have to survive and get back down. I knew that going into the film so I suppose I can hardly claim to be disappointed about what I got, as I got exactly that. No more, no less. Everything about the film can be summed up in a single sentence.I don't know what I was expecting, obviously just more than was on offer. Yes, the actors were predictably sufficient in their respective roles and the scenery (filmed in picturesque mountains with epic views – don't know whether it was technically filmed on Mount Everest or not, but it was suitable to fool a geographical novice like me!) was truly magnificent. However, there just wasn't that much to keep me interested. I know it was a true-to-life story, so they hardly bring in a fleet of alien spaceships with death-rays, but there just wasn't much there to keep me interested.I also have a problem with certain war films where soldiers are basically all dressed alike. I find it quite difficult to tell one actor from another. Here it's a similar problem as they're all wrapped up so tightly to protect themselves against the harsh elements (not to mentions porting full facial beards making identification even harder!) it made telling who's who quite hard sometimes.I certainly didn't hate the film. The quality of acting talent on offer and the great filming locations made it just about worth sitting through. However, when a film can be summed up in one sentence I just feel it doesn't offer (a) much in the way of shocks or surprises or (b) little when it comes to making me want to sit through its two-hour run-time again. Pity, but only the once. Maybe I'm now so brainwashed by Marvel-style movies that I can't appreciate a film that doesn't involve Optimus Prime smashing his way through New York with a battleaxe for an arm.",6,1,2,23 May 2017
Friends with Benefits," Standard rom-com - does what it says on the tin
","It's a romantic comedy. That's all you need to know.If you've seen one before, spoken to someone that has, or simply just passed a poster for an upcoming film featuring two, young, likable, sexy leading characters of the opposite gender, then you basically know the score.Some rom-coms are aimed at adults, others at those not quite allowed to hear all those sexual references and naughty words.Friends With Benefits is an adult rom-com. It's about Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis who decide that, instead of going out together, just to stick to the 'bedroom aspect' of the relationship. Wait a minute, I hear you cry - didn't they already do this in Love and Other Drugs and that one with Natalie Portman. Yes, is the answer, they did. And they're doing it again. Is this a bad thing? Not really, if you like romantic comedies.Justin and Mila are as likable as the next couple you watch who end up falling in love (I refuse to put the word 'spoilers' in a review of a romantic comedy as you know as well as I do what will happen in the end). They have good chemistry and you'll smile a few times along the way. What more do you want from this kind of film? It also tried to poke fun at rom-com clichés, then ultimately adheres to them. But, if you're bored, break out the popcorn and watch these two annoyingly attractive specimens of humanity exchange some witty banter.If you like this sort of movie, you could do worse.If you think this review is overly-cynical - it's probably because I'm single. I would imagine this movie is better to watch with a partner - *sobs*",6,0,0,24 May 2014
Men in Black," Still great after all this time
","The men in black have been part of 'UFO-lore' almost as confused people have noticed lights in the sky and claimed that little grey men gave them a damn good probing on board the Starship Enterprise. The stories go that they're shadowy figures who cover up all traces of UFO and alien activity on planet Earth. Now, whether or not any of that is true, at the height of the nineties the X-files ruled the airwaves, therefore someone was going to transpose the men in black legend to the big screen.While die-hard UFOlogists claimed that the tone of the film was too light, it was a damn good family romp. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith play the titular Men in Black – Jones is the hardened pro and Smith is the wise-cracking new kid on the job. When a rogue alien decides he wants to help himself to a device that will give him great power (etc) it's a race against time to prevent the planet from getting destroyed in the process. That's about all you need to know. The plot is kind of by the way when you compare it to the general fun-feeling of the film.It doesn't matter where Smith and Jones are they play off each other perfectly. That's why it shouldn't matter whether you're into sci-fi or not, you should enjoy this. It's the sort of movie that's in the same league as Indiana Jones, Star Wars and (the old) James Bond films. The whole family could sit down on a Saturday afternoon and enjoy this.It's a short and simple film (not just simple and fun to follow, but weighing in at a mere ninety minutes – quite short for a summer blockbuster). But you'll enjoy it as primarily a comedy with the science fiction part later. Give it a go. Just don't expect too much from the 'so-so' sequels!",8,1,1,22 January 2016
Elysium," Matt Damon - the working class hero
","In the future evil people will wear suits and not want to live in slums. Therefore they construct an almighty space station called 'Elysium' to orbit the earth which is protected by robots who can shoot as straight as the Stormtroopers from Star Wars. Unfortunately, anyone who can't afford to live up there feels aggrieved and is therefore constantly trying to get up there in shuttles (to live for free at someone else's expense presumably?).Enter our white Latino hero (?), Matt Damon, who is a hard working and virtuous pauper on Earth, who falls victim to an evil suit-wearing man's cruelty and only have five days to live. So he must find a way of getting up to Elysium to get the urgent medical treatment he needs.So, he and his friends basically set out to steal, kill and blow up any evil person in a suit who stands in their way. Jodie Foster is the most evil person in a suit who is so evil she believes that Elysium should be inhabited by people who can afford to be there, instead of anyone who simply wants to go and live there for free. Therefore, she sends her top hit-man Sharlto Copley (by far the film's best part) to hunt him down. And, while Copley is the best part -amazingly - Jodie Foster is the worst. For a great actress, she doesn't really shine. She delivers all her lines like she's reading them in the most clichéd way possible. If this film was made in a single day then it would definitely be Jodie Foster's 'one bad day.' However, Elysium does look good. It's written and directed by Neill Blomcamp (of District 9 fame) and could almost be a companion piece to it. It has a great 'future-industrial' feel to it.What lets this film down is its total in-your-face political message that 'all poor people are virtuous, hard-working and there simply to be exploited by the rich' while anyone who has earned their money (and wears a suit) is evil. In every second to Elysium the story rams this message down your throat, showing how whatever violent means the poor take, it's justified because they're poor. Yes, the film looks nice and Sharlto Copley is great (as ever), the whole thing seems a little too preachy to be taken as seriously as it tries to be.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",3,0,0,19 June 2014
This Is Spinal Tap," This is a great film
","The word 'cult' was pretty much invented for 'This is Spinal Tap.' It's hard to say who the target audience is, but it's fair to say that whoever it is, it's a 'niche' group. 'Mockumentaries' are commonplace these days in both film and TV, but back in 1984, they were a lot rarer. Here, we have a (fake) fly-on-the-wall documentary about Britain's loudest rock band 'Spinal Tap' as they release a new album and try to tour America at the same time.The best thing about the film is that it never openly makes fun of its subject matter. The band may be made up of self-absorbed, egotistical, long-haired idiots, but, the strange thing is, you actually care about them. They're hardly the brightest bunch and their lack of intelligence does mean that we – the audience – do feel superior (and even sorry on some occasions) for them when things go wrong. And they frequently go wrong.Spinal Tap may be Britain's 'loudest' group, but their star is fading and the tour is not as 'sell out' as they'd like it to be. Sometimes it's actually quite sad watching them as they desperately try to hang onto the life they were once used to.Like I said at the beginning, it's hard to know who the 'target audience' for This Is Spinal Tap' really is. The comedy is more subtle than your average 'laugh-a-minute-fest' and you need to have an appreciation for both mockumentaries and also darker, black humour. Plus a love of heavy metal and/or rock music should help.Many films don't age well. At least this one has bad haircuts that were as bad at the time of filming as they are today! Also, special mention to Michael Mckean, who puts on a great British accent like he's a native.",9,1,4,4 August 2015
The Mummy Returns," Good, but not – quite – as good as the first
","The first 'Mummy' film was a classic. No, not in the 'Godfather' kind of way. No, it certainly won't be remembered as one of the greats when it comes to the history of cinema. However, it was a fun little film which has its place on TV on a Saturday afternoon. It was a good action-adventure film which could be enjoyed by all the family without much of a need for brainpower.Yes, it could be looked at as a 'poor man's Indiana Jones,' but it was just such fun it should be afforded some of its misgivings and simply enjoyed for what it was. So, because of its simple success (and commercial, obviously), a sequel was quickly greenlit. The second instalment certainly gets a fair few things right, yet it never quite gels together like the first. Not that's it's bad, it's just not – quite – as good as the first.The best thing about it is the cast. They all return from the original. And it's nice to see the two central characters (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) don't need to fall in love all over again. They're married now and they have a child, Alex, who's not as annoying as 99% of the children we see in films. In fact, instead of Rik having to rescue Evelyn constantly, the two of them have to rescue their son. Yes, the Mummy does indeed return (never mind how he was firmly killed and dragged to hell in the first instalment. He's now back, okay?) and wants to borrow the mythical 'Scorpion King's' army with which he can then take over the world again. Unfortunately, little Alex just so happens to have the only bracelet attached to him, so he's captured and subsequently dragged half way around the world into to raise the army.One of the things 'The Mummy Returns' will always be known for is that it's the first filmic outing for 'The Rock' (better known nowadays as, former wrestler, Dwayne Johnson). He plays the Scorpion King himself – a secondary villain, also not the type you want to get hold of either your only son, or an army capable of taking over the world. It's a brave attempt to crowbar another villain into the mix, but he's not properly in it until the final showdown, therefore the main villain we go with is the Mummy, simply because he was in the first film and is basically in the second outing all the way through.So, The Mummy Returns sits nicely alongside its predecessor in the 'Saturday matinée' type of film. It too will be enjoyed by most families with a sense of humour and a forgiving nature towards daft films. But it's not perfect. It's hard to explain exactly what's wrong with it, but there's something there that doesn't feel right. And it wasn't in the first. It does seem a little more formulaic than the first. You get one action scene after the next, even going as far as to copy the sandstorm from the first film and changing it slightly using water instead of sand.It's a nice little film and most people should like it. Perhaps it's best to let the Mummy franchise die there. It will certainly save you from the very disappointing third instalment.",7,1,1,11 January 2015
Avatar," Still worth a watch (just)
","It's worth noting at the start that, for nearly ten years, 'Avatar' was the highest grossing film of all time. Therefore, you may think that it HAS to be worth watching because so many people obviously did. Yes, it's certainly a technical achievement - writer/director James Cameron uses/refines every special effect trick in the book (and even invents a few new ones!) to bring us a science fiction tale about humanity trying to make peace with an alien race on a far away world, in order to get a rare mineral found only on this planet.It's a decent enough tale, but I can't help think that its extraordinary performance at the Box Office was largely due to being the first film in the modern 3D age. The film is definitely 'live action,' but so many computer-generated special effects were required to create the giant blue aliens and their planet that half of it could practically be described as a bigger budget Pixar movie.Sam Worthington is the star - a disabled space marine who gets a second lease of life (with legs) by inhabiting an 'avatar' which is basically a human-built version of the giant blue aliens. Once in control of this avatar, he can then mingle with the tribe and - hopefully - get them to trade their precious supply of 'unobtanium' (no, seriously - that's what they call this rare material!). Sigourney Weaver is about the biggest name on the cast list, but she seems to be playing a character who's a long way from her most famous on-screen incarnation, i.e. Ripley from 'Aliens.' Here, she wants to preserve the alien way of life rather than 'nuking the site from orbit!'Although I never saw it in the cinema I heard it was definitely an impressive watch, simply because of the outstanding 3D and various effects. It's still worth a watch on the small screen, but, in terms of story, it really is nothing new. You can pretty much tell what's going to happen right from the off and everyone's character is quickly defined as either 'good' or 'bad.' Also, there's also very heavy 'political' messages not particularly skilfully woven into the story. The piece does get kind of preachy and it's strange that a writer as skilful as James Cameron can't find way of putting his own politics a little more subtly than what we end up with.If you're looking for a sci-fi action film that won't tax your brain that much, you could certainly do much worse. There are great effects, action set-pieces and a story that's believable if you don't think too hard about it. I do always wonder why a film as successful as this never really seemed to linger much in popular culture. No one really talks about it much any more, leaving me to wonder whether it really was just the novelty of the 3D aspect that sold it to the masses. I guess we'll see when the sequels start rolling out?",7,0,0,21 March 2020
Drag Me to Hell," Too cheeky to be scary (but fun anyway)
","I'm writing this review after my third viewing of Drag Me to Hell. I guess I've finally 'got it.'After seeing it advertised on its release, I was under the impression that it was meant to be (really) scary. Therefore, when the credits started to roll, I felt severely disappointed. This is NOT scary. It is however quite tongue-in-cheek - which I should have really guessed, seeing as it was made by the producers of the Evil Dead franchise.It's about a girl who gets cursed by a psychotic old gypsy woman, who damns her to hell unless... well, you have to watch it to see what lengths the poor bank-worker will go to to save her soul. This film, although grotesque in places, is far from frightening. It's more designed to make you laugh and throw-up at the same time.Don't take it seriously. Just get some mates, some beers and some popcorn and enjoy it for all its daftness (and ALWAYS be nice to gypsies if they want an extension to their mortgage).",7,0,1,7 January 2015
There's Something About Mary," Still outrageously funny
","There are few films as well done as 'There's Something About Mary.' Of course that doesn't mean that it's for everyone, as there are some scenes there that some may find 'offensive,' but, apart from those few who are easily shocked by scenes of 'adult humour,' it should be appreciated by most.The 'romantic comedy' format of film-making is as old as the hills: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again. Now, without wishing to 'spoil' the story too much, 'There's Something About Mary' hardly breaks that rule, but it's all about the way it's told.I've already mentioned the humour. It's NOT for all the family. There are plenty of jokes that could be considered (a) bad taste (b) adult in nature or (c) both. However, don't go thinking that this is going to be some sort of raunchy adult comedy with bawdy characters constantly engaging in slapstick comedy and who you won't care about. Somehow, this film actually gives us some rather touching moments which go a little deeper than your average 'boy meets girl' film.It's probably something about the cast. Sometimes everything (or I should probably say everyONE) just falls into place. It's hardly an 'ensemble' film, but there are a few different characters to keep track of and therefore some different story arcs to follow. Most of the marketing of the movie was focused on (then!) Box Office goldmine Cameron Diaz and you could be mistaken for thinking that she was practically starring in the film all on her own. However, it's worth mentioning that Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are both excellent in their roles. They provide some great conflict and male insecurities which contrast Diaz's sweetness.The other two characters that are worth a mention are Chris Elliot and Lee Evans. Elliot isn't given as much screen time as the rest, but whenever he's in front of camera he's worth every moment. If the film has a weak spot - in my opinion - it's Lee Evans. I don't know why, but I've never been a fan of his manic stand-up and I find his performance about as enjoyable as his 'gags.'Perhaps the best thing about the film is that - even after over twenty years - it's still as funny as it was when it first came out. It doesn't seem to have aged at all and, whether you're just looking for a 'boy meets girl' film, or something a little more outrageous and adult in nature, this one should tick all the boxes you're looking for. And, if your only knowledge of the film is that off picture of Cameron Diaz with the funny hair-do, then the scene that you'll be waiting for is very much worth the wait.",8,1,2,20 September 2019
Saw," More intelligent than you probably think
","You probably wouldn't say that the 'Friday 13th' franchise is particularly 'high brow' or a 'thinking man's' horror film. The franchise went on seemingly forever and, if you know anything about the 'Saw' movies, you'll know that they're up to about 'Part 802' (well, not quite, but you know what I'm getting at). Therefore, you may think that a horror series that churns out one film after the next isn't worth bothering with. I can't comment on the latter installments, but the original is actually a damn sight more deep than you'd ever imagine.Yes, you can probably sum the plot up (like many have) simply by saying that two strangers wake up in a serial killer's lair and they have to figure out a way out of their soon-to-be-fatal predicament. There's nothing wrong with that plot summary - it does the job, but, if you sit down to watch 'Saw' then you'll find that there's so much more to the story than such simplicity.Also, 'Saw' was one of those films in the early 2000s that helped to revitalise the 'torture p0rn' genre. In case you don't know, it's a sub-genre of horror films which specialises in watching people do grisly and disgusting things to their own, or others', bodies. And - again - this is applicable to 'Saw' which just makes it sound like yet another reason to write it off as just a sick video nasty with no substance.Besides my earlier plot summary I'm not going to go on about the story, namely because - as I've already mentioned - there's a lot more going on besides. If I give too much away then - if you haven't already seen it - it will spoil much of the surprise that you'll get from an initial viewing.All I can say is that if you're into horror (and have a strong enough stomach) then you should definitely check the original 'Saw' out. It has pretty much everything you could want, from strong acting performances, character you'll care about, plenty of gore and various elements that you probably won't see coming. Ignore the sequels (actually, I quite liked the second one too, but everything after that I could pretty much leave) and stick with this one.",8,0,2,20 November 2019
Mama," A prime example of modern horror
","'Mama' is the latest horror movie to receive a reasonable budget. That may raise it slightly above the hundreds of other B-movies out there, but the problem - in my opinion - is that is simply follows the typical (modern) horror structure.This is as follows... Creepy things start to happen to a family (mainly the children). The adults put it down to a rational explanation and call the police. The police do nothing. Slowly the adults except that something supernatural is happening. They seek advice from a convenient expert in the field. They confront the horror at the end of the film.Unfortunately, Mama follows this narrative structure to the letter. Yes, it is well shot. Yes, there are some 'jumpy' moments and yes the overall vibe is slick, well-produced and a bit creepy. But, at the end of the day, it's nothing that seasoned horror fans (which I'm including me in) haven't seen a hundred times before.It's certainly a decent offering in the horror genre, but it might be nice for film-makers to try something a little more out of the norm.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,0,1,3 September 2014
Super 8," One for the kids
","J.J. Abrams pays homage to all of Spielberg's early movies with this mix of the Goonies and, er, an alien invasion movie.One of the most nasty aliens possible lands in a small American town - nasty largely because of its intense desire to grab people from behind at night time. First we see its back, moving quickly amongst the darkness then we see the odd arm, wrapping itself around a hapless victim's neck. Every now and again you see a leg - possibly - it's normally too dark to see.Anyway, the grabby-grabbity alien is running amok in a small town grabbing people like they were the last Nike trainer on the shelf, but, luckily, the U.S. Army is there to save everyone. Only they don't. Their masses of tanks and guns are pretty useless against something big that likes to grab people. However, humanity is saved by six (ish) plucky, nerdy kids who have a knack for not being grabbed (and if they are they can be rescued later) and a love of using cheap fireworks as weapons.I grew up with the Goonies and I still watch it, largely for nostalgia values. If it was released today I probably wouldn't bother with it.Super 8 didn't do much for me. It was too dark and it was only on the 1 hour 32 minutes mark did you find the alien has a face (while its grabbing someone). However, judging by the rest of the reviews, I'm clearly in the minority here. Most people seem to love it. I can only assume they're twelve year old boys. This film is rated 12A and never before has the rating been so applicable. If you want a better opinion of the film, ask a twelve year old boy as that's clearly who this film is aimed for. Give me Sigourney Weaver in a power-loader suit any day.",6,0,2,14 April 2015
Sinister," Yeah, not bad - it did its best
","I suppose how much you enjoy Sinister will depend on how well you know your horror movies. Enough time has elapsed since The Ring for Hollywood to think that most audiences will have forgotten about 'that sort of horror.' Ethan Hawke plays a real-crime writer, who deliberately moves his family into the home of another family who were all murdered, so that he can study tapes of the crime for his upcoming book. Once there, he naturally starts finding himself in the middle of all sorts of spooky goings on.The Ring had a 'killer video tape,' whereas Sinister has... well, it's not completely different. And instead of a female lead investigating it, you have Ethan Hawke. And so on. Okay, so Sinister isn't a complete rip-off of The Ring, but it just felt like it was definitely in the same area of dark, brooding, supernatural, creepy horror.And it's not bad. With the seemingly endless flow of monster/ghost movies out there, it takes something a little different to stand out. And Sinister just about manages to raise its head above the pile. If you read the marketing, you'll see people raving about just how scary it was. I didn't find it that scary, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.It is quite dark - by that I mean literally (not just the subject matter, which, obviously, is also quite dark). The film is mainly shot inside one house which you could be forgiven for thinking that they don't have a single light bulb in any room. Some may say that adds to the atmosphere, others may find it too hard to tell what's going on. Perhaps my only gripe would be that I found the whole family a little annoying. Ethan Hawke's character is obsessed with being famous. His 'loving' wife never seems to bother looking after the kids, leaving all disciplining to him (it even took me a while to work out whether the mother was actually the biological mother or a stepmother, as she repeatedly refers to the children - when speaking to her husband - as 'your children'). Plus the kids themselves are hardly endearing - the girl's okay, but the boy (don't be fooled by his haircut - he IS a boy) is surly and generally unlikeable.It's no classic, but it does offer enough different to make it worth a watch.Special mention to the local sheriff's deputy - just a minor, if quite cool character.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,1,1,28 May 2014
A Clockwork Orange," Horrifically hypnotising
","'A Clockwork Orange' was famously 'banned' by its director, Stanley Kubrick soon after its release. This gave it an instant 'cult' appeal as many wanted to know why a film-maker should go to such unusual lengths with his own work.It some ways, it's easy to see why it was taken out of general circulation. It is horribly violent. Its central character offers absolutely nothing in the way of likability. He's a violent robber, rapist, gang-member and murderer. And, perhaps worst of all, he never seems that bothered by his own actions - simply enjoying them as you would any hobby.Some may say it's hard to root for such a vile 'hero' yet we do. Despite his numerous evil traits, he's also entertaining, charming and a most memorable leading man. Therefore, we may hate him, we may also be desperate for him to receive some retribution, yet we find ourselves wanting to find out what becomes of him. This - in many ways - is down to Malcolm McDowell's excellent acting, but Kubrick's direction is also key to making this such a work of art.The film is weird and timeless, much of it looking like the seventies has been transported a hundred years into the future. Everything from the language to the hairstyles says 'science fiction.' It really does create a weird and creepy atmosphere.You don't have to like A Clockwork Orange, you just have to appreciate that it is a work of 'art' and, like all great art, is subject to controversy. Many hate it and I can understand why. The overall violence of the film does leave a bitter taste in your mouth. If you're considering watching it, you may need a strong stomach. However, if you can put aside the nastiness of it all, you'll find a weirdly entertaining film of which you've probably never seen anything like it before.",10,1,4,9 November 2014
Groundhog Day," Still as good today as it will be today. And today
","If you've somehow found yourself watching the 2016 version of 'Ghostbusters' you may or may not have noticed some bloke popping up in the middle of the film, only to disappear as quickly. I barely spotted him. In fact, it took me until practically the end of the movie to realise it was Bill Murray, now reduced to a cameo in the film that – arguably – made him a household name. Whatever you think about the 'Ghostbusters' remake, after the original he was riding high and one of his follow-up roles (and possibly 'best') was as Phil Conners in 'Groundhog Day.' If you haven't watched it then, by now, you've probably seen a film that's – technically – based on it. The formula is a simple, if pretty basic one: a man is literally trapped in a day. No matter what he does, where he goes or who he meets, he simply wakes up the following morning in today. Since 'Groundhog Day' I've watched this format played out in all sorts of other films or TV programmes – everything from the 'X-files' did it, to variants of the genre such as incorporating horror and sci-fi to the mix. However, no matter how fun they were, none have really come close to watching a grown man kidnap a small rodent and take it for a joy ride through a quarry pit in small-town America.Bill Murray plays a weatherman who hates his assignment covering a – in his mind- low-brown and pointless celebration in a small American town which has a tradition involving a groundhog (also called 'Phil!') supposedly predicting the weather for the next few months. Murray's done it for years and is totally sick of it, however, when the day ends, a freak snowstrom strands him not just in the town, but also in the day. What follows is quite an accurate account of what might occur should this happen. At first you have confusion and disbelief, followed by the freedom to know everything that's going to happen in the future (or at least for the next twenty-four hours) and finally depression at the realisation that you're never going to live any other life that what's on offer for this day.Rumour has it that Murray disagreed with the film-makers as to what sort of film this should be. He wanted it as a deep and emotional study of the human condition when presented with such a situation, whereas the director wanted more of a fluffy family (romantic) comedy. From what I can tell both parties seemed to get their way. Yes, this film could be classed as 'fun for all the family.' There's something for everyone to enjoy. It's great fun without ever getting too dark to be difficult to explain to younger viewers. However, it does also grant Murray his wish to a degree as, despite its absurd premise, you could argue that it plays out almost exactly how it would if a human was faced with this 'capture in time.' I watched 'Groundhog Day' when it first came out in the cinema and I'm pleased to say that it's as good today as it ever was. There are plenty of good supporting cast members, my favourite was Murray's long-suffering camera man, but this is Murray's baby. The film sits firmly on his shoulders and he carries it perfectly. Enjoy its numerous imitations, but this will always be the original and best. If only the same could be said about the 2016 'Ghostbusters!' (meow!)",10,0,0,10 September 2017
National Treasure," The clue is NOT in the title
","Once upon a time, back when Nicolas Cage could actually 'sell' a big budget movie, some clever producer at Disney came up with a script for 'Indiana Jones' mixed with 'Ocean's Eleven.' Then someone else added a dash of 'True Lies' and then wrapped it up in 'The Da Vinci Code,' before the man in charge of the money mentioned that whatever this Frankenstein's monster of a film had to be fit for all the family... and promptly gave it a PG rating. What once might have been a good idea with a major star somehow became something that was less than the multitude of all its inspirations. And that's a shame, because I think - once upon a time - there was a good film in here trying to get out.It opens with a young boy (later we discover is Nicolas Cage) being told by his grandfather about an artefact in US history that has been long forgotten and only accessible via certain clues left by their forefathers. And tell the boy he does. This opening scene goes on for about ten minutes (it felt like more) and is basically one long exposition dump setting up what the characters will later be looking for. When it finally ends, we join Cage and his team in the arctic (or a studio in California that has a freezer in it). They all find something and spend the next ten minutes adding more exposition as to how they will eventually use this new information to track it down.I get the feeling that at this stage the producers realised that what they were making was a little 'talk heavy' and figured they better blow something up in order to wake the audience up (hopefully not literally). Cue an action scene and a reminder to all American adventurers never to include a Brit among your party as Sean Bean decides it's time to pull off an early double-cross and - guess what - the film's villain is revealed to us all.National Treasure' is not a short film. It's close to two hours of more of the same. The characters are never really given any time to develop. Diane Kruger is the (tragically so) generic 'love interest' for Cage. There's a younger guy who I never got his on screen name and can't be bothered to look up the actor's name - he's the comic relief. As I mentioned, Sean Bean is the villain because... er, he's British. That appears to be his only real motivation for wanting to get ancient relics before Cage (or Indiana Jones, I guess). Expect more generic action, more generic characters and a hell of a lot more generic exposition.Cage does his best with the script that he's given and, although he's never afforded the luxury of going 'the full Cage' (fans of his will know what that means), he does his best with what he's given. But he's not given much. There's no real chemistry between him and anyone else. And that's not their fault either. No matter how good any of the actors are, they just look bored - Sean Bean especially!I know a film doesn't have to be completely be original to be good. In fact, pretty much everything's been done now in terms of story-telling, so we're used to things being repackaged and churned out, just in a slightly different way that now makes them - at least appear - watchable. However, 'National Treasure's' biggest problem is that it just doesn't know what it wants to be. The obvious genre would be 'adventure' (ala 'Indiana Jones'), but then it veers off to some sort of comic spy movie like 'True Lies,' before quickly trying to pull off a heist like 'Ocean's Eleven.' I know many good films that have combined genres and worked; in fact... most do! However, this is an example of a film exceeding its reach and trying to be too many things at once and not having a - true - target audience in mind and ending up appealing to very few.I wonder how well it did in America, compared to the rest of the world. To quote (the far superior) 'Team America: World Police' it is pretty 'America! F*%k yeah!' all the way through. Perhaps this is a 'national treasure' to the good citizens of the US of A, whereas out here in that small part of the world known as 'everywhere else,' it all feels a little overblown and self-indulgent to be the classic it could have been.",6,1,3,27 December 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Reservoir Dogs - Rugged, raw and riotous
","Somewhere along the way, opinions on Quentin Tarantino have become divided - some still loving his work, others calling it bloated and unnecessarily inflated. However, those are two criticisms that cannot be levelled at his first (major) film, Reservoir Dogs. It's the very definition of 'minimalist,' focusing on the aftermath of a bank robbery gone wrong and it's shot (in some places) in 'real time.' The story is simple: a gang of bank robbers thinks that one of their number is a 'rat' and has tipped off the police. How do they deal with this? Watch the film and find out.It's hard to choose a 'stand-out' performance among so many great actors. Everyone from the stoic Harvey Keitel, to the psychotic Michael Madsen plays their roles to perfection (and let's not leave out Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi).Basically, if you like gangster or crime films then you probably should have already seen it. However, even if you're not a fan of the genre and simply enjoy cinema then this one is worth a watch because it is very arty in its approach and the performances alone should make up for the fact that some may consider it to be a little over the top on the violence (not to mention explicit language).Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction, may have been cleverer and more stylish, but Reservoir Dogs has all the raw appeal of a real cult classic that will definitely stand the test of time.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10,1,1,5 August 2014
Total Recall," Premium Arnie
","Ignore 'Terminator: Genysis' and those recent 'straight-to-DVD' films that Arnold Schwarzenegger is - sadly - repeatedly churning out. Once upon a time (or at least in 1990, anyway), he ruled the Box Office with impunity. His 'highpoint' probably came a year later with 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day,' but - in my opinion - 'Total Recall' comes a close second.Of course, if you're not a fan of the big man himself, there's probably not much here that would change your mind. However, if you're into either action or sci-fi films, practical effects over the computer-generated variety, of - of course - Arnie himself, then you're in for a real treat here.In 'Total Recall' he plays an 'everyman' in the near future (assuming the average guy comes from Austria and is built like Mr Universe!) 'Doug Quaid' - a lowly construction worker on Earth who dreams of going to Mars (did I mention a reasonable proportion of the human race lives on the red planet?). However, seeing as our 'simple guy' earns a lot less than the actor who plays him, he's not going to ever be able to afford such a trip. That's why he gets a 'memory implant' of a vacation into outer space (I don't think I mentioned that was an option either, did I?). Unfortunately, that - supposedly - 'simple' procedure goes wrong and exposes the fact that he's already been there and is even caught up in an interplanetary conspiracy involving everyone from the Mars government to space spies and aliens. Now, everyone's trying to kill him and he's on the run.
I guess that since 1990, plenty of films have been made where our hero is on the run from 'Agency X' or whatever (the 'Bourne' films spring to mind). However, back then there weren't that many. And even less that span two worlds and star the biggest actor of the time. And... it works. Perfectly.There's not an awful lot I can think of that's wrong with this film. Arnie carries it - as he did at the time. Despite the fact that (mainly towards the beginning of the film), he seems to struggle with putting much emotion into his lines, but then that could also be something to do with the script and/or director. However, he soon settles into the role - roughly at the same time the story requires him to start busting bad-guy heads (coincidence?).He's helped and hindered by a decent cast - most you will 'sort of' recognise, such as Ronny Cox as the chief baddie 'Cohaagen' and Michael Ironside as his henchman 'Richter.' However, the other main name on the cast is Sharon Stone, only before she really hit the big time by doing that thing with her legs. Plus, keep an eye out for Dean 'Hank from Breaking Bad' Norris as a mutant with an odd face. And, while we're on the subject of keeping an eye on mutants, get ready for a chuckle when it comes to an alien prostitute with, er, 'extra assets.''Total Recall's' strength is its blend of - obviously - Arnie and the cast, but also the fact that the action is top notch (all delivered with that trademark 'tongue in cheek' method Arnie and many others like him delivered in the eighties/nineties, yet is - sadly - missing from much of today's action movies). It's a joy to see the practical special effects instead of blurred CGI (even if a couple of them do look a little dated by today's standards). However, it's the film's soundtrack that really gets the blood pumping and is up there with the best of them.Ignore the completely unnecessary remake (even though it - technically - wasn't that bad and had Bryan 'Walter White' Cranston in it!) and settle down for some old school sci-fi action that only those with a real aversion to cracking popcorn-munching romps could possibly not get some fun out of. They really don't make them like they used to.",10,5,5,1 March 2019
Don't Breathe," Don't bother
","Sometimes a films sounds better on paper than it does when it's actually in front of you. I'd vaguely heard of the film 'Don't Breathe.' I knew it was a horror film and found out enough about the plot to interest me. It's about a trio of youths who like to spend their days burgling houses. Yes, a real group of protagonists you can identify with and root for – NOT! Okay, so the female of the three is okay-ish. We get enough backstory regarding her wanting to help out her family and take them away to a better future, but you can't really get around the fact that they steal things for a living.Therefore, one day they think they're in for a 'free lunch' when they decide to break into a house that stands all on its own with the promise of great rewards to come. However, things don't go entirely to plan when it turns out that the old man who lives there is not someone you want to mess with (or even know!). Imagine breaking into Jason Voorhees' sitting room and you're sort of in the right area. Basically, what starts out as a routine cash grab turns into the three being stalked mercilessly for their lives.So, it kind of sounds interesting, i.e. turning the initial bad guys into the unwitting victims. Sadly, it just didn't work out for me. As you've probably guessed, I didn't care much for the three kids and felt that the way we were supposed to care for the girl felt forced just so we feel something for her eventual plight. Plus there was the fact that I never really bought into the fact that they were unable to escape from a house. This isn't some giant country mansion with sprawling corridors and secret passageways. It's not far off your average detached house you'd see on most streets (I had the same complaint for the horror film 'The Collector!'). Then there was the way it was generally shot – it was too damn dark! I know that darkness goes hand in hand with horror movies and that it's a film-maker's tool to add atmosphere to the generally grim feel, but I just found I couldn't make out what was going on! All in all, if you don't watch an awful lot of horror films and just feel like something that's a little dark with a few jump scares and token blood and gore, then this will probably foot the bill. However, if – like me – you've seen every kind of maniac wear every kind of hockey mask despatching every type of teenage in every style of gruesome fashion, then this really doesn't offer enough that's new to really leave an impact. Yup, pretty much already forgotten most of it.",5,10,20,9 June 2017
Pretty Woman," Still holds up, despite its lack of originality
","Being a guy, I'm pretty sure that this movie isn't really meant for me. No matter how the film-makers dress it up, it's your basic 'rom com.' However, just because nothing about it is original, doesn't mean that it's not at least 'watchable' (and 'watchable' is about the highest praise I can ever give a romantic comedy, based on the fact that most of my DVD collection involves car chases and alien armies being thwarted by superheros in an epic New York battle).Yes, I hate to admit it, but 'Pretty Woman' is actually very funny. No, it's definitely not original. It follows the tired old genre trope of: boy meets girl, boy loses girl and boy gets girl back again. But, if the characters are interesting and we care about them, plus they make us laugh along the way, who cares?In case you're the one person who doesn't actually know the plot of this film, Richard Gere plays a high-powered businessman in Los Angeles who befriends a down-on-her-luck 'working girl' (Julia Roberts). At first he pays her for her company during business events. Soon there's a flicker between them that something more may happen.So, you'd probably have to have never watched a romantic comedy film before not to be able to know what happens next. But it's not a film that's supposed to 'subvert your expectations' or with a 'twist' at the end. Everything flows from A to B nicely and along the way there are many memorable funny moments that you may since have seen lampooned in various popular culture outlets.I know women tend to like this film more, but I have to say that - if you're like me, i.e. a guy who isn't really into the genre - and you find yourself having to watch only ONE romantic comedy, this could be the one for you. It certainly goes quickly and the two leads are just so charming that you can't help but root for them. Also, special mention to Hector Elizondo who adds just that extra little bit of heart and charm to an already heart-filled and charming film.",7,0,1,7 November 2019
The Descent," One of the greatest horror films ever... apparently
","I love horror films and I've now watched The Descent three times. I suppose that means I do like it (I do own it after all), yet I never seem to see what everyone else does. When I read other people's reviews they use words like 'Awesome' and 'Amazing,' however, if I was using words to describe this film I'd simply use the term 'Pretty good,' as that's all I felt after watching it.If I'm in the mood for a reasonable monster-hunting film, then I put on The Descent. It's not overly long and it doesn't take much of my brainpower to understand it. Basically, a group of women go underground caving and get hunted by some of Golem's relatives.I like the way it's shot and scored. For some reason it reminds me of John Carpenter's early work, but for a film that lasts ninety minutes, the beasties don't make an appearance (properly) until over half way. You have a lot of creeping around dark caves before you get to the gore.As I say, many horror fans LOVE this movie. So, there must be something there I'm not seeing. Personally, I'll stick with an average 7/10 and probably watch it again in a few years time (maybe I'll 'get it' then? After all, I am the only man alive who doesn't like either Bladerunner or The Godfather!)http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,1,3,26 May 2014
Pulp Fiction," 10/10. Not much else to add
","It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here.",10,2,3,20 August 2019
Jack Reacher," Nothing new, but nothing bad
","I'm a casual fan of Tom Cruise, so I just watched this regardless. I didn't know much about the book, so I can't comment on how accurate it is to its source material. I thought it would be more action-packed - like a kind of vigilante going round seeking revenge on your general baddies. As it turned out, it's more like a cop movie (but without a cop as the lead character). What action there is is all right, plus the acting is fair and it is not hard to see that money has been put into this movie.Tom Cruise is an ex military policeman who's investigating a seemingly motiveless sniper who killed five apparently innocent civilians. No sooner is he on the case does he meet the unfeasible attractive attorney, played by Rosamund Pike. I found this aspect of the film the most far-fetched - you know instantly that she's going to be the 'will-they/won't they' love interest of the film.From then on, the film follows a typical template for this kind of movie. It's played absolutely straight (a bit like the 'Bourne' films, but without the near-constant chase scenes all the way through) and it doesn't really add anything original to the genre of action/thriller movies.If you're looking for a bit of a conspiracy thriller with a plot that slowly unravels, this isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours (plus it's nice to see Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall sharing the screen again since Days of Thunder). If you can believe that every single female in American that meets Tom Cruise wants to bed him, whether she's twice his age of half his age, then you should find this enjoyable.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,0,1,5 June 2014
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," The best (modern ) British gangster movie
","Yes, we all know that Guy Richie married Madonna and, ever since then, many considered that the quality of his work somehow suffered. However, long before the 'Material Girl' entered his life (and his films even had – unsubtle – hints towards her music) he made films like 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.' And they were good.Okay, so you'll probably have to be okay with gangster films in general, not to mention plenty of foul language, unlikeable characters, excessive violence and probably some more bad language. If you can overlook all of those then you'll probably enjoy Lock Stock.They say that the simple ideas are the best and normally they're right. However, Lock Stock is anything but simple. Yes, the story is primarily about four lads who get in deep debt with a particularly unsavoury character, but that's only a small portion of it. There are numerous characters, each with their individual story lines. It just so happens that all of these story lines are somehow relevant to the central story and they all come together perfectly (and possibly violently). Along with the violence, language and nasties, you have to be prepared to concentrate. If you don't, you're likely to miss something vital to the plot and lose track of what's happening.But, if you do, you'll be rewarded by one of the most darkly comic, twisting tales of backstabbing and double-crossing. And, like I said, it's damn good.I won't go into the plot too much, simply because it's pretty complicated, but mainly because I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. There's so much to be enjoyed about this film, you really have to experience it for yourself.Not to mention it contains the first ever on-screen appearance of Jason 'The Stath' Statham. What more could you want? You want more? What about the first ever appearance of ex-footballer Vinnie Jones in a role that was simply made for him? It has that, too. You really can't ask for more (unless you want to see someone executed with a s*x toy, but then it has that, too).",10,1,1,31 March 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," All good fun
","Even though I really enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie, for some reason it didn't leave me wanting to watch the next instalment straight away. I sort of got the feeling that it would be more of the same. And it was. And I tried really hard not to like it. And I failed. Yes, it's effectively not that different to the first instalment and yes there's a lot of CGI, making it look like an extended cut-scene from a computer game, but it's just too much fun to really hate.The story carries on a little while after the first ended and our team of 'Guardians' are in the middle of some computer-generated space combat, generally saving the galaxy from one beastie or another. However, the main story is kicked off by a plot thread that was left hanging from the original, namely regarding 'Starlord's' father.People often use the term 'Avengers in space' to describe the 'Guardians' films and I can see why. It's technically (another) superhero team-up movie. Starlord is 'the star,' but the rest of the screen time is shared between the five or so other main cast members, giving each just about enough room for a little character development. And it's because it's an ensemble that it words so well. I guess for all its obvious flaws that I tried to dwell on, it's the sheer 'interaction' between the characters that makes it so enjoyable. Yes, the action is - by today's standard - pretty generic in that you'll probably have seen stuff like it before in any other modern sci-fi movie, but the way the characters bicker is a joy to watch.It's also nice to see Michael Rooker's character getting extra screen time, but the big surprises were the 'big names' of 'Tango & Cash' getting back together for their respective roles (or should I say Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell if you're not familiar with that *ahem* 'classic' buddy-cop movie from yesteryear). There's even a bit of genuine emotion thrown in there at the end which I won't go into for fear of runing into 'spoiler' territory.Ultimately, if you're familiar with the current 'Marvel Shared Universe' then 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' isn't anything you haven't seen before, even coming across like other similar modern space epics (like 'Valarien' only people actually went to see this film!), but if you're looking for something which is pure 'fun' then you'll definitely find it here. It's not really that necessary to know what went on before and I was pleased to see that this film wasn't one long lead-in to the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War' movie.",7,0,0,19 April 2018
In Time," One in the eye for the rich
","In Time is an interesting premise - set in an Orwellian, dystopian future where everyone only ages up until they're twenty-five then stays that way (why? We don't know). Also, once they hit the big two-five they only have a single year left to live! (why? We don't know that either). Anyway, the year you have left is displayed on everyone's left arm by a green digital clock that's constantly ticking downwards. Instead of earning money from your job etc, you earn time for your arm-clock (why? No idea. You just do).Justin Timberlake is an average Joe who works hard in the poor area where everyone is earthy and noble, while at the same time being horrible exploited and put-upon by the evil rich people, who have years worth of time on their arms in a different district (some of the evil rich are so evil that they're also British, making them doubly evil).Justin Timberlake saves the only rich man on the planet's life and he gives Justin a load of time on his rich before he kills himself for no real reason at all. Now Justin has enough time to head to the rich zone and get back at all those nasty rich people who like nothing more than watching poor people run out of time and die.Luckily, Justin doesn't have to do it alone. No sooner does he arrive in Richland (or whatever it's called) does he bump into Amanda Seyfried, who happens to be the only woman in Richville who also believes that poor people shouldn't be made to work until they drop and then laughed at as their corpses rot in the street. Throw into the mix Cillian Murphy's cop trying to hunt them and you have a chase movie where Justin continually gets away from the authorities because he can beat everyone up at once (he just can). Also, he can drive a car better than the police force (or 'Time Keepers' as apparently they're known), so he does have the edge.The idea behind 'In Time' is nice, but sadly it's poorly executed, with a clunky script and riddled with one-dimensional characters and clichés. Lots of things don't really make sense (like the way you can 'steal' someone else's time by basically just going near their arm (?). The good characters are amazingly good and the bad ones are bad (because they're rich).The film tries to be really hip by replacing all words that should be 'money' for 'time;' it thinks it's being clever by putting these sorts of things in, in an attempt to appear really deep and meaningful. Sadly, unless you're a massive fan of that working class hero, Justin Timberlake, it's actually pretty shallow. You've seen it all before and you've seen it better.Just remember - all rich people are bad. Justin Timberlake is good.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5,0,1,21 May 2014
Thor," By the might of Asgard!
","Who'd have thought the - not particularly well-known - Marvel comic book hero, Thor, would have transferred so well to the big screen? Most people are pretty familiar with Superman, Batman etc, but it takes a little more digging to know about the 'God of Thunder.' He's the son of king Odin and, on the day he is destined to ascend to the throne himself, sets off a chain of events which sees him banished to - guess where - Earth! There, he must learn to not act like quite such an insufferable oaf and sort his head out.And, watching him do so is damn good fun. The film's main brilliance is Thor (or Christ Hemsworth) himself. He plays someone who is way too big for his God-like boots. However, despite being a bit of a puffed-up idiot, he remains likable at all times. You'll root for him whether he's wiping out Frost Giants, or getting in touch with his sensitive side while wooing the unfeasibly-attractive scientist he meets on Earth (hello, Natalie Portman).If you like action, if you like adventure, or if you just want a brilliantly silly film to rest your mind to, this one is it. If you have a sense of fun, whether you know about the 'Marvel Universe' or not, you really should find something you like here.Also, kudos to director Kenneth Brannah for getting involved with this - he's clearly more than just a thespian actor in tights!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,2,3,25 August 2014
The Happening," There's a good film in there somewhere (I think)
","Okay, most of us film fans will say that we loved M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable.' And 'The Village' and even 'Signs' were more hit than miss. However, when it came to 'The Happening,' something... happened.Whereas his other films were all logical (or at least logic in a supernatural setting), had a good story, acting and pacing, The Happening didn't seem to have any of them. What it did have (and its main high-point in my opinion) was a very creepy premise. One day - for no reason at all - people start to commit suicide, en masse. Why? We don't know. They just do.Therefore, Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel must do their best to unravel the mystery while at the same time trying not to succumb to the urge to kill themselves. And it doesn't really work. For those few people who try to praise this movie, they say that its high-point is that it is a MYSTERY and therefore not meant to be solves. Others just get frustrated by the little information we - the audience - are given concerning what's actually happening.Oh, and that's another thing, people keep using the word 'happening' at least once in every conversation - presumably in case you've forgotten what film you're watching. And it gets annoying after a while.Another low point is Zooey Deschanel. Don't get me wrong... I like her as an actress and she's been good in other projects. However, here, she delivers her lines with about as much passion as a tree blowing in the wind. There's an absolute lack of chemistry between her and Wahlberg, who, by his own admission, only took the part so he could play a teacher (as opposed to his usual roles as criminals or tough guys).I've watched The Happening twice now. It's not anywhere as good as Shymalan's previous work, but - somehow - it retains enough weird and dark charm to warrant a second viewing for me. Don't expect every question to be answered and, if you can live with the frustration after ninety minutes then you may hate it a little less than most (a bit like me).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,0,3,31 July 2014
The Shape of Water," Del Toro does it again
","'The Shape of Water' is the latest movie from Guillermo and, if you've seen anything he's done before, you should have a good idea of what you're going to get. I'd say, out of all his previous work, this is closest to the much-lauded 'Pan's Labyrinth.' Personally, I enjoyed that one, too, but I do recall one of my friends saying something about how he went into the film expecting a monster/sci-fi/fantasy film and all he got was a war film with a couple of fantastical scenes. Okay, so his appraisal was technically correct, however I stand with the majority of audiences when I say I didn't mind that - just like I didn't mind that 'The Shape of Water' was basically a war film with a monster thrown in there.However, that than being a subtitled film set during the Second World War, this time we go a little closer to present day and find ourselves in 'Cold War' America where government agents have captured a mysterious humanoid/reptilian life-form and intend to use it in their space-race (I'm not sure how this was to be achieved, but never mind!). Again, anyone who has seen any of Del Toro's previous films where a humanoid aquatic creature is involved, can probably picture what this one looks like (especially as it's even played by the same actor!). And, it's fair to say that this weird-looking half-fish-man isn't having a whale of a time (pun intended). He's routinely tortured by scientists and equally-creepy men in black (primarily) by Michael Shannon - who's probably more of a monster than the monster itself thanks to his overuse of an electronic cattle-prod device of torture!However, just when it looks like our fishy friend is doomed to a life of torture and dissection, he's befriended by young cleaning lady (Elisa, played by Sally Hawkins) who's also completely mute. They then form a bizarre friendship which - hopefully - will lead to a better life for both of them.I enjoyed 'The Shape of Water,' but I can see that it's probably not for everyone. If you're a fan of Del Toro's other work then you'll like it. The sets and period details and perfect and a wonderfully-magic atmosphere is created out of a normally mundane setting. At first I found it a little weird, having a protagonist who never uttered a word for the entire two-hour runtime, but Hawkins is a capable lead and uses all other bodily actions and expressions to convey just what she's thinking and feeling (plus she can curse using sign language!). Like I say, it is two hours and, although beautiful to watch, does tend to feel a little overly-long here and there.Richard Jenkins plays Elisa's friend and provides some much-needed 'heart' and humour into the film, but the stand-out goes to Michael Shannon, who portrays the most sinister man in black since 'Agent Smith' from 'The Matrix.'Don't expect wall-to-wall action, think of this as more of a 'Pan's Labyrinth' type film just with more 'signing' and less subtitles. Also, if you have a soft spot for cats, you may want to close your eyes mid-way through - or just never bring a wild monster home if you have pets.",7,37,75,20 February 2018
The Untouchables," Can't touch this
","It's hard to believe that once upon a time, buying a bottle of WKD Blue from Tesco's on a Friday night could have bought you a one-way ticket to the slammer. However, in 1930s America (aka the era of 'prohibition,' i.e. making alcohol illegal) this was basically happening. Luckily, for us hardened drinkers good men like Al Capone ensured that we could still get drunk outside the local Weatherspoons and start a fight with someone smaller than us... or something like that.Actually, it wasn't quite like that. No matter how silly banning booze may sound to us, it happened and violent gangs flouted these laws, most famously Al Capone. That was why the city decided that a special police task force should be compiled to combat such nefarious criminal activity. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) was put in charge of stemming illegal liquor activity in the city of Chicago and, at the same time, bringing down the most wanted of criminals, Al Capone (a padded out Robert DeNiro). 'The Untouchables' tells the, er slightly fictionalised, story of this.If you've ever done any research into this period of American history then you could probably make a twenty page list of the inaccuracies in this filmic interpretation of the actual events. For example, hero and villain never really met in real life and Elliot Ness was unhappily divorced, as opposed to his ideal life we see on screen. However, despite these sorts of points making the film more historically accurate, I'm pretty sure they would also make it a damn sight less enjoyable. And it is very, very enjoyable.First of all there's the cast. Whatever you may think about Robert DeNiro's more recent output, there's no denying that in 1987 he was still at the top of his game and he gives an excellent performance as the film's antagonist - the only complaint being that he's probably not in it enough, seeing as he - like the real life Al Capone - spent most of his life hiding in one luxury dwelling to the next. Kevin Costner was a gamble for the lead. This was before he was Robin Hood and his Box Office draw was questionable at the time as to whether he could headline such a big budget film. However, the film-makers made up for this by casting Sean Connery as his right-hand man (and, in doing so, helped market the film on the former Bond's inclusion). There's a young Andy Garcia in there too, but it's DeNiro, Costner and Connery who you're going to be the most interested in.Overall, it's a highly-entertaining gangster movie. Yes, it probably condenses more action into the film than should probably be there, but it makes it all the more entertaining for doing so. You probably don't have to be that into gangster/crime movies to appreciate this - definitely holds up to this day.a",9,2,3,8 November 2018
The Disaster Artist," Ed Wood's long lost cousin
","I wonder what someone who sits down to watch 'The Disaster Artist' would think of it without actually seeing the film that it's all about? In case you don't know in 2003, a man called Tommy Wiseau wrote, produced, directed, financed and even starred in his own movie, i.e 'The Room.' Now, bearing in mind this was in Hollywood, you may not think there is much here worthy of a two hour film based on the events surrounding the production. However, you obviously don't know Tommy Wiseau. In fact... even people who do know him possibly don't know everything about him!James Franco plays Mr Wiseau and, if you happened to tune in to the film halfway through, you'd think he was playing some sort of exaggerated version of a character from a TV sit-com. The thing is, believe it or not, Tommy Wiseau is just like Franco's portrayal, i.e. totally bonkers and an absolute spectacle to behold.What's more, on its released, 'The Room' totally bombed at the Box Office (assuming it made it into more than a handful of cinemas across the country at the time). Like Ed Wood's 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' before it, 'The Room' became known as being one of the worst films to ever be made (in terms of, well, pretty much everything). However, just because it was bad, didn't mean it wasn't entertaining to watch and has slowly grown to becoming some sort of 'cult classic.''The Disaster Artist' charts how the film came to be and the relationship between its two main stars (interestingly the other is played by James Franco's brother, Dave. And, like 'The Room' before it, it's one of the most entertaining car crashes of a film ever made. Yes, it's technically more competently produced and better acted, but it's just so bonkers (all thanks to Tommy Wiseau and James Franco's spot-on portrayal) that you'll find you just can't look away. Also, I don't know whether it's because the two leads are brothers in real life, but their bond really does shine through into the story and it creates some genuinely touching moments of heart in an otherwise weird series of events.If you've watched 'The Room' then watching 'The Disaster Artist' is a much-see, as you're obviously into strange and cult films. If you haven't, I'd still give this one a go. Yes, it's hard to believe that the character of Tommy Wiseau is really like that in real life, but - based on everything I've read online - he really is like this (and even approved of Franco's portrayal of him!).",8,0,0,15 November 2019
Mystic River," Hard-hitting, gritty and great
","Shame on me for not knowing that Mystic River was directed by Clint Eastwood until AFTER I'd watched it (yes, somehow I must have missed his name in the opening credits - shame on me, I know). I was just watching it because of its pretty impressive ensemble cast, including Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.We meet the three when they're just boys and Tim Robbins gets abducted by two men. He later escapes, but carries the scars with him right the way into adulthood. When they're grown up and have families of their own, Sean Penn's nineteen-year old daughter is murdered and Tim Robbins is the primary suspect.Not only did I not know about Clint Eastwood's involvement, but I also didn't know that it was based on a book. I haven't read this, so I can't compare the film to this. All I can say is that it's a pretty intense ride. You need to be in the mood for something pretty heavy as there's no 'light-relief' to be found here.All the characters play their respective parts well (Laurence Fishburne should get a special mention as he has the least character development and yet still brings more than a few nice touches to his role as supporting detective) and it was no wonder that it eventually went on to win Oscars.I won't give too much away about the plot, but I can't imagine many people will be disappointed with what they've watched. As long as you're in the mood for something dark, this should suffice.",8,3,5,22 October 2014
Zombieland," Still don't (quite) get it
","Okay, so I've pretty much seen and enjoyed most zombie films – everything from George A Romero's offerings to the general silly B-movies featuring shuffling corpses eating people's brains. So I was always going to put 'Zombieland' on my 'to watch' list. As soon as I heard it pretty much had A-list actors in it and a theatrical release, I was definitely looking forward to it. Plus it's worth noting that most people who saw it loved it.I didn't love it.Granted, I didn't hate it. It kind of left little impression on me – neither good nor bad. Yeah, there were some humorous moments where I giggled, but, generally, I found it a bit forgettable. As the title would suggest, the world has been overrun by the living dead and there are few humans left, desperately trying to survive. Jessie Eisenberg is our 'hero' who talks us through the 'rules' of how to live in a world where most of the population is trying to eat you. His voice-over is pretty funny, but after the first act it kind of drops off when he meets his 'love interest' and they head to a theme park.I think the biggest flaw in it comes near the end. I'm not sure I can mention it as it probably constitutes a 'spoiler,' but it's generally to do with a weird (and rather stupid) decision made by the two girls which totally goes against anything a sane person would do in a world infested by zombies.For some reason I just couldn't really get over that and no matter how good the rest of the film was, that one moment of madness (involving doing something that literally drew the attention of every flesh-eater in Los Angeles to them).After a second viewing I do like it a little more. It's not a bad film. It has gore. It has laughs and it has a good celebrity cameo from Bill Murray. I just wish they'd changed that one (theme park-related) aspect towards the end. It really bugs me.",6,0,1,5 April 2015
A Beautiful Mind," Much better than I expected
","I never watched 'A Beautiful Mind' at its time of release as I wasn't a massive fan of Russell Crowe and I didn't know what the film was about. For me, this was the ultimate example of never judging a book by its cover. I still proclaim that the cover of the DVD looks pretty dull and gives no real hint as to what the film was about. Yes, I knew that Crowe won an Oscar for his performance and that it was a story about a guy who did stuff, but nothing about (the little) I heard about it really grabbed me. However, now nearly twenty years later, I finally got round to seeing what all the fuss was about. And I'm actually quite glad I did.I guess my overriding predictions of 'A Beautiful Mind' was that it was a love story and nothing else. However, the film is actually based on the real life story of John Nash (Crowe), an American code-breaker who helped the US Government decipher Russian messages during the Cold War, making the whole thing more akin to a spy thriller than a romantic drama. I'm not saying that just because it's about spies you're going to get a load of high-octane James Bond car chases and gadgets. What you have here is a far more realistic take on the profession. We see how Nash is 'recruited' by the Government and the way he uses his gifts with patterns and numbers in order to help them out. Of course there's always going to be a reasonable helping of romantic sub-plot and here it comes in the form of Jennifer Connolly who becomes his wife throughout the course of the story. But, in my opinion (now!), it's primarily a spy story.I won't go into too much detail regarding the rest of the plot as there are most likely some things that you won't see coming. Or, at least from my perspective as someone who knew nothing about the film before watching, I certainly didn't predict what would happen. But, I do recommend watching it, even if you're not a fan of spy-stuff. If nothing else then Crowe's performance is definitely worth a look. You can see why he got his Oscar as he does put everything he has into the portrayal of a man who, by his own admission, isn't that likeable and yet you want to see what happens to him. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer should also get mentions as they both provide integral parts of the story. I know Jennifer Connolly was good too, but I felt she had little to do other than be Nash's long-suffering partner throughout the story. It is a kind of long film and I think perhaps around fifteen to twenty minutes of the final act could probably have been trimmed to make it a tighter film. It may take me another twenty years to watch 'A Beautiful Mind' again, but I'm pretty sure one day I will.",7,0,0,22 January 2018
The Departed," Jack shows 'em how it's done
","The Departed' is a remake. Therefore it must be merely a cynical cash-grab, right? Wrong. And it's not often anyone says that these days. Yes, it may be a remake of a 2002 film from Hong Kong, but, when it's directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DeCaprio and Matt Damon (to name but a few) you know that it's going to be very different some other recent remakes, reboots and re-imaginings!I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare the two films. And I have a feeling that this US version will be remembered so fondly that many will soon forget that an 'original' ever existing - no matter how good it was. A director as talented as Martin Scorsese, it's no wonder he's dabbled with numerous types of film and genre, but here he returns to - arguably - what he does best - epic gangster movies. I reckon that in time 'The Departed' will be remembered alongside 'Goodfellas' and the like. It really is that good. Or at least it is if you're into gangster films in general.First of all there's the cast. I've already mentioned the main three, but add Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone (just don't mention the Londoner's attempt at an American accent!) and Vera Farmiga. It's fair to say that there isn't a bad performance among them (and, no, Winstone wasn't THAT bad when it came to the accent - they probably should have just made his character British and be done with it). However, for all these big names, it's Jack all the way. The 'old man' of the film shows everyone how it's done.Jack plays Frank Costello, who is the 'head' of the Irish mafia in Boston. And, therefore, he's hardly a nice, sympathetic character you'll feel inclined to root for. Only you sort of do. In the same way you'd hardly feel comfortable sitting down to tea with Hannibal Lecter, yet you can't help but see him as a hero (or rather anti-hero!). And this is all down to Nicholson's performance. He oozes charm and likeability, even when he's clubbing people to death, or generally engaging in high-level criminal activities. In short, this is Jack's baby.The general story revolves around Frank's attempt to 'plant' a bad police officer within the ranks of the force charged with the task of investigating him. However, what he doesn't know is that that very same unit is hatching a similar plot to plant a police officer among Frank's gang. What follows is a pretty tense tale of 'cat and mouse' where you're wondering which side will find out the truth first (and, more importantly, the repercussions when they do!). I'll leave it there in terms of plot, as there are more than a few moments that you probably won't see coming - avoid internet spoilers if possible before watching!There's little negative to say about the film (it's quite long - if that's really a problem when a film is this good?) and I think that the only people who may not enjoy it are those who generally aren't a fan of the genre. If you don't like crime movies in general, you won't like it. Same goes for if foul language and violence is not your thing. However, if like most, you can appreciate an excellent film that doesn't pull any punches and is just about as perfect as any film is these days, then this is definitely worth a watch.",9,0,2,10 September 2018
Die Hard," The greatest action movie (not to star Arnie)
","I've decided to leave a review for 'Die Hard' exactly thirty years since its release in 1988. Partly because it still holds up after all that time as one of the greatest action movies ever made and, secondly, because it has just (officially?) been classified as a 'Christmas movie.' So, does it promote festive cheer and goodwill to all men? Or does it just give you the manual on how to kill unlimited bad guys with a machine gun, a witty quip or two and dirty feet. Probably the latter really, but, for the record, it is SET at Christmas and a famous Christmas song even plays it out. What more do you need to pull a cracker and eat Xmas pudding to?For anyone that doesn't know, the plot to 'Die Hard' involves a cop getting stuck in a giant building during a terrorist takeover. Guess what? He fights back. It's a simple plot and that's its main strength. It never really tries to be anything that its not. Bruce Willis may have been around before 1988, but it was no doubt that it was 'Die Hard' that cemented him as an 'A-list' star. Granted he's reprised his role as John McClane numerous times since, however one (of the many!) criticisms thrown at the sequels is that he's become a 'superhero' in human form, i.e. he can do anything and is completely invulnerable. But, back in the first outing, we really do feel his pain as he limps, crawls and drags his way through the building's air ducts in order to simply survive the night, let alone take out the entire squad.In short, Bruce Willis was actually 'relatable' back then. But, what is a hero without a good villain? Not much. But luckily, as 'Die Hard' cemented Willis as an A-list protagonist, it also did the same for Alan Rickman as the dastardly terrorist leader, Hans Gruber. I read somewhere that the best films involving a clearly defined hero and villain explore the relationship between them (test it out - the movies that don't really work almost always have the hero and villain never meeting/interacting until the final showdown where the hero inevitably kills the villain). Here, the two spar not just physically, but mentally thanks to McClane stealing one of the terrorist's radios and mercilessly taunting Gruber as he dispatches one henchman after the next.So, you have the relatable hero, the evil villain and the simple plot. What more could you want from an action movie? Well... action, maybe? And it's here tenfold. The wonderful thing about eighties action movies was that they were real. Or rather the special effects were really there on screen, rather than the actors filming up against a green screen and the explosions added later. All the fights here actually look like they could really happen. Yes, we always have to suspend our disbelief that one man shooting at a hundred has a better chance of killing them than the other way round (but then we've been doing that since James Bond first sipped his Martini!). But the action looks real and it's the final icing on this most unexpected Christmas cake.Die Hard' may now be a Christmas movie, but you really can watch it any time you want a simple, yet excellent action film that really doesn't have many flaws (or at least none that detract from its brilliance). It really has been the template for many an inferior action movie to come. Yippie-kay-yah Christmas to you all!",10,1,1,4 January 2019
American Made," Watchable 'true' story
","'American Made' is one of those films where I can't really think of anything particularly negative to say about it, but then I also can't really think of any major positives. On paper, it all works - it's one of Hollywood's 'true' stories, which basically means it's loosely based on people and events that actually happened. It has star-power, drama, high-tension moments and a good supporting cast. And yet only a day after watching it, I'm struggling to remember anything really to say about it.Back in the late seventies and early eighties an American pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) started smuggling drugs for the South American cartels, but was subsequently 'recruited' by a CIA man Monty 'Schafer' (Domhnall Gleeson) to start double-crossing the drug dealers and gathering evidence for the White House.Tom Cruise is no stranger to headlining films and therefore is the perfect leading man to root for. There's no shortage of budget for the production and all the sets look like they're set in the appropriate time period, plus there are some dramatic moments which utilise the dramatic elements of danger associated with trying to doublecross organised crime. Plus the story is - relatively - true, therefore it adds an element of interest knowing that this actually happened. Yet I still felt a little unsatisfied.I've checked other reviews online and it seems that I'm in the minority. Most people seemed to really love it and think it was great. I guess it was watchable enough, but not memorable. Perhaps because I'm part of that 'older' generation, I've seen plenty of films such as this that are based on trues stories where one man is recruited by some law enforcement agency and has to infiltrate the mob. It's like I've seen all this before and 'American Made' didn't offer enough that was new in order to make me remember it too well or even want to see it again.If this is your thing, or you don't know that much about 'true' crime then you should enjoy it. I did. I just don't really think I'll ever bother watching it again. For me, it was certainly one of those films where I'm happy to watch on an online streaming service, but would never bother buying on DVD. At least it proved that Domhnall Gleeson can do more than just shriek and be the 'comedy bad guy' in those depressing new 'Star Wars' movies.",7,0,1,4 August 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not an improvement
","Having grown up in the eighties, playing with 'Transformers' toys, reading the 'Transformers' comic and watching the weekly 'Transformers' cartoons, it was fair to say that I was delighted when they were brought to the big screen in 2007. However, what I got was an hour and a half of a teen romantic comedy/drama, followed by a couple of brief scenes with robots who were CALLED names that I recognised then a battle which looked like a load of splinted metal crashing against each other.Surely they wouldn't do the same again? Oh, wait - they did, only much, much worse. This is the second time I've watched 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' and it hasn't got much better with age. It's a long film (2.5 hours) and dare I say 90% of it is dedicated to the humans. I know I harp back to the eighties cartoon which did also include humans. However, they weren't often the stars of the show (and if they were for a SINGLE episode, I tended to skip it). Here, I'd quite happily skip every single scene with only humans in it (and therefore reduce the film's runtime to about half an hour).The film follows on from the first, i.e. the good robots (Autobots) are now settled on Earth and are working with the humans to pick off any remaining evil robots (Decepticons). To me, that premise never really worked. Decepticons are huge, nearly indestructible machines of death. An entire army of humans wouldn't really stand a chance against even a single Decepticon. And they don't. It's the Autobots that do all the fighting, meaning what's the point of humans even trying to help in the first place?Anyway, what you get is about two hours of annoying humans and badly-forced attempts at humour. The Transformers are never really used, other in the action scenes which are so badly-shot that it's impossible to tell who's fighting who. You may just about figure out who Optimus Prime and Bumbebee are, but that's only because of their colours. However, every other Autobot and Decepticon looks exactly the same, i.e. a bunch of silver metal thrown together. If you know the characters from other mediums, like the TV show or comic, you'll know all robots have very distinctive looks and personality. In this film, all is thrown away in favour of generic robots who you never really get to know (and example of this is the Autobot 'Sideswipe' who's always been a red car. A RED car. Here's he's silver and on wheels in robot form. Just... why?The robots themselves are the stars, however they never really get to shine in the way that they should. Peter Cullen returns (fortunately!) as the voice of Optimus Prime, but even he's not in it for as long as the LEADER and most recognisable face of the franchise should be. I won't spoil it as to why he's not in it, as the film-makers have spoiled the film enough.I know pretty much every 'Transformers' film has made a tonne of money and this one was no exception. Kids probably love it, but I always feel that films/stories/characters that have been around for a long time with established (and now older) fans need to be handled with a little more care. I'm all for bringing the Transformers to a new generation, but surely it wouldn't be that hard to come up with a way of doing so that appeals to fans, old and new.I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on the film. The youngsters of today clearly lap it all up. I guess I'm no longer the demographic for these 'robots in disguise.' And I haven't even touched on the way the director, Michael Bay, lingers on Megan Fox's body at every given opportunity and the borderline racial stereotypes applied to some of the robots (when they're allowed on screen!).",5,1,3,20 April 2019
Rosemary's Baby," Timeless horror on so many levels
","If you have only really heard of 'Rosemary's Baby,' by its considerable reputation then you may be inclined to believe that it simply finds its horror through a tale of demonic possession. After all, its central premise is that a young couple move into an upmarket apartment block in New York, only to find that their new neighbours are more than a little bit satanic. Maybe it was just a film about devil worshipers when it was released back in the sixties. However, watching it now, there's a secondary level of 'horror' written into it – namely how women are both portrayed and treated.Mia Farrow plays the titular 'Rosemary' as she's basically pushed, pulled, ordered and generally manhandled through both her attempts to get pregnant and the subsequent pregnancy itself. If this film doesn't bring a shudder down most women's spines at how little control the central protagonist gets in her life and body then nothing the devil himself will.But, of course, speaking of Beelzebub, he does do his best to make an appearance and generally make things even worse for our helpless heroine. The devil-worshipping scenes are pretty dark and Roman Polanski's chilling direction gives the whole film a clinical and bleak feel to it.'Rosemary's Baby' is still as watchable today (and, of course, deeply horrific and disturbing) as it was all those years ago. It doesn't need gallons of fake blood or computer-generated effects to be scary. Everything here feels a little too real and is a credit to how films can be made. Don't expect a roller-coaster ride of scares and guts – it's much too 'foreboding' to succumb to anything so cheap and easy. If you're in the mood for something horrible, dark with an every-increasing sense of dread then give this one a watch before it gets remade with too many special effects and no soul (and I'm not counting the 'Astronaut's Wife' in that!).",10,0,1,12 July 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," A reasonable portrayal of modern day espionage
","In case you don't know... Zero Dark Thirty is about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, after the 9/11 attacks on America. Maybe, over the years, we've been spoiled by James Bond into thinking that all spying involves gadgets and car chases. However, in reality, most spying is done from behind desks and listening. And, yes, that's certainly a bit boring in some people's eyes.However, that could be seen - by some - as a failing of the film. It's about two and a half hours long and a lot of it is spent in offices watching people in suits arguing about budgets and how to spend them (hardly what we'd expect from superspies!). So, maybe if you're intending watching this, you should know that it's not 'all action.' Plus there is a fair bit of human torture during the first half, so, if you don't have a strong stomach, you may not want to see how interrogations are taking place.But, it does chronicle the hunt for the world's most wanted man pretty well. Even though (assuming you've watched the news) you probably know then ending, the final showdown is extremely tense and well filmed.Plus there should be a special mention to Jessica Chastain who completely owns every scene that she's in. In fact... her performance is so strong that she effectively eclipses every other actor in this film, leaving everyone who isn't her as little more than an extra! So, if you're interested in the subject matter, then this really is the film to watch on the hunt for Bin Laden - certainly worth a watch (although expect a 'slow burner').http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,3,19 June 2014
30 Days of Night," These vamps don't twinkle
","Ah, vampires, those pillars of the community who go to your local highschool and have pretty gold eyes because they only hunt animals. Oh, and they twinkle too in sunlight. I'm very pleased to say that 30 Days of Night isn't anything like that.These vampires have fangs that would make mincemeat of Kristen Stewart's neck and have a nasty habit of slaughtering every man, woman and child they meet. And they meet Josh 'the beard' Hartnett in his Alaskan town which is so northerly that the sun doesn't rise for thirty days (hence the title, right?).What follows is a story of survival, where the handful of remaining townsfolk (led by Hartnett's beard) have to last the thirty days before the eventual sunrise which will kill their undead foe (of which the head vampire bears more than a passing resemblance to Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys... but with bigger teeth and a thirst for blood, rather than poppy dance anthems).And it's good (if you don't look too closely). It has impressive action set pieces, characters you care about, plenty of gore to keep us 'claret-lovers' entertained and vampires who you don't want to slap for being so wet and 'Emo.' It could all be a classic, if it wasn't for the fact - and you might want to skip this bit, just in case you don't notice - that the whole 'thirty days aspect' seems to be well and truly glossed over. In fact, it could all happen in one night and you'd be none the wise.But that is a slight niggle and, if you like your vampires old fashioned and nasty (as opposed to falling in love with teenage waifs who are incapable of cracking a smile) then you should like this (although, whatever you do, don't watch the sequel - it's a terrible attempt at cashing in on the success of this one).",8,2,3,30 October 2014
Sausage Party," No one should enjoy this film (and yet I did)
","There are some films which should probably come in blank DVD boxes. That way, when they're mixed in with your collection and you have friends or family round, they will never know that you really enjoyed watching an animated sausage discover the meaning of life in a supermarket by indulging in everything from murder to... I'll stop there when it comes to details (that's for the film's final act only).Yes, seriously, 'Sausage Party' is basically the polar opposite to all those delightful Disney/Pixar movies we've been taking our kids to over the years. Pixar films are delightful fun for all the family. Sausage Party is something you want to keep your kids away from for as long as possible. As I mentioned in the opening, a hotdog learns the (awful) truth about his existence. This particular hotdog is one of many different food types, all living in a supermarket (where else?!). Every morning all the foods for sale cross their fingers (yes, most at least have arms and hands, if not legs, too) and hope upon hope that a friendly human will 'choose' them for a better life in the great beyond (basically through the supermarket's sliding entrance/exit doors). Naturally, our hotdog (voiced perfectly by Seth Rogan) soon realises that his 'perfect life' will ultimately involve being roasted alive before being ground up in a human's mouth and then pushed out through the afore-mentioned human's rear. Hardly an attractive ambition for a sausage in love.Therefore, he – and his various buddies – set on a plan to escape this. At first it's a little hard to work out where this film will go. It's almost entirely set inside the supermarket and you may well wonder if this setting gives the film enough scope to really go anywhere. I'm pleased to say that that's an incorrect assumption. It never really lets up for a moment. The (very adult) humour comes thick and fast and, if you've seen any other recent Seth Rogan movie, you'll know to expect much profanity, sexual references and the – seemingly obligatory – getting high scene.You may not be able to tell some of the actors who have leant their vocal talents to this film by their performances, but Edward Norton and Salma Hayek are both newcomers, along with Seth Rogan's usual bunch of suspects such as James Franco and Jonah Hill. If you're into their collaborations then you should enjoy this. It's hard to imagine it will ever be that successful as the concept is just too 'niche' to ever get a mainstream following. It's definitely not one to watch with your grandmother, but it is extremely gross and adult fun if you're in the mood for that sort of entertainment.Oh, and as a Meat Loaf fan, I loved the 'Bat out of Hell' sequences, but that's probably just me.",7,2,2,27 April 2017
Joker," You'll never root for Batman again
","A film about the Joker. What a great idea! Jared Leno must be delighted to be front and centre as arguably one of the most famous and recognisable bad-guys ever in popular culture. Unfortunately, DC's 'shared universe' ran into one or ten problems and has become fractured into... well, no one really knows what. Only that Jared Leno's 'Joker' appears to have been dumped after his woefully small appearance in 'Suicide Squad' and now Joaquin Phoenix puts on the clown make-up for the role.How 'Joker' fits in with what has been and what is left of DC's original attempt at bringing 'Justice League' together is anyone's guess. If you liked (or hated!) all those previous installments it doesn't really matter. Don't go into this film looking to see how it ties in. There might be a sequel, there might now. It doesn't matter. This film is so good that I almost hope it stays as a 'stand alone' film, just in case the quality deteriorates.Phoenix plays 'Arthur Fleck' (yup, no more 'Jack Napier' here!), a down-on-his-luck resident of Gotham City who struggles with his mental health issues while just about scraping a living working as a clown and looking after his sickly mother. It's rare that a film - even one that's mainly about a single individual - actually has that character in every scene. With 'Joker' there's rarely a minute where Phoenix isn't on screen... and therefore stealing the scene. Robert DeNiro is also on the cast list and - yes - obviously he's excellent (but he's not in it that much, so don't expect too much screen time for him). It's also interesting that many people also see the similarities of two of DeNiro's other work. If you've seen (and, if not, I recommend you watch) 'Taxi Driver' or 'King of Comedy' then you'll see more than a few nods here and there.I know that many recent Batman fans will say that there's no other Joker than Heath Ledger and us oldies will always say that Jack Nicholson did it best. I certainly won't argue with anyone who admires either of their performances, but Phoenix shows that, even stepping into their big clown shoes, he can still bring something new to the role.Yes, it's - technically - a superhero film, but it never really feels like one. There are no lavish computer-generated special effects of heroes/villains with superpowers. There are plenty of points which obviously link in to the whole 'Batman mythos,' but you could almost watch this film as more of a study of mental illness than an 'origin story' for the Joker.It may not be for everyone. Yes, it is brutal and there are some shockingly-real acts of graphic violence here and there. There's been a lot of speculation in the media about 'Joker's' hidden meaning and the impact creating a film about a villain and promoting them as a 'hero.' Personally, I don't think that anyone (sane) would ever commit any sore of crime because of a movie, even this one. One reviewer said it best when he said that there wasn't a massive spike in violent crime after the cinematic release of 'American Psycho' so why would there be one now with 'Joker?' The character 'Joker' - despite being the focus of the story - is never really shown as some sort of 'role model' for us all to follow. We may understand - some of - his motives, but anyone in their right mind would never truly wish to emulate him.I don't want to give away anything away about the plot as this is a film you really do need to watch yourself. I'm not one to say who should be in line for an Oscar. I don't know whether Phoenix will win one (probably not), but his performance is definitely worthy of praise.",10,7,13,14 October 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Captain Ahab must get his bridge
","There are many Second World War films that will definitely stand the tests of time and be looked at as - almost - 'historical' representations of the events that transpired. I'm not entirely sure that 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' will be one of those, as it's far too 'niche' to maintain its popularity, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad film. For a start, if you're looking for huge 'Saving Private Ryan' style battles involving the heroic Allies blasting their way through legions of German troops, you'll be very disappointed here. With the exception of a couple of brief shoot-outs and the odd knife to the back, there's little in the way of action here.It's about an unfortunate bunch of British (mainly) prisoners of war who are incarcerated in a Japanese POW camp. There, they're forced to help build a bridge (over the river Kwai, believe it or not!) in order to aid the Japanese war effort. You may think that a WWII film based around a POW camp would mean that our plucky Brits would spend their time and efforts devising new and ingenious ways to tunnel their way out of there. Not here. The camp doesn't even have any fences due to it being on an island, therefore there's nowhere really to escape if they tried. Instead, the story predominantly focuses on two character - one is the Japanese warden who runs the facility and the other is the British officer 'in charge' of the captive prisoners (there's also a sub-plot regarding how the rest of the Allied war effort perceives the camp and what they're doing about it, but that's secondary to the one-on-one between the two leads in my opinion).Now, I wouldn't go as far as saying you'd be able to 'identify' with the Japanese guard, but you will definitely get to know him and his motivations and, dare I say it, his character even develops as the film progresses. However, the most interesting character is his British opposite, played by none other than (the original) Obi-wan Kenobi himself, Sir Alec Guinness. He's a man in charge of both keeping his soldiers' morale up, but also the 'good name' of the British army/Empire. He'll go to almost any lengths to ensure that neither are brought down in reputation in any way. And, his choices lead to some interesting outcomes which I won't go into in great details here.So, if you're looking for an outright war film, you won't really find it here. Instead, you'll get (quite a long) character study about stubborn madness, maybe even a little 'Stockholm Syndrome' and - what I perceived as - a variation on the 'Captain Ahab and his whale' type story. Alternatively, if you're just looking to see what old Ben Kenobi looked like without a lightsabre, you'll find that here, too.",8,0,0,15 February 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Bill Murray never had to go through this
","Okay, let's get the 'Groundhog Day' comparisons out the way straight away. Ever since Groundhog Day was released, any other film that has based its premise around a single day repeating itself has been compared to it (i.e. Repeaters, Source Code, that episode from the X-files and so on).This time we have aliens invading the Earth in the near future, but, just like that load of extraterrestrial nasties in Oblivion and War of the Worlds, they didn't figure on us humble earthlings having Tom Cruise on our side. And he's on cracking alien-slaughtering form. He may start out like a bit of a wimp – merely a disgraced army media spokesperson, forced to fight the xenomorphs on the frontlines. However, a freak accident means he acquires the power to restart the day every time he dies, meaning he gets one hell of a 'heads-up' on our invading monsters.Naturally, Tom doesn't have to go it alone and soon recruits the highest-decorated soldier to help him out. And, just as naturally, the highest-decorated soldier just so happens to be a super-fit baddass chick, played by Emily Blunt. So, the two of them have to replay the day until they finally come up with a way of saving the Earth (and most likely getting together for good measure).And it's a pretty good ride. I guess the main audience for it will be sci-fi films (dare I say men?). It's actually more intelligent that it sounds and there are a number of different aspects to the story that make it more than just an 'action version of Groundhog Day.' Also, it does play out a bit like a sci-fi version of a war film (think Saving Private Ryan, but with monsters), so you may have to appreciate war films, too.Tom and Emily undoubtedly carry the film. It's their chemistry that makes it. It's good to see Tom gradually get to know her day by day, only for her to completely forget who he is when the day resets.If I had to pick one flaw in the film it's the aliens themselves. You never really get much of a look at them. Yes, they're pretty horrid – fast moving squid-like things, but, because they're computer-generated and so damn speedy, they move in a blur and you never really get much of a look at them as they tend to kill the cast before we can take stock of their real form.However, that's a minor point. Basically, if you either like Tom Cruise, sci-fi in general, or just a big-budget summer blockbuster that actually makes you think, then give it a go.",8,0,3,27 December 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," He'll Huff and he'll puff (but he won't win an Oscar)
","Poor ol' Leo, what does he have to do to get his Oscar? Here he teams up (yet again) with Martin Scorsese to play the real life (well, Hollywood adapted) tale of Jordan Belfont – a New York stock broker of dubious morales – who lives life in the fast lane (and swears a lot).If you like Leo and/or Scorsese then this is for you. It's an exercise in excess. From its excessive foul language to its excessive nudity and even its excessive (three hour) run-time – everything here is over the top. And it's pretty good.Scorsese does what he has been doing best lately, i.e. getting a good performance out of Leo and piles on his trademark monologues and tracking shots, while filming grown men behaving *very* badly. Leo seems to be on overdrive and cranks up his acting to the max, screaming, shouting and generally working himself up into a manic frenzy. Both of which are pretty fun to watch.If you want to know what 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is like, think the characters from America Psycho and put them in the setting of 'Wall Street' and add the foul language from Goodfellas then you're sort of in the right area.It's pretty entertaining. You may not like all the characters (in fact you probably won't even like a single one), but you'll probably enjoy watching them fall from grace with a bump. Just as long as you can tolerate the shouting, the drug-taking and the nudity then you'll get something out of this.My only complaint was the length. Yes, three hours was a little too long in my opinion (apparently it had been trimmed down from FOUR hours!); I felt a few of the scenes had been dragged out a little too long and a little more ruthless editing might have been in order. But, I'd certainly watch it again (once I've stopped swearing like a trooper and thumping my chest while at work).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,0,1,8 September 2014
Army of Darkness," Bruce is back!
","'Evil Dead.' The original 'video nasty.' 'Evil Dead II.' The half sequel, half remake, three quarters reboot of the original 'video nasty.' 'Army of Darkness.' The sequel to one ending of the remake of 'Evil Dead' which sort of follows on, but also kind of creates a new continuity which then gets erased depending on which version you watch and then how you interpret what follows in 'Ash vs The Evil Dead.' Confused yet? It doesn't matter. Basically, if you're a fan of cheesy horror-comedies (or just love Bruce Campbell as much as I do) then you'll have a blast with 'Army of Darkness.' Despite 'The Evil Dead' franchise's 'liberal' attitude to continuity, no one seems to care. That's probably because its fan-base is just so damn loyal that they forgive these frequent lapses in story-telling and simply enjoy the films (and now TV show) for what they are - dumb, silly - and very, very gory - fun.'Army of Darkness' carries on this tradition. Yes, you probably should have watched at least 'Evil Dead II,' but this (sort of) third instalment will hardly punish you for not knowing its entire back story. Basically, a man gets trapped in medieval times and has to fight his way back to the present. However, it just so happens that the man in question has just so happened to have a lot of experience in slaying disgusting monsters and manages to do it without the use of a hand and an array of dry quips (and a shotgun - that comes in pretty handy, too). Yes, it's none other than 'Ash,' played effortlessly by Bruce Campbell.If you've never heard of Ash/Bruce Campbell, it's actually quite hard to tell where one ends and the other begins (assuming they're different people to begin with). He's certainly not your average hero. He's definitely not politically correct and fits perfectly with the whole 'Evil Dead' feel of gore and gags. It never takes itself seriously and delights in spraying more unnecessary pints of blood all over the screen for as long as possible (most of which ends up on Bruce one way or another!).I suppose if you're completely used to 'modern horror' and like your films 'dark, gritty and realistic' then you may hate 'Army of Darkness' (and the whole 'Evil Dead' vibe). The special effects are pretty cheap-looking (not much computer-generated effects here, mainly blue screen and practical effects). It's hardly scary, choosing self-knowingness over true horror. But it certainly is disgusting. And great fun. There's a reason why the 'Evil Dead' films have stood the test of time (and why its dark and gritty remake of 2013 is barely worth talking about). 'Army of Darkness' is a shining example of a great film that can be made without the need for a massive budget (although, compared to the original 'Evil Dead's' budget, I guess 'Army of Darkness' was 'expensive!'Hail to the king of B-movies and the whole 'Evil Dead' franchise.",9,1,1,9 July 2018
Scream 2," Not bad for a sequel
","Yes, the first 'Scream' movie basically reinvented the tired 'slasher' genre and it's still being imitated to this day. I dare say that not even the producers dreamed it would be as popular as it was. Yet it was. Therefore a sequel was almost guaranteed.The greatest thing about 'Scream' was how 'self aware' it was, constantly parodying its own genre. Therefore, the imaginatively-titled 'Scream 2' had a lot to live up to. Did it? The film itself answers the question. Knowing it's a sequel, one of the characters states that by definition a 'sequel is an inferior product.' I guess he has a case (although the other characters disagree with him!). 'Scream 2' may not be as original as the original (surprise, eh?), but it carries on nicely in the same vain.Neve Campbell (and the remaining survivors of the first encounter) all return (which is nice and not always common in horror sequels) for this outing where, once again, they're mercilessly stalked by a masked killer. Yes, the plot is pretty simple – as was the original and so many slasher flicks before it – but it works, again. The fact is that there's so many awful slasher/horror films infesting the bargain DVD buckets that this sequel almost seems like a masterpiece in its own right.Once again there are plenty of 'red herrings' in terms of characters who may or may not be the killer and I doubt anyone will really guess who's behind the mask until it's too late. Neve Campbell is great to root for as the heroine, but David Arquette does tend to steal the show in terms of sheer lovability! It's witty, it's gory and it's fun. If you liked the first, you should enjoy the second and if you like slasher/horror films in general, you should also get something out of this. Yes, like the character 'Randy' says, it may be an inferior product, but don't let that put you off. And don't think too deeply about plot points – but then if you're a fan of the genre you probably do that anyway when it comes to slasher flicks.",8,1,2,3 June 2015
Con Air," This and 'The Rock' – hell yeah!
","There are great films that will stand the test of time and then there are great – FUN – films. 'Con Air' is the latter. It may never be committed to the world's film archive as an example of classic Hollywood storytelling, but it deserves its place the annals of nineties action movies. For, if you're looking for one great action film that summed up the decade, then it's 'The Rock' (or possibly 'Speed'). But if you're looking for two or three, then Con Air should definitely be in there.Where do I start? Oh, yes, the star of the show. And, when I say 'star' I don't mean Nicholas Cage, but the explosions! Everything (and very nearly everyone!) explodes around here. Years before Michael Bay bored us to death with those pretty explosions Con Air did it first (and better!). However, apart from the fireworks, it does boast a really impressive cast to blow things up. Yes, Nick Cage is at the forefront of the carnage and he plays what is actually a bit of a tongue in cheek role straight as they come. He's ably assisted by John Cusack and – perhaps more importantly – John Malkovich, as he's almost as important as the explosions. The fact is, he's possibly one of the greatest (and possibly under-rated) villains ever to grace the silver screen. He's absolutely fantastically bad, only slightly over the top, but never playing it so much that he becomes unbelievable or a cartoon of himself. Now, it's easy to give all the acting credit to Malkovich, but this 'rogues gallery' of an aeroplane is also packed full of colourful (and completely evil) other prisoners and a special mention to Steve Buscemi who isn't in it for as long as some might wish, but is also fun to watch as a – not particularly subtle – Hannibal Lecter clone.Anyway, the plot our Nicholas Cage plays a U.S. ranger who returns from active duty to his pregnant wife, only to immediately he embroiled in a bar fight where he ends up killing his assailant. Now mercy is spared here and he ends up being sent to prison for years. Then, and all this is hardly a spoiler as it all happens in practically the first five minutes, when he does get released he only ends up on a prison plane flying across America that gets hijacked by the convicts. Some guys just don't get a break.I think the reason I find Con Air so watchable is because it's serious, but not dark – if that makes sense. It kind of knows that it's being a bit overblown and has some nice moments of humour thrown in there, but it's part of that generation of action film that came because 'uber-serious' action films were forced upon us ('Bourne' franchise and Daniel Craig's Bond – I'm looking at you).I find it hard to believe that there are people out there who won't find some enjoyment from this film. Even if you're not a massive fan of any of the stars or action movies in general, this is just such a daft, silly ride then surely you can't help yourself from climbing aboard the plane and going along for a – very explosive – ride.",9,1,2,14 March 2017
The Wrestler," Tragic and poignant - is that really Mickey Rourke?
","Mickey Rourke may be an unusual choice for a leading man these days, but, upon watching The Wrestler, it was hard to imagine the film with anyone else.He plays a 'burned out' wrestler whose glory days have long since passed him by. He lives in a trailer, works part-time at a local supermarket and barely sees his daughter. We watch as he tries desperately to form relationships and regain his career. Like people said that The Man Who Fell to Earth was basically about David Bowie playing a - slightly warped - version of himself, The Wrestler is effectively Mickey Rourke. He's seen his best - acting - days and is trying to climb back up the ladder - the hard way.If you're not a fan of 'professional' wrestling, don't worry. The actual 'ring time' makes up about 12 minutes of a 1 hour 40 minutes film. And, what grappling there is, only proves the point that it's all fake and one big show for the people.There's little to laugh at here. It's a sad tale of someone who has had a taste of the big life and lost it. Now he'll do anything to get it back. It's definitely not a feel-good movie. If you want something tragically poignant, where you root and feel sorry for the 'hero' all at the same time, try this. Mickey Rourke is more than just muscles.",8,0,0,1 November 2014
Dark Shadows," The jury's out
","I like Tim Burton, I like Johnny Depp and I like vampires. Hence Dark Shadows was always going to be something I watched. The film is based on a little-known TV show where Depp plays a vampire who's been buried alive for two hundred years and awoken in the seventies, where he tries to rebuild his family's fortunes while fending off the witch who originally buried him.Having watched the film, I'm still kind of in two minds whether I liked it or now. There were some bits that were really good. If you've seen anything by Tim Burton, you'll either love or hate his Gothic fairytale style (which is, once again, evident here). Depp, as usual, puts in a good performance. However, it seems he's trying a little hard to be different with some not particularly good dialogue. A lot of his 'acting' in this involves him waving his fingers in a semi-threatening manner.I couldn't work out whether the film is trying to be a comedy or a drama, but with horror elements thrown in there as well (and a kind of 'action' end standoff/battle). The film seems to lurch from one genre to another. There are some funny moments utilising the fact that Depp doesn't understand the world he's now living in, but they're few and far between.I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how. Just like I'm not sure I'd be in much of a hurry to see it again. It's even left slightly open for a sequel, however with the mixed reviews (which now, having seen the film, I can fully understand) it's probably in some doubt whether there's any more Dark Shadows to come.Although, it was great to see Alice Cooper rocking out in a film again!",7,0,1,28 February 2015
Hancock," Probably should have been a 'DC' superhero film
","Will Smith made 'Hancock' in 2008, roughly at the same time when Disney's 'Marvel Shared Universe' began its unprecedented rise to global domination. Superhero movies were still a bit hit and miss, especially ones aimed at adults. Here, everyone's most charming actor plays - effectively - Superman (or at least a superhero of very similar powers), only darker (and drunk!). Apparently, the script went through numerous re-writes to actually get it down to the PG13 rating as it was meant to be R rated. And it shows.It's definitely not a bad film. In fact, it's pretty good. However, not only was it made while superhero movies weren't as mega popular as they are today, but the prospect of a more 'adult-themed' superhero movie was just about as far off as possible (how that would one day change with 'Deadpool' and 'Logan!'). You don't have to be a fan of Will Smith to appreciate this 'darker' take on the genre. It poses the question would the general populous really put up with someone so strong that they can basically do whatever they want without the consequences that the rest of us have to face? Not only that, but someone who causes rampant destruction - even in the name of 'good.'Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are the main two other stars attached the project and I'm pleased to say that they're not just there to lend their names, but their characters do have significant parts to play in the overall story and make a distraction from this being a Will Smith stand-alone film only.
I guess one thing that hasn't held up so well over the years is the CGI used to show Hancock flying around the city (and trashing it!). It all looks very much like it was rendered for a home console and then Will Smith superimposed over the top of it. 'The Avengers' and pretty much any other film that has used mass destruction of a city since 2008 has done these kind of effects better.The other major problem with the film is that it doesn't really have an antagonist. I guess Hancock wrestling the demons of being cursed with these sorts of powers seemed to be enough for the film-makers. It's not a long film (a modest hour and a half) and it felt like the writers suddenly thought that these plot themes might actually not be enough and attempted to throw in a villain at about the hour mark. This doesn't really add that much and probably could have been taken out all together if they didn't feel confident enough to expand this aspect to be an ongoing part of the story.However, those are a couple of minor gripes. Will Smith is as awesome as ever (as are Bateman and Theron - seems unfair to leave them out!) and if you like superhero movies then you should definitely watch this one. It's not as dark and adult as 'Logan' or 'Deadpool,' yet it's certainly not as 'family friendly' as Disney's MCU, but it's still fun. Enjoy.",8,0,1,19 October 2018
12 Strong," Thor vs the Taliban
","When I watch a film like '12 Strong,' i.e. one that's 'based on true events,' I always feel like I should research the true story before deciding on how good the film is. It tells the tale of the first group of American soldiers sent into Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks who paved the way for the Allied invasion and subsequent regime change for the Middle Eastern country. Naturally, it's all told from America's perspective, but with any Hollywood war movie, what did you expect? Anyway, it's naturally very patriotic and, although I can't confirm or deny on how close to the actual story this depiction is, it's still pretty good fun. And, dare I say that's mainly to do with its leading man, Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth.Hemsworth plays 'Captain Mitch Nelson' - the squad leader of the twelve special forces operatives sent in to meet up with various local tribes, all of which only too willing to help overthrow the Taliban. There are a couple of familiar faces thrown in there as well - the ones I recognised were Michael Shannon and William Fichtner, but, in my opinion, it's Hemsworth's show all the way. It's hardly controversial to say that he can carry a franchise with ease and here is an example of how he can generally take what is probably a bit of a mediocre and predictable film into something very watchable. He's just so damn easy to watch and somehow doesn't let his (annoyingly, in my bitter opinion!) good looks get in the way of him portraying a kind of 'everyman' soldier who you could just imagine leading a platoon of troops into battle.As you can probably imagine, the film centres around Hemsworth and his men. There is some attempt to show what's going on in the country at the time, but I did get the feeling that this was there for the added effect of showing how bad it was and therefore doubling down on justifying America's invasion of the region. They try to show the 'villain' of the film (i.e. the leader of the Taliban in the area they're attacking) and what he's up to, but the fact that the story dictates the fact that he's obviously never going to interact with our heroes, he's about as effectives as a villain as a bad guy in the Marvel Cinema Universe (excluding Loki, of course!).Besides Hemsworth, I thought the other stand-out performance came from Navid Negahban as local warlord/American ally, 'General Dostum.' He actually gets enough screen time to show us that not all residents of the country are our enemies and its good to see the bond develop between him and Hemsworth's characters. Naturally, there are also the obvious battles that you're going to get in any war film. Most of them seem pretty well done and realistic, but I think there were a few CGI explosions thrown in there as well. Like I say, I'm not sure how historically accurate this film is, but there is some text at the end (which I always go by!) that tells us a few facts and it does seem that the film-makers have done their best to tell the actual story, rather than just throwing out some US propaganda. So, if you're interested in the early days of the 'War on Terror,' like war movies, or are just a fan of Chris Hemsworth, this is actually a film that's better than I expected it to be.",7,0,1,4 December 2018
Kong: Skull Island," My latest guilty pleasure film
","Okay, so I'll start by saying that 'Kong: Skull Island' is hardly high-brow entertainment. It's mass marketed nonsense aimed at the lowest comment denominator. I guess I would have to include myself in that bracket, because I thoroughly enjoyed it! We'll ignore Peter Jackson's recently take on the 'King Kong' story, as it bears no relevance here. Instead, back in 1973 the U.S. government discover an island that's remained hidden throughout the years and decide to send in a team to investigate. We're treated to a brief introduction to all the major players and a quick briefing on board the battleship which reminded me of something out of 'Aliens.' And, while we're on the subject of 'Aliens' Ripley would be most proud about the way the military starts dropping bombs all over the island (with a view to 'study' it – no, seriously). So, while helicopters do their best to 'nuke the site from orbit' one of the island's indigenous occupants – an oversize monkey – doesn't take kindly to this course of action and takes down every last one of them, leaving those few survivors not blown up in the massacre to do their best to make their way across the island to the pick-up point before something even worse happens to them.Now, it's not just enraged monkeys who they have to worry about. They have natives, giant spiders and horrible lizard-things who live underground to contend with. And they soon realise that Kong is the least of their problems! I'm lead to believe that this will be the first in a line of these movies, some even crossing Kong over with other existing franchises ('Godzilla' anyone?) so naturally Kong is – justifiably – the star. However, this does mean that some of the humans are kind of left in the background a bit. It does try to handle quite a large cast and not all of them get the screen time they deserve.Arguably the film's (human) star is Tom Hiddleston. He's basically everything you'd expect a fantasy/action film's leading man to look like. And, as anyone who's seen him in action as Loki in any of the Marvel films, you'll know he's got the screen presence to pull off the leading man role. And, I'm sure he can. He just never really gets the chance here. It just feels like he never gets a true chance to shine as there are so many other people to also feature that he's only there to look manly and give us a possible hint at a romance with the obligatory female co-star. Of course when you also have Samuel L Jackson among the cast, you really need to give him something to do as you don't want to run the risk of wasting acting talent like his. And, to be fair, he does his best with all the screen time he's afforded and the 'stare-down' between him and Kong is truly chilling. John C Reilly is also worthy of a mention, simply because he balances some much-needed humour with a role that allows him to be more than just the standard 'comic relief.' Now, with any film where there's a strong element of danger in it, you expect there to be a bunch of cast members who are there only to make up the numbers and will be routinely killed off at various points in the film. 'Kong: Skull Island' certainly has plenty of these and – yes – most end up in the belly of a giant arachnid or something. However – without wishing to spoil anything – a few of them make it further into the film than you'd imagine. They're given next to no screen time, yet they last longer than characters you've grown closer to. Of course all human stars play second fiddle to the 'real' star of the show – the titular character 'Kong' himself, who is looking pretty good for his age! In other words the computer effects used to bring him to life are realistic enough to give him more than just your standard CGI monster. And, isn't he the real reason we're going to watch this film? If there is a down-point it's that it's a little long and some scenes seem a bit drawn out. Plus, when Kong smacks down on other CGI creatures, the effects do blur together a bit into one fast-moving mess (but at least it's still not as bad as any of the Transformers movies!). However, if you're expecting a popcorn flick which, despite hardly re-inventing the wheel as far as plot and character development go, you should get some enjoyment in seeing Kong battle it out against all manner of human and monster foe. It's not meant to be a great work of art, so please forgive it its failing and enjoy it for what it is. Let's just hope that whatever sequels and crossovers its success spawns don't dip in quality too much (Transformers, I'm thinking of you again!).",8,5,8,22 April 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Probably the best of the bunch
","I was a huge fan of 'The Lord of the Rings' movies and, for once, I actually read all the books when I was young – including the 'prequel' – the Hobbit. Therefore, I was always looking forward to the Hobbit movies. And, I think I was pleased – somewhere. The first two films were just long. We all knew that because The Hobbit was a small book, split into three looooong movies. Even though I've seen both previous instalments, I can't actually remember much about either of them. There were a couple of memorable moments, but, in between Parts II and III, I've managed to pretty much forget almost everything I'd seen (apart from the fact that there were too many CGI scenes and situations where the heroes could never survived!).However, here we have 'Part III' and, in my opinion, it is a bit better. Granted, most of the movie is one loooong battle scene. It's like the 'Helm's Deep' battle from Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, only stretched out for the entire film. Yes, there was as much computer-generated stuff, but it felt slightly more polished than its predecessors. I never really went for the CGI in any of the Hobbit movies. Even though they've been made over ten years after the Lord of the Rings trilogy ended, the CGI seems to have gotten worse over the years.Even though there was probably the least story in this film, it actually came off as the best – or most realistic. There were no ridiculous barrel-chases crashing down rivers, or gaggles of dwarfs bouncing down mineshafts and just getting up again without a scratch.Once again, the titular Hobbit (played – again – excellently by Martin Freeman) is not in it enough, despite the film being named after him. Instead, the film focuses on characters who have been shoved in to pad it out, or the ones we just don't care that much about.Maybe the best thing about The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, was it was actually the last one in the series and had a sense of resolution about it.Bottom line: I loved the Lord of the Rings films and I loved the Hobbit novel. I sort of enjoyed the first two movies, but definitely need to watch them again as I can hardly remember anything about them. At least this last one seems to have stuck in my mind a bit more and I don't reckon that I'll need to re-watch it quite so soon to remember what's happened. Yeah, it held my attention more than the others.",7,1,3,1 July 2015
Lord of War," Uber-restrained Cage
","Nicolas Cage has had an up and down career over the ages - well, mainly 'down' these day, but, back when he could still headline a movie that wasn't released straight-to-DVD, he did 'Lord of War.' It's mainly a drama, but there are certainly elements of satire and almost black comedy sprinkled liberally here and there. Cage plays your average lovable international arms dealer who's happily selling weapons of mass destruction around the world while enjoying the fruits of his efforts (much to the disapproval of a long-suffering Interpol agent, played by Ethan Hawke, who's constantly hot on his trail).There's a reason Nicolas Cage won an Oscar and could prop up even the weakest of scripts with his acting ability and here it shines through. It's definitely one of his last (best) films where the whole show lies upon his shoulders. Granted, he's got a bit of a reputation of - how best to put this - going a little 'over the top' with his acting performances, however, here he's actually pretty restrained compared to some of he previous output.Even though it's Nic's show through and through, there is a pretty decent cast around him. Besides the already-mentioned Ethan Hawke (who's not in it as much as he probably should be), there's also Jared Leto and Ian Holm, both who put in good performances considered the amount of screen-time they're afforded. Cage's on-screen wife is played by Bridget Moynahan who has little to do but look hard done by due to her husband's dodgy lifestyle choices.It's full of social satire and statements about the way we (as Western nations, I guess) live and run our countries, plus the impact the arms trade (whether it be legal, or Nicolas Cage's way of doing it) has on the countries such weapons end up in the hands of. It's also pretty dark in places and doesn't pull any punches. Just because the majority of the violence caused by such weapons is cleverly edited out, we can get the full horror of the regimes who desire to buy illegal weapons such as machine guns and grenades.It's hardly an uplifting film, but Cage does what he does best and makes it worth a re-watch or two with his charming portrayal of someone who deliberately blinds himself to the horrors of what he's doing, simply to further his own lavish lifestyle - hardly a heroic protagonist, but then I guess that's what the film's trying to say.",7,0,0,12 February 2019
Arrival," A thinking man's 'Independence Day'
","Oh, no – giant alien spaceships arrive on Earth and hover over every major city with disastrous (and most likely CGI-heavy) consequences! Yes, we've seen this tired and strained plot for many decades (albeit the slightly older films relied on strings holding up the UFOs, but that was still pretty 'high0-bidget' at the time!). However, in this case, the aliens actually don't go straight into nuking every recognisable landmark they can find on Google Maps. Instead, they actually try to have a chat. However, just because they've left the White House in one piece, doesn't mean things go smoothly. Basically, they have a completely different language to us, therefore the American military enlist the help of a reclusive language specialist (Amy Adams) to help translate.Naturally, there's the obligatory 'love interest' for Adams. This comes in the form of Jeremy Renner, who is likable for what he's there for. Forest Whittaker is always good at pretty much whatever he does, so he's not out of place as the army general in charge of the operation.I knew this basic premise of before I sat down to watch the film and did wonder whether it was possible to string the entire film out for around two hours on this. And, I'm pleased to say that it actually worked. You see the alien ships land in various countries around the world and, although we obviously only really focus on America's involvement with them, we get to hear about how other countries handle them. 'Arrival' is one of those films where, in some ways, it's very difficult to review. If I give away too much it may spoil certain elements of the film. If the basic premise interests you (and you're not expecting wild aerial dogfights against waves of invading flying saucers) then you should definitely give it a go. The film is basically a mystery. You know the aliens are here for a reason, but you have to learn what it is at the same pace as the film's characters. And, if you don't mind the wait, you should enjoy the slow burn.I definitely enjoyed it, but, as I know the ending now, it does mean that it's never going to be as mysterious the second time around. I'd certainly go for a re-watch one day, but you'll only ever get to see it for the first time once and be totally in the dark as to what the ending will entail. Sorry I'm being a bit vague, but, if it interests you, the less you know the better. Either way, at least it proves that you don't need epic space battles or global destruction to make a movie interesting. And this one even raises a few questions in terms of what one person perceives as 'language' may be totally different from another.",7,0,5,2 May 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Is it a bird, is it a plane? Oh, it's a bird. That's that sorted
","With all the superhero movies infesting the screen, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to ask the question, 'What will happen to the stars once they get too big to fit into their spandex costumes?' Here, Michael Keaton once played the (apparently iconic) superhero 'Birdman' back in the early nineties. Back then he ruled the silver screen the way Robert Downey Jr and Hugh Jackman are doing today with Iron Man and Wolverine. However, that was then and this is now. The public have moved on and are more interested in Marvel's 'shared universe' than a man dressed up like a sparrow. So Michael Keaton must attempt to regain his former glory by flexing his acting muscles and put on a play on Broadway.Easier said than done. He has to finance the thing himself and he's hardly a 'bankable' star any more. Plus his ego is so big that it needs its own dressing room. And, if that wasn't bad enough, his 'Birdman persona' occasionally likes to take over and point out all his failings. Naturally, all this leads to a recipe for disaster.It sounds like fun. And it is. But it's an acquired taste and definitely won't be for everyone. It's longer than your average film (nearly two hours) and there are long periods of time when it's like nothing really happens apart from actors wandering from one part of a large theatre set to another (normally to shout at each other). I read a couple other reviews that only gave it minimal marks due to 'nothing happening.' I can see where they're coming from (although I don't technically agree) as there is little in the way of a 'story.' It's about a man, who isn't always the 'hero' he thinks he deserves to be, who is clearly having some sort of breakdown. Fantasy and reality are starting to merge and it's not always easy to tell the difference – for him the character and us the viewers. Therefore, there are bits of it that make you wonder how real they're meant to be. Again, this may put off some of the audience.Then there's the soundtrack. It's mainly a vaguely hypnotic drum beat, endlessly repeated until it's finally parodied in itself at the end of the film – leaving us to wonder whether we're hearing the mindless repetition that actually happening in his own mind.There's quite a stellar cast too. Edward Norton rivals Michael Keaton in the acting stakes, yet his character seems to fade into the background more during the final act.If you're into a bit of slightly surreal drama with a hint of knowingness about it and a healthy swipe at popular culture then give this one a go. It's definitely not an easy ride and is not the sort of film you can just 'get' while it's on the background. Get in the mood for something deep and heavy and take a flight with the bird.",8,0,2,6 August 2015
Centurion," Romans go home!
","I know I shouldn't, but I'm incapable of watching any form of media surrounding the Roman Empire without my mind recalling every quote from the classic Monty Python film, 'The Life of Brian.' There, they were depicted as buffoons and lampooned mercilessly. I guess the people of the numerous lands they conquered in real life wouldn't have agreed too much with the escapades of Biggus Diccus and his cohorts.'Centurion' is about the leader (Michael Fassbender) of a legion of doomed Roman troops, sent in to deal with the uprising locals in the north of England and, in particular, Scotland. Apparently, those Scots (or 'Picts' as they were really, back then) were dealing heavy losses to Roman battalions and something has to be done about it. Sadly, for most of Fassbender's party (and I'll keep calling him by the actor's name, seeing as every time I see a - supposedly - authentic Roman name of the period, I keep thinking it looks something like 'Naughtness Maximus!') they get completely wiped out, leaving just him and a handful of others on the run from a band of bloodthirsty locals.And there is plenty of blood. It's not for the faint-hearted and there are plenty of limbs being hacked off left, right and centre. It's primarily one long chase film with action set-pieces thrown in. And it's all good if that's what you're looking for. I'm no historian, so I can't tell you if every Roman infantry man's costume is 100% accurate, or whether this was what it was like back then. But it is a fairly decent action film.It's also well-directed, but then you'd expect that from Neil Marshall (the creative force behind such great little gems as 'Dog Soldiers, The Decent and Doomsday'). I would say that it's worth pausing while you're watching the film and ask yourself the question, 'Who are the 'real' good guys?' In 'Dog Soldiers' the werewolves were clearly the bad guys, then you had the monsters in 'The Decent' and the cannibal gangs in 'Doomsday.' Here, the Romans are clearly the underdogs, but, if you think about it, they are - technically - an invading and most unwelcome force in an occupied land, so are the Picts well within their rights to hack their heads off for fun?I read somewhere that it's based on a true story. And when I say 'true' I mean in 'Hollywood terms,' i.e. there was a sort of account of something that happened that might be a bit like this and this film is one way that events COULD have unfolded. Anyway, it's still good fun. Although there are a few other actors in the film you may recognise from this or that, Fassbender is the only one that you'll remember (unless you count the mute psychotic lady Pict with her blue war-paint sent to dispatch him - I certainly wouldn't mess with her!).There's a - pretty superfluous - love interest thrown in there, but it doesn't impact too much on the action and the gore. It's a fun little period action film that is definitely entertaining. Just try not to think of 'The Life of Brian' too much and shouting 'Bl**dy Romans!' too much at the screen while you watch it!",7,0,4,18 March 2019
Platoon," The Ultimate war movie
","I know that 'war movies' are a bit of a 'niche' genre. Not everyone is interested in seeing various real life conflicts depicted on the big screen. However, 'Platoon' is just about the 'perfect' war movie and - hopefully - should be able to be appreciated by almost everyone. Most people know that the 'Vietnam war' didn't go quite as well as the US were hoping. Here we don't see a glorified historical retelling of the conflict, showing how the US were 'right' to get involved, or how they really did 'win' the war (honest!). It's more of a character study of the 'average' troop on the ground who was forced to fight in the conflict.Charlie Sheen (pre 'tiger blood' outcry!) is the young recruit who the story focuses on - a man from middle class America who enlists in the army because he didn't see why only the 'poor kids' should get killed in the line of fire. However, as you can imagine, he quickly discovers the true horrors of war and regrets his decision to enlist. There's plenty of other recognisable actors among the soldiers who you'll probably recognise (including a particularly young Johnny Depp), all of which play their parts well. But 'Platoon' is not just about the grisly effects of battle, as a big part of the film is about 'ideologies,' namely between the two sergeants who wrestle (sometimes quite literally!) for control of the squad and the recruits it's made up of. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger play the two soldiers and both have a tendency to steal every scene.Of course it wouldn't be an epic war film without plenty of action and the battle scenes certainly don't hold back in terms of practical effects and nasty death scenes. You'll need a strong stomach in some places as the film never holds back when it comes to limbs being blown in all directions (and expect plenty of strong language to match).Platoon' may have been made back in 1986, long before the massive influx of computer special effects that allow film-makers to create huge worlds and epic battles which we could only just dream of back in the eighties. However, watching it today in 2018, I couldn't help but feel that it could have been made today and the effects couldn't be improved on. It really is timeless, so, if you're looking for a character study that never holds back from showing the horrors of war, different ideologies and has action to boot, then 'Platoon' is as good as it ever was.",10,2,3,16 October 2018
Scream," The slasher film that started it all (again)
","The 'slasher' film, i.e. a killer stalking a selection of dippy American teenagers, had kind of gone out of fashion in the late eighties. Therefore, the early nineties were a barren place for masked nutjobs wielding knives. Then Scream came along.It's about a young girl, seemingly destined to spend the entire film being stalked by a masked killer who despatches her peers in many different knife-related ways. Nothing particularly unusual there, but don't let the basic nature of the plot put you off. There is definitely more to this than meets the eye.It not only revitalised the 'slasher genre' but it also was the first of such films to poke fun at the whole genre in itself. If you've ever found yourself yelling at the 'dumb blonde' on the screen to run the right way and not straight back into the serial killer's clutches then this is the film for you. It uses the horror clichÃ©s to the max and takes great pleasure in, not only pointing them out, but dispelling them.However, Scream wasn't just hugely successful because it poked fun at the genre. It was also a damn good mystery. With other similar films, the killer was normally quite obvious, i.e. the big disfigured bloke in a mask, wielding a chainsaw. But in Scream, pretty much every character is a suspect. The only time you can really rule them out is when they end up the wrong end of the killer's knife.If you love horror then you've probably already seen it. If you haven't... watch it now. The only downside you might find is that it was so successful that there were almost an infinite number of (nowhere near as good) copies. However, Scream is the original and BEST. It's fun, gory, well-written with great characters. What more could you want if you like scary movies?",10,1,3,8 December 2014
Prometheus," 90% brilliant - 10% let down
","Prometheus is breath-taking - its visuals are a treat and its direction is flawless (but then it's directed by Sir Ridley, so you should expect that).It's about a team of astronauts that find evidence that a race of aliens have visited Earth thousands of years before mankind and left a map with which humans can follow them.But, let's face it, no one cares about that.What people want to know is 'Is it, or is it not a prequel to Alien?' The answer, is ambiguous at best.Yes, it's obviously set in the same universe and it's a great film (like I say 90% brilliant). However, the let down occurs when you start applying it to Alien (and its successors). Those wanting a film that 'leads in' to Alien will be disappointed. Prometheus appears to want to be a film that starts its own franchise. Therefore, any direct link to Alien is still several films away.Also, there are some very annoying questions that never get resolved in Prometheus. Now, I'm not going to describe them as 'plot holes' because, there are probably going to be sequels which will explain them. However, if no sequels arrive, or they just gloss over the questions Prometheus raises, then these oddities will be regarded as some major goofs.Overall, Prometheus is great. My advice - ignore everything 'Alien-related' (for now) and enjoy it for what it is. Also, be prepared to be left with unanswered questions. If you can live with that, you should find it excellent.",7,1,5,25 January 2015
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman – DC finally finds its feet
","In case you're not aware of the 'shared cinematic universe' wars that are going on in the cinemas, I'll try and put it simply. One studio makes superhero films that everyone seems to love. Another studio makes superhero films that you'd think the same audience would loves, but everyone seems to hate. And there you have my brief history of 'Marvel' and 'DC.' Wonder Woman falls into the 'DC bracket' and fans have already expressed their disapproval with DC's previous attempts at getting all their most famous heroes together on the big screen with the various Superman and Suicide Squad films, some even saying that DC's 'shared cinematic universe' is already dead in the water. However, just when it looked like this franchise was as dead as the new General Zod, along comes Gal Gadot as the titular Wonder Woman. And, just as most people agreed that the other DC films don't work, now most people seem to agree that Wonder Woman is awesome! I have to say that I agree, but then maybe I'm easily pleased as I also really liked Batman versus Superman and Suicide Squad! I've never read the comics, but I believe the film is a little different here and there. Apparently, they've changed her origins and set the story in World War I as opposed to WWII. Apparently, that did irk some people, but my lack of backstory knowledge of the source material meant that I never noticed! Anyway, we meet Diana (aka Wonder Woman) on her Amazonian island as a child. We see her obsess over becoming like the warrior women she idolises and yearns to join them in their eternal fight against the forces of darkness. Don't worry. This doesn't last for long. It's pretty tedious and definitely the low-point of the whole film. In fact, it could quite easily have been cut and no one would have really noticed. All it feels like is pointless exposition. However, like I say, it doesn't last long and Diana quickly grows up in time to rescue crashed Allied fighter pilot Captain Kirk from his stricken plane as it nose dives in the sea (or rather Chris Pine, anyway).And from then on it's pretty non-stop. You have everything you can want from a superhero movie. Despite Gal Gadot's inexperience with acting (I believe she's primarily a model), she plays the character perfectly. She's one part fish out of water as she arrives in the 'real' world and interacts with people who weren't raised without war on a paradise island. But she's never totally naïve. You cannot help but root for her as she's just so damn likable without ever been a goody-two-shoes. Then there's the chemistry with Kirk – sorry, Pine – they bounce off each other brilliantly. And the characters are seamlessly woven into expert direction when it comes to the fight scenes – after all, Wonder Woman is literally going to war and the scene where she charges an entire German trench sends goosebumps down your arms – it's that good.If there is a negative it's the beginning, plus an annoying comedy relief character (you'll spot her straight away), but thankfully both bad elements are brief. This is normally the point where I say that fans of superhero movies will love this. And, although I believe that to be true, I reckon that Wonder Woman is the kind of film where pretty much anyone who enjoys good cinema should enjoy it, plus – special shout-out to the weird grinding soundtrack that seems to come on every time Diana fights (it's weird and definitely as memorable to the action as other classic tunes such as the Bond and Indiana Jones themes).After a shaky start DC are finally off and running. And this can only be good to give Marvel a bit of competition at the Box Office. Bring on Wonder Woman 2 (or was that technically Batman versus Superman?!).",8,3,9,20 July 2017
Back to the Future Part II," Ignore the plot holes (and enjoy!)
","I know that the original 'Back to the Future' film was 'lightning in a bottle' (or should that be 'Flex Capacitor?') and its sheer charm and mass appeal could never truly be recaptured. Therefore 'Part II' was always going to have a hard job when it came to competing. I was only twelve when it was released and, in short, I loved it. However, even back then long before the days of internet message boards and Twitter, I remember picking up on the mutterings from film critics about how it wasn't a patch on the original. Now, I'm not about to commit blasphemy and tell you that it is. I'm just saying that it's a great, fun film and it continues the story just perfectly.Sequels that outdo their original are few and far between, but this one does have enough memorable moments to really hold their own over time and remain in the public's consciousness, even today (Marty's 'self-lacing' Nike trainers, anyone?). If ever a story picked off where the last one left off, it was 'Back to the Future Part II.' Who among us wasn't dying to know where Marty and Doc were going to next and the sight of our favourite time-travelling car flying off into our faces only filled us with intrigue. And, when they arrive in the 'future,' or at least 2015 as was depicted back in the 80s, it's filled with weird and wonderful gadgets (which - naturally - are still waaay off where we are today, technologically). Marty has to prevent an incident in his son's future that will bring down his family-life to come. naturally, not everything goes to plan and he and Doc are forced to zip back and forth through time in order to correct things. And, like I say, I loved it then and I still do.However, that's just my opinion and I think it's fair to address some of the criticisms it's picked up then and now. Some people resent a few casting changes that occurred between films, others say that the future is too over-the-top, plus it retreads old ground (sometimes remaking scenes deliberately in homage to its own predecessor), but without any of the charm and others resent the way it ends (I should warn you that it's designed to be a 'middle film,' therefore I'm guessing the film-makers had no plans to end the story with Part II.Personally, I didn't mind and of that. If I could nit-pick one single thing it would be something I note now about the story-telling 'suspension of disbelief' which seems to go hand in hand with all time travel movies. Namely something happens which causes 'time' to spew off in a different direction, but, due to the paradox this would actually cause, the plot falls apart on a plot hole. However, I didn't notice that when I was younger and I'm sure not going to let it ruin my enjoyment of the film now.There are few movies nowadays that the whole family can sit down and enjoy (okay, maybe 'Ready Player One' will be one day), but, right now, all three 'Back to the Future' movies deserve their place in cinematic history. Watch it now before it gets remade!",9,0,1,13 April 2018
Blow," Dark biopic
","Believe it or not, there was a time when Johnny Depp could do no wrong. 'Blow' was an example of one of the many - possibly only average - films which his presence and screen-charisma elevated to more than just a run-of-the-mill biopic of a drug dealer. Depp plays 'George Jung' - possibly the most notorious American-born drug dealer of the seventies and eighties and 'Blow' charts the man's rise to power and subsequent fall, leaving off where he (literally) is today (or at least where he was in 2001 when this film was released).Besides Depp, there aren't that many famous faces on show here. Penelope Cruz seems to relish taking a break from playing 'nice girls' back then in favour of being Depp's crazy, coke-fuelled on-screen wife and Ray Liotta pops up as Depp's long-suffering father (with occasional dubious make-up to show how he's aged throughout the story). Besides them, it's a Johnny Depp film all the way. I do wonder whether, if it was released today, it would have been half as popular, as Depp's last few big screen ventures have brought nothing but scorn from critics at the Box Office. However, here he shines. Yes, he is certainly a rogue - someone only interested in the 'good life,' but despite being a criminal, he's never a violent one (of course some may argue that spreading addictive and deadly drugs to the masses constitutes 'harming' people!).Being a 'real life' tale (or, as Hollywood tends to do, takes aspects of the real events and forms a more compelling narrative around them) Depp provides a lot of voiceover which does tend to 'tell' the story, as opposed to 'showing' what transpires. Plus this turns into a convenient tool with which to fill in blanks when the film moves from time period to time period (I think - technically - it starts in the fifties and ends up in the nineties, so many time-jumps are required). And, if a voiceover isn't there, sometimes you get a montage to quickly get the audience to the next major point in Jung's life. These can come across as a bit jarring and make the film (which most likely could have been a whole TV series about this man's life!) feel a little rushed in places.If you're into crime films (based on real life events, or otherwise) you should enjoy this. It's definitely very watchable and, from what I've seen online, presents a reasonable attempt at portraying the facts surrounding Jung's life. Plus, if you're into Depp in his heyday, then you'll get your money's worth here.",8,1,2,21 August 2018
Taken 2," More of the same
","If you've seen the first Taken film, then you've basically seen the second. Some may say that's a flaw (and I suppose in some ways it is), but when the first one was quite an enjoyable action romp, then if you enjoyed it, you'll probably like this one too.In the first film, CIA superman, Liam Neeson's daughter sets foot outside the good ol' U.S. of A. and gets kidnapped (sorry... taken) by the first gang of non-American scumbags she ran into. You'd think with that sort of track record, his family may steer well clear of foreign travel. Of course that would make a pretty dull sequel. Instead, they take a relaxing CIA-orientated jaunt back to the hell-holes of Europe and this time Liam and Mrs Liam end up getting taken by an offshoot of the first gang of scumbags, this time wanting revenge.So, Liam must do what he does best... which is basically the same as what he did the first time round. Have a few car chases, count things and basically murder everyone he comes across.It's all very serious. I thought that it may stray into tongue-in-cheek, as it's so far-fetched, but it never does. Everything is played straight right up until the end.If you liked the first, or are a fan of ultra serious Bourne-style action romps then you'll probably like this one too. I look forward to seeing who gets taken in the next film. My money's on his dog.",7,0,0,2 February 2015
The Woman in Black," Clichéd, dull and sadly miscast
","Daniel Radcliff has become synonymous with Harry Potter since its transfer to the big screen. Understandably, now he's too old for the part and the franchise is over, he's looking to move on to other things and shed his 'boy wizard' image. In The Woman in Black, he plays a young lawyer in the nineteen century who comes a cropper with some nasty ghosts.First of all, well done to the film-makers for getting Daniel Radcliff in the film to begin with. I hear he doesn't come cheap. However, this is the film's main selling point, i.e. yes it's Harry Potter not playing Harry Potter for the first time. Unfortunately, competent actor that Daniel Radcliff is, he just comes across as too damn young to play the part.Although, if that was the film's only let-down, I could probably suspend my disbelief and just go with it. But no. The film's main problem is that it's simply not scary. There are a few bits that will make you jump, but that's about it - 'spooky' comes in the form of (normally) inanimate objects suddenly moving, i.e. a rocking horse, a music box, a children's stuffed toy and so on.It manages to borrow bits from other horror movies, like The Ring, but the fact is, it's very slow and not particular interesting. It's not really Radcliff's fault - a fair portion of the story involves him spending his time just wandering round empty buildings looking scared. During these scenes, he has no one to play off and you just find yourself waiting for whatever is going to creepily move to do so and offer the 'scare scene.'Good luck to Radcliff in shedding his wizard image. This film will go some way to showing he can do more than just ride a broomstick. Trouble is, he's in a scary film that's just not scary.",4,1,3,31 December 2014
Vanilla Sky," More 'Lynchian' than love
","It's hard to imagine that in 2001 a love story starring Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz was actually considered a Box Office failure. But then that's because it wasn't a love story. However, much of the marketing that surrounded it concentrated on the 'relationship aspect' of the film, lulling people into thinking this was what they would be getting. Therefore, by the time they had left the cinema and their heads had stopped spinning, they possibly were among the many who simply described 'Vanilla Sky' as a 'mess.' Yes, the story is centres around a print billionaire (Tom Cruise's) slowly falling in love with a struggling artist (Penelope Cruz) while at the same time trying to fend off his existing lover (Cameron Diaz). So far, nothing particularly out of the ordinary. However, once the film gets going (and I say this referring to much that comes in the second half, as the first half sets everything up without giving too much away as to what's about to come) things start taking a turn for the weird.Dreams are mentioned more than once and that's a good analogy as to how the film progresses. Things happens that appear a little random, leaving the audience to wonder whether there may ever be some form of supernatural influence involved. The story chops and changes and deliberately leaves the viewer feeling pretty disorientated, much like you'd feel upon waking up from a particularly vivid dream. Naturally, this form of story-telling doesn't make for an easy ride when it comes to understanding the narrative. I can see it leaving some people a little confused (it took me a couple of watches to actually 'get' the film entirely!).I mentioned 'Lynchian' in my title. This refers to film-maker David Lynch, who's famous for his weird, surreal, completely NON classic Hollywood narrative way of telling a story. He, like 'Vanilla Sky,' likes to leave a fair element of the story up to the viewers' interpretation, rather than spoon-feeding them every plot point. Therefore, this is most likely a film that you're going to find yourself discussing with friends after a viewing (although, in my opinion, 'Vanilla Sky' actually gives you a lot more answers than the average David Lynch film!).If you know what you're in for I think people who are in the mood for a particularly weird and slightly disturbing type of film will quite enjoy this. You definitely have to be in the mood. I've seen it a fair few times, but, if I'm simply craving car chases and shoot-outs, then this isn't the film I put on. I think if anything sums it up best it's Cameron Diaz's performance in 'Vanilla Sky' - on the surface, sweet and frothy. However, dig deep and you'll find dark and creepy (and that's not an insult - she's really good in this!).",8,0,0,22 January 2018
X-Men: First Class," Yeah, pretty good actually
","I'm not the biggest X-men fan. I never read the comics, so my knowledge of the story only comes from the films. If you look online you'll see plenty of fanboys crying because some of the dates in this prequel don't add up in the original trilogy.That's probably true, but I didn't notice. I thought, for a prequel - which, let's face it, is just an excuse to milk a few extra quid out of the franchise's audience - it was actually okay. It did a good job of showing us a backstory that we didn't know, i.e. how Professor X and Magneto went from friends to enemies (George Lucas could take note as to how to write prequels!). Everything seemed to fit together well and tie up all the loose ends. Plus there wasn't too much pointless action and the special effects seemed just right (although I just watched Transformers 3, so I'm all CGIed out right now!). It felt more like a spy film with super powers.All in all, good fun. And just be thankful they did cast Kevin Bacon as the villain as opposed to Colin Firth (seriously, he just would have killed the film).",7,0,0,12 May 2014
The Wolverine," Does the job
","Okay, so everyone likes Wolverine best out of the X-men, so it was no surprise that he got his own movie out of it. However, 'Origins' (as it was titled) wasn't as popular at the box office as the studio would have liked. Yet, due to the fact that it's Wolverine, who cares? So... let's give him another movie anyway.This time out steel-boned (or Adamantium, or whatever it's called) is in Japan, so expect plenty of fights with samurai. Next adventure he'll probably be in Norway, followed by a film set in Brazil, before finally ending up in Wales. Anyway, it doesn't really matter where he is... Hugh Jackman continues to do a decent enough portrayal as the titular character to make the movie worth sitting through. He fights, he growls, he fights a bit more. It's all good. However, this time the whole 'mutant aspect' which was so familiar in the X-men and Origins has been toned down a bit more.In this story (and I'm not 'spoiling' it for you as it's in the trailer) Wolverine loses his powers of rejuvenation and so needs to be a little more careful when taking on his enemies. Therefore you don't need to be a mutant (or have their 'mutant powers') to defeat him).So, if you like the X-Men, or just gritty action, you'll probably like this one. It's a solid entry into the franchise, but doesn't cover too much new ground.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,2,28 July 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," If you liked the others, then you'll love this
","There's probably not much to say about The Dark Knight Rises that hasn't already been said. You can't really walk into the cinema and wonder what you'll get from a film about a man who dresses up like a bat and fights crime at night.Most people who will watch The Dark Knight Rises will probably have seen the previous two and will be aware of writer/director Christopher Nolan's 'slant' of the classic Batman legend. Well... this is more of the same.All the surviving cast members from the previous films return to tie up their character arcs and, perhaps the best thing about the film, is that it feels like a 'real' sequel - not one that's been made by someone else and has a totally different feel about it all. The cast is as impressive as before and Tom Hardy puts in an excellent performance (I think he deserves credit for stepping into the shoes of 'main baddie' that Heath Ledger wore so well and tragically last time).The only drawback I felt was that there are so many good characters played by big names, that it was hard to give them all enough screen time and - believe it or not - there are long periods where the title character himself doesn't feature.It's a great ride, but one that's definitely different to Marvel's current superhero crop. Everything from The Hulk, Thor, Iron Man and Avengers is big, loud and very 'comic-book.' Batman is none of this. It, like its predecessors are more like crime dramas with a much darker feel to it and more realistic (well, slightly) action.Basically, if you liked the first two, you'll probably see this as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. You don't have to have watched the first two to understand everything that goes on here, but it will probably help. So, my advice would be to start at the beginning of Nolan's trilogy and work your way from there.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,2,4,2 June 2014
Black Panther," Welcome to the shared universe, Your Highness
","'Black Panther' has received a lot of hype surround it being the first superhero film with a black leading man (even though that mantel probably should have gone to 1997's 'Spawn,' but it is correct at least in terms of the current Marvel Shared Universe). However, I really don't believe its success will have much to do with anything so shallow. In short: it's a modern day Marvel film and, if you're a regular at the multiplexes, you'll probably already know what to expect: a hero with superpowers taking on - basically - an evil version of themselves. So, if that's what you're into (and current Box Office trends says that many of us are!) then you're going to enjoy this just as much as 'Iron Man, Thor' and all the others. The reason: it's just a cool, colourful, charismatic film which is great to eat popcorn to.It's set just after 'Captain America: Civil War,' but perhaps one of the first things I should mention is that you don't really need to have seen any other films in the MCU to fully understand everything that happens here. We meet up with King T'Challa of (fictional African nation) Wakanda who, along with ruling his nation since the recent death of his father, also moonlights as the super-powered 'Black Panther,' who, as yet, has kept his and his country's 'special' abilities a secret from the rest of the world. Now, faced with exposure of just what Wakanda is capable of, he is faced with whether to continue its current way of existing, or enter the fray (which will no doubt take him further into the path of the Avengers and their exploits).So, there's nothing new in terms of plot, but it's definitely a distant cousin of the recent Marvel movie 'Thor: Ragnarok' in terms of its look and feel. It's very colouring to look at (nothing DC-like by being all 'dark and gritty' here!) - you may even say its looks like a 'living comic book!). It's a great-looking film visually, but, if you're being overly-critical, you could say that there's a little too much CGI, especially in the backdrops. I know this is a criticism levelled at all 'fantastical' films where whole new planets/civilisations have to be created, but sometimes you can tell the King is talking to someone up against a greenscreen.Also, it's worth noting that there isn't - quite - as much humour in this film as other recent Marvel entries. I guess this is down to - sort of - handicapping its leading man by making him a King. Before, we've had leading men who are gods/thieves/playboy billionaires - all of whom are allowed the freedom to let a witty quip roll of their tongues at a moment's notice. However, here, if the Black Panther did that, it would probably feel a little out of character. Luckily, the film makes up for this by surrounding him with a stellar supporting cast who are well-schooled in letting off steam with a one-liner or two.Overall, 'Black Panther' is just another excellent and enjoyable thrill ride in the Marvel universe. Don't expect anything too deep or revolutionary - just expect a good time and be prepared to bow at not just His Majesty - the King of Wakanda - but also yet another amazingly-successful in a film franchise that never seems to be able to run out of steam.",8,6,35,15 February 2018
Iron Man," Not very super, but quite heroic!
","'Iron Man' is the surprise superhero hit from Marvel Studios which charts the tale of billionaire weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark, to the flying metal superhero 'Iron Man.' It seemed that, despite its impressive budget, no one quite imagined this lesser (when compared with the more famous – and bankable – superheroes such as Spiderman, Batman and Superman) hero to become quite as bigger box office draw as it turned out. And it definitely isn't 'wall-to-wall action' which drew the crowds in.To be honest, there isn't an awful lot of 'Iron Man' in Iron Man the movie. Our hero, Tony Stark (expertly played by Robert Downey Jr) only gets inside his costume about three times in a two hour movie. Therefore, don't expect a load of 'Michael Bay-style' explosions every few minutes.You have to get the 'origins' side of Iron Man out of the way here, showing how he transgresses from playboy billionaire to concerned citizen, prepared to put his life on the limb to save the world. So a lot of the story is taken up with HOW he becomes the titular character.However, don't let any lack of action fool you into thinking this isn't going to be one hell of a ride. Somehow, everything just works and the two hours fly by faster than Iron Man outrunning some jet fighters.You don't have to love comic books or superheroes to appreciate that this is a really fun film. It's nowhere near as dark as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and sticks to its upbeat and colourful comic book roots. It's a great popcorn film for all the family and even having Gwyneth Paltrow in it doesn't detract from the fun element *miaow! http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,2,3,5 July 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not as bad as you've probably heard
","Okay, I know I'm a little late to the party here – 'Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice' has been out for a while now, so I was well aware of the split opinions when I finally got round to watching this on DVD. From what I gathered you either thought it was the greatest film ever made or a steaming pile of bat-kryptonite.I come down somewhere in the middle. I'm no die-hard comic book fan, so I can't really tell you how well the main characters are represented, apart from how they compare to their various filmic incarnations. But I can tell you that, although it's no classic, it's probably not as bad as you've heard. But then that's not to say that it isn't without faults.First of all, if you didn't know, the comic company behind Batman and Superman is DC and they're playing catch-up to rivals Marvel when it comes to recent big screen outings. Marvel created a 'shared universe' where they made a film about each superhero then combined them for an 'ensemble' movie. Now, DC is jumping on the bandwagon, but is going a little too far too fast. BVS is packed full of characters and sub-plots, many of which could have been taken out. It only really had the Man of Steel (aka Superman 1) before it, so it's trying to get too much information in, compared to Marvel's slow build up.Then you have Jessie Eissenberg. Yes, he plays the main villain 'Lex Luthor' (or Luthor's son to be precise). However, as many feared, he's just not up to it. I like the actor, I just think that he was horribly miscast for this role – and it shows. You really needed a more threatening (and older!) actor to take on the role.Then you have the trailer. If you were looking forward to this film then you probably saw the trailers. They basically ended up being a condensed version of the two and a half hour film, so you can probably work out everything that's going to happen. No surprises here then.But, despite its faults, I actually enjoyed it. I was sceptical about Ben Affleck as Batman, but he was actually pretty okay (and that's high praise for Affleck from me!). Wonder Woman's inclusion wasn't as 'shoe-horned' in as I thought it would be and she'll probably have a reasonably successful stand-alone movie off the back of this. Plus the fight scene that we were all waiting for was well worth the wait (if cut short for many people's taste).Overall, don't believe either the lovers or the haters. If you go into this film with your expectations suitably set to something that will pass the time and is actually worth it for seeing – arguably – two of the greatest superheroes ever knocking seven bells out of each other, then you'll just about get your money's worth. Probably one for DVD rather than paying full price in the cinema for.I'm well up for the Justice League – expectations set low for that, too.",8,1,2,20 September 2016
Monsters University," Will adults enjoy this?
","Let's face it... that's an important question every parent asks, because, at the end of the day, we know it'll be us who have to sit through this film as well as our kids. Children tend to be able to sit through most films/TV as long as it has cute characters and lots of primary colours. But us adults' eyes tend to start to glaze over as we pray for the end credits to roll.That was why films like 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek' were so popular - because they were just as enjoyable for adults as kids. Luckily, 'Monsters University' tends to lean towards those. It's probably not technically as good and/or funny as either, but it will definitely entertain the kids while not annoying the adults who have to watch it with them.Obviously, if you liked the humour/characters in the first film (Monsters Inc) then you'll probably love this, too. However, even if you haven't seen it, you and your kids will easily pick up the plot. Of course there are the usual moral messages which go over the youngsters' heads and us oldies roll our eyes at.But, at the end of the day, it's a fun film which the kids will probably want to watch again and again. And, even better still, we won't be that bothered to sit through it with them.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,1,2,22 July 2014
Casino Royale," A brave new Bond
","Okay, let me say that the reason I'm reviewing this film several years after its release is because I've decided to give it a second viewing (in the wake of Skyfall's success at the box office).I've watched all the Bond films, right the way through from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan and, although they vary slightly depending on the story, I have to say I've loved them all. I love the silliness, the tongue-in-cheekiness, the witty quips and the gadgets.Then came Casino Royale.I had no objections to Daniel Craig being named as James Bond (after his part in Layer Cake, I think he proved he had what it took). I didn't even object to the fact that Bond was (sort of) being 'rebooted,' showing how Bond became a 00 agent etc. What I objected to was that, in my opinion, it was NOT Bond. Yes, it had action, ladies and exotic locations, but gone was everything that I thought made Bond Bond.I watched the whole film and give it a disappointed two stars out of five, admitting that the action sequences were good, but it was more The Bourne Identity than Bond.However, as the years have gone by and my shock has dwindled, I've re-watched it and come to accept that it does have its merits. Yes, Bond has changed. Maybe it's for the best. Daniel Craig's (current) three outings have been the most financially successful of all the Bond films, so I guess he's appealing to the masses.This is indeed a 'new slant' on Bond. Gone is what I loved, but it's been replaced by something - now I'm viewing it in the cold light of day - with some ALSO pretty good too.I appreciated that the plot to Casino Royale was actually a lot more intense than many of its predecessors, plus there was far more reliance on character development, rather than just invisible cars (yes, even I found that one a little hard to swallow in Die Another Day).Although I will forever enjoy the cheeky charm of 'old' Bond, I will admit that this one has its place alongside it and now am beginning to look forward to the news of a new Bond film in the making.",7,1,4,15 February 2015
Trainspotting," Choose... THIS film
","Despite an offshoot of moral crusaders berating 'Trainspotting' in 1995 for allegedly 'glorifying heroin' there seem to be few who can doubt the greatness of such a cult classic.Yes, it is about a band of horrible, nasty people, but - most importantly - it does NOT glorify any form of drugs. On the contrary, it would recommend that this film is shown to youngsters as a way of showing just how wretched and awful people's lives can be when they're hooked on substance abuse.Ignoring 'Shallow Grave' this could be considered as Ewan McGregor's 'breakthrough' performance and, although he does steal the show in every scene, the whole 'ensemble' cast should not be forgotten - special mention to Robert Carlyle as 'Begbie' who is a truly terrifying on-screen psycho.It's hard to imagine there are too many people who don't like Trainspotting. It's a great British film which catapulted many of those involved into mainstream stardom. Some people say that it's quite bleak and, although the subject matter is pretty dark, the cast handle it with enough wit and charm to have us - sort of - rooting for them (or at least Ewan McGregor's 'anti-hero' - Renton). Yes, it can be a bit dark and disturbing at times, but the real life 'horror' of the 'junkie lifestyle' has to be shown in all its glory if its really going to portray it accurately.So, if you're any way interested in popular culture the Trainspotting perfectly sums up the nineties. Even if you're not, it's one of those films that you really should see before you die - if nothing else then sooner or later you'll find yourself in a situation when all those around you are talking about it and you really don't want to be left out!",10,1,3,4 November 2014
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A decent whistle-stop historical piece
","I never studied the 'Elizabethan' period at school (choosing instead to get all my knowledge about the era from 'Blackadder II!'), so I'm not entirely sure how accurate the story of - arguably - Britain's most famous queen is, but it certainly ticks off all the major beats from the latter part of her reign (to my limited knowledge, anyway).In some ways it's actually a 'sequel' to Cate Blanchett's first turn as the monarch, however whereas before we saw her rise to power and experiences at being so young and yet so powerful, here we're treated to a far more 'mature' Queen Elizabeth II and the pressure placed on her to find a husband, while at the same time trying to suppress her own (rumoured, so I understand?) desires for Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the very real threat that the Spanish may well invade soon.Blanchett already proved in the first outing that she's more than capable at portraying the royal in the period and her performance cannot be faulted here either. This is one film where a poor performance from the lead whose shoulders everything rests on can completely ruin the film. Here, as expected, she carries it off with ease and shows how even the most powerful woman of her age had many problems with her personal life and that of generally being a woman.There are plenty of other famous faces in the case - mainly Clive Owen who is at the peak of his rugged charm, but also Geoffrey Rush. Both are excellent and perfectly suit their roles, but this film is Blanchett's baby all the way and she eclipses everyone around her at every turn.Many people who have seen both films seem to think that the first one is better, mainly due to the fact that - apparently - it sticks closer to history and takes less liberties. However, for anyone even vaguely interested in this era of British history could do a lot worse than watch it to get a decent overview of the events of the time. Yes, many are skated over a little and everything seems to happen very quickly, but with a performance like Blanchett's it really should be overlooked. My main gripe was that the budget clearly didn't really stretch to particularly realistic computer-generated special effects during the battle scenes at sea, but if I wanted wall-to-wall special effects, I'd watch a Marvel movie.",7,0,0,11 March 2020
Speed," Pop quiz: what's the best action movie of the nineties?
","Answer: Speed. I just watched it again, now twenty-one years after I first saw it in the cinema. There are few movies that can be considered 'timeless' and, although 'Speed' may be an unlikely name to be added to that list, I truly believe it deserves its place among the 'action greats.' Even though it was filmed in the nineties, it looks as good today as it ever did. Okay, so the absence of iphones and Twitter may be noticeable, but it could basically be set today and you wouldn't really notice. The special effects are perfect and blend seamlessly with the action (no dodgy computer generated armies of monsters of far away planets to distract you and pull you out of the moment).Yes, it's definitely an 'action' movie (okay, there's a beautifully-woven romance element in there, but it's not central to the overall story). And, normally when I watch a blatant all out action film, I assume that the – primary – audience would be the lads. However, Speed is actually a film that's so good it's probably quite watchable even if you're not really into explosions and car chases.Speed's primary selling point is its simplicity. The story is hardly complicated and yet so original that it's amazing that it's never been done before. A mad bomber places an explosive device on a Los Angeles passenger bus and, if it slows down to less than fifty miles an hour, the bomb detonates. That's pretty much it for the majority of the film – the bus ride. And it's a hell of a ride to say the least.And then there's the cast. Poor ol' Keanu Reeves sometimes get a little flack for his acting abilities. However, he's on top form here as the no-nonsense cop who's determined to save the passengers and bring down the bomber at the same time. I always remember one of the reasons 'Die Hard' is also regarded as a classic action film – because the relationship between the hero and the villain is at the forefront of the story. Here, we have Dennis Hopper as the bomber who's always one step ahead of the police. Thanks to mobile phones he's in constant contact with Keanu, reminding him how the police are going to fail. Of course it wouldn't be complete without the obligatory 'love interest.' Granted Sandra Bullock was sort of well-known from Demolition Man the year before this, but Speed was definitely her break-through performance.Like I said, Speed is timeless and one of the most accessible, watchable movies ever made in its genre. It really does have everything you could ever want if you're looking for an all out thrill-ride – it's primarily fast, but also contains moments of genuine heart and sadness (let's just say the path of the righteous doesn't always run smoothly). It's just a shame that lightning obviously wasn't able to strike twice (and by that I'm talking about the – sadly – inferior 'Speed 2').",10,2,4,27 January 2015
Live Free or Die Hard," John McClane in the MCU
","Okay, so my title is a little bit misleading - Bruce Willis' tough-talking, no-nonsense New York cop will never fight Thanos alongside Captain America and Iron Man. The reason I mentioned Marvel movies is because I always see 'Die Hard 4.0' as a 'superhero movie.' The original 'Die Hard' film was about an ordinary man who was flawed and just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When terrorists took over a large building, he was the only one who could stop them. It's wasn't just an action film, but a tense, claustrophobic thriller. However, as the sequels piled in, the action got more and more overblown and it became less 'Die Hard' and more 'Die Impossible.' In short, it's probably easier to kill the entire Avengers line-up than one - supposedly normal - human. Now, that may be a criticism, but then I quite like Marvel superhero movies, so I just go with it.Sometimes 'Die Hard 4.0' is also known as 'Live Free or Die Hard.' If you're wondering what that means then don't expect an answer here. It simply marks the beginning of the film-makers' desire to start naming the films using 'cool-sounding' phrases that don't actually make any sense. Therefore, I prefer 'Die Hard 4.0' (what followed, aka 'A Good Day to Die Hard' is even less fathomable!).This time round poor ol' McClane simply gets a call to escort a young man to the FBI one night. This results in him (eventually) destroying a helicopter with a car and taking out an American fighter jet while armed only with a truck. Yes, the 'Die Hard' franchise has progressed to that from one man with a gun and no shoes. Therefore, if you're willing to accept this mega change in the way the story is told, you'll have an absolute blast. I see this film more like a Bond film (pre Daniel Craig, of course), rather than a super-serious, ultra-realistic spy-thriller (ala Bourne). It's got so much overblown action that it's the perfect film to watch while munching popcorn (if anyone still eats popcorn at home while watching various popular online streaming services).The trick is simply to suspend all disbelief to enjoy this. You'll have to just accept that Bruce Willis is - once again - in the wrong place at the wrong time (possibly making him the unluckiest man alive in the process!). You'll also have to accept how a bunch of cyber-terrorists trying to bring down the American economy also directly happens to threaten McClane's daughter (after his wife was put in the firing line in the first two and his son in the - next - fifth instalment). And, if you can do that and put up with Bruce Willis' trademark smirk and array of one-liners, then you should have a lot of fun in this. Big. Dumb. Fun. Besides, it's a worthy of Oscars if you compare it to what came next in Russia alongside Jai Courtney.",8,1,1,28 September 2018
X2: X-Men United," X-tremely good sequel
","I was never that much of a fan of the original X-men movie, not that I'm a die-hard comic book fan of the source material; I just thought it could have been better. Luckily, X-men 2 (or 'X2' as it's sometimes known) is that rarest of breeds – a sequel that actually surpasses its predecessor.For the few of you that don't know, the X-men are a bunch of superheroes (or 'mutants' as is the term here), naturally each having his or her own superpower. And, whereas the nice of our mutated friends hang out at 'Professor X's' 'school for the gifted,' those less keen on helping mankind are part of Magneto's 'Brotherhood.' Naturally, the two groups have a tendency to square off from time to time and anyone like me, i.e. not a superpower to my name, does tend to get caught in the middle.Therefore the President of America isn't too keen on his voters being fried to a crisp with some sort of mutant 'mind-ray' and enlists the help of one slightly psychotic general (Stryker) to come up with a plan to get rid of all mutants – good or bad. This, in turn, means that the X-men have to team up with the Brotherhood in order to save their collective skins. So, you have a nicely uneasy alliance formed (which you basically know won't last, but it's still fun to watch).And it's generally a great adventure to watch. If you're generally into superhero movies then you've probably seen the 'Marvel' films. It's worth noting that X-men does have a flavour of its own and, despite being taken from the same comic universe, feels different enough to make it stand out in its own right. Its tone is overall darker than the films of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but, unlike Marvel's heroes, the X-men has to concentrate on more characters at once.It's an 'ensemble' cast, with many famous faces playing the leads. Therefore not all the X-men really get as much screen time as the probably deserve. Yes, there are a few 'lesser' mutants who don't really matter, but equally most of the cast would probably be able to carry an entire film of their own (not just Wolverine, the fans' favourite who spawned an entire franchise of his own). Yes, (the many) fans of Wolverine will be happiest, as he's clearly the star, but Sir Ian McKellen gets a decent crack of the whip as the leader of the Brotherhood.One misfire was 'Nightcrawler.' I do actually remember him from the comics as a creepy-looking good guy who basically looked like a monster/vampire. I always pictured him a dark and hulking presence, brooding silently and basically playing the part of the anti-hero. However, he's sort of more the 'comic relief' of the film, always jabbering on like a blue-faced Jar Jar Binks. Luckily, like many of the lesser mutants, he's not in it that much, but he could have been so much cooler than he is (my opinion!).So, all in all, if you like your superhero movies and enjoy them with a darker flavour than your average Marvel epic, give this one a go. If you're well into your X-men comics, it might be worth checking the cast list to see how much your favourite character is in it – even a big film like X2 can't cater for every mutant!",9,0,1,3 February 2015
Thor: The Dark World," By Asgard this is fun!
","If you haven't seen one of the recent crop of 'Marvel comic book movies' then 'Thor: The Dark World' is probably a bit of an odd place to start. So, assuming you've already enjoyed anything from Thor 1 to Iron Man 3, then you'll probably enjoy this, too. It follows the whole 'Marvel superhero formula' pretty closely and, if I'm being harsh, doesn't really bring anything new to the table. However, when a movie is this much fun, a lack of originality isn't that much of a problem.It's a fun, action-packed romp and, even if you haven't seen the first one (or any other Marvel film of late) then, as long as you understand the basic concept of 'good vs evil' then you should have no problem picking up on what's happening.Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Tom Hiddleston is equally great as Thor's nemesis 'Loki' and the rest of the cast all play their parts well, too.So, all you need is a big bucket of popcorn and an hour and forty-four minutes to kill and you should enjoy some seriously fun 'hammer time.' Oh, and don't forget about no less that TWO 'secret' scenes hidden within the credits. 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' here we come!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,1,29 June 2014
Lucy," Hardly highbrow, but enjoyable enough
","'Silly, silly, silly.' So said 'Graham Chapman' in Monty Python. And that's about the best summing up I can give 'Lucy.' It's completely daft and hardly intellectually stimulating, but – what the hell – sometimes you don't want films that make you think. You just want mindless entertaining fun. And Lucy does the job.Scarlett Johansson plays the titular 'Lucy' – an average sort of girl who ends up accidentally being given a powerful new drug which allows her to use powers no human has ever had before. And, like I say, it's a fun film to watch. It's not perfect though. It starts off a bit 'arty.' There are clips of various 'unrelated' events (like a cheetah catching its prey) interspersed with the main narrative. But these sort of get dropped about half way through the film, leaving you to wonder why they were included to begin with.While Lucy is busy killing those responsible for her new powers, we also have Morgan Freeman – the scientist who just so happens to be an expert on 'expanded brainpower.' His story sort of runs in parallel with hers, although he's basically there to explain what's going on (in the final scene he almost completely 'narrates' the action – it's quite funny!). He tells us that the average human uses about 10% of his/her brain. Lucy is on her way to use all 100%.Expect killing. Expect kind of cool action scenes with Lucy using her superpowers to destroy all those who wronged her. There's a bit of science thrown in there, courtesy of Morgan Freeman to add a few concepts that might make you think. But it's not a long film. It's pretty condensed and everything flows from A-B quite nicely.Basically, the film is about how humans only need about 10% of their brains to function. And you certainly won't need any more than that to understand and appreciate Lucy. Grab the munchies, allocate about 8% of your brain to the film and just enjoy.",7,1,5,29 March 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Not my sort of film - apologies to the masses
","I feel terrible writing this review. I've checked out other people's and have come to the conclusion they must see things I don't. The majority of reviews give Moonrise Kingdom 4-5 stars. Maybe I need to watch it again.In short, I found it boring. Although that's not to say I didn't appreciate much about it. First of all it certainly has a style of its own. The way every shot has been filmed almost puts it in the 'arthouse' category (or at least over much of contemporary Hollywood's output). It is indeed beautiful to watch. Plus the music is perfectly fitting at recreating the innocent era of childhood in the sixties. The cast too deserve a special mention for gathering such a talented group of actors together for a story of grown ups on an island tracking down two starcrossed teenage lovers who have run away together.So, despite all that positive, I still found it boring.I like to think I don't only watch films with car crashes, giant monsters and Michael Bay. Quirky is good. Quirky, well-filmed and with a great cast is even better. I just found the story the biggest let down. Simply boring.So, apologies to all those who loved it. I really wanted to be with you on this. Maybe I'll watch it again in a few years and wonder why I wrote this? http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",4,33,47,14 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is still pretty strong with this one
","Whether (or rather how much) you will like the latest Star Wars instalment (Episode VII: The Force Awakens) will largely depend on how old you are or how much you liked the original. A lot of people hated the 'prequels.' I did, too. But then I was born the year the first Star Wars came out and grew up through the eighties on the exploits of Han, Luke and Leia. Therefore, when episodes I, II and III came out, they really couldn't live up to the originals. I felt – like many – that they relied too much on computer special effects and the characters were just two dimensional.At least the prequels suitably lowered my expectations for what would come after the films I loved. I'll say that now I've seen Episode VII I'm actually quite pleased (or rather relieved that what came next wasn't as bad as what came before).A lot of people are calling Episode VII a 'soft reboot.' That's largely because it follows what could be described as the original film's 'formula.' Yes, there is certainly a feeling of de ja vu, but then when it's based on Star Wars, is that such a bad thing? Again, it's at least better than the prequels. It's set thirty or so years after Return of the Jedi and we see where the Rebellion versus the Empire has gone. What makes this better than the prequels is that it introduces new characters and links them (relatively seamlessly) with the old ones we know and love. Plus there's not as much CGI effects, or what there is blends better with the story and isn't as noticeable.The new characters have more of a job. They're young and naturally not as at ease with a project of this scale, but they do their best. A few people have criticised them for their acting shortcomings, but I'm hopeful they'll get better as the story goes on. Luckily, the 'old guard' is on hand to help out. Special mention to Harrison Ford who steps effortlessly back into the role of Han Solo. A lot of people feared it would be Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull all over again, but the smuggler's still got it where it counts (and Chewie is pretty cool, too).Episode VII will appeal to the kids of today. There are enough lightsabre-wielding role models for them to imitate in school playgrounds up and down the country and adults – like me – who grew up with the originals, should like it because it reminds them of what they once loved.It's not perfect. It has its flaws. But then didn't the original trilogy? Who can forget loving the Ewoks when they were five years old, but now we see a bunch of teddy bears defeating the Emperor's best Stormtroopers, we do tend to roll our eyes. So, if you can see past the hype and that it's actually a pretty decent attempt at recreating the magic of the originals, while at the same time not setting out to rip it to pieces, then you should definitely give it a go. Even the roly-poly droid BB8 wasn't as annoying as I thought he'd be (based on what I saw in the trailers!).",9,1,10,3 January 2016
RED," Die Hard with a walking stick
","I don't know why I feel so 'dirty' watching 'Red.' Deep down I know it's hardly Shakespeare and I should never rate it more than a 2/5. However, there's something oddly satisfying from watching a load of old actors go crazy with guns and take out wave after wave of trained henchmen like they were immortal. 'Red' is effectively an action-thriller, with a healthy dose of 'Bourne-like' spy-movie thrown in there. Bruce Willis plays a retired John McClane (not really, but he might as well – effectively a retired CIA killer) who, something, something, something, ends up on the run with a woman he's been flirting with over the phone. Naturally, there's hired government killers on his trail at every turn and he must fight for survival every step of the way while he desperately tries to prove his innocence. Think that plot synopsis sounds familiar? Well, it does. It's basically the same as every other recent (Bourne clone) spy movie made in the last few years. It's nothing new, but it is fun.I guess you could say that it's a bit of a gimmick having the lead being an 'elderly' balding (sorry Bruce!) hero, as opposed to a young man with a nice tan and full head of hair on the run. In fact it is the 'age factor' that is this film's only real selling point. Bruce doesn't go it alone, he's helped out by an aging John Malkovich, an aging Morgan Freeman and an aging Helen Mirran – all of which are quite capable to murdering any young, highly-trained upstart who gets in their way. And, yes, it is fun to see them in action.Despite the serious subject matter of death at every turn, the film never even attempts to take itself seriously. It knows it's daft and over the top and that's its main saving grace. If it tried to make us think that a bunch of senior citizens could really do all this then it would be ridiculous. However, throughout all the car chases and shootouts it almost parodies itself.If you like your action movies fun (like pre Daniel Craig Bond) then you should appreciate this, plus if you're a fan of Bruce Willis doing what he does best, or just want to see Helen Mirren wield a sniper's rifle, then you should definitely enjoy this. The plot is simple, Karl Urban is kind of wasted as the film's primary antagonist, hell bent on Willis' capture/death, but he's a nice addition anyway. Just don't think too deeply about why an older man still has to have a considerably younger love interest at his side!",7,0,0,4 October 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The conclusion of 'epic'
","It's hard to imagine that anyone would join 'The Lord of the Rings' saga so late in its on-screen life, so if you've never heard of this tale (there must be at least one of you!) then I suggest you begin with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and take it from there. However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').Maybe it's because the source material (J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of novels) has already been written that the concluding chapter is so good. Many stories start out with much promise and tend to die off (see the last series of 'Game of Thrones!'). Luckily, this doesn't happen here. Everything and everyone that made the saga great comes together and gives the audience the perfect ending that they deserve.Yes, purists of the book may argue about the odd creative liberty here and there which has been taken when transferring it to the big screen, but, more often than not, everything lands where it should. Re-watching the trilogy today (nearly twenty years after its release) I noticed that some of the special effects in the first film ('Fellowship') didn't look quite so good as they did at the time (i.e. more green screen-ish), yet this final chapter seems as perfect as it was in its day.There are so many fine performances in 'Return of the King' that it's hard to pick a favourite. In the first two movies I always preferred the human characters, such as Gandalf and Aragorn (and, of course, the computer-generated Gollum in 'The Two Towers'). Yet now, I really felt more of a connection to the two hobbits - Frodo and Sam. Following their journey I really did get a sense of how much they'd suffered here - a rare feat nowadays when so many on-screen heroes seem to be able to absorb inhuman amounts of punishment with barely a ruffled head of hair (and don't get me started on Disney's 'Star Wars' trilogy).As I said before, you really need to watch the first film to know if you'll truly enjoy its conclusion and, if you do, then 'Return of the King' will certainly not disappoint. It has everything from great character-acting, to excellent special effects and a perfect setting and direction. Not since the ORIGINAL 'Star Wars' trilogy has a set of films come together so spectacularly.",10,1,2,15 January 2020
The Purge," At last a film we can all agree on!
","Let's face it... films are a divisive topic of conversation. I guarantee at least a hundred people will hate your favourite film (and vice versa). However, with 'The Purge' it seems that practically everyone can agree on one thing: the premise for this film is awesome! Set in the near future, America now has an annual twelve hour period where ALL crime is legal (and no emergency services will help out or arrest you). It's certainly an interesting idea. After all... what would you do? Would you barricade yourself in and hope no one tried to steal your telly (or worse - your life), or would you run to the nearest bank with a pickaxe (or find that bloke who cut you up in his car at the traffic lights and have more than just a few strong words)? Sadly, despite its awesome premise, the execution is lacking. Have you seen a 'home invasion' movie? One where the innocent family are tormented by some sort of invading force in their own home. If you have then you've basically seen this movie. The great premise is soon discarded in favour of a family under siege and therefore adds very little to the overall film.It's not so bad. It's short and to the point. It gets the job done and has reasonably good performances all round. If you like home invasion films then you'll probably like this. It's just a shame that the great premise wasn't expanded on a little more. However, a sequel is in the pipeline, so maybe it'll be addressed then (and with the obviously expanded budget).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,2,5 August 2014
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The original (and best)
","Say what you like about the (numerous) sequels that followed 'A Night on Elm Street' (and many people did), but most will agree that this one was a classic horror movie that still stands the test of time. And, if you don't know, it's recently been remade, so you want to make sure you check out the original if you're new to the franchise. The remake was universally despised and critically panned.If you don't know, 'Nightmare' tells the – not particularly nice – story of Freddy Kruger, a child murdered who was burned alive by the parents of his victims. However, you can't keep a good child killer down and he gets supernatural powers which he uses to return to children's dreams, only to despatch them again.The 'Nightmare' films were a little different to your average 'slasher' flick, as you don't just have a masked killer wandering around hacking people to bits one by one (normally after they've just had sex). The 'dream-angle' provides the film-makers with a broader pallet to work with, one where they can be more creative and have fun with the locations. As Freddy only attacks when his victim falls asleep, the landscape is normally individual to the victim and he can manipulate it suitable to 'mess with their heads' before he kills them.Of course, Nightmare wouldn't be Nightmare if it wasn't for Freddy and therefore finding the right actor to play him was paramount to the film's success. Step up Robert Englund. He really makes the film what it is. He's suitably nasty, but strangely fun to watch at the same time.So, if you're into eighties horror, slasher films in general, or just like a film that's genuinely creepy, give this one a go (and for heaven's sake please steer clear of the 2010 remake – despite having an equally great actor to portray Freddy, it's just plain awful).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,0,0,26 August 2014
The Truman Show," Life eventually imitated art?
","I remember hearing the briefest of synopsis of 'The Truman Show' in a film magazine that was promoting the next year's upcoming movies. It just read, 'Jim Carrey discovers he's a character in a TV show.' I have to say that that description hardly blew me away as I didn't know what to make of it. Saying it like that makes it sound much more simple and goofy than it really is. I didn't go and see it when it was theatrically released, but after the positive word of mouth it generated, I felt I had to see it for myself.I can't really sum it up any better. Jim Carrey slowly discovers that the world around him is one giant TV set and he's the (unwitting) star, as cameras have been following his life ever since his birth. It was actually a pretty novel concept back in 1998. 'Big Brother' and various other reality TV shows had not yet taken over our airwaves, making this film quite ahead of its time.Carrey plays, 'Truman Burbank,' a happy-go-lucky fella who slowly starts to realise that there's something very wrong with the world and its inhabitants who exist all around him. From there, he slowly begins to unravel the plot for himself. It's all great fun and you really want to root for Truman to succeed in escaping this 'prison/goldfish bowl' he exists in. Jim Carrey is known for his 'larger than life' characters, but I'm pleased to say that he's dialed it down here and is much less manic than his other outings such as 'The Mask' or 'Ace Ventura.'Not just is it a quirky little drama, but it throws in many a dose of healthy social commentary of society and their obsession with television and the characters they spend their lives watching. However, I doubt that the film-makers ever realised how true to life this would all be with the amount of reality TV shows which were to follow it.Personally, I loved it and - despite it being a bit out of date now - I think it holds up perfectly as a warning of our obsession with TV. For what it's worth, I'll mention my friend's thoughts on it. He didn't like it because he thought it was all too far fetched. He felt that if the cameras had been following Truman since birth (approximately thirty years by the time we join him), that would mean the TV show started around 1968 and, back then, studios didn't have the technology to pull this off. I simply disregarded that as a nit-pick. This film is too good to look that deeply into and risk putting yourself off enjoying the ride.I guess I'll leave it up to its 'tagline' to say it best. 'On Air. Unaware.' Well done to the Marketing man who came up with that one!",9,2,2,6 November 2019
Godzilla," Godzilla really needs to get himself a better agent
","Okay, I can see it from his point of view... if I was a thirty-storey tall lizard, I would accept that I wasn't going to get that many offers from Hollywood producers. It's not like Godzilla could star opposite Jennifer Aniston in a cute, cuddly little romantic comedy. So, when the 'king of monsters' got an offer to star in a Hollywood retelling using his very own name as its title, he must have jumped at the chance (possibly causing a minor earthquake in his city).However, what the poor misguided monster didn't know was that his role in the film was little more than a 'bit part.' The producers probably mentioned that they also had the great Bryan Cranston on board, fresh on the back of his success in 'Breaking Bad.' I don't blame Godzilla for being optimistic. He probably expected to be engaged in numerous deep and emotional scenes with the man who played 'Heisenberg.' Yet it turned out that he was merely duped. The trailer for the film made it look like the two of them would be carrying the film together. How wrong they were.For a start, Cranston isn't in it much as the trailer and marketing would suggest and, secondly, you hardly get to see the monster! The film is two hours long. For the first half an hour we have Bryan Cranston. And, as you'd expect if you've watched Breaking Bad, you'll know he's awesome. He has the drama and screen presence (or at least right kind of manic nuttiness) to hold your attention. Then he goes out of it. So, does the monster take over? Well, not really.We see Godzilla's back. Sometimes we see his thighs (and, yes, he is looking a little 'out of shape' after being off our screens for so long). And occasionally we hear him roar. However, every time he's about to open up a can of whoop-ass on some bad monster, it reminds me of that scene in Reservoir Dogs where Mr Blond tortures a police officer and the camera pans away. This happens every time in Godzilla. As soon as the action starts, the camera cuts to something on the other side of the planet (kind of literally – if the monsters start a fight in Tokyo, the action switches to San Francisco).Yes, the end of the film (and by that I mean the last quarter of an hour of a two hour epic) you get to see the monsters finally get stuck into each other. But, between Bryan Cranston leaving the film and the 'HALO jump' right before the final stand-off, there really isn't much to keep your attention. I sort of get what they were trying to do. I'm sure the producers would call it 'building up tension,' but they take it a little too far. Imagine a Terminator movie where they only had the titular cyborg in it for give minutes. How well would that work? Oh, wait, they did – Terminator: Salvation. And how well did that go down?! I hear they're already thinking of making a sequel to Godzilla. I just hope the titular character gets his representatives to actually negotiate more screen time for the poor guy.",5,4,7,11 January 2015
Looper," Wow - actually pretty good
","I've seen so many films now, half of them I manage to turn off around the half hour mark. Sometimes I think I've seen every different monster and every different car chase. Then something like Looper comes along and restores my faith in Hollywood.It's about time travel. Therefore you can look up on the internet message boards threads about the major plot holes with the mechanics of time travel in general. They use words like 'paradox' and things like that. Basically, they're saying that the movie doesn't work scientifically. Well, if put to the test, it probably doesn't. But then nor does any time travel movie. So, if you can suspend your disbelief and like some slick sci-fi action, you should enjoy this.In the future, they time travel. And those crafty futuristic criminals are only sending their 'hit' victims back in time to be executed and disposed of (by assassins called 'Loopers'). This prevents the future authorities from ever linking the future criminals to their murders. Clever, huh? Well, nearly. Because Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of those Loopers and his 'victim' sent back in time for him to neatly kill and dispose of, is only him! Or rather Bruce Willis, who is apparently what Joseph Gordon-Levitt will look like in about forty years time. But, Bruce Willis has no intention of just taking the traditional bullet to the head. He has his own agenda. And it involves escape and killing many people along the way. Why? You'll have to watch the film to find out.It's well written. Special acting points to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for mimicking all of Bruce's little quirks and mannerisms in order to portray his younger incarnation. Plus full marks for finding a really dark and menacing kid who flits between sweet and psychotic (I think this is how young Anakin Skywalker should have been cast in Episode I, but never mind - too late now).Basically, Looper is a lot of well-written, well-performed mind-bending time travelling fun. Yes, it may have some plot holes if you really want to dig deep enough, but there's so much good here, it well and truly overshadows the bad.",8,0,2,4 November 2014
50_50," Not a comedy, but not bad either
","50/50 is about a man, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who discovers he has cancer and only has a 50/50 chance of surviving.The fact that his best friend, played by Seth Rogen, takes a prevalent place at his side on all advertising, might make people think that this is a comedy. It isn't. Sure, it has its lighter moments, but, ultimately, it's a drama. And it's quite a good one too.Cancer is affecting more and more people and the more the media can do to raise awareness is a good thing (my humble opinion). I watched Weeds (granted a comedy through and through) and a character got cancer in that and was basically better a few episodes later.50/50 tries to show, as best a light-hearted film can, about how cancer can affect relationships. It's not totally dark and nasty, as many cancer sufferers can sadly relate to. It tries to appeal to a wider audience.If you want something a bit serious, I'd recommend this (only the TV series Breaking Bad has dealt with cancer better in my opinion).",7,0,0,14 February 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Just like Twilight (only joking... thankfully)
","A film about vampires. My first thought – oh... another one – great. Add the fact that it's a 'mockumentary' i.e. a spoof documentary filmed in a 'fly-on-the-wall' kind of fashion. My first thought – oh, another one – great.Yes, there is truly nothing original about 'What We Do in the Shadows' – a spoof documentary, charting the lives of four ancient vampires, currently flat-sharing in modern day New Zealand. Perhaps the generally lack of originality was what made me watch it with such low expectations. In any case... I was more than pleasantly surprised.It was actually really good. In short... it was funny. It takes a lot for a 'comedy' film to actually make me laugh and this one pulled it off. Yes, there's absolutely nothing 'idea-wise' that we haven't seen before, but with a sharp, satirical script, that doesn't matter. It's just such a daft, fun film that anyone who has a love of the horror/vampire genre will definitely enjoy it. You do need to know a little bit in general about vampire films. Naturally, there are more than a few jokes based on the general Dracula legend that might go over your head if you haven't seen the film or read the book.Yes, most of the vampires are pretty stereotypical (for undead blood-suckers) and you should recognise their 'types' among the genre. But, as I say, it's simply the comedy that saves this film from potentially being just mediocre.If you enjoy your horror/vampire yarns, relax your brain and put this one. It really is simply amusing.

Deadpool," The greatest movie apology ever
","Deadpool, if you casually dip in and out of the comic genre, is a superhero. You may have heard the name somewhere on screen before, but probably forgotten. However, if you know your comics then you probably salivated at the prospect of seeing the 'merc with a mouth' going toe to toe with Wolverine in the X-man's 'origins' movie. Then you watched it and uttered words that no self-respecting spell checker should let me type.Basically, the makers of Wolverine: Origins completely messed up (putting it mildly) and the fans were not amused. Yes, Ryan Reynolds was actually a pretty good choice for the gobby anti-hero, but then they pretty much cellotaped his mouth shut and completely reinvented his character in the worst way possible. It actually makes a nice change to see a studio admit they totally got it wrong and do something about it (even if the decision is largely governed by money!).And that could have been that. However, luckily Mr Reynolds himself campaigned to bring a truer representation of the source material to the big screen. And, amazingly, it happened. And I'm so glad it did.Deadpool, is a superhero movie. You probably guessed that – you have the man in a mask who you pretty much know is going to go out there and beat the baddies and save the girl, yadder, yadder, yadder... However, what Deadpool also is, is a comedy. That being said – it's NOT a spoof. It's a tongue-in-cheek little number which has better action scenes than most action films and better comedy than most comedy films.I'm almost tempted to say that it's a film that anyone can enjoy. I can certainly see both men and women having a good time watching it. However, it definitely is a film for MEN and WOMEN. Whereas Marvel's current cinematic universe is kind of geared at kids (and us kids who never grew up) there is plenty in Deadpool that no parent will want to explain to their little darling. Again, don't let that fool you into thinking that it's all toilet humour – let's just call it 'adult' humour and leave it at that.Basically, Deadpool is great. Ryan Reynolds is mouthy, but never annoying and totally owns the role (as it should be when he plays the titular character). The supporting cast all do their bit, but it's Deadpool himself all the way. Please let this be the start of a franchise. It's probably a little too much to expect to see him crossing studio picket lines and ending up in the Marvel universe where he – truly – belongs, but we can always hope. If nothing else, I'm well up for a 'Deadpool 2' outing.",9,5,16,11 February 2016
300," These men eat Yorkie bars
","If you're thinking of watching '300' then be prepare for some of the manliest macho men ever to move their muscles.It's an action movie. I'm almost tempted to say it would probably be enjoyed by 'men only' if it wasn't for the fact that numerous female friends of mine also love it (only for completely different reasons).If you're a guy, you'll love the epic (and 'uber-cool') stylised fight scenes. If you're a girl... well, there are numerous men who don't wear that many clothes and make me feel terribly inadequate.It's about those - unsung cinematic bad-guys - the Persians. They only decide to pick a fight with Greece (or, the Spartans, to be precise). But Sparta - despite boasting how they train their men to fight from birth - have suddenly discovered their sensitive side and refuse to fight. But, luckily, they have a semi-Scottish king (Gerard Butler) who is well up for a scrap - any time, anywhere. And so he leads 300 of his finest drinking buddies and promises them death or glory (or just death, but they don't seem to care).What follows is nearly an hour and a half of some of the most stylish violence even committed to the silver screen.And it's enormous fun - silly fun, but still enormous fun. The whole film (despite originally having some roots in an ancient Greek legend), was based on a comic book. If this did ever happen (and some say it did), I doubt the Spartans were faced with mutant rhinos, giants, ninjas, wizards and time-travelling cyborgs from the future (I might have made that last one up). However, this is an action film and who cares about factual accuracies here? This film is not realistic and it's not meant to be. It's meant to be fun. And it is. Enjoy... for SPARTA!",8,1,3,20 October 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A new kind of spy movie
","If you said that 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was like a 'Bond film' then you'd only be partly right. Yes, it's a 'spy movie,' yes you have a 'super villain' trying to basically take over the world and, yes, you have a 'gentleman spy' ready and waiting to stop him. Yet, for all its 'Bond-like' traits, I just can't really liken Kingsman to a Bond movie. It's not better or worse, just a different beast altogether.It's different because – unlike Bond – it doesn't just concentrate on one area of the spy genre. Our gentleman spy in question is played expertly by Colin Firth and, if the film-makers had chosen to do so, they could have easily concentrated on his efforts to stop our (lisping!) super villain, Samuel L Jackson, from getting away with his dastardly plans. However, like I say, that's only part of the story. Mr Firth, Colin Firth, decides to take on a protégé in the form of a young lad from the rough end of London and train him up in the ways of the Force (in Star Wars terms, anyway). So, not only do we have a spy movie, but with a large helping of teenage coming-of-age thrown in there (oh, and the obligatory teenage romance to satisfy the 'Twilight generation'). Now, if you're already picking up on my distain for twinkling vampires and schoolgirls who don't seem able to smile or close their mouths, then you're probably right. I'm not a fan of teenage love stories and Kingsman could quite easily have fallen down here in my estimation. However, luckily, it's not the case and the 'teenage element' is actually done pretty well and hopefully won't alienate too many of the older generation (like me, for example).I won't go into too many details about the plot. If you've seen one Bond film (or any other spy movie worth its name) then you'll know. The plot isn't important, only that you know that it's done very well. And, I should mention a special nod to the 'action scenes.' I'm not entirely sure how they're done, but they're damn awesome and stylishly put together.If you like the slightly tongue-in-cheekness of old 'pre-Daniel Craig' Bond then you should enjoy Kingsman. It has decent performances, stylish action, over-the-top baddies (seriously... a woman with giant razor blades for legs has to be straight out of the Dr No era!) and even a touch of humanity and uplifting character development. A surprise package.",9,5,10,28 August 2015
Cube," Good horror doesn't need a big budget
","From what I can tell of the other online reviews for 'Cube,' it's one of those films that you'll either love or hate. Personally, I absolutely loved it from the first time I saw it and have subsequently seen it many times since. I guess I can understand people not really getting behind it. It's hardly a rollercoaster or a thrill ride with hordes of brilliantly computer-generated monsters ripping people apart. Although it is pretty horrific - you just have to think it through.Six strangers wake up inside, what is technically, one giant Rubik's Cube. However, this one doesn't just take half your life getting one piece of blue square out of an entire side of red - this one has lethal traps inside which can do anything from melt your face, to completely dicing you all together. How did they get there? They don't know. All they know is that there's no food or water on hand, therefore they better figure out how to get out of there before they starve to death (and so rob the traps of the honour of killing them).And that's about it. It's a simple (and highly condensed/claustrophobic) little tale with no real major set-pieces (the cube is technically the same one room, endlessly repeated - only in different colours), no recognisable stars, few special effects and - possibly most importantly - few (if any!) answers to the questions raised.Like I say, I personally love it. I find it as tense now as I did when I first watched it (even though I know what happens to everyone!). Yes, I know the lack of 'star-power' does actually mean that some of the actors deliver their lines a bit poorly, but I forgive it on account of the fact that it clearly doesn't have that much of a budget and yet it still was able to pull together something that is truly memorable.If you want something big budget and exciting, this is definitely not for you. However, if you're looking for something small, tense, creepy and downright scary if you think about putting yourself in any of the protagonists' situation and work out how you might survive in such a foreign situation, then definitely give this one a go. It's not a 'cult classic' for nothing.",10,1,2,17 April 2019
The Hangover Part III," Probably should have left it at number two
","It goes without saying that 'The Hangover' (part I) was a great film. Its sequel (part II) was met with a mixed reception (personally, I quite liked it, while thinking it wasn't quite as good as the first one). However, now with Part III, they really seem to be dragging something out simply to make money.The sad fact: Part III just isn't that funny. There simply aren't enough jokes in there to warrant calling it a 'comedy.' Other people have noted how they've 'changed the formula' with this one, i.e. there's no actual hangover in this one where the cast wake up, not knowing what they did the night before and having to piece together the clues. Of course if Part III HAD followed this rule, everyone would be saying that it was just a second copy of the original, so the film-makers probably couldn't win either way.Also, coupled with Part III being a little low on jokes, Zach Galifianakis' character 'Alan' has completed changed since the last two movies. Before, he used to be a lovable, but dumb sort. Now he's a complete idiot (and not a very nice one at that), leaving us finding it much harder to root for him during this third outing.However, whether you notice, or are that bothered by, the change in his character, it doesn't make much difference to the script, i.e. it's still short on jokes. Yes, the movie is watchable and short enough not to make me think I'd wasted an hour and a half of my life, but, when you compare it to Part I, it's noticeable how far it's fallen.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,0,1,21 June 2014
Fantastic Four," The 'Just About Okay' Four
","Yeah, you heard the general consensus regarding 'The Fantastic Four's' first major big screen outing. Most people hated it. I didn't hate it, but I'm not warming to it with time. When I first saw it in the cinema I thought it was 'just about okay.' Now I've watched it again on DVD a couple of years over time I'm sticking to my original verdict.In fact, one of its problems is the rest of the 'Marvel' movies. Since 2005 we've been treated to the whole 'expanded universe' where all the Marvel superheroes pop in and out of each other's films. And, it's safe to say that most people like all that (plus Avengers etc). So, basically the current way of doing superhero films is miles above what 20th Century Fox tried back in 2005.The cast isn't really the problem. Even if some of them did get some stick for their portrayals of the characters, I didn't find any of them a problem. They all looked the part to me. However, the problem I had with the movie is that it never really gets going. It's not a long film (only an hour and a half) and, despite getting their superpowers early on, the four central characters don't really do that much with them until literally the final few minutes. I thought this when I first watched it in the cinema, but it wasn't until I saw it again on DVD that I was able to time exactly when the film actually 'got going' (in my opinion). It was about at 1h 20 minutes (out of an hour and a half!). That's when the superheroes finally come together like I was expecting them to and fight Dr Doom.Oh yes... Dr Doom. I mentioned that the casting wasn't that bad. I was referring to the Four. Dr Doom is pretty unspectacular and not that evil. And they only gang up on him at the end, making the whole film seem like a prequel that could have been told in about twenty minutes until the story starts properly.All in all, The Fantastic Four will always be classed as a 'missed opportunity.' Yes, it's already being 'rebooted' and die-hard fans are hoping that Fox will get the formula right this time. Although... rumour has it that the writers are already changing HOW the Four got their powers. Therefore I'm not holding my breath!",6,2,5,5 January 2015
Click," Sadler's best effort
","Yes, that's not saying much. Adam Sadler hardly deals in 'high-brow' comedies. And, basically, this isn't one either. However, it does easily kill an hour and a half.It's a 'one-joke' movie. Sadly is given a magical remote control which can pause, rewind and fast-forward time (and much, much more). This, therefore, leads him into all sorts of trouble.Luckily, Sadly is surrounded by a talented cast which frequently take the pressure off him to be the film's sole attraction. Christopher Walken is - as you might expect - excellent as the man who gives him the remote (and frequently pops up throughout the movie).There's not a lot of 'meat' to this movie - it's just one to munch popcorn to. Personally, I would have preferred if the film ended about ten minutes before it did - but that's just me being cynical - you'll have to judge for yourself.It's nothing perfect, but then it has Adam Sadler in, so what are you expecting? If it's watchable, it's definitely one of his best (I'm still reeling from forcing myself to sit through twenty minutes of 'Jack and Jill.')",7,1,2,25 October 2014
Pineapple Express," Sometimes you just don't get it
","I'm writing this review after my second viewing if 'Pineapple Express.' I watched it a couple of years ago and seemed to completely forget what it was all about. The reason I've watched it again is because I'm a big fan of Seth Rogen (and Judd Apatow's style of film-making in general), plus I'm not bothered by the fact that a film can be about losers/stoners. Therefore, I really thought I must have missed something on my first viewing.Sadly, as far as I'm concerned, I wasn't wrong. This film really isn't very good. And, when I say 'good,' I basically mean funny. I laughed about once (out loud) throughout the whole hour and forty minutes (which us unusual when I watch a Rogen/Apatow collaboration). No matter how much I tried, I just couldn't 'get' it. It's about two pot-smoking stoners who end up getting chased by killers/drug dealers. However, the 'chase' largely involves Seth Rogen and James Franco screaming a lot and then running round in circles (occasionally slapping each other/someone else).Again, my verdict is simply that it's not funny. The two central characters are annoying and not that relatable to, therefore I don't really care that much if the mob catches up with them and kills them, or they just get away.So, that's my verdict – Pineapple Express is an average 'comedy' at best. However, it's worth noting that the majority of people must have seen something in it that I've missed, as it's (currently) rated a pretty impressive 7.0 out of 10 on the Internet Movie Database. Guess I'm in the minority here on this one then.",5,4,8,27 June 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," Keanu shoots more people
","Would it be harsh if I said that many people were actually quite surprised at how good the first 'John Wick' film was? Keanu Reeves' star seems to have waned over recent years and he's hardly the A-lister he once was. However, with such success of the first outing, I guess a sequel was guaranteed. I eagerly sat down to watch 'part 2,' but somehow I didn't feel that lightning has struck twice.The first time round the - seemingly indestructible - titular assassin went on a murderous rampage of revenge because some hoods killed his dog (no, seriously - that's the kind of 'character motivation' we deal with in these films!). This time round, some baddies only go and total his car. Guess what... John Wick doesn't just call his insurance company and hire a rental car until the garage can knock the dents out. He gets pretty much gather every gun not already used by Schwarzenegger and starts shooting people.And he does shoot a lot of people. He travels from one location getting surrounded by baddies who can't really shoot straight (I believe this is now technically called 'Stormtrooper aim') and, if any do manage to scratch him, bullets only seem to graze him slightly. Then he shoots more people in a different setting.And that's about it really. As much as I do enjoy action scenes (some of the shoot-outs in 'The Matrix' were literally revolutionary and nothing had ever been seen like it before in cinema) here it was literally Keanu shooting people. If a film's main selling point is its action, I'd like to see something a bit more original. I know most fans of the genre will probably have seen every hero blast every type of gun in every type of location known to man, but, even now, there are still ways of coming up with something new (think of how the action is portrayed in recent films like 'Kingsman, Shoot 'em Up' and 'Upgrade'). Here, it's just shooting people.At the end of the day, 'John Wick 2' isn't a bad film. I didn't hate it. I just was hoping for something a little more than one generic shoot out after the next. I felt his car 'died' for nothing here.",6,0,1,16 April 2019
Annihilation," Interesting, high-concept sci-fi
","'Annihilation' is certainly an interesting film. Not just because it's a sci-fi flick that does more than just pit humans against monsters (or some other tired and unoriginal premise), but because it also takes a snapshot of the film industry today. Apparently, the film was released in America and didn't do too well at the Box Office. Therefore, it's now been released on Netflix and suddenly it's a hit. This is great news for Netflix (and I guess the film company who made it?) that their film is gathering such unexpected momentum, but it does ask the question whether many companies will bother releasing films to the cinema when they do so well on the (new) small screen?Anyway, another reason why the Netflix audience got so excited at 'Annihilation's arrival on their platform was that it stars Hollywood heavyweights Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaacs (and, no offense to Will Smith, but I'm guessing you could say that they're the - current - 'biggest' names to ever go (almost) straight to that platform). So why did the film end up there?As I said, it's science-fiction, so that already makes it a 'niche' genre which doesn't always guarantee that the film will be bankable ('Star Wars' franchise excluded!) and it's not all out action. A large bubble of weirdness (known in the film as 'the shimmer') appears in America, swallowing up the land mass it's landed on. No one knows what it is, where it's come from and every attempt to send a team in has produced no returns. Therefore, when biologist Natalie Portman's soldier husband (Oscar Isaacs) becomes the first and only man to return from this place, only as a shadow of his former self, she decides to become part of an all-woman team to find out what happened in there.Now, don't get me wrong, just because this has a few more 'higher sci-fi concepts' than your average action flick, doesn't mean there aren't the odd shoot-out or monster, so don't worry, it's not constant talking all the way through. The five ladies have to use their machine guns as well as their minds in order to navigate what waits for them inside the shimmer. That's all I'll say about the plot, as there are plenty of interesting moments that you may not see coming. I've seen some criticism online about how it's 'too hard to understand.' It's not. It's actually pretty straightforward, however the ending is a little 'interpretational' and I couldn't help but think of '2001: A Space Odyssey' when looking for a comparison.It's written by Alex garland, who's most famous for his other 'thinking' sci-fi film 'Ex Machina.' I think if you enjoyed that you should appreciate this (even if they're not much alike!). The special effects are reasonable. Obviously with sci-fi if you're looking to create a world truly unlike our own, you're going to have to employ the use of CGI. Mostly it worked, some times it looked a little too 'Phantom Menace' if you know what I mean. If you've seen either Natalie Portman or Oscar Isaacs in anything latterly, you'll know their acting is top notch, so it's always worth watching for them. Don't expect an action epic, but, if you're a fan of slightly slower, more deeper science fiction then you should definitely give this one a watch - especially as now you don't even have to queue at the multiplex to see it!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,2,16 March 2018
Jackie Brown," Waited fifteen years for a second viewing
","I first watched Jackie Brown when it came out in the cinema back in 1997. And, like so many people at the time, I was unimpressed. I fell into that large group of people who felt it wasn't up to the violent/gory standards of Reservoir Dogs or the cleverly made-up standards of Pulp Fiction.Now, fifteen years later, I decided to watch it again and see if my opinion has changed. Now I'm not so blown away with the great Pulp Fiction, I thought I might be less biased.Sadly, my opinion hasn't changed that much.This time I was able to look at it as a stand-alone film, not just 'Pulp Fiction 2,' yet, unfortunately, I still found it sub-standard.It's two and a half hours long. And, for quite a lot of time, it really feels like it. Samuel L Jackson plays a similar (if not as cool/likable) character as his one in Pulp Fiction and does his best to carry the show. Robert DeNiro is obviously a great actor of the modern age, yet he doesn't seem to come alive at all. He mainly sits on the sofa looking like someone who's come on his own to a nightclub and doesn't know whether he should leave or not. (despite participating in the film's really only shocking and unexpected moment of the film). Plus the film's titular character, Pam Grier, is as good as she can be and Bridget Fonda makes good eye candy for the lads! The major gripe I have with the film is its constant use of over-wordy dialogue for scenes. Yes, we get to know the characters well through how they interact with each other, but it's just too much. Each scene is dragged out for longer than it feels like it needs to be.Sometimes films are re-released as a 'director's cut' with added material. Jackie Brown is one film I'd like to see a director's cut of which has been trimmed down to a shorter run-time.Jackie Brown is not Pulp Fiction. It doesn't try to be. It does win points for staking a claim to being a film in its own right. However, the fact remains is that it just isn't as good as anything Quentin Tarrantino has done before it, or since.I'm glad I gave it a second viewing. Even though now I doubt I'll ever watch it again (even in another fifteen years time), I didn't feel like I'd completely wasted the two and a half hours of my life. I just felt that there are better gangster-style films of the genre than this, despite its impressive ensemble cast.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6,1,5,20 May 2014
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Holy Grail of comedy
","If you're a fan of 'Python' you'll love this (in fact you'll probably already have watched and enjoyed it). If you don't like Python, but consider yourself to be a generally humorous person then you should watch it, too. Only people with absolutely no sense of humour should steer clear of this.It (loosely) follows Graham Chapman as King Arthur as he's charged (by none other than God himself) with his holy task of locating the Holy Grail. To help him he's aided in typical style by the rest of the Pythons, cunningly disguised as various Knights (not to mention practically everyone else they meet).And it's funny. That's the bottom line. I know it does look a little on the cheap side (the film was partially-funded by the band Pink Floyd if you're interested). But don't let the cheapness of the production put you off. I find that it's part of its charm. In fact, seeing blatantly false limbs severed in ridiculous amounts of fake blood.Yes, it's kind of 'off-the-wall' humour that you should already know comes with the Pythons. If you haven't seen it and like comedy, do give it a watch. It's probably also good to watch with friends. Seriously they don't make 'em like they used to. Awesome. Ni.",10,1,2,7 October 2014
Sin City," 'Sinply' the best
","'Sin City' is one of those rare films which most people can actually agree on – and the general consensus is that it's excellent! And, I can't really disagree with that. I would say it's a film for men. It has pretty much everything a guy (and perhaps an 'action film' enthusiast) could want. But, there are also a lot of women out there who enjoyed it, too. And that goes to show that it's actually more than just shooting and hitting people again and again.It's not so much a story, but a collection of three main stories, all set in the same city ('Basin City' to be precise). These stories sort of play off each other and interlink, but remain mainly separate throughout the film. Then there's the look of the film itself. It's pretty much all actors being filmed against a blue screen and then having a weird, computer stylised background added on afterwards. It's about now that I should mention Sin City is based on a comic book series. Maybe that's why the black and white (with occasional relevant colour) computer background works so well. It really does add to the atmosphere, creating a seldom seen look to a film.Then you have the cast. Simply put, Sin City is an A-list ensemble of recognisable faces. And, like all the best actors, every one puts in a perfect performance (although some people have criticised Clive Owen for letting the side down a little – maybe, but nothing to really let the whole film down).So, if you like your action films, your comic book films, your stylishly shot films and interlinking stories in general, you should have already watched this by now. Even if you hate it, you'll probably appreciate that what you've watched at least attempted to be a little different to the norm.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10,1,3,7 September 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Wow - something a bit different!
","Over the last ten years or so, so many horror movies have been labelled as 'genre-changing.' And most of them have been utter tosh - simply regurgitating tried and tested formulas, filled with annoying horror clichés and even more annoying screaming teenagers.Enter The Cabin in the Woods. I picked up on the hype before it was released and deliberately tried to avoid finding out too much about it as I wanted to be surprised.I was surprised indeed. It was actually pretty good. Yes, it's horror. However, there's not an awful lot of gore or scares if that's what you're looking for. Instead, it pays homage to classic horror films like Evil Dead and rips them off in a good way, while at the same time introducing a slightly new spin on the genre.It's about five teenagers who take a trip to a deserted cabin in the woods the come to a sticky end, one by one. Nothing particularly original there, but it's the overall package that makes it slightly different to the norm.I won't say too much in case you don't know about there whys and hows of it all. Basically, if you like cheesy B-movie style horror films and you want one with a different plot which pokes fun at the many horror clichés you've become accustomed (and possibly desensitised to) over the years, then give this one a go. It may just surprise you.I really liked this film, but, after reading various Internet reviews, I've found a fair few people didn't. Their criticism was that either it wasn't scary or horrific enough, or that they didn't understand it. A fair comment on the lack of gore and scares, but I think the point of the film isn't to make you throw your dinner up or have a heart attack out of fright - but more to try and make something new out of something old. As for not understanding it - yes, this one does take an ounce more understanding that just a maniac in an ice hockey mask cutting people up with a chainsaw. Pay careful attention to the scenes in the office style environment which are interspersed with the story of the teenagers in the cabin - it should answer all questions.",8,4,7,9 March 2015
Spectre," Operatic 007
","You need to know that I'm writing this review never truly warming to the tone the Bond franchise took post Brosnan. I preferred the happy-go-lucky Bonds of the past compared to this new 'darker' Bond for the 2000s. However, I learned to appreciate that 'Casino Royale' was actually a good film. It wasn't what I'd call a 'Bond film' but it was a decent spy thriller. 'Quantum of Solace' just seemed to be an 'add-on' to 'Casino Royale,' but I felt that the series was taking a few tips from the past by injecting a little ore humour into 'Skyfall,' therefore making it the best of the trio (in my opinion). Now, having sat through Craig's latest turn as the invincible superspy, I feel that it was a hard watch.Yes, it retained a little humour which I did appreciate and the action was there. It was just the direction which seems to irk me. The previous film (and my favourite you may remember!) was directed by our own Sam Mendes who I thought did a great job. Therefore I was a bit surprised when I didn't like his style any more. The closest I can describe it as was when Homer Simpson ran a plough business and tried to boost his sales by making a pretentious black and white advertisement which had loud operatic music, beautiful women and no relation at all to the service he was providing. This is what I felt when watching many long drawn out scenes in 'Spectre.' Loud opera music, slow moving people and grandiose locations. It all felt really over the top – and not in a self-knowing good way. It just screams that it's trying really hard to be deep, meaningful and artistic, yet all it's doing is coming across like a bad advert for posh perfume.So, that's the bad out the way, now on to the good. The action is there, but (and I know I watched it on a popular online streaming service rather than on a big cinema screen) I felt like I could tell which explosions were computer-generated and which weren't due to a weird graininess of the picture (I stress – this could have been down to the quality of my broadband, so I'm reasonably forgiving on this one). I think the best part about the film was actually getting another dose of nostalgia by having our most evil of all Bond villains back again – Blofeld himself.This time he was played by Christoph Waltz who is actually pretty creepy as the – virtually – omnipotent leader of the infamous terrorist organisation. It was nice to see someone repeatedly get the better of Bond and there were plenty of nods back to the previous (Craig) Bond films thrown in there for good measure. The other thing I liked was how Bond didn't actually do it alone this time. In 'Spectre' he was ably aided by M, Moneypenney, Q and some other guy I couldn't quite catch the name of. This made a pleasant change to simply pitting Bond against the world and felt almost a little like one of Tome Cruise's 'Mission Impossible' films.Overall, I'd say that 'Spectre' is a pretty good effort. It's all there if you know what you're expecting from a 'modern' Bond movie. The direction grated on me and I tended to roll my eyes a bit, plus Craig himself was looking a bit tired all round. I've heard the rumours about him not wanting to play Bond any more. Maybe I was looking for signs of this, but I think it shows. However, it was decent enough. I'm interested to see where it goes from here, as it's clear that the franchise is technically 'ongoing' as opposed to the old 'stand-alone' Bond films.",7,0,2,19 September 2017
True Romance," Tarantino's 'Romeo and Juliet'
","Before Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction came Tarantino's 'other' film. It's not quite as well known (despite sporting an all star cast of A and B-listers) as what came after it, but that doesn't mean it's any the less fun. It might not be as raw as Reservoir Dogs, or as trendy as Pulp Fiction - you could even say it's more of a 'mainstream' gangster flick.It's about a pair of lovable rogues who steal cocaine from someone they really shouldn't, then go on a joyride to Hollywood to sell it. It's fair to say that, along the way, they meet plenty of people who want to put a damper on their plans (or simply just murder them horribly).As I mentioned, there's an all star cast, so expect one great performance after the other. Of course, being written by Tarantino, don't expect him to go easy on the language or violence. Some scenes may require a strong stomach to watch.If you like gangster films then this one has to be on your list - it'll give you everything you want: great actors, snappy dialogue, violence, double-crossing and maybe even a little bit of romance.

The Nice Guys," Not 'nice guys,' but nice film anyway
","'The Nice Guys' has always appealed to me, simply by its front cover. I know you should never judge a book (or film!) on such superficial factors, but it just looked so damn cool. And, I'm pleased to say that it is. Maybe simply setting what it – technically – your pretty standard 'who-dunnit' crime caper in the seventies it hardly that new, but it just seems to work. It's about an 'enforcer' (Russell Crowe) and a private detective (Ryan Gosling) who have to team up in order to solve a crime. So, it's effectively your average mismatched 'buddy cop' movie, even though neither of the leads are police.When you try and 'sell' a movie like this, it's hard to really make it sound as good as it actually is. As I've already mentioned, everything about the set-up is nothing new and it's only real difference is that it's set around forty years ago instead of in present day, you may wonder what makes it worth watching. Well, I guess it's the chemistry between the two leads that makes it work so well. Crowe and Gosling really do play up the 'mismatched' element of the story to perfection. However, just because they're funny, doesn't really mean that I'd call this film a 'comedy.' The humour is all very 'black' and even when you're laughing out loud, it's probably because someone has just been hurt! I won't go into the plot too much, as with most 'who-dunnits' if you give away what and why they're investigating you run the risk of spoiling what's in store. I guess 'The Nice Guys' won't be for everyone. It's not just the humour that's dark. I mentioned that people get hurt and there some fights and actions scenes that are up there with the best of serious cop dramas and action movies. It's one of those films that splits genres. It's never only a comedy, action film or drama, yet it definitely displays elements of all of them. It's also too violent and adult in nature to be watched by younger audiences, so it's strictly for adults who enjoy their murder mysteries dark when a healthy dose of black humour.It's a great piece for both Crowe and Gosling who look like they're really enjoying themselves. And it shows. As I said, 'The Nice Guys' probably isn't for everyone, but hopefully it will at least gain a cult following that it deserves.",7,1,2,1 September 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Practical Magic
","'Mad Max?' who's he?' cry the younger generation. Well, I guess he's Tom Hardy these days. However, to anyone born back in the seventies and eighties, he the titular character was synonymous with a different actor who has since majorly fallen from grace. So, in short – it's a remake. But, in that most rarest of remake traditions, it seems that the general consensus is that it's actually pretty good! Now, I was never that into the original films (I can't even remember whether there's two or three of them!) so perhaps I'm more forgiving and not exactly a 'Mad Max' purist, however, perhaps one of the reasons this new version is so well received is that it's written and directed by the original's director, George Miller.It follows the same premise, i.e. in a post apocalyptic world (or 'Australia' as it's also known – boom boom!) gangs rule the deserts and fuel and water are the most rare – and therefore valuable – commodities that people will literally kill for. Enter one gruff loner (or 'Max' as we later find out) who's been surviving on the road all this time on his lonesome. However, his (sort of) carefree days of eating lizards and driving a cool car quickly come to an end when he's captured by a gang of those nasties who seem to come to be in every post apocalyptic world we've ever seen on screen. So he's tortured and killed and no one lives happily ever after. Just kidding. With the help of a load of other prisoners, he escapes and they all go on the run, hotly pursued by their psychotic former captors. However, just because you're on the run from people who want to strap you to the front of a high-powered vehicle and wear your skins for sun block, doesn't mean it's all bad. There are worse people to be on the lamb with than Charlize Theron (unless she's playing Aileen Phillips from 'Monster' I suppose!), so the pair of them do their best to fend off the constant attacks from the gangs, while protecting those who are escaping alongside them.I guess if you were to sum up the film and try to pigeonhole it into a genre, you could say it's an 'action' movie, but I think the sub-genre of a 'chase' movie is more in order. It never really stands still for long and the film is ultimately one long chase across a desert, only stopping occasionally to gather a breath or two before everyone's off blowing moving vehicles up again. And, if that's your thing, then you're in for a real treat. Part of the enjoyment of this (very simple) film is that many of the special effects are real life stunts, as opposed to CGI or blue-screen work (yes, I think there may have been a little bit of the afore-mentioned effects, but it's pretty minimal) so you really get a feel of the danger the actors (or probably stunt people!) are going through.Not only are the explosions all convincing, but the make-up is also really cool. And, by 'cool' I mean absolutely revolting! Although, it seems that in this dystopian future, only bad people are hideously mutated individuals and anyone who needs saving looks like a supermodel from a Victoria's Secret catalogue. Although, to be fair, it seems that once a woman stops looking like Cindy Crawford with slightly less make-up, if they still wish to stay on the good guys' side, they automatically become a hard-as-nails old crone who's got a heart of gold and a forehead that time forgot. Anyway, that's just me being picky, this film is fast-paced fun. If you like numerous explosions, car chases and general mayhem then go on a road trip with these people and you'll see how bad car travel can be – I promise you after seeing what these people have to endure you'll never moan again when all you have to do is drive a car with your kids in the back while they constantly ask, 'Are we there yet?'",7,1,3,5 July 2017
Warcraft," I wanted to like this so much
","No, I'm not a die-hard 'Warcraft' fan on the computer games this film is based on. However, I am a huge fan of its writer/director Duncan Jones (and of course his late/great father, David Bowie). If you're a fan of sci-fi then you really should check out Jones' first two films: 'Moon' and 'Source Code.' They're a great example of what can be done on a smaller budget with a decent script. Therefore, my hopes were high when I saw the amount of money and resources being poured into 'Warcraft: The Beginning.' However, as many who have studied film since the mid-nineties will know films based on computer games rarely work out.If you have no idea what 'Warcraft' is (and my knowledge is based on playing 'Warcraft II' on the PC many years ago and that hilarious 'South Park' episode that rips into it) then it's kind of like 'Lord of the Rings' i.e. a medieval-type world and an ongoing war between humans and Orcs. Now, I mention 'Lord of the Rings' not just because of the (loose) plot similarities, but also because the trilogy is currently around fifteen years old and dealt with battles between green-skinned Orcs and humans. Therefore, you may think that the special effects will also be fifteen years more advanced that what we've seen before. Not in my opinion. This was my first major gripe with the film – the CGI. It just didn't look real. The dwarfs and elves looked almost comical and the Orcs were basically so blatantly made with computers it took me right out of the story. Unfortunately, the costumes weren't an awful lot better (and these weren't even made with computers!) – they looked like what you'd see at a cosplay event and were way too clean without the rugged 'battle-worn' look that's been displayed in Lord of the Rings.Then we have the plot. Yes, it could simply be described as 'Orcs vs humans,' but they at least try and mix it up a little with some good Orcs and some bad humans. However, the characters are so one-dimensional that the baddies (or either species) simply come off as cartoonish (and doubly cartoonish if they're already drawn on computers and look like a cartoon anyway!). There's a plot in there that kind of reminded me of 'Avatar' (for some reason) about inter-species relationships and working together to save both races.The action was okay. Yes, there are battles, but nothing that Lord of the Rings hasn't done before. All in all this film feels like painting by numbers. It's not terrible, but it probably could have been a lot better. I could imagine a young boy (most likely) who hasn't seen many films being totally blown away by this and loving it (and then going out and buying all the toys afterwards!). However, I'm just too jaded and have seen all this before. Maybe I should be more forgiving when it comes to films like this. I guess it's aimed at children rather than me. But, love it, hate it or – like me – be kind of indifferent to it, I still have faith in Duncan Jones that he'll come back with another awesome film.",6,0,1,15 May 2017
Donnie Darko," Ain't it kinda funny, ain't it kinda sad?
","Those words kind of sum up 'Donnie Darko.' It's definitely not for everyone, being the writing/directing debut of Richard Kelly. It's deep, complex, with overlapping-story lines and constant blurring of genres.Rumour has it that once it was made, the distributors let it sit on the shelf for a year while they tried to figure out how best to sell it. I can see why. It's hard to name a genre that it doesn't borrow from. It's definitely sci-fi, but only in parts. When the sci-fi elements come, they're very noticeable, but surprisingly fleeting. However, it's also very creepy in places, producing a more sinister atmosphere than most horror films. Then, just when you're scared senseless, it throws in a lot of light-hearted banter, even going as far as to discuss the sexual habits of Smurfs like it was a Kevin Smith comedy. Then you have the touching sadness of it all, plus the high school element, the teen romance subplot, the family drama and the general satire on modern living in suburban America.If anyone asks you what Donnie Darko is about, even if you've seen it, you may have trouble explaining it. The people that really know what it's about have probably looked up its 'true meaning' on the internet somewhere.If you're familiar with David Lynch's work, then you may know where Donnie Darko lies in the scale of films. Where is Lynch specialises in disturbing horror, Donnie Darko utilises all the genres to produce a mind-bending trip into a disturbed teenager's head as he struggles to balance everyday living with strange visitations from a time travelling bunny rabbit from the future (called Frank).Those who don't like it will probably say that it didn't make sense. Well, they're right in some ways. It's not a film that wraps itself up easily. A lot is left to your own interpretation of what you've seen. There is definitely a story that you can follow and you should care about all the characters, but it's partly more of a 'sensory experience' than an easy narrative to follow.But then it's worth it just to see Jake Gyllenhal's breakthrough performance. He hadn't done many films prior to this and it's great to see him carry the film on his own. However, there are numerous characters in this film and, just because they're not quite as good as its leading man, doesn't mean to say they don't all put in excellent performances. Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze aren't in it for long, but that doesn't mean to say that they aren't both excellent in their small roles.Donnie Darko is an experience. It may not be for everyone, but you really should see it to decide for yourself. It was listed in the 'Top 50 films you need to see before you die.' I think it justifies its place in that list.",10,0,2,28 November 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," I just don't care any more
","Growing up in the eighties, I used to watch the Transformers in their earlier cartoon incarnation and long for a proper big-screen film to do them justice. Three films in and I'm still waiting.Number Three starts off well - the linking with real twentieth century history is a nice touch, but then the usual set of two dimensional 'heroes' take over and any promise turns to cliché.The humans are either macho soldiers who only live (and die) to serve the U.S. of A. The scientists are all only there for comic effect. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looks great, but does little to add to the story (plus has an interesting ability to simply stand still in the middle of a warzone in order to safely survive it). Shia LaBeouf does what he always does, i.e. kill more Decepticons that the entire Autobot army put together. Seriously, the guy is completely indestructible and has the superpower of being able to shout several miles across a trashed city to his friends. I don't know why he doesn't just take on the big bad robots all on his own and give Optimus and co a holiday.I reckon a cut should be made of this film where it completely takes out all human characters as the robots are far more interesting. Optimus and Sentinal Primes are the stars. Even the other robots are bland and you can't tell one from the other (apart from the two small really annoying ones who must come from the same planet as Jar Jar Binks).Enjoy the robots. Ignore the humans (and the plot and the over the top special effects and the numerous plot holes and the 2D acting and the clichéd characters and the fact that it's only designed to sell toys). I could go on. I hated every human moment of this film. I'd rather just watch Optimus Prime do some sort of monologue for two and a bit hours.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5,1,4,13 May 2014
The Social Network," A film for my generation?
","Looking through the reviews on this site, it's hard to really add anything new about The Social Network. It's brilliant. I can hardly fault it. However, I am a serious Facebook addict (currently undergoing electric shock treatment to help myself cut down) so it fascinated me to hear about the back story as to how it was created, who owned it (and who nearly owned it).I would rate this 9/10 – great performances, great direction (David Fincher, I now officially forgive you for your part in Alien 3) and great pace.So, as an experiment and, in keeping with my 9/10 rating, I invited my Mum and Dad round to watch it. The second time around I enjoyed it as much as the first. In short, when I asked my parents to rate it out of 10, they gave it a 5 and a 6. They didn't get it. They didn't understand Facebook, or 'the fuss' about it. They didn't understand anything more technical than the term 'the web' and they found all the characters unlikeable and annoying. Only a few hours after the credits rolled and my Mum was having difficulty remembering anything other than people were generally moaning at each other over something that involved money.I guess if you're one of the stereotypical 'Facebook generation' you may love this. If not, stick with your knitting (and, no, my Mum will never read this).I'm now off to cut and paste this whole review to my status – please feel free to comment :oDhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",9,0,0,1 September 2014
Back to the Future," As good as it ever was
","There are some films that are just timeless and everyone should watch (especially in today's climate of remakes, reboots and reimaginings). Basically, see it before it gets horribly remade with overblown computer effects and wafer-thin characters that you simply just don't care about. By now, you can probably already tell that I love this film and I'm effectively going to 'gush' about it, so if you just want to accept now that it's a definite 10/10 you might as well stop reading now. However, if you're vaguely interested as to why I think it's so - technically - perfect, then feel free to read on. In case you're one of the few people that have been living in 1955 all your life and have only just arrived in our year courtesy of a time machine, you may need to know that 'Back to the Future' is about time travelling. Marty McFly, played by the ever youthful Michael J Fox, gets caught up in eccentric inventor, Doc Brown's, latest scheme to build a time machine out of a DeLorean car. Naturally, things don't go smoothly as he inadvertently ends up in 1955 and accidentally interferes with the very moment his parents got together, therefore possibly preventing him from every being conceived. If this wasn't bad enough, he's only got a one-shot chance at returning to his own time thanks to a lightning bolt due to power his time machine for the return trip.I think what makes this film stand the tests of time is the fact that it is a true 'family' film. Whereas most films which can be watched by children are largely aimed ONLY at them and force the adults to sit through it until it's over, I can't imagine anyone - male/female, young/old - not actually finding enjoyment out of this adventure. It's funny without ever being childish or vulgar, exciting without ever being over the top or unrealistic (if you're willing to suspend your disbelief enough to believe that time travel is actually possible) and, of course, it contains some of the most memorable characters ever committed to film. Naturally, our dashing young hero, Marty, is very easy to root for, however it's his cranky old sidekick 'Doc', played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd who steals every scene and is the true joy to watch all the way through. It's also worth mentioning that Marty's on-screen family also can hold their own, played different versions of themselves throughout the time periods, but special mention should go a character who should - by rights - be little more than a stereotypical bully, yet 'Biff' somehow becomes the clichéd bully that all other on-screen thugs aspire to be ever after. If this film has a downside - and I'm only mentioning this because I can see that some people may have a problem with it these days (I didn't and still don't!) it's that there are a few topics of humour that some people may find a little 'edgy' in today's PC culture. For some reason I get the feeling that today any 'family' movie may shy away from a mother inadvertently falling in love with her son, but it was the eighties and things were different then!There aren't many movies that still can bring a family together around the TV in the living room on Christmas Day, but this is still one of them. If you haven't already brought the entire trilogy on DVD, then watch it now and show your children. It deserves to entertain future generations. Yes, the following two 'Back to the Future' movies weren't quite so well-received by the critics, but I think they're great, too.",10,0,0,26 December 2017
Goodfellas," Often imitated, never bettered
","Goodfellas is often featured in the 'Top 10' greatest films ever. And, it certainly doesn't disappoint. I suppose the only person who wouldn't enjoy it is someone who really hates gangster films (or perhaps is very offended by strong language and/or violence).However, for all those who can appreciate films which show the darker side of humanity - in this case one that tells the story of (real life) gangster Henry Hill and how he climbs the ranks of the local mob. Yes, there's plenty of foul language along the way, not to mention a fair few violent 'hits' on anyone who gets in his way. So, if you're into that, then this is for you.Not only is the story gripping, but the performances and direction are all up to scratch. You know it's a high quality cast when someone - in this case Joe Pesci - actually manages to upstage Robert DeNiro (the 'waiter' and the 'clown' scenes to start with). But, Pesci aside, all the cast play their parts brilliantly and you can't really fault any of them.If you haven't seen Goodfellas, you really need to. Even if you don't like gangster films, you may actually enjoy this one. It's certainly one you'll need to know about when people are discussing it down the pub! Now go home and get yer shoeshine box!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10,0,1,11 June 2014
13 Hours," 13 Hours – yup, that's about right
","Sometimes a film's title really does tip you off as to what it's going to be about. 'Snakes on a Plane' is one such example. What you see is what you get. '13 Hours' is another. Having watched it, I can definitely confirm that it felt like I had wasted 13 hours of my life watching this. And that's a shame. Despite Michael Bay's notorious reputation since his stint at the helm of the infamous 'Transformers' franchise, I still think he's a reasonably good director (I am just about the only person alive who enjoyed his 'Pain and Gain' film!) so, when I heard he was directing a film about hired security officers in the Middle East, I thought it would be worth a watch.Now, you can probably tell I wasn't impressed and I feel I should probably start listing the various reasons as to why I felt this way. However, I can sum it up in one word: boring. And I could probably leave the review there. I didn't think it was terrible, just boring. 'The Office's' John Krasinski plays the lead security officer and, if you've seen him taking fire from Michael Scott, then you'll probably know that he can hold his own in dangerous situations. He's – as predicted – a likable character who you always feel like you could probably share a beer with. But the film was still boring. Yes, it does show us westerners a window into what life must be like in Middle Eastern countries and what Westerners have to go through when living/working there. The scenery is certainly nice and interesting to look at – certainly a change from watching films set in New York or other recognisable locations. And there is definitely a gritty undertone to the whole story. You can feel the dirt and danger these people have to go through on a daily basis. But I was still bored. Yup, there are some – sort of – car chases and gunfights. These are naturally well executed (in true Michael Bay style), but I've seen all these before and, yes, I was bored.Overall, '13 Hours' is a nice (and dare I say 'accurate?') portrayal of what life must be like in that unstable region of the world, but, ultimately, despite its good points, it just didn't grab me. I was bored (although I'm guessing that this was still better than 'Transformers 5: The Last Knight!').",4,4,12,23 June 2017
Warm Bodies," Breathing new life into this 'corpse' of a genre
","I don't want to mention Twilight, but, let's face it, it was 'vampires for teens,' just like Beautiful Creatures was 'witches for teens.' The 'teen market' is very profitable when it comes to film-making. Therefore, what with the trend in zombie movies in the last decade or so, it was only a matter of time before someone made a 'zombies for teens' movie.Amazingly, it's actually pretty good.It starts in a decimated world where the undead outnumber the living (nothing new there then, eh?). Only one - former teenage boy - zombie is starting to have 'feelings.' These remembered emotions lead him to make contact with the last few human survivors and strike up a friendship with a living girl.It plays out like Romeo and Juliet (check out the unsubtle nod to the Shakespearean play in the 'balcony scene') where the boys 'zombie family' don't take too kindly to a living human among them (that they can't eat) and the girl's human settlement doesn't relish the possibility of a brain-eating flesh-eater wandering among them.If you can move yourself out of the typical 'dumb' zombie world we're used to from George Romero and The Walking Dead etc and step into one where zombies can now talk, reason and even love, then you should give this one a go. It's not just for teens - zombie/horror fans like myself are treated to a healthy dose of gore and skeletons ripping people apart. There's a small helping of humour in it too and, on a personal level, I actually preferred the film when it was being an out and out comedy, but there's not too many laughs, so don't expect them coming thick and fast.In a market saturated by one rubbish zombie movie after the next, fair play to Warm Bodies for trying - and succeeding - in bringing something a little different to the genre.",8,1,2,6 November 2014
Beetlejuice," Needs more Keaton
","You're probably already aware that 'Beetlejuice' is considered a 'classic' when it comes to modern cinema and I don't really disagree. However, upon re-watching the eighties horror/comedy today I still level the same criticism â€“ not enough of the titular character, aka Michael Keaton.The story follows a young couple who find themselves dead after an unfortunate road accident. Now they're forced to spend the afterlife haunting their own dream home, now infested with the (annoying) living. And, in an effort to drive out these fleshy interlopers, they enlist the help of one particularly unhinged fellow spirit, known as Beetlejuice.It was directed by Tim Burton as (arguably) the height of his career. It's wonderfully Gothic with all his best trademarks all over the place (not counting the lack of Johnny Depp). The only aspect of the film that rivals Keaton's performance are the (completely non-CGI) special effects which add to the atmosphere perfectly.Maybe today the film is looking a little dated, but it's one that you have to suspend your disbelief and enjoy it for what it was at the time, rather than compared to today's filmic offerings. I wait for the (depressing) day when I hear it's going to be remade with all CGI environments. That will probably happen, but no matter how much computer trickery they employ, they'll never be able to CGI another performance as good as Keaton's. And that's why the original will always stand out (and not just as an excuse to laugh at how unbelievably young Alec Baldwin looked back then!).",8,1,2,20 November 2017
Valkyrie," A nice change from the regular World War II movies
","Although the Second World War should never be forgotten, it's fair to say that war movies are hardly big money-spinners at the box office right now. Perhaps it's because we're used to see the Allies winning in the end? However, Valkyrie is told from an entirely German perspective. It's the dying days of the war and Hitler is determined to fight until the last man, bringing down Germany if it comes to it. So a rouge group of German officers (led by Tom Cruise) stages a plan to assassinate him and arrange a truce with the Allies.Tom Cruise can act, if given the right part. Here he doesn't have to do too much. He's largely here for 'star power' value. However, it's the story that's important rather than who's in it. Despite the fact that you'll probably know the ending, it's actually pretty tense as the Germans fight their own leader and try to bring a less devastating conclusion to the war.Bonus points to the film for putting together a large group of some of the best British actors to play various German roles (and Eddie Izzard, who sneaked in there somehow - bless him).If you fancy something a bit more historically accurate (and I'm told Valkyrie is reasonably accurate) then this is worth a go. Perhaps 'Downfall' (an excellent German-made film about Hitler's last days) could even be a sort of sequel to this?http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0,0,12 May 2014
The Simpsons Movie," A good extended episode
","It's widely regarded that 'The Simpsons' TV show has been long past its prime of the early through late nineties. Nowadays it's still watched, but it doesn't look like it will ever regain its prestige. However, that didn't stop them trying to make a movie out of the long-running series in 2007 - roughly a decade after people thought it had peaked.Perhaps one thing that's normally commonplace when a TV show makes the jump onto the big screen, is that everything is bigger and on more of a grander scale. Yet, due to 'The Simpsons' being on the air for so long and because it's animated, therefore not bound by the limitations of special effects and budget etc, pretty much everything has already been seen and done (ala that episode of 'South Park' that made the same point!). Therefore there's very little that's fresh to see by watching 'The Simpsons Movie.' I know there's a certain amount of 'meta' humour poking fun at the audience for going to the cinema to watch something they could view for free on the television, but it's a point that's kind of on the nose.Although, saying all that (and speaking as a fan of 'The Simpson' - in their heyday) I have to say that the film is an enjoyable enough romp. There's literally nothing here to distinguish it from an episode (well, a good one) besides its extended runtime. All the characters are there, although most are only on screen for a few seconds to throw a line or two in there. The film focuses in on the central family and recycles many old plots from various episodes to create something that appears new (if you don't look too closely).If you like the show then you should definitely like this. It's one of those movies that you probably shouldn't pay to see (especially at cinema prices), but if you get the chance to watch it for free then there are definitely worse ways to spend an hour and a half. It's just a pity today's episodes can't even match the quality of the film.Plus did any future episode ever say what happened to the stand-out star of this film, i.e. 'Spider-pig?' He definitely deserves his own spin-off series!",7,0,1,25 February 2020
Alien: Covenant," Frankenstein's monster of an 'Alien' film
","I'm guessing that most people who sit down to watch 'Alien: Covenant' will have some idea about what they're in for, but, in case you need the most meagre of plot synopsises, it's basically a monster hunting humans in space (or, if you believe the original pitch for the first 'Alien' movie back in 1979 it could – also – be described as 'Jaws in space'). So, if you're a casual fan of the franchise then you'll probably get what you want out of this. There are monsters. The monsters kill humans. End of. However, I (like so many) are anything but 'casual' fans of the franchise! The reason 'Alien: Covenant' is such a big deal stems back to 1986 (or some may say 1979), due to the phenomenal success of 'Aliens.' Now, don't get me wrong, the original 'Alien' in 1979 was awesome – so awesome in fact that it was in doubt whether it could ever be bettered. And, some still say that it can't. It's sequel (1986's imaginatively-titled 'Aliens') gave us the same and more. Apart from 'Terminator/Terminator 2,' people claim 'Alien/Aliens' to be one of few examples of where a sequel surpasses the original. Therefore, there were high hopes for the third instalment, 1992's 'Alien 3.' And that's where things started to go wrong. I was an absolute disaster with fans all over the world wondering how a good sequel couldn't somehow be made of the first two films' backs. And, that's the question we've been asking ever since. We've had all sorts of 'Alien' movies since – mainly spin-offs and crossovers – and none have really come close to attaining the high praise of the first two.So, now we come to 'Alien: Covenant.' It's clear that the film-makers know that the 'Alien franchise' is still hot property, has armies of loyal fans out there and it far from unprofitable. I can almost see them all sitting round in meeting rooms trying to work out why every alien-related film post 'Aliens' has failed so dramatically and therefore what they need to do to make a worthy successor. I'm just guessing, but it seems they sat through the first two movies taking carful note of what fans liked and they splicing it together to form a script for 'Alien: Covenant.' It's like they said – audiences like the 'one alien' suspense – so we'll put that in. But, at the same time, people liked marines fighting aliens with big guns. That goes in, too. People loved Sigourney Weaver's original heroine Ripley – so we need a tough female lead with short hair. Everyone loved it when Ripley got in a giant robot suit and kicked the alien out of a spaceship – let's throw that in there as well. But 'Covenant' also has to be a sequel to a prequel ('Prometheus') – what did people like about that? Not much really. However, Michael Fassbender was highly-praised for his creepy android portrayal of David. So let's bring him back for a prominent role. And so on.If you take 'Alien, Aliens' and add a dash of 'Prometheus' then you end up with 'Alien: Covenant.' A spaceship full of colonists traces a signal to a new planet and lands, only to get picked off by the xenomorph and its friends. It's not a bad film, but, once again, it doesn't do the first two films justice. Because it seems to try and throw in so much into one film – it tries to be 'Alien, Aliens,' a sequel to 'Prometheus,' a bridge back to 'Alien' and something that will hopefully reinvigorate the franchise, it does come across as a bit of a mess. Yeah, there are good bits here and there – director Ridley Scott again proves that he hasn't lost his flair when it comes to visual storytelling, but my personal favourite was – like 'Prometheus' – the android David again. However, it's still just another 'monster movie' as opposed to what could have been an amazing sequel to 'Aliens.' It's okay, but it's ultimately going to be forgotten for what it contains and probably remembered more for being the film that stood between Neil Blomkamp making his (much touted on the internet) version of a remake of 'Alien 3' (although I think he called it 'Alien 5') which would have been a direct sequel to 'Aliens' and bring back fan-favourite characters Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop.",7,3,9,13 June 2017
Rock Star," Predictable, but better than I expected
","Not being a massive fan of Mark Wahlberg, I really don't know why I watched this. However, I'm quite glad I did. There are some films that you just don't like for reasons you can't quite put your finger on. This is the opposite. I liked it and I don't really know why.The plot follows Mark Wahlberg as the lead singer in an eighties tribute band to the (fictional) rock gods, Steel Dragon. However, his life takes an interesting turn when the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves (or is kicked out!) and his bandmates offer Mark the job as replacement. Now, if that sounds a little hard to believe, check out the movie trivia. Apparently, a similar situation actually happened during the seventies (and before I was born, hence I'm not totally up on it).From there we see what his life is like 'living the dream' of drugs, rock and roll (and 'the other' obviously).The thing is, based on that briefest of plot summaries, you can probably guess the highs and lows (and probably eventual outcome) of the film. And you'd be right. There are no major twists in the tale. Yet, for some reason, I still found it enjoyable to watch. There's a healthy dose of sentiment, but not too much to distract from the big eighties hairdos and thumping guitar chords.Perhaps fans of rock (as I am) just automatically like it? Perhaps I just got lucky. I found it a kind of semi feel-good movie for adults.It doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, but the characters have their own charm (and special kudos to Mark's on screen parents, who, despite being 'all grown up and respectable' like to headbang with the best of them down at the gigs and mosh pits!).",7,0,0,16 May 2014
The Martian," Matt on Mars
","Okay, I'll admit it – I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan. I can't get that impression of him from 'Team America: World Police' out of my head (if you've seen the film you'll know the one I mean!). Therefore, when I heard that 'The Martian' was about him being an astronaut stranded on Mars, my initial reaction was oh, well, never mind. However, after watching the film, I'm still no real convert for Matt himself, but I can say that the film is actually pretty good.It's been getting quite a lot of praise heaped upon it and, although I did enjoy it, I'd hardly liken it to the classic that some people are hailing it as. As I've said, Matt Damon is part of the first manned mission to Mars and, when a freak sandstorm hits, his crew are forced to perform an emergency evacuation, stranding him there in the process. I knew that going into the film and actually expected it to be only about Matt Damon, hardly ever featuring anyone else. I was pleased to say that the scenes on the red planet are constantly interspersed with those back on Earth as the rest of the world (well, Nasa mainly) is tasked with the solution to finding him a way back home. But, ultimately, it's Matt's show and it's mainly about him. And, I'm pleased to say he comes across as a likable guy to be stuck on – technically – an alien planet with (at least from an audience's perspective anyway!).So, he goes about his business doing his best to survive with the limited resources he has to hand. It's nice to see a film where it's actually quite dramatic without the need for all those other – apparent – nasties that Mars has spawned. Matt Damon's life is difficult enough staying warm, without worrying about green bug-headed aliens in flying saucers, ghosts who possess your body and force you to self-mutilate, or borderline fascist corporate men in suits who want to keep the air for themselves in order to stay in power.I should probably mention that it's directed by Ridley Scott who, when he's not doing weird things to the 'Alien' franchise, still has it when it comes to directing epic landscapes and beautiful scenery. Also, it's originally based on a book of the same name; I haven't read that (I barely have time to watch a two hours film, let alone read words!) so I can't really comment on how faithful this adaptation really is.It's hard to say too much more about this film. It's a nicely-simply affair and the threat comes from the harsh environment Matt Damon is stranded in, rather than the afore-mentioned other filmic nasties from Mars. Okay, so there's a little conflict with the other characters back on Earth with how they deal with the 'political' fallout that stems from effectively blasting off from orbit and not bothering to check whether one of your people was still planting potatoes! Plus, when I saw the run-time was over two hours I did wonder whether it would hold my attention and I'm pleased to say that it did. I'd definitely watch this again, maybe not soon, but it's worth a second watch at some point.",7,0,0,20 June 2017
Evil Dead II," Hail to the King (baby)
","'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn' – is it a sequel? Is it a remake? The argument rages to this day. However, ultimately, who cares? It's awesome! Well... if you like seeing grown men screaming as they're repeatedly covered in a variety of different-coloured bodily fluids. Luckily, I do.Ignore the original 'Evil Dead' (yes, it was fun – for the time – but this one's head and shoulders over it when it comes to special effects, gore and characters). Whether Part II is a remake or sequel, it basically covers the entire of the first film in the opening ten minutes and then gathers steam from there. It is basically the original 'cabin-in-the-woods-movie.' So many times since we've seen a group of annoyingly-good looking teenagers head out to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, only to meet their end at the hands of something pretty nasty. But, back in Evil Dead/Evil Dead Part II's day – it was actually quite an original prospect – especially when it's done as well as this.Yes, the prospect of people being stuck in a remote location and hunted by someone out of this world isn't that revolutionary, but it's the way it's done here that makes 'Dead by Dawn' a classic. Here the hapless humans are hunted by, not just the undead, but the 'evil' dead. If you're unclear of the difference, the evil dead aren't just your run-of-the-mill zombies, but demons who just look like zombies, but are a hundred times more powerful and are completely insane.If the gore and general craziness of seeing a man fight his own (possessed) hand isn't enough for you to get you to watch this, you have Bruce Campbell as the central character, Ash. After this performance the B-movie world had a new cult hero who has gone on to not just star in the sequel, but countless computer games, comics and most recently a TV show. Basically, Ash is a chump – a stupid, sexist idiot who causes more problems than he actually gets round to solving. He is definitely not your average Hollywood hero – and the film is all the better for it.Ash makes Evil Dead. Evil Dead would just be another horror film without Ask. If you don't believe me – look into the remake of Evil Dead that completely omitted him (and I'm not counting the 'too-little-too-late' cameo at the end of the film). It was rubbish. Or rather it was just another horror film. If you like your horror films, B-movies, or just wise-cracking insane heroes battling even more crazy demons, give this one a go. It's groovy.",10,1,1,5 May 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," Far-fetched fun
","There is only one thing you need to know before watching 'Law Abiding Citizen' and that is: how much can you suspend your disbelief? If the answer is, 'Not a lot - I like my films realistic,' then don't bother watching this. However, if you can overlook one plot hole after the next and just gloss over the numerous coincidences which need to occur simply to move the plot forward, then you'll probably enjoy this.Luckily - for me - I simply allowed myself to get swept along in what is quite a novel and fast-paced story where 'everyman' Gerard Butler's family gets killed, but the killers cannot be prosecuted, thanks somewhat to lawyer Jamie Foxx. Therefore, ten years later, Butler decides to invoke his own style of justice.What follows is one pretty clever and gruesome way of killing someone after the next. You'll find yourself both sympathising and hating Butler's character, while Foxx isn't to be outdone on the acting stakes, as he comes across as both slick and vulnerable all at the same time.Basically, if you like your action/revenge/thrillers loud, dumb and full of loop-holes, then you'll like this. If you're expecting absolute realism then you'll hate it.",8,1,2,23 September 2014
Semi-Pro," Actually pretty good fun
","I always find that Will Ferrell's films can be a little hit and miss. He's either funny, or he tries a little too hard to be funny. Luckily, in the case of 'Semi-Pro,' he's the former. The film is clearly his vehicle, so whether it works or not is largely down to him. Here he plays Jackie Moon – the owner, coach and player of a low league basketball team who are about to get disbanded, unless they can scrape fourth place in the league.For a start, you don't have to know or like basketball. I know nothing about it, but I enjoyed the film anyway. Yes, Ferrell is a little over the top here and there, but his performance never really borders on 'annoying.' It's not a long film, only an hour and a half, and most of it is packed with gags (all pretty adult in nature) and the majority of those work.There are minor plot lines, but they're all secondary to Ferrell. Most other characters are only there to tee up Ferrell for him to deliver the punch line. Woody Harrelson is about the second most important character and he has a little more screen time. He's totally functional too, but Semi-Pro is still Ferrell's baby.Basically, Semi-Pro won't win any awards. It's daft, loud and dumb, but ultimately very watchable if you're in the mood for a film like that.Just beware of escaped bears!",7,8,8,20 November 2014

But, despite him being the 'heart' of the story, Harrelson is more of a 'functional' part of the tale and 'Semi-Pro' remains Ferrell's baby. David Koechner and Jackie Earle Haley are also on the cast list, but both of them - although always enjoyable in anything they do - are merely there as kind of 'extended cameos.'Basically, Semi-Pro won't win any awards.
