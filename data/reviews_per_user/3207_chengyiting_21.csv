The King's Speech," King's acting
","It was very inspirational and heart-warming. It was really exciting to see the King 's last speech that was getting smoother and smoother, and to think about the various hardships and the abuses he suffered in his childhood. I really like the feeling of the royal family. It has the taste of Tangjiatun children. The English said that British accent is all high class and elegant aristocratic capitalism. The lines are great, and the acting is also very strong, it is worthy of Oscar. It is a movie worth watching.",8,0,0,16 April 2020
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Beautiful movie
","Great movie! Seeing the young students laughing, slapstick, partying, and going for a ride together, there is really an urge to release the summer in my body, and I want to throw a lot of youth that I still hold in my hands. I love the era when technology developed just right, but I can only express sincere emotions in primitive ways. Everyone is a carrier of joy and pain. You can't just stand beside. When you are a Wallflower, you have to participate in it, feel the moment, feel the love, and feel the beauty of loss and stay.",7,0,0,19 April 2020
Captain Marvel," I have nothing to prove to you
","Although Captain Marvel's movie was utterly smeared by many men, it was nothing but ridicule that feminism was too much and Marvel was too politically correct. You see, women have not fully won, and a little political correctness can make this group of people unbearable and attack the movie. My eight points is equivalent to buffering out part of the audience who gave this film a low score because of feminism.",8,2,5,5 April 2020
My Neighbor Totoro," Warm and beautiful animation
","In the 90-minute picture, there is no violence, no scolding, no swords and swords, no love and hatred. The whole film is like a beautiful freehand drawing, a clear river, dense towering trees, flowers and trees, and clean. Xiaolu always reminds us to care for the environment. Simple folk customs, indifferent experience regardless of gains and losses, is the way to a healthy survival. The theme song of the film is also very nice, with a touch of indifferent joy, crisp percussion, and the sound knocks into people's lungs.",8,0,0,2 April 2020
Life of Pi," The picture is really beautiful, dreamlike.
","The days of rafting are amazing, the ocean, the sky, everything is so dreamy and beautiful, that I just want to remember the first story, not the second. This is a story of terrifying thoughts. Reality and illusion are intertwined. There are not only allegations of crucifixion and salvation in religion, but also thoughts on human nature, and philosophical discussions. On the endless ocean, fear will breed Out of the animal nature, the evil in the heart ...",8,0,0,5 May 2020
Interstellar," The screenwriter's logic is too powerful
","I feel that I must forget all the existing knowledge of time and space to understand. The future person is ourselves. We are in a high-dimensional space, a space in the physical dimension of time, and a space that we can't even imagine now and save ourselves. Salute Cooper, salute Murphy, salute Brand.",9,0,1,8 April 2020
Léon: The Professional," Killer humanity
","The narrative rhythm is clear and smooth, and there is no muddy water; Léon, Stansfield, Mathilda, several main characters have distinct personalities; coupled with the fast switching screen like MTV, the film grabs the audience's eye from beginning to end, which is very rare. Because of this film, the world has realized Natalie Portman.",8,0,1,17 April 2020
Yesterday," A love song to the Beatles
","The structure of the story is based on 'Charlotte's Troubles' and 'Crazy World'. When yesterday's sounded, she couldn't help but move to tears. If Beatles, Harry Potter and Coca-Cola no longer exist in this world, how regretful should human civilization evolve so far? The hostess is really beautiful ~ Many people don't understand the emotional lines in the drama. I think this is to tell the audience to be loyal to themselves and to their love. Seeing them punching cards in Liverpool, I thought of myself who was chasing the Seventh Park and Ziqiang Tunnel. Even if the world is worse, do we still have music? When you set up a flag, when can you watch a concert at Wembley Stadium? Fascinated. Five stars are given to the Beatles.",6,1,2,27 April 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," NOT BAD
","Go to the cinema to see the action special effects are all great. I personally think it's pretty good, the scene when all the heroes came out together is very shocking, and there are tears in the middle.",7,0,2,1 April 2020
Aladdin," Lower expectations and surprises
","Aladdin is an Arab story. As a kid, I only heard the three wishes of the devil, and did not know the original story. Aladdin's movie gave this opportunity. Singing and dancing is great, the magic princess is too beautiful, and the temperament is so attractive, it is a turning-over work of Will Smith.",8,1,1,30 March 2020
The Lion King," childhood memory
","The familiar melody and taste, the fidelity and reduction have reached the peak, and the emotional core continues seamlessly. However, the real version of the eternal shortcoming is that you cannot have the animated version of the colorful and wild. Still love Simba, that's the Lion of Enlightenment we fell in love with animation!",7,0,1,1 April 2020
Call Me by Your Name," Very delicate love story
","I really like the director 's lens and composition. A beautiful narrative brings out a smooth and natural plot flow. The delicate feelings and subtle psychological portrayals are very touching. Of course, the beautiful body is also very pleasing (the casting is really convincing, and Acting sincerely), the last point of the father's point is very appropriate. It 's a pity, or it 's destined, the summer love song bids farewell in winter, let me call you with my name for the last time, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, weeping silently in front of the fireplace The heart is broken. Such is the beauty and sorrow of love, not forever, but for once",7,1,3,14 April 2020
Coco," Best Pixar Movie
","The coco. Movie I went with my classmates showed Mexican culture very well, and the beautiful pictures were comfortable. My grandchildren's feelings made me cry. This is the best Pixar animation I have ever seen",9,0,0,29 March 2020
1917," Beautiful photography
","I wanted to wait and watch the movie online. I did n't expect the epidemic to last so long. I ca n't wait. The story itself is very simple. Knowing in sync with the protagonist, the tension increased, but I still regretted not watching it in the cinema!",7,0,3,25 April 2020
Titanic," The most love movie
","Whether it is the method of filming or the face value of the male and female protagonists, they are all rare high-quality qualities! The beauty of the heroine made me want to worry about it. This movie is a rare masterpiece. It is no wonder that the director has won the award!",7,0,0,2 May 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," satisfied movie
","The Harry Potter series has always been my favorite magic movie. I am a fan of Emma Watson, and I watch every movie of hers. I love Hermione so much. It is a pity that this movie was not seen in the cinema. The storyline is very restored to the novel, continuing the level of the previous few",7,1,1,6 April 2020
It's a Wonderful Life," Worth watching over and over
","I personally think that whether a movie is good or not does not depend on whether the movie has a strong star lineup, superb visual impact, and so on. It is undoubtedly whether the audience 's feelings after watching the movie are deep enough, and whether the movie can really touch the deepest string in the audience 's mind. It is indeed a good movie.",8,0,0,23 April 2020
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Maddening
","The discipline of people in the lunatic asylum, including language, body, and physical panoramic prison surveillance, Foucault's theory is not bullying. The film portrays several so-called lunatics with distinct personalities. They are more or less actually defined as lunatics, perhaps by relatives and professionals, but they are all flesh and blood, so they are all voluntary, why have they not get ready? The deaths of Billy and Mac are both concrete presentations of the film's criticism of the lunatic asylum system, which is different from the positive hope that the leap of success brought us. This is a passive resistance. In the film, Mac asks his girlfriend to have sex with Billy. It seems to show great disrespect for women and unconscious patriarchy. It is impossible to gain understanding in today's context.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Great anti-war movie
","Looking at the deformed world in the eyes of children, all kinds of contradictions seemed ridiculous and unreasonable. 'Marriage Story' and this film completely let Scarlett get rid of the vase. The pure color interpretation of foreign little Baizhi also made people shine. Although the supporting role with the little follower is not too much, but there are also highlights. The essence of the tragicomedy may be just the right one ...",6,1,2,7 April 2020
Amélie," Worth watching repeatedly
","The film is a bit absurd, but it is inexplicably close to reality. I really like the episode.",8,0,0,30 March 2020
The Godfather," Words cannot express my feelings
","Within three hours, the group portrait is complete, and the characters are evenly shaded, and there are no idle strokes. Many scenes can be called great. The environment, sound, lighting, and props are integrated. For example, when the hospital changes rooms, the editing is too good and busy. He never forgets the tears around the godfather 's eyes, which is suitable for movement; for example, the clip of baptism and killing is a thrilling one. The second generation of the godfather gradually sublimates and freezes in the intersection of joy and cold blood.",9,0,0,31 March 2020
