Hereditary," A Better Drama Than Horror
","The debut film from Ari Aster comes off as a far better Drama, or even Psychological Horror, than a true Horror film. Perhaps that comes from years of subjection to jump scares and cheap gorey tricks that the hollywood wants us to believe makes a good horror film. But when I think back to films such as Alien I remember what true horror feels like (I may have hidden behind a pillow for the most part of that film), a feeling I never experienced during this film. Yet I became deeply intrigued by the bizarre events that occur to the characters, taking me on an eventful journey full of twists and turns. For the most part the acting was fantastic. In particular Toni Collette, whose character could have easily turned to a stereotypical screaming white woman, instead formed an outstanding character study who I could barely take my eyes off. However, I would like to take a moment to focus on the role of Peter played by Alex Wolf. For me this is where the film stumbles and I am unsure whether it is a writing, directing, acting, or a mixture of all three. Throughout the film we watch the lives of intriguing people with there own intergrule backstories, and then we have Peter who appears to be a stereotypical edgy highschool student. Yet the character is written as though he is eight years old which grates like nails down a chalkboard in contrast to his surface appearance. He constantly says mommy and bawls and the drop of a hat which in turns pops the viewer out of the experience of the world. Perhaps if the actor was stronger, or if it was re-written this part may have worked.All in all this film was a great journey that was grounded and a joy to watch.",8,1,3,16 October 2018
