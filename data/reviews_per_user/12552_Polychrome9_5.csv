Blade Runner 2049," Desperately Seeking an Editor
","Too long, too slow, and in desperate need to editing. A sorry sequel to an excellent film, BR2049 doesn't have the same feeling of reality that the original had. The actions of the characters felt scripted, I kept asking myself why would they do that? I also kept looking at the clock (always a bad sign).Beautiful, obviously expensive effects sadly wasted on a thin, poorly explained story.",5,15,29,19 February 2018
Hero," You saw everything good in the previews...
","...and nowhere in any of the advertisements did it tell you to expect subtitles! When I go to a movie, I want to watch a movie, not read. If I want to read, I'll read a book. All the good action sequences were already shown in the previews, and there was very little story, character development, or plot to speak of. I like Jet Li, I think he is a talented actor, but this film was a poor vehicle. Just because it had 'Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon'-style special effects and was based on a 'true' story does not mean it was a good film. This film was all 'atmosphere', and I suggest you wait until it shows up on cable - don't waste your hard-earned money on seeing this in the theaters.",4,0,3,2 October 2004
Avatar," Not enough plot to support this long a movie.
","I would have given a better rating if the film had been better edited. Many scenes were too long, and just needed to be cut down a bit. The The basic story was one that has been done many times before, with all of the updated CGI and other high-tech trappings we expect in movies today. The effects were really all that carried the film, and they were excellent. Unfortunately, I think after spending all that money on the cool graphics no one wanted to cut out any of it - so the scenes all went on just a bit too long. James Cameron has achieved something of a god-like status in film-making, and he needs to find an editor that can stand up to this and clean up the footage properly. Cutting this film down from 160 minutes to 130 minutes would have produced a work that was clean, tight, and right on the mark.",7,1,3,23 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An excellent film, but needed more editing!
","A bit too long - no need for this movie to be the 3 1/2 hours it was. The first two films were so good, we know this one could have been edited down to under 3 hours!  Minor changes in the plot, but basically true to Tolkein's essense.  Top-notch action scenes, superb graphics, one of the best films of 2003!",8,0,1,24 December 2003
V for Vendetta," A thrilling mix of intense action and character development!
","I was initially hesitant to see V for Vendetta. It was written by the Wachowski brothers, and the only other work of theirs I have seen was The Matrix. I liked The Matrix, but it was difficult to follow, and I didn't want to get sucked into another multiple-movie storyline where the only good film was the first. I went to the movie based on the IMDb rating and not only was I not disappointed - I was thrilled! This film has lots of action, but the characters are fully fleshed out. You find a great deal of empathy for both Evey and V. The social commentary was not overpowering, certainly less so than many other films I've seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it!",9,2,4,26 March 2006
