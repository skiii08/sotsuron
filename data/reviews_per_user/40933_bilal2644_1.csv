It," Waste of oxygen
","This movie was just awful. It was not scary, the characters were dull and did what the plot told them to. The acting was awful, but that's expected of kids. Never going to watch a 'Stephen King' movie again. That's 2+ hours of my life that I won't get back. You're better of watching some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles than watching this bad screenplay and writing.",1,23,47,11 September 2017
