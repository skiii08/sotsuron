The Incredible Hulk," It's all the Hulk should be.
","Not the best movie ever made, but it doesn't disappoint.The performances are all quite good, Tim Roth's in particular. Though his character isn't overly deep, his acting certainly makes him interesting. Norton's portrayal is pretty monotonous and boring, but considering the character he's playing is a scientist that's trying to keep himself from getting excited, it works.The fight scenes are well done, and really the best part of the movie. Why else were you going to see a Hulk movie anyway? A slo-mo running scene (which you see in the commercials) seems a bit cheesy, but it's not overdone so I can look past it.The CGI... could have been better. But this is a movie where the main character is CG, he has a lot of screen time, therefore you have a lot of time to examine him, and any CG will be clearly fake after that much examination. He's a big green monster, I don't expect him to look real anyway.Overall, pretty good. The story of the Hulk isn't a great one in my opinion, and they've done about the best they could with it. It would work for someone coming in fresh, but has plenty of geeky tidbits for the nerds like me.",8,4,7,15 June 2008
