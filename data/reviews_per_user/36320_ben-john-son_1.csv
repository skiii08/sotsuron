Ghost," Interesting idea but....spoiler alert it isn't very good.
","Although this movie is regarded as a classic I just didn't find it to be as great as everyone else seems to think it is. It's an interesting idea but the are a number of flaws with it that I feel we're very easy to spot and leave the film quite problematic. First off, when Patrick Swayze's character becomes a ghost he's able to sit in vehicles, ride subways, sit in chairs yet unable to touch or move any other objects. Next, there's an scene where Patrick Swayze is following his killer home, the killer walks into his apartment and leaves the door open, as Swayze walks into the apartment he closes the door, as a ghost, which leaves you to wonder why was he suddenly able to touch an object when he wasn't before and why did this killer decide to leave his door wide open. Swayze's facial expressions and acting were absolutely terrible and took away any emotion I was supposed to feel for his character, while Demi Moore had scenes that left me wondering if she decided to make those choices herself or someone else on set had a hand in it (in a good way). Overall the movie is problematic but an okay way to waste two hours on a movie that's known as a top film from 1990.",4,0,3,14 December 2019
