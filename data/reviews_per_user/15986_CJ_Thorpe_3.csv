Requiem for a Dream," An unflinching, dark, gritty exploration into the life of an addict...
","An unflinching, dark, gritty exploration into the life of an addict with no hope and no positivity. It still holds up as perfect example of excellent film making. Every shot is purposeful and conveys the emotional impact of the situations on the characters. No second is wasted. The pacing builds with the film, beginning with long, slow scenes and becoming quicker cut as the tension builds. The soundtrack mirrors this progression, starting with orchestral pieces and moving into more aggressive electronic sounds. After about an hour of the slow build the film then just repeatedly punches you in the gut for the remaining 30 minutes and leaves me, for one, feeling empty inside after and I love it. This is what cinema should do make you feel.The themes of dependency run throughout the film. The addiction to diet pills and television that Sarah Goldfarb suffers from parallels the drug addiction of Harry and Co. and are shown to be equally as destructive, both mentally and physically. Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sarah Goldfarb is superb. During a scene where she is explaining her crippling loneliness her lips quiver and break into the occasional, subtle, nervous smile, which is a something that you just don't see from lesser actors. Each scene with the young cast (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) is juxtaposed with a scene of Sarah to further show how any addiction has the power to control you and it is the lack of control that ultimately takes your life away.The film is littered with extreme close up, quick cuts of drug taking which reflect the constant, unescapable repetition that the characters live. I could probably write an entire essay about the genius of 'Requiem for a Dream' (I have barely mentioned the cinematography, lighting or sound design) but ill stop here for now.",10,2,3,2 September 2017
Wonder Woman," Just Google photos of Gal Gadot instead
","Just Google photos of Gal Gadot. It'll be quicker and more enjoyable as looking at her is the only worthwhile thing in this piece of crap movie. I made it 40 minutes in then had to turn it off. The first half hour is all exposition told in the driest way possible. Maybe it gets better, but Im not willing to waste anymore time to see.",3,6,16,2 September 2017
Mother!," A relentless stream of visual oppression
","Last night I saw 'mother!' And it was pretty damn great. It was a relentless stream of visual oppression that just doesn't give up. An observation, told through metaphors, of the dangers of letting other people into your relationships; the dangers of fame and obsession and of oversharing; all told through a heavy biblical allegory. If you liked the trailers or want to see just because J-Law is in it... don't. This almost certainly isn't the movie for you. The trailer is extremely misleading. But if you want to watch an exploration of these themes through dark symbolism and imagery, then go for it.",9,2,10,21 September 2017
