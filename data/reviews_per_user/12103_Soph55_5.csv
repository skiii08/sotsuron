Casablanca," Casablanca
","This movie was excellent, I really liked the comedy in all of the seriousness. I thought despite all of the politics and revolt, that this was a beautiful story of love, and struggle. The relationships between all of the characters was amazing, the way they all just seemed to belong together in this time and place, in these situations. though all of the characters work to pull the wool over each others eyes and keep out of view of the Germans, in the end one large scheme pulls everyone together and allows everyone to end up where they belong. Through Ricks many connections in Casablanca he is able to run a money making business that also acts as a safe house for exchange of things not so legal at this time, and brings him a part of his past he would of much rather lived without ever remembering again...Ilsa. In the end nothing is really what it seems...",10,4,5,3 March 2011

It is a brutal reality check of what our futures may hold, a world of struggle and hurt that we can not even fathom.

Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","Annie Hall is the story of a quirky couple and a New York mans inability to be in a long lasting relationship. We start off with this small dorky man who is afraid of everything, who over and over again has failed at relationships, and he meets this eccentric young women who throws him through a loop. like other Woody Allan movies there are some unique directing techniques such as characters who stop to talk directly to the audience and so on, but Annie Hall is an excellent romantic comedy that everyone can relate to. This movie is full of good laughs and colorful scenes that contain the good and bad times in a relationship. This movie brings to light so many things that a couple goes through that not everyone gets to see.",8,0,0,10 May 2011
The Graduate," The Graduate
","This movie definitely tested the waters of New Hollywood. After years of censorship directors where once again free to show no mercy. This story is full of unsurity, sexual affair, and seduction. when a young man falls in the bed of an older married woman things get complicated, but the get even worse when he falls for her daughter. through false accusation and jealousy a young Dustin Hoffman fights to get his girl. This movie has a little of everything, it is comedic, unexpected and completely out there, but it was colorful visually and in context, as well as completely interesting and impossible not to pay attention too. This movie is surely one i would see again and again.",Null,0,0,10 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain
","This movie is bright and happy, beautifully colored and sang. The story itself is of becoming someone in a town where it is offal easy to be no one; Hollywood. These starlets fight to be at the top and do an amazing performance throughout. not to mention the comedy and adorable love story that all take place in this beautifully done musical. I, myself truly like musicals and this one was fantastic by my standards. I was surprised with the quality of the color and sound and just the brilliance of the comedy. the whole musical was a crazy run around with so many things happening all at once, you couldn't not pay attention. In conclusion you could say i really loved this movie, though it had its moments all and all it was truly spectacular.",9,1,2,10 May 2011
