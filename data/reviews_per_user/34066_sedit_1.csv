Captain Phillips," Boring drab movie, shaky and devoid of details cinematography
","This movie has been shot using the currently faddish 'realistic' way.Actors look like everyday persons, without any spark nor charisma.The picture is drab, devoid of details, shot too close with a shaky camera, making it look as some news coverage rather than an actual movie.The movie itself is slow paced, with very tepid action (sometimes), and mostly very unlikable characters.Tom Hanks is good, of course, but him alone cannot save a movie which is a big yawn from start to, well about 75 minutes which is the point I gave up, not being able to take any more.Maybe it gets marginally better on the end, but it's so flat and uninvolving that I did not want to waste any more time with it.",1,16,45,9 January 2014
