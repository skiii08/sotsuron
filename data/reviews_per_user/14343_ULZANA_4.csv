The Blair Witch Project," overhyped overacted and overhere!!!!
","I HAD WAITED 7 MONTHS TO SEE THIS FILM I EVEN WAITED UNTIL MY BIRTHDAY TO SEE IT AND IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN.SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE NOT SLEPT PROPERLY SINCE THEY HAVE SEEN IT, WELL I'M SORRY BUT I NEARLY SLEPT THROUGH IT!!",2,0,1,30 October 1999
The Green Mile," SUPERB RENDITION OF 'KING' NOVEL !!
","This is the best film i've seen since THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. The acting,script,atmosphere and story were quite simply BRILLIANT.Tom Hanks was at his finest in the role of the chief of The Green Mile (DEATH ROW)with sympathy for the inmates but with a proffessional attitude to the job.The story surrounds one particular inmate John Coffey(Michael Clark Duncan)who has the ability to remove pain and suffering of those around him.We are quickly made aware of the fact that although most of those on death row are bad people the real monster is the new young warder Percy Wetmore played with fantastic menace by Doug Hutchison.The execution scene of one inmate bought home the sheer horror of what happens when man plays god.Given that the film runs 3 hours it would have been easy to get bored at times but due to the marvellous direction of Frank Darabont this was never the case. Top marks to all concerned and shame on the oscar committee for not awarding this film 'best film' status.This can only be because American Beauty had the word American in it..............",10,0,1,15 April 2000
The Lion King," The best animated film ever made
","The film is quite simply the best ever cartoon to hit the silver screen. The voices, music and story line (including an ecological message) make it stand out in this genre. Kids will still love this film in 50 years.Timon and poomba should have one best supporting animated creatures at the oscars!!!",10,1,2,6 June 1999
Gladiator," a pleasant romp through ancient rome.
","I have waited for about a year to see this and was not disappointed. The direction,effects and action sequences were at time mind blowing.Russell Crowe plays the lead with refreshing understatement and reminded me of Richard Burton at his very best.The story is very very loosely based on the last days of the Roman Empire but allowing for some poetic license we were transported to a time when life was cheap and the contentment of the mob was paramount.The film even had moments of humour especially from Commodus the errant son of the Marcus Aurelius but it was his evil which was superbly portrayed by Joachin Phoenix.This probably wont win the best film at next years oscars, due to it not being about life in modern America but i doubt i'll see a better film this year.",9,0,0,25 May 2000
