The Blair Witch Project," The most disappointing film I have ever watched.
","I believed the hype about this movie and really wanted to see it. I nearly went into Manhattan to see an early limited screening at an independent theatre. I am so glad I did not take the time and effort to do that. I waited a week and saw it at a local theatre. I convinced my wife that this would likely be one of the best scary/suspenseful movies we had ever seen. Holy S_ _ T! This was quite likely one of absolute worst movies I have ever paid to see in a movie theatre. I was 30 years old when I saw it, but I can guarantee you that if I was 20 years old I would still have the same opinion. I am a movie fan and have seen many independent films. I enjoy good/clever scary movies. This movie was neither clever, scary nor entertaining. A complete waste of time. I seriously considered requesting a refund.",1,3,4,5 March 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," A little disappointing, but worth watching.
","This movie was a bit slow at times but was okay for a Saturday night at home. John Goodman was of course very good in his role. The story was basically pretty good but overall lacking something. I found it to be less entertaining than I was hoping it would be. I guess the trailer and reviews had me convinced/thinking this would be a great movie. In my opinion it was good, but not great.",6,0,0,5 March 2017
The Witch," A painful experience to sit through.
","This movie, in my opinion was not worth watching. Not scary, not clever, just pure nonsense. I enjoy a good scary movie and this was not it. I cannot understand how this movie garnered a 6.7 rating. I have seen movies with ratings in the 4s and 5s that are much better than this depressing sad film. If I had gone to the theater to see this I likely would have walked out before it was over. I was ready to turn it off but my wife wanted to see it through. She regretted her decision. For the life of me, I cannot understand how anyone would find this movie appealing, enjoyable or a 'good scary movie'. My recommendation if you are thinking about watching this movie is to watch a different one.",2,3,8,31 October 2016
