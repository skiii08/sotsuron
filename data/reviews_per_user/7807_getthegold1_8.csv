Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," really good but a little confusing
","When I was a bit younger I saw my parents watching episode 4 (a new hope) And then a few years later episode 1 comes out and I was very confused.But anyway, I must say that this was an excellent movie and I am excited to see the attack of the clones soon.It is good when at the climax so many things are going on at once and it keeps switching to different scenes. The battle between the Jedi and the sith, The war with JarJar, the queen invading and Anican in the ship flying it into enemy base.This is a good movie for kids and adults over the age of 8.",7,0,1,26 February 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Really really GOOD
",This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen! A perfect level of Action and adventure with some funny parts.My favorite scene is the battle! When the eagles fly over their heads and drop rocks on the enemy is cool.Really I would rate it at a 9.5 but it was not an option :| I am trying to think of something I did not like about it but nothing is coming to me right now...well there are some miner things but they are not worth the effort of putting them here.Don't ask me why but I especially like the thing that said 'They come your highness with numbers and weapons far greater than our own' like I said Don't ask me why!,10,0,1,1 January 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," What a storm!
","A storm that covers the entire northern hemisphere, impossible? maybe, Scary to think about? YES!This is a very good movie that has so many things going on at once it gave me a headache (not really)! Everything from burning books just to stay alive too a small boy with cancer stuck in the biggest storm the world has ever seen.also a man falls through the roof of a shopping mall (and dies)and the snow in this movie is waist deep...ON THE STATUE OF LIBRATY!!in short this is an intense movie with good (if not scary) special affects. I would suggest this for ages 13-adult!",7,0,0,18 January 2006
Over the Hedge," Best animation movie ever!!
","I went to see this movie on Saturday. And when me and my friends got into the cinema we noticed that there where more teenagers there than kids (by teenagers I mean 13-18) and when the movie started I knew that it was a movie for all ages. It had the best characters I have ever seen, and I can say that I enjoyed it more than any other animation movie ever. Almost better than the best live action movie too. this is a great movie for kids, this is a great movie for teens and this is a great movie for adults. I can truthfully say that I am 14 and I plan to buy this movie, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, the animation and acting is amazing. The only thing is that some of the jokes may go over some younger kids heads (younger than 10) But other than that this movie is definitely worth buying.",10,4,5,29 May 2006
The Greatest Game Ever Played," The greatest movie ever made!!
","This is most definitely my favorite movie, and, WOW it's based on a true story too WOWI have said in former reviews that true storys rarely hold my attention but this was an awesome movie with hardly any swearing! One of the characters, Ted Ray does say 'I'll be d..med but other than that this movie is empty of foul language, and there is no sex at all.more good things about this movie is that it is realistic! No wow I won by SEVEN shots! No totally fake holes in one.Shia la beuf is also a vary good actor for the role and is believable, This movie is good for kids ages 10-adult",10,2,6,5 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good movie!
","Even though a lot of the good parts where skipped this movie still held up a seven from me meaning that the parts that where in the movie where done really well.A lot of action, a ton of adventure add a pinch of comedy and you've got: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!One of the best scenes is the first challenge but if you haven't read the book you will have to see the movie to find out what that is! (hee hee). So overall this movie is vary good and slightly scary near the end! I highly recommend this movie for ages 13-18 and beyond!",7,0,0,2 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best 'Star Wars' film ever
","I am a huge fan of the entire Star Wars saga but this is certainly the best one that has yet been made.The music was great, casting was excellent and the visual affects where amazing. I also liked this movie because it was sad (don't laugh I like movies that are a little sad). This movie is, However rightly rated at PG-13, (and not just because a droids head falls off every here and there but because of the sadness and huge death toll).So this movie is both excellent and violent and not for children under the age of 13. But I loved it!",10,0,1,14 April 2006
Jurassic Park," an OK movie
","This movie is OK but I don't know why it is called Horror, there is really no reason and it really did not catch my attention.However there are a few good things about it, like the dinosaurs are somewhat real looking, not at all like the first attempt at a King Kong movie! Also I like the cast in it and there is a good level of suspense even in not so suspenseful scenes!All in all it is a fairly average movie but I would mainly recommend it for people over the age of 12 so mainly 13 and up!As far as scary monster movies go I am usually not interested but this is the only one I ever considered watching again.",6,1,5,3 January 2006
