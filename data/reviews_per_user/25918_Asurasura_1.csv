The Equalizer," Silent, brooding and Kick-ass
","I liked the movie. I enjoyed its entire run time except the finale. It spoiled the entire build up of the story. If the Villain killed some of the Home Depot employee's it would have ended spectacularly but we get too much of Deus Ex Machina vibe in the end. One man can't save everyone. Sometimes when a war's started there will be casualties. Denzel may be calm, precise and deadly but he too can't kill 10 people with a single sniper shot. Chloe grace's acting was good but I liked the actress who played Chloe's friend. She really looked the part. This is not a full blow by blow action movie. I realized when I saw the trailer that I have to savor the silence and enjoy the mayhem. Becacuse silence increases the violence level.",Null,0,1,15 November 2014
