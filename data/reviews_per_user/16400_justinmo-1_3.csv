Come and See," Unforgettable snapshot of fascist war atrocities
","Set in Nazi occupied Belorussia during WW2 'Come and See' tells the story of one boy who joins the Soviet partisans, of his mother's despairing appeals for him not to, of his whole family's death in the Nazi reprisals on his village and his struggle with hate, guilt and the extremities of mental stress in its wake. In an amazing, almost surreal, piece of cinema technique the effect of being deafened and shocked by an artillery barrage is portrayed in the soundtrack, muffled and indistinct noises emerging from moving mouths. Apart from this personal story this piece of late Soviet film-making attempts to capture a 'typical' atrocity of those times in the fate of another village, and largely succeeds. It ranges from the black comedy which the Soviets found in the behavior of their oppressors, a German motorcycle rides through the village with a corpse with a sign on it warning of the fate of partisans; but no-one sees it because it's raining and everyone's indoors; through exacting military historical detail - a Focke Wulf 'Owl' reconnaissance plane slowly tracking through the sky is the recurrent motif signifying German presence - down to collaboration and partisan atrocities in turn. It makes it's devastating comment in the final credits when it names how many hundred Belorussian villages suffered the same fate. A magnificent piece of realistic film-making about a repellent and compelling subject.",9,4,7,17 August 2005
Enemy at the Gates," A fair beginning; Hopefully the first of many films of the Russian front.
","The story of a duel between a Russian peasant enlisted man sniper and a Prussian aristocratic Nazi officer sniper during the WW2 battle of Stalingrad. Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev, the Russian sniper, was very real; but some doubt has been cast over the historical truth of the personal duel. Because it is a member of a much too rare breed; movies about the most momentous land battle in history, the Russian front, this movie falls short on many levels, it tries to give some sense of the scale of events, and early on it succeeds; but it retreats before the sheer immensity of its historical context into a personal story; and in the end it's almost as if the war has stopped so these two can shoot at each other. Other than that it weaves historical content into a human story, the nature of totalitarian regimes and the indifference to human life that the Red Army displayed early on, the Party involvement in morale making, the front line role of women etc; it was enormously refreshing to see a story told from the Soviet side; almost all prior movies on the subject were Nazi-sided (See Peckinpah's - Cross of Iron). It also contains excellent action shots; making the humble bullet a mighty dangerous object again, as it should be. Though it falls down in not being able to devote enough money to huge battle scenes (almost every German vehicle sighted is stationary); and so cheats on a real sense of the battle, it's good for what it is. Those who like historical war films can only hope that the true balance of land fighting of WW2, ie: the Russians with some help from the Western allies toward the end; starts to be reflected in cinema; at least Enemy At The Gates has given a start.",7,1,3,30 April 2005
Vanilla Sky," Excellent movie, makes a brilliant innovation of a worn clich√©
","I realized how highly I thought of this movie only on the second viewing when I couldn't remember how it ended. It is coherent without being transparent, a great achievement in movie storytelling. I remembered several endings as the movie unfolded; all of which were true and none of which were the conclusive one. It takes many twists and turns, all enthralling and ends with the worst twist in movies, 'It was all a dream.!' but that's not the end of it either. I thought of a joke that I must share.Variety may be the spice of life but Vanilla Sky is the splice of life. You have to watch it really to get that. A great movie I reckon.",7,1,2,26 November 2004
