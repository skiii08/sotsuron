The Hangover," Where were the cue cards?
","a negative rating, if there were such a thing, would be too much praise for this abomination, but I digress. I apparently never once saw the cue card guy with the 'laugh' sign, walking back and forth at the bottom of the screen because I don't remember knowing when to laugh, or even chuckle once during this trainwreck. Maybe the film producers need to work on making that cue card guy a lot bigger??That this piece of excrement, and even that is too complimentary for this concoction of matter, is rated so highly on IMDb just reinforces so much of what is wrong with this planet today. The fact that this detritus ranks even in the same solar system as Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather (any part), Schindler's List, 12 Angry Men (the original, of course), The Good the Bad And the Ugly, Lawrence of Arabia, Even Guardians of the Freakin Galaxy, speaks volumes as to how far we as a race have sunk! I'm ready for the ELE to hit reset so we can start over again. Maybe the cockroaches can do better next go round?",1,1,3,26 June 2016
