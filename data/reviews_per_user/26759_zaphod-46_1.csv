The Blair Witch Project," I hated it
","I'm sorry, but I really hated it.There are already tons of plot summaries, but here we go :Three people, in forest. Get lost. Lose map. Get scared. Get more lost. Get dead. Oh, and swear lots. And lots.And that really is it. I spent the entire film wishing that they could at least point the camera forward not at a point 6' in front of their feet, that maybe they'd breathe a little quieter, so we could hear the noises that were supposed to be so scary, and that most of the wandering around in the daytime had been cut.Oh, but the last 3 seconds made me jump. The rest of it just made me (and the rest of the cinema) laugh. However. As another reviewer has already pointed out, why didn't they just follow the river? Anybody that stupid -deserves- to get mutilated horribly in their sleep.If there is a sequel, can we let Ruggero Deodato direct it? There's a man who really knows how to shoot a film about missing film makers....",1,0,1,3 November 1999
