Hereditary," A lot of gimmick but still felt empty.
","Because it's so easy to spoil this film, I'll make my review general. The pacing is too slow. I'm all for movies that take their time, but by the 4th long slow pan I was bored and done with them! The movie steels a few frights from other movies such as the exorcist, and if you haven't seen it and all the other movies this one borrows from, you might very well enjoy them. Lastly the movie does certain things without explanation. It's almost as if the filmmaker said to himself, 'it'll look freaky if the son does this weird thing, or mom does this weird thing. It explains most everything, but there are some definite holes. 'E' for effort but not an elite horror film, sorry. Unless once again, you've never seen one before.",5,0,0,16 October 2018
Annihilation," Great ideas, Great performances, but...
","The movie feels watered down by its brilliant ideas. It might of been better with a narration and something more in the ways of a Terrence Malik film with strong visuals and performance and maybe just a few of the ideas in this film handled more firmly as a thought piece. Instead it has more of a patched up watered down effect overall. Because the individual elements are so much better than the whole, I still had to give it a 7. It is worth a viewing.",7,0,0,19 January 2019
