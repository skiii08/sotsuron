Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THE WORST OF ALL...
","Before TPM was release back in 1999, I had so much hope and anticipation built up for this movie...I had always envisioned what had happened before EPIV-VI, but never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be so MASSIVELY disappointed.  First off...You would think after 16 years, Lucas could come up with some a little more interesting that a TRADE FEDERATION plot...WHAT is up with that?  Then, at least he could have cast someone with a little acting ability to play Anakin...instead we get a kid that yells 'YIPPEE' every five minutes, and can't act if his young life depended on it. To make things worse, we get legendary WOODEN performances from Liam Neeson, and Ewan McGregor.  And why in the hell is Samuel Jackson IN THIS MOVIE???  I don't see a character...I see SAMUEL JACKSON....but the worst of all the worst is the most embarrassing thing EVER put onto the silver screen...JAR JAR FREAKIN' BINKS....This alone is enough to turn off even the most diehard SW fan...Why in Gods name did Lucas have to totally destroy the SW legacy with this thing?   What purpose does JAR JAR serve?.  Why does he talk like that?  The questions in my mind go on and on.Now, back to Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin...I realize that this is a child actor playing Vader as a boy, but for heaven's sake, could you ever imagine Vader at ANY point in his life saying 'YIPPEE' or 'THAT GOT HIM' or anything like that?  I could NEVER imagine that, but apparently George ' boy this beard sure does make me look intelligent' Lucas thought that these were the perfect lines..As I write this, I am debating HEAVILY on whether or not to waste my time and money on Attack of the Clones...I may give Lucas one more chance, but if this movie is as AWEFUL as TPM, I will NEVER even think about seeing anything about Star Wars that happens to come out in the future....",Null,0,1,15 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What is it with the housecoats?
","Why is it that in Star Wars everyone wears a housecoat?   Obi Wan wears one, the Jawas wear them, Vader wears one...WHAT IS  UP WITH THAT?  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy SW after all these  years, but frankly, my enjoyment of the movie has just deteriorated over the years.  I first saw it when I was 8 years old...and now, 25 years later, the magic isn't there anymore.  The special effects are so antiquated now that they look FAKE, the dialog is HILARIOUS, the battle sequences are PREDICTABLE, and the acting...well, let's not touch that one.  I do however, still enjoy John Williams' soundtrack, even though it has been rehashed OVER and OVER in the following movies.If it seems that I have a bad attitude about SW, I guess that is due to the 2 'prequels' that have been released.  Phantom Menace has basically ruined everything I ever enjoyed about Star Wars, TESB...and I never liked ROTJ in the first place....BUT, I used to regard SW as one of my favorite movies of all time. Now it is just an afterthought...Thanks alot, George Lucas...why, OH WHY did you ever have to release the prequels in the first place??!!!",7,1,4,15 May 2002
