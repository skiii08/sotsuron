Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Definitely lacking that *spark*
","There were several things that annoyed me about this film, and I'll simply list them as follows.The list will contain *spoilers*Queen Amidalas voice.  Now yes Natalie Portman is drop-dead gorgeous but there is definitely, DEFINITELY something wrong with her voice that has to be mentioned.  Why I dont get is that while she was Queen Amidala her voice transcends from being nice and sweet (padme) to a very hoarse and deep sounding (almost masculine) one.  Its highlighted when she says 'I have to go back to naboo' 'We'll have to rely on negotiations' and my favourite 'Get to your ships!'Im interested to know if anyone else has noticed that.  It was just too prevailing for me to look (or hear) past it.The notion of having the force being systematically butchered down to a biological level is just too fantastic too bear.  With all the talk of symbionts at the start I was just waiting for something to appear that was on a parasitic-type level.Oh yeah, when Obi-Wan Kenobi is trying to catch up with Darth Maul and Qui Gon (after he himself has been kicked off the ledge) to obviously try and get to Maul before he kills Qui Gon, why doesnt he use that ability that both of them displayed at the start to catch up...You know, when they had to escape those rolly poly droid things with the shield generators....they moved at Warrrrrrp speed.Those damn droids!  WHY WHY WHY!  I realise its a kid film and we cant show humans getting wasted by lightsabres (well not all the time) but robotic Ducks?Jar Jar Binks wasnt AS annoying as what some believe him to be, but Anakin definitely was.  For starters the kid cant act and why did Lucas Make him C3P0's maker?  Does that mean that Luke Skywalker is C3P0's brother?  So if we try and work out the odds that the two of meet up the way they do in 'New Hope' one would think the odds would hover around the 1 in a trillion mark.Also Samuel L Jackson didnt seem content with the fact that his role was VERY minor, so therefore he mustve felt the need to overact a bit.  My Favourite part is when one of the Jedi Council members says :'Impossible!  The Sith have been dead for a millennium'and Samuel goes 'I do not think the Sith could have returned without us knowing'...... ...But Samuel gives a big ehhhhhhhhhhh before his line, as if to give the impression he's contradicting the previous council member's statement, when in fact he's agreeing with it....watch it and see...and be confusedIan McDiarmid cant act either......since he looks no where even close to what he did when he played Palpatine in the Return of the Jedi, I think Lucas could have gotten away with using someone else (Albert Finney, Jeremy Irons........Cuba Gooding jr)The only parts I enjoyed were the middle and end lightsabre Duels with Darth Maul.......sigh, and he's only in it for about 10 minutes.  However he probably gives the most in-keeping-with-starwars-tradition performance out of everyone.......and he's not even an actor...he's a martial arts stunt double!He was pretty tough though, not too many people can go crosseyed and give a whince or too after they have been cut in half by a lightsabre",Null,0,1,6 February 2000
Glory," The greatest movie ever
","I mean how in gods name does a cinematographer get the effect that Freddie Francis did?  One of the tricks with any of these things is forgetting what you think is good and doing something that you think the audience will think is good.From the beginning scene when Shaw says charge Bayonets, I knew this was going to be good.  The other good thing about this film was that we just saw enough of the confederate army to know they existed.........and that was all we needed.  For example, in Gettysburg, I didnt know who the hell I was barracking for at the end of it....oh yeah it was cr**p too (they tried to fit way too much in and I liken the actor roles in that film to the substitutes on a bench during a footy game who finally get a run).Ok so what else was great about this film.  The screenplay, the story, the actors, especially the hundreds of African American extras who played the soldiers of the 54th Massachusets.  You really begin to bond with them right from the start when Shaw is inspecting them and, with their wide smiles, ask simple questions like 'How we look Colonel?' 'We gonna woop the sesesh?' 'When do we get the blue suit?'.I dont care what people say, I think Broderick played his role perfectly. He's almost unrecognisable in his role and has an air of maturity around him that you dont see in any of his other films (which all sucked).Cary Elwes gets the best scenes though....especially in Fort Wagner when he's waving his sword above his head an giving the most inspiring war cry you'll ever see.  The good thing was is that his character was easily likeable and when we see him kicking a** during the battles, you cant help but cheer him, and the rest of them on.Congratulations to Zwick for the way he ended the battle.....it was poignant in respects but completely in taste......especially since we all know what happens.Coupled with the score, Washington's performance, and Freeman, Braugher (is it just me, or does he play a waif in almost every film he is in?) and Kennedy, this movie is not one to be missed.
10/10  Simply because my mind does not have the capacity to think how this film could have been better......However.....When Shaw is admonishing the Quartermaster.....doesnt it look like he keeps peering down at the desk to read his lines?In that case the film gets 9.9 recurring",Null,0,1,21 August 2000
The Patriot," Load of hyped up grotesque bulls**t!
","Oh dear oh dear
Geez, thank god the Yanks had Mel Gibson on their side otherwise the entire course of histroy could (heaven forbid) be different!
Whilst I am not going to complain about this movie's historical inaccuracy, their are other SERIOUS problems with this movie that must be addressed. May contain *spoilers*For starters, we are lead to believe almost immediately that the American war of independence was an act that started purely by an oppressed nation hell bent on ridding themselves on the ferocious tyranny of the Naz........woops BritishWhen we see Mel Gibson and his children walk outside and the big regalla is happening, Im quite happy that the scriptwriters made sure the men burning those two mannequins called out 'Hang King George'.........to make sure that we new they were doing something in line with the overexaggerated load of patriotic fervour surrounding the whole film (I think he just had a fetish for burning things actually).  Oh yeah, dont forget when Mel Gibson tries his hand at comedy when calling out 'All hail King George' and were made present to a bunch of hollywood nobodys, each wanting to make sure they make the most of their limited camera time by acting truly upset by the comments made by Gibson.  The  proceeding constant references to how the Redcoats 'Deserve' to die, when each of those drunken yobbos lined up to answer their calling made me almost sick.Im sure Isaacs character would really have been scared when Gibson goes 'before this war is over Im going to kill you' .........Im surprised he was able to contain himselfOh dear and what else narked me about this film.............The speech given by the girl in the church (mind you she wont be giving too many more)The way the British Soldiers were portrayed.  I mean, this whole Idea that the American Revolution consisted of backwater rebels fighting lines of redcoats is a complete fallacy and Emmerich did history no justice in this film.We're also lead to imagine the british soldiers simply as a bunch of rigid lines of muskets with legs.......who have no brains and are only good for marching in solid formations across completely open fields.......it makes you wonder how the hell they do the real complicated things like flanking and stuffIm just really glad the British dragoons got their fair share of action, and that Heath Ledger copped a beauty by Isaacs (best death scene ever.........and funniest).Hahahah oh yeah, and look out for the extremely very very very interesting and non boring beach wedding scene.............man, it was Pam and Tommy I tell ya!Dont waste your time or money with this load of crap",Null,1,2,11 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Probably the best of the series
","I for one was not as impressed with Phantom Menace as what everyone else was, and to attempt to compare it to the original Star Wars blockbuster is to compare chalk with cheese.This film highlights the ability of one person with vision to manifest something remarkable that has, for twenty years now, defined the way movies (and their soundtracks) have been made.This movie begins in a period where a civil war is occurring between the Galactic Empire and..............man....you know the rest
It will be too easy to say what is good about this film........what is bad about it?If you try real hard you might be able to find something, possibly the lightsaber duel could have been better, but that would possibly be about it. What is easier to do is to compare it with Phantom menace and basically say what is better about it than its well........pretty woeful counterpart. Story, acting etc.....The problem with making a star wars film nowadays, apart from the ludicrous expectations being put upon Lucas and co, is the fact that any actor, especially those in minor roles, will be trying to make as much an attempt as possible to highlight the fact that they are in a Star Wars film.  It was obvious with the pod race scene in Phantom menace, the crowd members were practically cheering TO THE CAMERA!!!!!!! And dont get me started on Samuel L Jackson.............even Yoda wanted to make sure he got his fair share in
Basically you cant say anything about this film expect that it is possibly THE greatest film ever made.",Null,0,0,16 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Not as good as the other two
",I didnt like this film as much as they other two basically because it was the middle of a trilogy.  We were left with too much to hope for with Return of the Jedi (which incidentally is why I think most people dislike Jedi the most).The assertions that the lightsaber duel in this was the best sword fight in movie history would probably be true if you hadnt already seen Princess Bride.  However other parts that irked me about this one is the fact that Hamil seems to have aged quite considerably going into this film.. It was a pretty big jump from New Hope to this and I just dont believe it stacks up next to New Hope.....especially without Guiness playing a major role.,Null,1,2,16 September 2000
Gladiator," Ben Hur for the twothousandies Contains SPOILER
","In looking at Gladiator one can easily identify with the many other epics made concerning the rise and fall of the Roman Empire as well as everything that went on within.It was only a matter of time before a movie like this came out, since nowhere can I ever find a movie at the video shop concerned solely with gladiatorial comba.The nineties and twothousandies is a period now that is demanding that in order for a film to be classed as 'in epic proportions', the film must be something to rival everything that has preceeded it.The problem nowadays is that everything has been done before.  I for one hate being told by the baby boomers that 'they don't make them like they used to anymore'.  So am I supposed to simply yield to the fact that, just because 'A night to Remember' was devoid of the technology necessary to make it truly spectacular, that it is a better film than James Cameron's 'Titanic'?  Of course not..The same can be said for Gladiator.Although one has to put their films in perspective:  back in the old days when movies like Spartacus came out, the expectations of the audience fell heavily upon the abilities of the actors.  Nowadays you don't have to necessarily have good actors in your film, just bankable ones.However the casting in Gladiator was so near-perfect that it should have its own category at the academy awards.Although we could tell Russell Crowe was having the best time of his life, he didn't need to show it in order for us to enjoy the film.  Thats where a lot of actors can literally make or break a film.  Too many times in films we see 'bit' actors playing 'bit' parts trying to upstage everyone else. Those men playing the roles of the gladiators didn't try and make themselves out to be superheroes through mean facial expressions and such........rather they played their role as they were supposed to.....not trying to draw attention away from what was meant to be happening.  Basically its all about actor's needing to know their place.Russell Crowe was as he should be in this film, brooding, and solemn.  One of the creepiest moments of the film was when *SPOILER*, you here him inform the soldier about how snow makes your sword stick within its scabboard, just before he cleaves his head in two.Joaquin Phoenix was looking slightly heavier in this film and played his role well.  I'm wondering what sort of surgeons back in Roman times could have done such a good job with his cleft palateRichard Harris was looking more and more like Obi-Wan-Kenobi with every camera shot, and Arana played his role well as Quintus (you remember....... Frank Portman from 'the Bodyguard').All in all a pretty good effort by Ridley Scott, especially with the casting.  Although some people may find the ending a bit disappointing the rest of the film holds its own.",Null,0,0,5 May 2000
The Birds," History isnt kind to a film's special effects
","Histroy hasn't been especially kind to this film with regards to the outdated special effects but look beyond that for a brief second and one can truly see the horror that is apprent in this film.Basically put, I dont know how to describe Hitchcock's films.Psycho was terrifying......but why......I cant really say.  A lot of it was to do with its cinematography and its being shot in black and white, but one of the things that made The Birds such a surreal horrer film was what it lacked ........a musical score.I never thought I could be scared of the gradual build up of a bunch of ravens on a childrens playground set, but the way Hitchcock shows it is nothing short of genius.   The scene of the man in his house with his eyes pecked out also works well as a prelude for things to come",Null,0,0,24 September 2000
