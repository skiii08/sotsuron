The Avengers," Trash... excess of effects... completely boring
","I spent the worst twelve bucks of my entire life buying the ticket to watch this movie. I had to get out of the theater because I couldn't handle such amount of trash... Sorry for the Marvel lovers, but this movie sucks, from beginning to end. I bought the ticket taking as reference the 8.7 average the IMDb meter published. Completely disappointing. From now on I'll take more care when trusting that meter, or actually is not IMDb problem, but it's the perfect example of how humans can be dumb enough to love such an insult to the story telling job. Or is a movie made just for the Marvel geeks?? But really, I think its just business. For those who seek profound stories, this is not the one, at all. You'll regret for sure if you watch the movie. A considerable huge amount of the film is war, explosions, sound-effects. In not a complete enemy of cinema effects when they are used for good, like Avatar, but, this time is empty from bottom to top. I guess it's just the way of making business and earn a lot of money. It's ironic, after watching the movie (part of it) I started to believe that humans were made to be ruled and submitted, even when we deny it. And loving this movie is the example.",3,5,21,20 May 2012
