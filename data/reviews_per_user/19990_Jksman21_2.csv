Requiem for a Dream," awesome,disturbing,thought provoking,great
","Having instantly becoming one of my favorite films after my first viewing.Marlone Wayans character Ty is one of his best performances in a serious film seein he mostly is seen as a comedian.Jared Leto is excellent and changed my view on him as an actor.Jennifer Connlly also does a great job as her character Marion.but nothing compares to Ellyn Burystns performance as Letos character Harrys mother Sara.She did an excellent and most disturbing performance.In general i thought the film was very good even though from what i heard it was rather low budget. The life of an opiate dependent person is one of desperation,sorrow and pain causing them to go to extremely desperate means to get there fix.The addiction pushes them to do just about anything to get there drug stealing from loved ones pulling off or attempting robberies and just about anything else one can think of to get a quick couple bucks. What most people don't realize is that some of these people are extremely talented and intelligent people.The film in some ways shows this.It all starts off rather good with getting a little high just for fun then the dealin to make a few bucks and to try and reach there dreams.Then the pretty realistic downfall of the characters as every one knows is the truth of what happens to a strung out drug addict.Ty getting arrested spending more money than you can earn the increase in the habbit your life falling apart and the hopelessness and desperation that is destined to follow.Heroin sold them dreams and destroyed not only there dreams but there lives.All in all i did think and still do think it is a great film and recommend it to those who like a realistic drama of a movie in which you don't get a happily ever after ending.Also not for the faint of heart.but if you can handle it i can guarantee you won't soon forget it.",Null,0,1,29 October 2004
Trainspotting," good,entertaining film
",trainspotting is a great movie with colorful characters and good story line.renton(aka Rent boy)is an awesome character who speaks strait out about his thought's and views concerning his mates and his life in general.He is the main character and the movie is primarily centered around him.The film is about a group of low life Edinburgh youths and there escape from reality through the use of heroin.The film though quite humorous is also rather serious from the mishaps of rent boy sick boy and spud the pshycotic violent and criminal out bursts of begbie to the tragedy of tommy's fate.The only part of the film that i was kinda disappointed with was renton ripping off his friends but at least he makes good with spud by leaving him a small cut.I did highly enjoy this film and do recommend it to others who enjoy this type of picture. Enjoy!,9,0,1,29 October 2004
