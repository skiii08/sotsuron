Penelope Cruz and Ian mcsahne more than filled in admirably in their roles as Blackbeard and his daughter admirably.They couldn't have found a better area to film the scenes for the fountain of youth; Hawaii was the perfect place to film the scenes s for the fountain of youth.I really have to get Hawaii.All in all Captain jack did not disappoint in his 4th go around in search of the fountain of youth. I give captain jack 7 out of 10 stars",Null,0,1,18 July 2011
The Town," Ben Affleck and his crew do a standard bank job but don't realize until after its done that the bank manger can eyewitness one of his crew's members tattoos
","My movie going interest lead I to go see the town rated R. A very well done drama writing and directed by and starring Ben Affleck, Blake lively, and the reliable Jeremy Renner.Ben Affleck went back to his home town of Boston to write, and direct this gritty drama about the city of Charlestown, where the local employment trade is bank robbery among its citizen's. Ben is the unofficial leader of a cast of characters lead by Jeremy Renner. Ben and Jeremy are best friends in this well written drama. A monkey wrench gets into the work when been falls in love with a female bank manger from bank they held up Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). She can identify a tattoo on the neck one of Ben's crew. What ensues is some very tense and well done acting involving Big Ben Blake lively,Jeremy Renner,and Jon Hamm as FBI agent Adam Frawley.Some of the best scene are involving the car chases in the very narrow streets of Charlestown's, I'm still trying to figure out how they did some of those stunts... I love they how they used Fenway park as back drop for a fantastic shoot out scene. They did a admirable job using the town itself to get a real feel what it's like in the bank robbing capital of Boston.I thought the combination of the cast back ground of the city, story line makes for a good time at the theaters. I give it 4 stars.My blog is http://www.thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/",Null,0,0,14 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry and his friends set out on their final adventure.
","I was at my friends place one day back in 2000. His girl friend now wife was reading was reading a book and I asked what it was. She said it was harry potter. I was like whom? She had this amazed look like you don't know who harry is. Needles to say I was talked into going to see what all the fuss is about with this harry kid. Let's just say I was hooked when I left the theater. The deathly hallow didn't disappoint in this action adventure fantasy with Harry (Daniel Radcliff) and his friends, Hermione Jean Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Wesley (Rupert Grint).The deathly hallows picks up with adventure of harry and his friends trying to finish professor Dumbledore's work with conquering the evil dark lord voldemort's.They are in search of the Gacrux's special amulets that can drain the dark lord of his power and destroy him. The kid's receive items that were left for them by professor Dumbledore,and went on a journey with these items to find the horcruxes.In their travel's to find the horcruxes they discover clues hidden in the items they were left to them by professor Dumbledore's will. They did manage to add some funny scenes they have this potion that they can change into anyone they want they just have to take a piece of that persons hair. When they were attack at a wedding they had to take off.When they took off they ended up in England. Hermione had this little purse; it looked like 12 inches by 12 inches. Hermione would pull out a change clothes for all 3 of them, and when they were in the wilderness she pulled out 6 or 12 mantent. Throughout their travels they keep running into people the dark lord voldemort's sent to capture them.It makes for some exciting scenes in their quest to conquer the dark lord.Like how they bring together the cast from the other films to tie everything tighter. Ralph fines looks very comfortable in his role as the evil (dark lord voldemort)I enjoyed the use of the special effects from the evil wizards changing to the kid drinking a potion to change how they look. The talk about a familiar face dying happens in this chapter hmmm..lol.I left the movie saying I can't wait til the final chapter. I give Harry potter 3 stars. Would I go Yes",8,0,1,5 February 2011

","The wolf pack heads to the far east Bangkok, Thailand for more mayhem in this comedy block buster sequel directed by Todd Phillips. This Bangkok party runs 2hours and stars Bradley Copper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bertha.The second bachelor party starts out on beach having a toast to stu EdHelms) for his wedding. The guys wake up the following morning in a seedy motel (let's just say it's not anything you will find on Travelocity) with everyone's favorite gangster mr. chow past out under a blanket.Stu's face tattooed, Alan's (Zach Galifianakis) shaved head and stu's future brother in law is missing somewhere in the city of Bangkok.

If this happens here we would have to pay few hundred dollars spend a few hours in the Er if we are lucky. I want to know how Doug manages to stay out of all the trouble the guys seem to get into together.The one thing that stood out for me was the beautiful scenery of Thailand. However, based on what I saw of Bangkok, I don't think I'll be putting Bangkok on my list of places to visit any time soon.All in all it was good film great cast funny / safe script. I give the wolf pack trip to the Bangkok Thailand 3 stars.",Null,0,1,3 June 2011
Super 8," This sci-film is about a group of friend's wannabe films makers doing a class project at a local train station when they witness tragic train accident.
","I have to admit this wasn't a must see for me right away considering JJ Abrams previous monster movie clover field, the constant camera moving gave me a headache. I 'm glad i decide to go see super 8. This sci-film is about a group of friend's wannabe films makers doing a class project at a local train station when they witness tragic train accident and what happen afterwards. JJ Abrams did a wonderful job crafting a classic sci- fi horror movie that keeps you on your toes the whole movie. This film stars Kyle Chandler and introduces some fine young actors, Joel Courtney, Ryan lee, Elle Fanning. Super 8 is written and directed by J.J. Abrams and is just shy of 2 hrs.J.J. Abrams latest project set in the 1970's in a small Ohio town where there nice quiet existence is shook up by a train wreck, and the mysterious cargo that was being transported through their town. The story revolves around a young man Joe lamb trying to adjust to life after the death of his mother after a work place accident. He finds solitude with his friends filming a movie for a class project. While filming their class project they witness a train crash and make a pact not to say anything, because they weren't supposed to be there that late at night, kids what you are going to do with them. The military leap's into town to clean up the mess and hide what there transporting across country. The boys get the film developed from the night of the crash and discover the military is transporting something looks like it belongs to area 51.While trying to figure out how to finish their film lots of strange things are happening. The mysterious train cargo goes about stealing power lines off poles, car batteries, people, and the towns pet population is disappearing.The one thing that stood was the acting. The cast wasn't filled with any really big names but that didn't stop the quality of the story being told. I love how you saw the story unfold in the eyes of the children throughout the whole movie. The use of the small town as a back drop for the film adds to the appeal/ charm of the film, and the story line involving the kids and their quest to find out about what was on the train and why the military was so interested in the cargo.I can't understand why JJ Abrams is so hush hush with his projects he does good work for the most part You really didn't know what to expect in this film because he is so hush hush. I think if he marketed it more it might have gotten a lot better press.I thought JJ Abrams did a wonderful job crafting a classic sci –fi film not a lot special effects, more story driven. I have to hand it to Mr. Abrams he did a great job here. I give it 3 stars.",Null,0,0,18 July 2011
Thor," This about Thor the god of thunder and his arrogance the makes his father banish him to earth to find out what it takes to become a leader.
","My summer of the superhero kicked off this week with the god of Thunder Thor.I was a little skeptical they could pull it off with Thor not being a well know character. I have to say they pulled it off very well. This action adventure drama starring Chris Hems worth ( Thor), Natalie Portman( Jane foster) the always entertaining Sir Anthony Hopkins as(Odin king of Asgard) and Kat Dennings(Darcy Lewis)for just the right amount of comic relief . Thor runs for 114 minutes and is directed by Kenneth Branagh.The story line surrounds Thor and his arrogance and recklessness by disobeying his father Odin. Thor decides to confront the frost Giants after they attack the castle while Thor's coronation is talking place. In doing do Thor reignite's an accent war among the frost giants from before he was born. In doing so Odin takes away Thor powers and banishes him to earth so he can learn the true meaning of leadership. I enjoyed the story line around this film, because he is not a real well known superhero unless you are a comic book geek.They didn't take the whole idea very seriously to the point of overdoing it. The acting was very well done. I was glad to see they brought in some talented actors to help build the story around. They added just the right amount of humor to the story about Thor and his quest to learn on earth what he needs to ascend to the throne of Asgard.Thor goes onto a local dinner has breakfast with Jane and drinks a cup of coffee and say's I like this drink I want more and smashes it like the a Viking. Thor walks into a pet store and demands a horse to go in search of his hammer, and the store keeper looks up with a look like how much have you had to drink. I thought the scenery of New Mexico was great choice because that where they found Thor's hammer in the end of iron man 2 .The design and special effects of Asgard was amazing. Anthony Hopkins looked very comfortable in his role as the King of Asgard. The biggest thing that stood out was how they built Asgard. That was amazing scenery how they built the world of Asgard, the city bridge going to earth and the 9 realms. Tom Hiddleston added just the right touch of evil as Loki. He didn't take his role to serious to the point it might have been considered over acting. The one thing I noticed was the only tie into the avengers in 2012 was Erick Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) made a reference to a scientist he worked with who was studying the effects of gamma radiation. I was kind of hoping for an appearance of one of the other avengers. They seemed to realize what they had to do bring the mythological god of thunder to the big screen. They accomplished it very well with the cast, scenery and the script.I think Kenneth Branagh did a commendable job pulling this story together and giving the movie going public a very enjoyable 114 minutes.I definitely give it 3 stars.My blog is http://www.thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/",9,3,6,14 May 2011
X-Men: First Class," the young x men learning about their abilities during the time of the cold war cuban missile crisis
","School is in session for the latest x men class at Professor Xavier's school for the gifted. My summer of the superhero's made a stop with the x-men first class. This action sci-fi I drama stars James McAvoy. Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon, and Emma Frost. The new first class runs 132 minutes and is directed by Matthew Vaughn.This story is set in the 1960's with Charles Xavier and Erik lensherr and the young x men learning about their abilities during the time of the cold war Cuban missile crisis. This film bring s back characters raven/ mystique played by (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy/ beast played by (Nicholas Hoult) from previous films. The first class introduces Banshee played by (Caleb laundry Jones) havoc played by (Lucas Till), Darwin played by (Edi gathegi). They are brought in by the cia to help prevent a chance at possible nuclear war aka; the Cuban missile a crisis of the 1960's that is being fueled by fellow mutant and mischief maker Sebastian Shaw and his crew of trouble making mutants.While talking a tour of the cia hank show's Charles a machine he invented called cerebro. It s' meant to help find other people with similar powers like them. They go about finding other mutants such as Riptide( Alex Gonzalez),Angel Salvador( Zoë kravitz), Jason Flemynug Azazel), Banshee(Caleb Landry Jones), and Havock (Lucas Til). They find out that a fellow mutant Sebastian Shaw ( Kevin Bacon) and his cohorts Riptide( Alex Gonzalez) Jason Flemynug ( Azazel) and the beautiful Emma Frost ( January Jones) have their own plans to create world war 3. The struggles the x men took to learn and harness there abilities with the help of Charles Xavier was very well told.The story of magneto from the time he was a child in the prison camp to his obsession with Sebastian Shaw, who murdered his mother right in front of him as a child took on batman begins type tone.He sets out across the country to find clues and discover who he is and take revenge on Sebastian Shaw for his mother's death.I enjoyed the films use of the script to mention the future. They had a scene where a young hank was showing Charles cerbo. Hank asks Charles are you sure you don't want to shave your head before you use it Charles say s don't touch my hair. Charles makes reference to him teaching and says before you know it I'll be old and bald. The cameos of Huge Jackman/wolverine, and Rebecca Romijn / mystique add to the appeal of the film. While Charles and Erik are out looking for mutants they come across wolverine in a bar they introduce themselves wolverine just looks at them says go F yourself. Rebbecca Romain shows up when a young mystique tries to seduce Erik and she asks do you like this side of me.I have to admit the one thing I didn't like was Kevin bacon as a villain he didn't cut the mustard as a far being a villain. Other than that they did a great job bringing the x men franchise back to the beginning excellent script, acting , the use of old news footage to reenact the cold war. I think it was the best marvel film I have seen so far. I give the x-men first class 8 out of 10 stars.",Null,0,0,18 July 2011
RED," Bruce wills and his CIA pals set out to find out who is after them.
","I attend the opening weekend release of Red based on the graphic novel of the same name , rated pg 13 not meant for the kiddies This movie stars Bruce Willis a retired CIA who is bored with his hum drum life as retiree of the CIA.The team includes Joe Matheson(Morgan Freeman),Marvin Boggs(John Malkovich), Victoria (Helen Mirren) and Ivan (Brian Cox).Bruce wills looks at home it this action comedy plays a retired CIA black ops agent (know as RED retired extremely dangerous). He is bored with his hum drum life,regularly rips up his monthly checks just so he can call the CIA pension office just to talk with the person in charge of his plan... played very well by Mary- Louis parker. He is set up for assignation from the higher ups in the CIA for what he knows about and old job assignment and his crew of ARRP assassin's were involved in back in the 80's.(I thought the CIA was supposed to be the good guys what gives here). He is hunted down by the CIA agent William cooper (Played very well by Karl urban) who is assigned by the higher ups to hunt down Bruce Willis and his pals. They come across a conspiracy theory involving VP of the United States, and Alexander Dunning (played by Richard Dreyfuss pulled of the villain role very well as nasty arms dealer).Throughout the movie Bruce Willis and his band of aarp hit men travels across county to put clues together to find out why they want them dead. It a very well written movie and, the cast looks like they are having a lot of fun just acting like kids shootouts, kicking butt. They do a very good job with the traveling scenes. They don't keep it confined to one area. They travel across country and utilize various locations to add to the fun of the movie... I especially love john malkovich's as Marvin Boggs a crazy as a fox agent. John steals some scenes in the move that are just too funny to describe here. I like how they use post cards on the screen to tell the audience where they are heading. I thought it was a fun movie, good casting. The best thing you can take from it a fun afternoon at the movies well worth your trip and 2 hrs out of your day. Plus age is just a number if you want to have fun.I give it 3 stars.My Link is http://thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/",9,0,0,5 February 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers : Dark side of the Moon
","So who is with me and giving up on listing to some of these so called critics who bash our comic book movies? I say if you're a fan of the transformers show or any other comic book film franchise stand up for it and let your voice be heard. This sci –fi adventure transformers : dark side of the moon stars Shia Labeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington –Whiteley, and PatrickDempsey.It's directed by Michael Bay and runs 157 minutes.Going into this film i was hoping it would better then revenge of the fallen and it went way beyond that this film was a home run. The Transformers : Dark side of the Moon centers around the autobots learning about a cybertronian spaceship that crashed landed on the moon during the war on cybetron between the Autobots and Decepticons, this space ship holds a secret that could have help the Autobots defeat the decepticons.The secret is held inside an accent autobot leader Sentinel prime who crashed on the moon and prompted the space race of 1969 between the USA and Russia.Sam's life picks up after transformers 2 living in Washington DC trying to find a job after graduating from college living with his new girlfriend Carly(Rosie Huntington –whitely).Megan fox and victories' secrets model Sam is one luck guy.This secret brings SAM (ladies man 261) witwicky back into the fold of the war among the auto bots and decepticons. While working at new job he meets a co worker jerry Wang (ken jeong) who has inside info to the spaceship that crashed on the moon and knew Sam had connections to the auto bots. He gives this information to Sam in an awkward but funny bathroom scene wrestling around in a bathroom stall. When on the way to give this info the CIA, which is headed up by Charlotte mearing (Frances Mcdormand) Sam is attacked by the decepticons at every turn.Sam realizes after some digging what the plan actually is and all hell breaks loose. It's all starts with his girlfriend Carly being kidnapped by her slimy boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who happens to be an allies of the decepticons and helping them get the secret from the crashed spaceship on the moon.You know regardless of what people think of all the special effects being used nowadays this is one film where it is necessary to explaining the story and bring the characters to life. Michael bay did an outstanding job of bringing this final chapter to life from the battles between the auto bots vs.decepticons to the attack on the CIA facility, and the attack on Chicago and everything in between.If you're expecting any Oscar worthy performances here you went to the film and wasted your money. This is a typical sci- fi action adventure lot of explosions gun fire, buildings collapsing, and aliens. He did a good job adding some new faces to the franchise; it didn't interfere with telling the story at all. Ken Jeong (the hangover) John Malkovich (red) added just the right amount of humor as Sam's co worker, and lunatic boss.Frances Mcdormand felt like she was there all along from the beginning and what can you say about Rosie Huntington –whiteley she made me forget about Megan what's here name.If this indeed is the final chapter in this wildly successful franchise you can say it really went out with bang. It didn't disappoint one bit from beginning to end. I give Transformers: Dark side of the Moon 7out of 10 stars for putting a great product on the big screen.",Null,7,11,18 July 2011
The Fighter," The true story of junior welterweight Irish boxer Mickey ward and his brother dickey.
","The Fighter  I have to say all of the hype and advertising for this film was not  just hype without substance. This well done sports drama is directed by  David O. Russell (three kings, I heart the huckabees). There is plenty  of substance to go around staring Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale,  Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams.   The well done film is based on the life and times of junior  welterweight Irish boxer Mickey ward and his brother dickey a has been  fighter in his own right who had one claim to fame supposedly knocking  down sugar ray Lenard. Mickey is part time boxer from the small town of  Lowell Massachusetts trying to make it big is managed by his chain  smoking mother Alice Ward played by Golden globe winner (Melissa Leo)  Mickey's biggest problem is that he hasn't be able to put aside his  feeling for his family for what's best for his career as a fighter.  His crack smoking Brother Dickey and his mom seem try to take control  his career. As a way to make up for the screw up they had with dickey's  life and career. The performances from mark Wahlberg, Golden globe  nominated actor's Christian bale and Melissa Leo has live up to the  hype for their nominations for acting and film awards. To make things  more interesting for momma Mickey takes up with beautiful bartender  Charlene Fleming played by Amy Adams. She tries to convince Mickey to  take an offer to train ft and get paid in Vegas. The family becomes  very over protective of their little meal ticket and tries and bullies  the family outsider. It made for a good scene on the porch of her house   The back drop of the town was home run it was a perfect setting a back  drop for the story of a regular guy trying to make it big in the boxing  world. The biggest part of the acting for me is Mr. Christian bale. He  has never to shy away from the type of roles that seem stretch him as  an actor. He took to his role as crack addicted ex boxer perfectly. He  gets thrown in jail in one part of the film and has to dry out from all  of the drugs... just a wow scene.  I really think this movie deserves all of the press it's getting for an  Oscar. The screen play, cast, setting of film is a tremendous film. It  is winner and a must see. I give it 4 stars.",10,2,4,23 February 2011
