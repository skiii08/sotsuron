10 Cloverfield Lane," the cloverfield monster was tact on and unneeded
","its hard recommending this movie, because while the script and acting is pretty good, the ending is just nonsense. i understand the writers wanted to tie this into the other cloverfield movie, but it just ruined an ending that could have really sold the movie. its about 3 people trapped in an underground bunker together, and the mystery is whether the man who 'saved' them is actually a hero or a maniac just keeping them there. and all of a sudden, aliens. okay? terrible ending, just terrible.",4,0,0,30 November 2017
