Changeling," I am so sorry Clint
","The one and only problem with this movie is that Angelina Jolie played the leading role - I must say I cannot understand why Eastwood would cast her as the protagonist for this film - It was impossible to identify with Jolie as the mother of a missing child and although everything else about this film is top notch - she just can't carry it off and for me personally, she ruined it. I'm sure that Eastwood must have had a change of heart after he started working with her and realized that with all his fantastic directional skills - he won't get anything out of her- what a pity. If Angelina Jolie wins the Oscar for this hapless performance, I will eat my hat.",3,9,27,31 December 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," enjoyable schmaltz
",I saw this film at a premier on Friday and although it was 3 hours long I enjoyed it immensely. The premise of the story is of course unbelievable but the way Fincher carries it off is so believable that one forgets. Both Pitt and Blanchett perform their roles to perfection and Tilda Swindon gave a wonderful performance as well. The cinematography is just what I expect from Fincher and altogether the film is very well done. If you go with reasonable expectations you will definitely get your money's worth. It will surprise me if the film doesn't win an Oscar for something. My only reservation is that Benjamin Button somehow does not really confront his handicap as would be expected from such a dire situation and the audience is not given any insight into his troubled psyche.,8,0,1,5 January 2009
