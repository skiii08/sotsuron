Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you don't want to know what happens - you shouldn't have gone to see the last one.
","If you've seen the first three (or is it last three?) Star Wars films then you know what's going to happen and so the surprises in this film won't be very surprising at all.That said, this is a very entertaining film, the opening was wonderfully nostalgic and the political plotlines mean that it will provide interest for older viewers.  There are also heap-loads of impressive CGI effects and a plethora of action sequences, not to mention the appearances of many familiar faces from the other Star Wars films.But on the negative side, it's becoming more and more tricky to tell movies from video games these days.  This film, for example, provides unlimited eye-candy and you often feel as though you're watching a video game.  Some of the characters, notably Jar Jar and his people, are also similar to video game characters - they provide amusement but they really couldn't exist in the real world.  Alright, so they'll shift a fortune of merchandise, but sci-fi should be about genuine, interesting characters, not cash cows. Darth Maul, whilst impressive and sinister, is completely wasted and really serves little function apart from to fill the merchandisng void currently unoccupied by Darth Vader.  Maul killing Obi's fellow Jedi couldn't have been more forseen.  And those possum-faced robots were pretty silly, and spoke in completely unimpressive, unrobotic voices.Overall this is a lot better than I'd been led to believe by the critics. It's a wonderfully nostalgic trip down memory lane and it's fast-paced, non-stop entertainment.  But it really doesn't stand up to closer scrutiny.",Null,0,1,23 August 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Like all recent Hollywood dinosaur films, this was made without care or interest.
","Coming up with something to rival the first Jurassic Park film was going to be tough, but this film doesn't even attempt to do anything of the kind. The Site B idea is just contrived, and as the other island wasn't actually destroyed in the film then there's no reason why they couldn't have returned there.That is not the only problem, however.  Far from it.  True, the film starts promisingly with some gritty direction and some interesting characters, but they're soon forgotten as special effects take over.  The dinosaurs are as good as ever, but there's no sense of wonder surrounding them - they're just taken for granted.  And the sense of danger has gone.  The best scene, involving a cracking window, doesn't even involve dinosaurs.  Most of this film is just played for laughs.  And the climax (anti-climax) involves the feeblest monster-in-a-city scene I've ever some across.Though this film is, admittedly, entertaining at times, it has a weariness about it, as though everyone involved was doing no more than making some money.  With films like this it's no wonder sequels have some a bad reputation.  Mind you, it's certainly a lot more watchable than that '98 Godzilla advert for merchandising garbage.",Null,1,8,29 October 1999
Jaws," A landmark film.
","Far from being a monster movie, this is a realistic and gritty example of a town which relies on summer trade having its beaches invaded by a dangerous shark.  There are genuinely suspenseful sequences, a first-rate soundtrack and believable people.  The character development of the three men in the boat shows there's a lot more to this film than just a rubber fin.  I'd recommend this and Jaws 2 to any fan of drama/thrillers.",Null,66,123,15 March 2001
