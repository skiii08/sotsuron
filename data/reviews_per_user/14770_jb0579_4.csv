First Man," You've got to be into the subject
","I'm torn. What do you say about a well made, well directed, and well acted movie that bored the tar out of you? That was bad? It WASN'T bad! That it was unrealistic? But.....it WASN'T unrealistic! What one has when it is rendered down to the basic elements is that if a person is interested in the spacerace or into Ryan Gosling, it's a good one to see. Gosling never seems to disappoint and here is yet another example. He makes it look effortless, and he is so handsome again I just want to hire a Batman villain to invent something to swap faces with him! Let's see you mop up at the box office with MY face Gosling! I digress. Claire Foy nails the understated calm of her screen persona as does really the rest of the cast. The special effects were on point, and i will say that a couple of the action scenes, for example the opening one, were truly riveting. There's another scene wherein Armstrong and another astronaut (I wont say who) are in trouble and need a solution, and I had to pinch myself lest I start believing I was there in person! But this is where I start struggling to dish out accolades. Not because there are no more deserved, but because despite all the above I found myself fast-forwarding. I didn't get invested in this movie like I did in Apollo 13, the movie to which everyone on earth to a person knew that this movie would be compared. Or Damon's movie the Martian, where the leading man's vulnerability and believable self deprecating humor were so endearing. So that's I guess why this one isn't resonating as the others did, and I don't think anyone can really blame anyone for that. As I said before: you've really got to be 'into' the subject matter because despite getting good grades in direction, plot, screenplay, cinematography, and acting, it just lacked that extra something. And that's why I opened with the question that I did.",6,0,2,10 February 2019
Léon: The Professional," Masterpiece you say? No, but Close.
","I won't bore you with a long plot synopsis, just to say that Reno plays Leon, a contract killer who informally adopts Matilda (Portman), a young girl with no place to go and fortuitously becomes aguainted with Leon the 'cleaner. Matilda becomes bent on avenging her family's murder, particularly that of her innocent little brother (the rest of the family is either abusive or uninteresting to her). Oldman's character as a corrupt cop becomes the object of her ire, and with help from a reluctant Leon the two set out to settle the score. What I will say is that I was BLOWN AWAY with the fact that, for all intents and purposes, this was the first big screen job for Portman, who was fragile, tough as nails, timid, bold, nervous, and even provocative - all at the same time. Oldman is just plain Gary Oldman. Effortless, believable, awesome as always, and charming even though his villainous role demands he not be, and you can't HELP but to fall in love with Jean Reno, who steals EVERYTHING he does. The beginning of the movie? Riveting. The middle? Absolutely keeps your attention: a perfect....PERFECT mix of tension and comic relief (which by the way is why I pan a lot of movies. In EVERY real life situation there's at least SOMETHING funny). The movie is at times intense and at times tender enough to evoke tears, if you are prone to that sort of thing. In my reviews I always add ' Scenes to Watch For'..... in this movie: when Portman (Matilda) is desperately knocking on Reno's (Leon's) door for reasons that will become obvious to you, watch her performance there, and the use of light on her face when the door opens but the viewer can't see it....genius direction and use of light. Another scene: the comic relief every time you see them march up the street carrying a plant for, again, reasons that will become obvious to you. And in general, Reno is perhaps the best actor alive at acting with just his facial expressions. Again....genius. the 'Godfather'? No. But wow, a powerful, powerful movie. Watch it and thank me later...",9,2,3,17 February 2015
Tropic Thunder," better than I expected
","I don't include plot synopses in my reviews as one can find that information elsewhere. Instead, I concentrate on the all around artistic merits of a film, and the quality of its production.  This was a movie I had to make two passes at.  Normally not a huge fan of silly comedy and instead choosing a more cerebral examples of the genre, I started this movie once in 2008 only to put it down for 8 years until I recently pulled it back off the shelf. While I'm not as frothy in my enamor of this movie as many - and certainly not the buddy with whom I finally watched it on its entirety - I will say that I'm glad I stuck with it this time. And I may not have again has I not had an insistent watching partner. It was obvious quickly both the reason why Robert Downey, Jr received a nod for an Oscar nomination and why he was uncomfortable playing his part in the 21st Century version of blackface. But he pulled it off without, I think, being offensive by poking fun at the type of actor who goes to ridiculous lengths to reach the depths of a particular character. Cruise was brilliant, and I'm nobody who usually gushes about Cruise, though when he is 'on' I find him terribly difficult to ignore. Stiller is typical Stiller. One always knows what one will get from Stiller, who directed as well. Jack Black was uncharacteristically under- the-top while still playing his guy large. The rest of the cast is rounded out by reliables like Bill Hader, Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson (hysterically as rapper 'Alpa Chino'.) What struck me over an above the sight gags was the budget they dedicated to the project. Nothing was done inexpensively, a sign of respect for the body of work Stiller is beginning to amass. Not only that but at a 1:47 runtime for the theatrical version and another 16 minutes for Stiller' cut, it's long for a film of its ilk. Look for: a hysterically funny scene in which Stiller has a run in with a Panda, the interaction between Jackson and Downey, Jr., and again, Tom Cruise' priceless parody of film producers...absolutely brilliant. In particular look for the subtle yet unmistakable over sized prosthetic arms on Cruise, as well as the redistribution of his hair from his head to his arms and chest. Again, small things making huge differences.  I'll say I thought it a bit long for my taste - a little slapstick goes a long way for me. But other than that it was hard to complain here.",7,0,4,29 January 2016
The Happening," Seriously?
","Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. If I were a judge, instead of sending people to jail I'd make them watch this movie. I'd only make them way h it once though. Once is plenty. What starts out as impossibly horrible dissolves into, get this, something even MORE horrible. Sort your sock drawer, get a bad sunburn, clean up after the dog.....do anything but watch this....thing. You'll thank me later.",1,1,2,7 August 2017
