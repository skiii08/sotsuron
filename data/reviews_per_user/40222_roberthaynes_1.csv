Black Swan," Perfection
","After the awesome Requiem for a Dream (also one of my all time favourites) he had a small misstep with the somewhat obscure, 'The Fountain' but is most certainly back on his a-game here with Black Swan. Director Darren Aronofsky has crafted a film so perfect, so visually stunning, so intense that it brings to mind the work of some demented artist from a time gone by.Every frame of this film is so perfectly constructed and each performance so pitch perfect that it goes without saying that this has become my favourite film of 2010. Portmans performance deserves every accolade that it receives and Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis also deserve special mention.The editing, the pace, the score, everything this film has on display has been so meticulously crafted that it defies explanation.This is undoubtedly the most beautifully crafted horror film I have ever seen. Deeply disturbing with thematic elements that can be discussed ad nauseum post-film. I firmly believe as a long time horror film addict that this has made the genre relevant again and come Oscar time in 2011 this has my vote all the way.Perfection in every sense of the word. 10/10",10,2,3,28 August 2011
