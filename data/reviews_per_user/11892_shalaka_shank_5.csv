Mission: Impossible III," spy again to rescue a girl
","I watch this movie after seen second sequel. The movie was superb. Actions are very well amazingly picturised. First half of the story is interesting and suspense to be continued for a long period. But second half is going to the way of MI2. I mean Tom this time again fight only for his fianc√©e as MI2 he had ran for only saving her girl. I feared that if MI4 will come on screen the our super hero will fight and run for only any girl. Rather than I sure the story will be same on such plot like whole movie based on only save a girl. The villains, global virus threat(MI2)and action scenes only for attract audience. That is why I called Mission Impossible as Mission save a girl.",5,1,3,29 June 2009
Source Code," Best thriller
","It is a best movie for thriller lovers. I went it for a little expectation. But I greatly impressed by it. The movie put you on your seat until the last moment of end, without heavy actions, cruel bad mans, guns & bullets, lengthy chases and computerised unbelievable scenes. Suspense also last till long and when it is open everyone is shocked. Very good work by creative team. A different kind of sci-fic. As me it is next level of Matrix & Tron. Mysterious train, mysterious lady and what a mysterious plot. I hope for the second part will come soon. Really enjoyable movie must see for every action & thriller lovers.",Null,0,1,1 August 2011
2012," big disappointment
","I was wondered that the movie 2012 is still packed cinema halls in here, India. The movie is not apart from such disaster movies,like Tinanic & others. As me nothing to see new. All escape scenes are unbelievable like a video game. No realty shown anywhere. Even at climax one average audience can not understand where the hero is getting in gears, where are gears? how door open or close. how a piece of wire got in gears. where they used latest technology to build survival ship? This part is very complicated. I also did not understand what is about Tamara who was on the cage of animals? May be I missed or by story this point? I recommended to see ' Matrix( all parts), Resident Evil(all parts) & Terminator(1,2 & 3)rather than 2012. These movies will give you full of entertainment with good storyline to sit to finish the movie until last scene of the movie.",4,2,3,13 December 2009
Mission: Impossible II," The spy survive only a girl not world
",I watch this movie very interestingly. Movie is good. All Action scenes are superb. Story plot is well written. But I don't like the turning the story from a global matter to an individual. I mean that the spy was only running and chased by villain for survive a girl at the climax. It seems that the issue of world surviver from virus goes on and only remain on survive a girl. How foolish !. Therefore such a super spy movie made me disappointing last. I specially write this to read other readers. And let me know their opinion. Apart from this movie that 'Bourne' series is best. I recommended 'Bourne' movies to spy movie lovers. Rest movie is OK. The virus climax should have a long suspense.,5,0,1,28 June 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Must watchable
","I just watch this movie in theater. It is a good & must watchable movie. It has a good story line to last till the end. Well portrayed characters like Batman, Cat-woman & Commissioner Gordon. I praise for the character of commissioner that even his age he does much action than a ordinary young cop. It is most admirable work shown by director. Cat-woman is also fascinating character. Some people dislike her but it is only glamorous part of the movie and essential to less the tension of high voltage story. But one thing is not well that Batman is weak. I never expect such hero from who did most unbelievable jobs in comic books. Actually I am fond of Batman from childhood. Movie Batman does not match with comic hero in many ways like scientific tricks & fearless fights. Bale is very different. As me Batman must be shown a little stronger at least and use some tricks to defeat Bane. Some loop holes also including by story but do not bothered main aim or plot. Climax is good but ending is confused. I really want to see Batman again and let us all hope so. I have an option that Bruce may be rested and Blake should be new Batman. How sounding ? Let director to think.",9,2,9,23 July 2012
