Despicable Me 2," Funny!
","Very good animation, great script very funny and oodles of entertainment not seen part 1 &3 just this and the minions movie, a good franchise,thoroughly enjoyed this second instalment üëç7.5",7,0,1,6 July 2019
Scarface," NOT THE BEST GANGSTER MOVIE, BUT THE MOST ENTERTAINING.
","I have always liked this gangster remake because of the entertainment value, but the movie doesnt seem to take itself seriously enough, theres sort of a tarantino- esque about the film -the screenplay and script comes across as a tad over the top and cartoonish , this is slightly overated compared to obvious other gangster flicks for the above reasons but its a film we will always love for its fast paced story and violence.",7,0,0,26 February 2019
John Wick," Stylish , some good fight scenes, good characters.
","Pretty good film but i think overall its a tad overrated , it has style, quite a lot of violence and an ok script , but it feels like we have seen this before but in a different style and just keanu reeves in the lead this time, again its good in style and keanu is pretty good in this but the story is a little overblown and the pace of the movie lacks that boost of momentum.",6,0,0,17 July 2019
Rocketman," Musical biography thats entertaining and inspiring.
","Ive always liked elton john as a singer and artist most of his singles are catchy and inspiring and in my opinion he still one of the best musicians thats ever lived, this film is poignant , engaging, and exciting , the film focuses on his childhood , his early fame to the peak of his career , his rejection over his sexuality from his overbearing and unloving parents and his close relationship with his grandmother and of course his turbulent relationship with his manager( john reid )and supposed lover who nearly drove the poor guy to drink, drugs and suicide.
The film is very good overall , but i thought the musical within a musical in some scenes was overused and a little pointless, richard madden as elton johns manager -john reid ,of game of thrones and the bodygaurd seemed miscast in this , i thought his performance was wooden and annoying, but taron edgerton gives a believable performance as elton john , and his singing as elton isnt bad either! would like to watch it again when it comes out on blu ray . üëç eltons still standing!",7,2,3,19 June 2019
The Irishman," Ok but definately not in the same league as goodfellas or casino.
","For some reason this film feels belated it looks like it should have been made in the 90s probably before goodfellas (1990) because of the CGI and make up the picture looks false and forced,(visually) the story is definately not original but the script is Ok and there are some OK scenes and of course a great cast ,the violence is toned down from previous entries or it was netflixs influence, this is a more intelligent mature film by scorcese which is bogged down by CGI and over the hill actors putting in tired performances, disappointing but to be honest i half expected this. A generous 6/10",6,0,2,11 January 2020
The Hateful Eight," Not tarantinos best work to date, but acceptable.
","The problem with this movie is quentin tarantino had previously made a western in djanjo unchained (2012) which was an excellent western, so this 2015 effort had a lot to live up to, although the hateful eight is not the best in tarantinos filmography as this film is a slow burner,but the mystery makes this flick engaging, its very well written and the characters are aloof and interesting and there is plenty of violence ,i would like to view the movie again because i think i missed a key scene ,worth a view this effort doesnt ruin quentins reputation by any means. 6.5",6,0,1,31 December 2019
Suicide Squad," Not that good , these comic book adaptions are all starting to wear thin .
","Interesting characters with no plot and with scenes that are predictable with not much excitement , jered leto's performance as the joker was the only highlight, his performance stood alone next to previous portraits of the character other than that the film is flat and unremarkable",6,0,1,14 April 2019
Rocky II," Best of the sequels, rivals the original.
","1979 sequel to the 1976 classic, apollo creed calls out rocky balboa for a rematch for the heavyweight championship of the world.Sylvester stallone directs this time instead of john g avilsden ( karate kid) he manages to keep the tone of the first movie and in some ways surpasses the original in the entertainment department including longer training scenes, and a gruelling last half hour and longer fight sequences , its a bit plodding in parts and the narrative between the end of the original and the end of this is quite low key ,but apart from some dull scenes - stallone, meredith, shire , young and weathers reprise thier roles with aplomb which made the original such a classic .
best sequel of the franchise still √∞≈∏‚Äò≈í",7,1,1,30 August 2019
Predator," EXCITING ACTION/ HORROR.
","This is probably one of the most entertaining movies of all time with schwarzenegger in his pomp, a groundbreaking alien creation that matches ridley scotts vision all the way , the movie has plenty of action, its exciting , with some humour and horror elements, the climatic showdown between arnie and the alien is one the most exciting show pieces in
cinema ever, in my opinion this classic is arnies and director john mctiernans second best entries in thier careers just behind T2 judgement day (1991) and DIE HARD (1988)7.5 /10 ' BACK TO THE CHOPPER ' !",7,0,0,8 March 2019
Man of Steel," Reboot of the iconic character thats entertaining with some minor flaws.
","Entertaining , great visuals , and action, the film takes the same story of the original superman films but improves visually on the 1978 classic although this actioner doesnt have the charm of the original and cavill is not quite christopher reeve ,this superman is much darker than reeves version, basically this flick is a remake of superman 1&2 in one movie , its good three quarters of the running time but the ending does let this movie down, 7/10 , it flys but it doesnt quite soar but on the plus side this entry is slightly better than the following sequels batman vs superman : dawn of justice (2016) and justice league (2017) .",7,1,1,17 November 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL.
","This is still probably my all- time best action film, this movie was amazing when it first graced our screens , the entertainment value is definately there , this is why it tops the original and the film even carries the originals dark theme forward especially with the violence, the CGI looks a bit dated when you watch it now but this classic will always remain timeless.",8,0,2,10 March 2019
No Country for Old Men," Cartoonish - but enjoyable !
","I watched this film twice in succesion and i loved it ! It was original, dark and compelling - a blue collar hunter comes across a bodged drug deal were he stumbles across a case with 2 million dollars , but llewelyn ( josh brolin ) is unaware the money in the case is equipped with a tracking device , meanwhile anton shegar ( bardem ) is the hitman on his trail for which he believes is his ,shegur tracks llewellyn through the transmitter to the device and a violent cat and mouse battle ensues , the film doesnt seem to take itself seriously enough it is a bit cartoonish especially with shegurs wacky haircut and bizzare weapons, and some of the diologue in this movie is darkly funny , i recently reviewed the film after a third viewing i originally give the picture an 8 but after noticing a couple of silly flaws i took a point off , why would llwellyn go back to the scene where he found the loot to give a dying man water? If llewleyn really cared he wouldnt have took the money in the first place and put his wifes life in danger .
Plus the ending is fairly confusing because the ending is very anti climatic but overall its still an enjoyable ride thats relentless in watching",7,0,1,14 April 2019
Foxcatcher," Interesting but UNINSPIRING sports drama.
","Surprisingly the performances of tatum and CARELLüëè are impressive and mark ruffalo always delivers in a serious role, based on true life events about a troubled rich eccentric who souly took charge of the american olympic wrestling team in the late 80s, the movie hits the mark in regards to the story its telling and the characters and events are apparently accurate but it feels like an overblown tv movie with a tragic story that fails to inspire. 6/10",6,1,2,8 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Hard to watch and confusing.
","The reason i was dumb founded with this movie was probably because i havnt seen the gaurdians of the galaxy movies , doctor strange, black panther or captain america civil war, its hard to keep track of this marvel universe , but either way this film was overblown with CGI and in my opinion this wasnt a patch on the first movie avengers assemble, the inclusion of certain characters made the film interesting to watch but overall i would say it was dissapointing with a bad ending.",6,5,10,4 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," On the fence with this one, im going to view it again but it was definately good.!
","The haunting of sharon tate a movie which i recently watched on netflix has ruined the viewing of this quentin tarantino version, im a big fan of quentin i think his films are excellent - every scene is watchable in all of his films , hes a brilliant director and writer with a wicked imagination , he makes art understandable in a movie sense , ive enjoyed watching his movies over the years , and hes the kind of guy i would hang out with , this adaption related to the manson family murders is an excellent concept of mixing his fictional characters with real life characters which works for me and its a new genre which should be explored .....leanardo di caprio plays rick dalton an aspiring but failing actor in the 60s who has a pally relationship with his stunt man cliff (brad pitt ) who seems to be more dangerous than his job title ; di caprio plays the conflicted actor who is trying to further his career whilst cliff the stuntman is happy been daltons stuntman , double and friend , whilst the two characters eek thier way through thier career they become heroes and alter history in the movie time continium which is original , .di caprio uses his usual talent as the failing actor who has his buddy cliff to fall back on , brad pitt as cliff is one of the coolest characters in movie history he has alledgedly killed his wife and got away with it.... he insults BRUCE LEE behind the scenes and beats him up lol priceless , an excellent take on the movie industry and genre conflicting episode üëç",7,0,4,25 August 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," Good gangster epic
","This epic gangster flick is mostly entertaining the story is plausible enough to keep you watching but most of the violence in this film is aimed mostly at women and theres elements of sexual degrigation towards women which will be quite disturbing for some viewers especially women! but all the star performances in this movie are all above par and does hit the mark on a narrative scale its interesting and it makes you bothered to sit through its afternoon long running time, its stands alone opposite other films in this genre including the godfather, goodfellas, scarface, its a different animal. 7/10",7,1,6,28 February 2019
A Clockwork Orange," BIZARRE NONSENSE!
","Well made, well acted post apocolyptic drama, Arty, quite funny in parts but there is no plot or a real story and the settings are always dull and depressing , WATCHABLE ! but overall the film is hard to watch and very overated",6,3,5,30 December 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Good, but not that good.
","Quentin tarantinos debut gangster film that is what it is: a thin plot, profanity, mindless violence, dark humour, and a great soundtrack.
The script is questionable but i suppose the dialogue suits the depth of the characters and the setting of the movie, unrealistic in some scenes, especially the diner meeting at the beginning of the picture, overall a good start from tarantino which i regard more as art than cinema or just a guilty pleasure. 7.5",7,0,1,2 January 2020
Total Recall," Unique , action packed sci-fi adventure with some cheesy effects .
","This 1990 classic is still one of arnies best movies along with the terminator movies, predator and true lies, this overblown sci fi fantasy has everything, unique story, non stop action , its suspenseful and the film is very violent and bloody, the film has always been well known for its body count and excessive violence , if you compare it to most films in the 90s i would say yes ;it was ahead of its time in that sense, the story is based on a book written by phillip k dick , but the book isnt titled total recall , the concept of a man been able to take a mind trip from earth to mars is unworldly but shows how futuristic this movie is , and after several viewings i still dont fully understand the full story of it , its hard to watch , but thats what makes this gem a classic because of its unique story and originality for a sci fi action film, theres also sharon stone as sexy as ever ,as is rachel ticotin as melina, ronny cox as cohagen and michael ironside as cohagens evil henchman richter , schwarzeneggers acting is very bland in this in delivery but his screen prescence was priceless and was a big part of the films success, still one of my favourite sci fi movies but i love it because i still dont get it , another viewing is on the cards ! SEE YOU AT THE PARTY RICHTER ! 7.5",7,2,4,10 June 2019
Rocky," The birth of one of the best characters brought to screen.
","When i was a youngster i always thought the original rocky film was the most boring because when i saw rocky IV in 1987 i thought it was the best film id ever seen because of the entertainment value and exciting scenes.But now im older my opinion has changed completely, when i was 10 i didnt appreciate the origin of the characters cos i was more into the action and excitement in movies rather than the drama , my opinion of rocky (1976) and rocky IV (1985) are now the polar opposite , i think when you watch rocky IV now it is still entertaining but embarassing and absurd.The beauty of the original is the character development and the script and the acting in this is by far the best in the franchise with the exception of its sequel which comes close, the story is plausible and believable, and is probably the most realistic entry in the series, rocky is loosely based on real life heavyweight journeyman chuck wepner who famously - nearly went the distance with the legendary mohammad ali in the 70s but was stopped seconds before the last bell in the 15th after flooring ali with a debatable knock down earlier in the fight.
This film has a lot to offer on an emotional scale you are actually rooting for rocky and theres parts of rockys character that the average joe identifies within themselves ,rockys fledgling boxing career , his romance with his best friends sister, hes a debt collector on the side and has a rocky but respectful relationship with his trainer mickey goldmill.
Rocky is hand picked out of a boxing registrar by current world champ appollo creed on the pretext of his nickname the' italian stallion 'and for the advert of cliche ' david vs goliath on independence day , its a choice that spawned a great franchise and gave birth to films most loveable characters put on screen .",8,1,1,4 March 2019
Sicario," VERY REALISTIC AND DAUNTING.
","This 2015 thriller is one of the most realistic movies i have seen ever! The only problem with the film is that its slightly slow paced and dreary but manages to disturb you revealing underlying evil in the mexican underworld theres not a scene in this movie thats going to make you smile its very grim and thought provoking with a subplot that leads to a memorable ending , emily blunt is sexy and engaging and puts in a very good believable performance and benicio del toro - well, WOW ! he is brilliant in this. 7/10",7,1,1,26 February 2019
Psycho," The 'MOTHER ' superior of horror !
","This original classic manages to cross genres its a sublime mix off horror/thriller and its probably regarded as one of the best films of all time.
Marion crane, a secretary steals 100,000 from her employer and goes on the run , she accidently stumbles upon the BATES MOTEL and she is welcomed by a kindly motel manager with a hidden agenda and a few skeletons in the closet,
The film is the first of 4 movies psycho 2 (1983) psycho 3 (1986) psycho 4 the beginning (1990) this original is definately the best in the series if not in the thriller or horror genre 8.5 groundbreaking ! This film will never be forgotten",8,1,1,15 June 2019
Joker," Compelling, but ultimately disappointing.
","This character study, mainly the focus of the origins and psyche of the popular comic book villain doesnt quite work for me , apart from some good acting performances and a well written script, the picture is a little boring and pretentious, we all know the joker is crazy but this portrayal is too grim and feels too detached from the DC universe, nothing wrong with leaf pheonix performance of the joker ,its different and interesting but too dark for a comic book villain , for some reason this film brought the machinist (christian bale )to mind , but despite the actors great efforts id say its the most unmemorable performance of the actors who portrayed the villain over the years. The movie is like a cross of the king of comedy (1982) and taxi driver(1976) both scorsese and deniro movies , ironically de niro co stars in this.
Could be pretty good if you watch it with an open mind ,it offers something a bit different in this genre but this addition doesnt work for me 6/10 so... so",6,4,14,6 October 2019
Jaws," Hate to say it : still one of my favourite films; in my top 3 !
","This classic is still the best shark movie ever seen by far, yes its absurd in some scenes and its not quite believable - now we all know more about shark behaviours since this film was released and watched endlessly over the years by a wide audience, the film back in the day was deemed a semi - horror film , and it does in some ways manage to propel moments of dread and anxiety and scenes of bonecrunching moments of terror , all the attacks of the shark are set in great colour and setting and filmed with suspense and shock value , the last third of the movie feels more like an adventure movie that entertains throughout with one of the best endings ever in a movie ever seen - overall the film looks dated now and we know how unlikely the shark would behave the way it did , its only half plausible , but we all love the movie for its well made exciting scenes , music, suspense , with genuine horror and dread ,ITS STILL A GREAT FILM ! good acting by all the cast and spot on directing by spielbergThe shark always did look fake though !",9,0,1,13 May 2019
Halloween," My favourite horror movie
","Very scary flick, creepy and eerie with a simple storyline, the suspense and raw terror make this one of the best horror films of all time with a classic soundtrack and an ending that haunts you forever. EXCELLENT!",8,1,1,30 December 2018
Casino Royale," Im not a bond fan , this was the bond film i was waiting for!
","Despite all the bad reviews of this film and daniel craig i think this is the best bond film ever! it was realistic compared to other entries and all die hard bond fans are missing the point of this groundbreaking movie , i remember watching the movies post connery and most of them are downright rudiculous - lazenby in her mss , yes one of the best bond movies but lazenby was unknown and didnt really make an impact but all due respect to george it was a fine effort , roger moore was good casting but his films were almost comedic and werent worthy to flemings original bond , Timothy dalton made another favourite THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS ,but liscense to kill was poor , dalton was good but again he only had to work with what he had and he just seemed like a replacement which seemed disrespectful to the actor, who i think he is underated , then theres BROSNAN, probably the most handsome out of all the bonds casted but the films he was in were all over blown action popcorn movies and pierce seemed to be -moore and connery all in one which ultimately saved the bond franchise then came die another day which nearly ruined the franchise altogether.
So barbara broccolli decided to make a calculated change , find a rough diamond real character who can actually act and who brings realism to the character - ex SAS not the best looking of guys but attractive in his own way , daniel craig brought heart to the part which was clearly missing in previous entries hes not superhuman he can fall in love and get hurt and he brings more grit to the role , it would be no fun been james bond in real life which i think CASINO ROYALE brings across , the film sells to day to day women who hate james bond and phoney wanna be men who claim to be something what they are not , women want realism and excitement which CRAIG pulls off in this fine film .",8,0,4,31 December 2018
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Good, but it seems to fall a bit flat in the second half of the movie.
","The film starts of really well its dark, moody,and suspensful. The first kill is terryfying and the scene building up to that is just as scary, Tina!!!! Freddy hisses from the depths of her garden while she sleeps , she awakes and goes to investigate in her sleep and succumbs to freddys evil in a memorable scene.
The rest of tinas friends including her boyfriend are picked of one by one in there sleep by this revenge seeking razor fingered spectre, there is no happy ending which opens the door for many sequels.
The scenes running up to the ending of the film are confusing in regards to freddy been a phantom and suddenly been brought into the physical world and he suddenly becomes human some of the narrative doesnt make sense ,it does have it flaws including the telephone scene with freddys tongue which shouldnt have included the tongue, spoiled the error of the scene.
Overall a mesmerising groundbreaking horror movie which pulls through despite certain flaws .",7,3,4,30 December 2018
Casino," NOT AS SUPERIOR AS GOODFELLAS BUT MORE ENTERTAINING !
","This 1995 is a loose sequel to the brilliant 1990 hit GOODFELLAS, this time the setting moves from the back streets of little italy to the deserts of the lucrative casinos of las vagas run by teamster and mob bosses , de niro , stone and pesci performances make this a good movie to watch which contains very graphic violence and bad language, this movie aswell as goodfellas are based on real life events which make the stories more engaging and believable , the picture doesnt have the charm of goodfellas or the script even , the story is in this one is muddled and pondering but it makes up for that with the acting and interesting scenes, its a par off goodfellas but manages to be more entertaining, im surprised pesci took this role as his character nicky santoro resembled his tommy devito character in goodfellas too much which begs the question who was more psychopathic ? Santoro? or devito ?the point is i dont think there is any difference . 7/10",7,0,2,26 February 2019
