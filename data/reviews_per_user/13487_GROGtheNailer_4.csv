Hereditary," Might be the best horror film ever made
","I went to see this movie with my adult daughter since both of us really like the horror genre. No regrets, well worth the price of admission. This is a solid 9/10 and it may be the best horror movie we have seen and we have seen them all. I do not want to give anything away so I'll keep it short. Great atmosphere, an awesome sense of foreboding, the acting was stellar and the story itself as it unfolds was amazing. You really should go see this movie.",9,35,67,10 June 2018
District 9," Groundbreaking
","I have never posted a comment on IMDb even though I have been coming here for years. I had to post a comment on this movie after seeing it today.The special effects are astounding, seamless and just so damn realistic. The story itself wraps you into it, you really buy into it, it keeps you engaged through the whole movie. Totally.This is best movie I have seen in the past 12-15 years and it is now in my top 5 movies of all time. Hell, maybe even top 3.Do yourself a favor and go see this. You will be very happy you did.A 10 rating, it doesn't get much better than this.",10,6,13,15 August 2009
Sinister," Best Horror Movie I have seen in 10 years
","I will keep this short and sweet. The main things that did it for me. I have never jumped or have been as startled in a movie as this one. It is not a pure 'jump out at you movie' there is a build-up, there is tension. Lots of tension.I typically do not go to a theater to see horror movies as most are not worthy. This movie is worthy. You will get your moneys worth, make sure to see it in a theater though.Again, scariest movie i have seen in at least 10 years. Excellent acting and story, it follows through to the end (loved the ending). I will say this too, I have never heard a female audience member scream as loud as I heard last night at one point. It was epic.",8,17,29,15 October 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Best movie I have seen all year (so far)
","I see a lot of movies and am typically not an action fan really. This movie is much more than just action, though it does have great action and outstanding special effects.The story-line is interesting, fully engaging and this is Tom Cruise's best movie in quite some time. The plot is solid and I was fully engaged the whole way through. If you are on the fence for this movie, just go, fully recommended and you will not be disappointed.Best movie of the summer and perhaps 2014 so far. I am really picky in regards to Sci-fi but this hits on all cylinders, story, special effects and yes even some humor.I was not disappointed and many times this year I have been. Very good movie.",9,6,12,9 June 2014
