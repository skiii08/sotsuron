Deja Vu," I should have seen it coming. Sci-fi fans: beware. Non-sci-fi fans: plot holes.
","I'm about to ruin this movie for you, but only to tell you how absolutely horrible it turned out to be. If you're a lover of sci-fi, you'll be massively disappointed by all the bullshit science. If you're not a lover of sci-fi, you'll be disgusted by how little sense the conclusion makes.When I first started watching this movie, I loved it for about the first 20 minutes. I loved the main character, I loved the plot. Then, Denzel is approached by a man who invites him to join a 'task force'. The moment those words were spoken, I turned to my father (who was watching the movie with me) and said, 'They'd better not go sci-fi on this movie.' Sure enough, they went sci-fi. Suddenly, the government has satellite technology that isn't even conceptually possible. After watching that for a few minutes, I turn to my dad and say, 'Five bucks says it's actually a time machine.' Sure enough, Denzel pulls out a laser pointer and shines it at a computer monitor, only to reveal that the government actually has time travel technology (yes, he shined a laser pointer into the past...using a computer monitor).So the story progresses from there. The science is relatively sound: branching universe theory, blah blah blah, but then we start to realize that the things Denzel is seeing are actually things that *he's* done. Sure enough, Denzel TRAVELS INTO THE PAST and saves the girl and prevents a terrorist plot from taking place.But here's where the plot simply falls through and the stars fell off for me: Denzel has left himself all sorts of signs and clues after traveling back in time and then proceeds to prevent the terrorist plot. In the 'original' present moment, the clues that Denzel leaves himself are still there (so he *had* to have been there), but the terrorist plot still unfolds.You can't have it both ways, here: either he travels back in time and changes the present, or he travels back in time into an alternate reality. There is no valid explanationAll in all, for how good the plot was starting to turn out to be, I was expecting a much better movie. The two stars I gave this are for the first fifteen minutes or so.",2,3,7,20 January 2012
