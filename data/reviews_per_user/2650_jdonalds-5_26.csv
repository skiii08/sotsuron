Ford v Ferrari," Best movie this year
","Directors can kill a good script, or the movie can be spectacularly well done like this one.I kept marveling at the wonderful sets that made the movie feel like it was the 1960's.There was well placed humor throughout.The CGI was also quite well done.It's been a long time since I've watched a movie as well done as this one.",10,4,9,24 November 2019
Zootopia," Hard to rate
","We enjoyed Zootopia. The story line was good, the dialog was good, there were a lot of things to laugh at, and the graphics were over the top.The only problem we had was we thought 'Zoo' and 'Disney' would promise a video that our six-year-old would enjoy. But this was way over his head, and he is an articulate and smart little guy.We were trying to figure out who the target audience was. It didn't seem to us that kids under 10 would get that much out of it. Ten to twenty year-olds might be bored with it. Adults would enjoy it for the reasons listed above, but in that case it would make sense for it not to be animated.This isn't the first movie we felt the same about recently. We felt The Good Dinosaur hit the same notes.",9,5,9,12 June 2016
The Notebook," A great love story
","This stupid movie makes me cry. That's why I only watch it every few years. It is one of the best love stories ever made into a movie. Sometimes love stories are very sad. This one makes me cry because it's a happy story about love. But we all get old and one day it all comes to an end. We hope the love continues right up until the last minute, and in this story it does, strong and full.I can't think of any way this movie could be improved. The pace is slow but it's correct for this story. The cinematography is great, acting is superb, story is wonderful, casting was perfect, and what is too rare these days the direction was spot on.",10,1,2,9 June 2015
Midnight in Paris," Enjoyed it, in spite of Woody Allen
","I am NOT a Woody Allen fan. I don't like his direction, writing, or acting. But I did enjoy Midnight in Paris.I suppose the main reason I liked Midnight in Pairs is because I lived and worked in Paris from 1978 until 1981. Just seeing all of the views of the city nearly brought me to tears. There is no city in the world like Paris. It is unique in it's beauty, culture, shops, museums, and people. I watched the movie, even after I saw that Woody Allen was involved, just because of the Paris component. But I also found the story interesting, characters interesting, and casting on target.When the movie started I was surprised and disappointed in the choice of how the movie was shot in terms of the color reproduction. It was flat and dull. That made it a little difficult to watch. But I got lost in the characters and story which held together well through to the end.",7,0,0,28 March 2017
Crash," I don't know why this movie was made
","The acting was very good in this movie. Certainly the number of stars was impressive.I can't say much about cinematography because it was simply shot on the streets of a city so no luscious grand sunsets etc. I guess what was there didn't distract from the story. The style did fit the story, it's just that the cinematography didn't stand out as it often does in other movies.I certainly believe all of this goes on in our world. It seems there are prejudices of many kinds. We all can treat each other so poorly. This movie deals with prejudice head on. There was a hint of individual recovery in the movie, but not enough to convince the audience that anyone was making life changes. I just don't understand why it was put together.I don't really care to have each and every bad personality trait or behavior assembled into a two hour showing. As I said there was a hint that recovery and change might be coming, but at the same time that idea wasn't followed through. There was plenty of misguided things going on even at the end to make someone subject to prejudice to become angry. Which I'm sure wasn't the aim of the story.",2,6,10,3 March 2017
Interstellar," For SiFi Fans I guess
","The theater sound was somehow screwed up for this movie. The dialog was very difficult to hear and the 'background' music was way too loud. In spite of that just enough dialog got through to follow the story, but the sound problems weren't the real problem.I guess if you're a serious SiFi fan you might like this movie. I am not a big SiFi fan (other than the plausible Star Trek sort). I didn't enjoy this movie.There was no real foundation for why the earth was failing; you're supposed to guess. There was no background to suggest power sources for space vehicles that would last so long. There was no explanation for how the sleep modules worked. In fact there was no foundation or explanation for pretty much anything in the movie. You were just supposed to believe.There is no preparation for the flight. Cooper is an experienced pilot but the crew doesn't seem to know each other so they spent no time together before the multi-year flight. You're just supposed to accept all of that and look past it.Near the end Cooper ejects himself from his space craft out into space in his space suit. He's in a distant galaxy accessible through a worm hole but the last we knew he seems to have gotten trapped in a black hole. There is nothing but hocus pocus that has him land in a hospital on a space station at the end of the movie; no rescue attempt, nothing. You're just supposed to believe. I don't mind wild scenarios but they have to be plausible at least. Maybe even 50% plausible?I truly had a difficult time sitting through the movie and was glad when it was over. I wish I had stayed home and watched reruns of The Big Bang Theory. The movie was a waste of time and money.",2,5,11,13 November 2014
Man of Steel," Best action movie
","I don't know where the critics heads are. They rate Man of Steel low while the movie goers rate it high.My 19 year old son and I like this genre of movie and have watched most of the big Marvel hits recently. In my opinion this is be best I've ever seen.First I really like that the Superman story didn't deviate very much from the original and older series. You still have Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White, The Daily Planet, and Metropolis. The basic story of how Superman came to be is held in tact. Much appreciated.The action is what impressed me the most. There is plenty of it and the graphics are superb. This movie reminds me of others like ID4 and the X- Men. I didn't mind, as the critics did, that there is little humor or romance. There is no question that follow on movies can fill in those blanks.",10,3,8,23 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Good casting, weak story and direction
","I just have to see anything with Clint Eastwood. Throw in some other great actors like Ed Lauter, George Wyner, Bob Gunton, Robert Patrick, John Goodman, Justin Timberlake, and a few others and you have a pretty powerful cast. Kudos to the casting director Geoffrey Miclat for selling this project to so many stars.The basic story is fine if predictable. The director didn't do anything to hide the fact that it is a predictable story. I felt Robert Lorenz didn't make any attempt to adjust the story board, or perhaps he was responsible for the mess. The story rambled on a bit, was scattered, and lacked depth. A bit of the interaction between Gus and Mickey was quite good, the rest of the video was flat and juvenile. I give it five stars for the actors and acting. 3 stars for cinematography. And one star for direction. Lorenz has worked as an assistant director on a number of great films. Perhaps that is a role he should stick to.Trouble with the Curve is worth a watch. Just don't expect too much.",5,1,1,26 April 2015
Monsters vs. Aliens," great animation, fun story, lots of laughs, 3D added a little
","The best part was the story was funny and entertaining. I laughed quite a lot, some out of the script, and some out of the absurdity of the characters. What blew me away was the increased animation quality. I saw it in the fire, water, hair and clothing. It just keeps getting better each new production.One of the reasons I wanted to see this movie was it is the first of a blast of 3D movies coming out this year. Hollywood seems to think this is the next best thing to draw audiences and I wanted to see for myself.Certainly the technology has improved and the quality of the 3D was the best I've seen. There were a few moments where the 3D effects were pushed to the limit for effect, and many others where it simply fit well into the movie. Overall though I thought it added little to the movie, perhaps a 5% improvement. On the other hand we had to wear the glasses through the whole movie. In the end, even with my interest in the technology, I didn't think it added enough to the movie to be worth the effort and, I would guess, added expense. Let me say it this way, 3D won't be enough to attract me to a movie soon, and I certainly wouldn't pay extra to see it. I'll keep an open mind though and will check on future movies to see if I think there is value in this wave.",9,2,5,29 March 2009
The Intouchables," Fantastic Movie
","The best movie I've seen in a very long time. Having lived in Paris for three years I'm interested in French movies. But it turns out that had little to do with why I liked this movie so much.The relationship between Philippe and Driss is rare, funny, touching, wonderful, and enduring. Two characters, that couldn't be more dissimilar and from different worlds, cross paths and form a bond as if each one was 1/2 of the whole person of the combination.Fran√ßois Cluzet was perfectly cast and acted superbly. Omar Sy, the other half of perfect casting, had the energy needed to make his part shine. I doubt if this movie could have been as good with any two other actors.The music, settings, cinematography, script, and direction came together behind the actors to fill out a truly rich experience.Even better that I learned this was based on a true story.",10,0,0,16 August 2015
Inside Out," Not for young children
","While very well done, and a favorite subject of mine, I felt Inside Out was very good for adults and perhaps children age 10 and up. The graphics were really good, the depth of the psychology was quite good, but the entire movie was strictly that theme and nothing else.The meaning of the movie is easily missed by younger children, and there isn't anything to hold their interest. I can't imagine Pixar will make much money selling toys based on this movie.I took our five year old to the movie. I have six children and this little guy is way ahead of his age for maturity, comprehension, and vocabulary. After the movie I asked him if he enjoyed it and he said yes. I asked if he knew what it was all about and he said no. He then asked me if I knew what it was about. I watched him during the movie and he was squirming, but twice he laid down and it looked like he was going to go to sleep; something he rarely does in the afternoon.It's sort of odd that this subject is covered in an animated movie which is normally aimed at the young crowd, but it missed on that age group. Then it is a subject adults can really understand, but it's animated which is not normally targeted at adults. Even teens, who could easily understand the content, might not appreciate the animation.All in all I find this kind of an odd mismatch.We own the Cars DVD and think that is a wonderful movie for adults and children alike. But I don't imagine buying an Inside Out DVD, or for that matter ever watching it again.",6,9,34,27 June 2015
Legends of the Fall," Very slow and depressing
","I can understand why Legends of the Fall won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The cinematography was certainly spectacular. Also the sets, and clothing were perfect. I can also understand why it didn't win the Academy Award for Best Picture.I don't mind slow videos, but this one was simply way too slow. Not only did it drag on and on, but it exceeded the usual 2 hour limit. Then there was the story.I held out hope all through the movie but it never picks up. I like formula movies, good in the beginning, problems pop up in the middle, problem solved and everyone is happy in the end. But this movie is more like bad in the beginning, worse in the middle, and a disaster in the end.I actually own this movie. I've had it for several years but never watched it until yesterday. Now it will go into the 'sell' pile.",4,2,4,24 February 2016
Gone Girl," Great movie
","This was a great story with several interesting twists. The casting is great with Ben Affleck in the lead and Roseamund Pike in the supporting role. I think it's one of Affleck's best roles. It held my interest throughout the movie with a reasonable pace that didn't lag.I was a little disappointed with the ending (I didn't read the book so don't know if it departs from it). I also saw two logical goofs that grabbed my attention for a few minutes which is why I rate it 9 out of 10 stars. The director needs to pay attention to all of the details, not just most of them. I won't speak of the goofs because I don't want to be a spoiler.",9,1,9,16 October 2014
Django Unchained," Interesting but...
","My evaluation of this movie is it was way too long, the basic story was good, there was a good logical flow of events, the depiction of blood spurting out of those who were shot was way over the top.I don't know how to classify this movie. It wasn't an adventure. Certainly not a comedy but that might be the best way to think of it as you watch it. I suppose if you call it a drama that would be closest but it was so far fetched it certainly isn't a serious drama.I don't have a problem believing that some plantation owners had many slaves and treated them poorly, or even treated them like animals. It sickens me to see that. No man or woman should ever be a slave to another human.What I do have a problem with is Django being such a good shot, with both hands, that he never misses, or never gets hit with many people shooting at him. This is where calling it a drama begins to fall apart.The way Tarantino directed the shooting scenes was simply outrageous. Bullets of that era, and of the type of handgun shown, would not likely pass through a mans chest and come out through is back. Being shot with a pistol wouldn't propel a person backwards. When a bullet hits a person very small amounts of blood would initially splatter at the moment of impact, not the pint to quart amount shown in almost every shot.Near the very end of this long movie Django shoots a woman from an angle with his pistol and she is violently yanked backwards to the point of lifting her feet off the ground.A lot more realism would have helped make this movie more believable. As it is all of that radically inaccurate depiction constantly left me shaking my head.I liked Jamie Foxx as Django and I thought Christoph Waltz was cast well and did a great job. The problems with this movie all came from the director, not the actors or story line.",4,3,4,3 April 2015
Aladdin," I can't find any fault with this great movie
",I very much enjoyed the entire movie. I thought it was a great adaptation from the animated version. In particular the CGI was astounding. I'm sure the monkey was 100% CGI as was the tiger and elephant. The magic carpet had a personality.Will Smith was just as engaging as was Robin Williams.Any diversions from the animated version were quite welcome. I had to laugh when Prince Ali came into town with the whole parade leading him. That was a scene right out of Disneyland parade theater.My 9 year old son also very much enjoyed this movie.,10,3,7,9 July 2019
The Hurt Locker," No story, all about creating tension in the audience
","I can't believe this won Best Director and Best Picture of the year. I thought the main component of the movie was to frighten people in a Hitchcock style. I hesitate to even link this director with Hitchcock though as it failed to even accomplish that task well.The story begins with the action already developed which is a handful of soldiers defusing bombs. It continues through the story, and finally ends with them doing the same thing. Hence there is no story. There was little character development, no conclusion, and as far as I can see no purpose for the movie.Whoever is in Hollywood telling directors to use a lot of camera shake to fake realism should retire from the industry please.I would have liked to see The Blind Side win the Best Picture award. Sure it was a simple story but based on real events. It was uplifting and held my interest much better than The Hurt Locker.I will not recommend this movie to my friends.",4,6,14,14 March 2010
Meet Joe Black," Too long, strange writing
",You'd think with the powerful movie stars in this project it would be better. But the writing and directing left the characters flat or even confused.The main character Joe Black is sometimes full of wisdom and at others can't communicate. His character is quite uneven.Every major character in the movie stares for seconds before spewing out minimal dialog.The movie is quite slow and simple. Had it been 90 minutes in duration it may have felt like it flowed well. At 180 minutes it just dragged on and on.I'm a little hard pressed to understand why such well known actors as Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins signed on for this strange script.,4,1,4,20 July 2019
1917," Not my cup of tea
","I've never enjoyed WWI movies so take that into account when noting I only gave this movie 5 stars. I'm a huge WWII fan though. But my son saw it and said it was good. He and I have similar taste in movies so I thought I'd give it a go. In the end it was a meh for me.The sets were well done. I felt as if I got a good feeling what it might have been like being there. The acting was fine too.I think the single shot style did add something to the movie, but not enough to make it worth all of the extra effort and expense. There were a few times when I wished the camera would pan around but that would have broken the one-shot theme.The theater attendance was pretty light today (Martin Luther King Day), I'd guess about 40 in attendance in a theater that must seat 250.",5,2,7,20 January 2020
Avatar," superior graphics, bad story, 3D is distracting
","Pandora is a wondrous place that expands the imagination. I really enjoyed the idea that the Navi would make physical contact with the Banshee and sort of 'mind meld' for flight together. The sparkle that emitted from the trees as they ran was like phosphorescence in the ocean. In fact a lot of Pandora reminded me of life under water (we SCUBA in our family). Sadly that's where the positive ends for me.I thought the story lacked character development; the audience has to fill in a lot of story line and history, and the worst part was how evil were painted the humans. They were written as barbarians without concern for the Navi which I just don't find believable. Seems like a political statement was behind the writing.Lastly I found the 3D distracting. I think the 3D push is coming from the studios rather than from the audience. Certainly there will be a segment of the population that is enamored by 3D but overall I'm quite happy with 2D. For me the story line is much more important than the image. I can still enjoy old black & white movies if the story is believable and the direction is done well. I went to the 3D showing and paid $3 extra out of curiosity but won't do that again. If this is the best the industry has to offer, and I found it distracting, then there is no reason to be curious again.One thought lingers about the movie. I didn't feel there was anywhere for this to go in the future. Star Trek and Star Wars always left me wanting more. I would like more of Pandora and the Navi but the plot just didn't lend itself to a follow up. So I am left feeling detached from it rather than a part of a movement.",6,2,5,14 March 2010
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Still holding it's own
","Contrary to many movies more than 50 years old this one holds up quite well. While it was long it held my interest all the way through. Often the pace of these old movies is slow but this one moved along at a comfortable pace. The story, while fiction, was entirely plausible. I like WWII movies and this one is a very good one.Alec Guinness (AKA Obi-Wan) was perfectly cast in this movie. He was such a great actor. William Holden was also cast well with his ability to portray a lazy entitled individual believably. No other actor than Sessue Hayakawa would have fit is part as well. I may have seen this movie 10 times over the years and I just had to see it again. The price of this movie in a WWII series of DVDs was only $7, quite the bargain for such a great movie.",8,0,1,13 November 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Best movie on my personal list
","Yep I have to agree with so many others. I am a movie fan who usually watches about 5 a week on average. I actually keep track of every movie I watch in my own personal data sheet. This one is at the very top of my list.No movie I know of has better character development than The Shawshank Redemption. The movie has a few challenging scenes but most of it has a relaxed, even attractive quality to it. Just about anything Morgan Freeman does is good for me. I just can't help but like that man.I too thought this was Tim Robins' best role.I enjoyed the revenge component and somewhat happy ending even though it may have been a bit of a stretch.Great stuff. Good movie making. Good story writing. Great screenplay. Cinematography was appropriate. I felt like I was there with them.",10,0,0,14 March 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," Top notch directing
","I place user comments on a lot of movies. The trouble with most of them can be traced to the director. They can take a good script and totally screw it up, or they can draw the best out of it and get it onto the screen. Saving Mr. Banks is a script that could have been managed poorly and this movie wouldn't be what it has become.Direction by John Lee Hancock in this movie was wonderful. All throughout the movie I marveled at the wisdom and surprisingly wise scene changes.Of course the acting was first rate. How can you go wrong with Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson. Great actors like these can even push a movie along in spite of a poor director. But that wasn't the case here. The combination of direction and acting blended well throughout.",8,1,1,19 April 2016
Midway," All four stars are for the CGI
","It appears Hollywood does not know how to make a WWII movie. Pearl Harbor was a bit of a disappointment but Midway 2019 was far worse. The original 1976 Midway movie was far better. It would be great to blend the best parts of the 1976 Midway with the modern graphics of Midway 2019.There was no depth to this movie. Too many characters who were each ill defined. No character development at all. If you are a student of WWII as I am you, of course, know the story. But for those who are not familiar with the events and details of WWII they are greeted with a choppy exposure to bits and pieces of the true story. Forget historical accuracy.There were scenes of air battles or attacks involving the ground or ships but they would abruptly end and the scene would shift to a quiet dialog portion that seemed quite out of place. The next scene change would then be to some dramatic high volume war segment.The graphics were the highlight of this movie and there were many scenes that were well constructed. Nearer to the beginning of the movie the ships in Pearl Harbor were about 90% real, unfortunately that 10% that was missing was quite visible. The rest of the graphics were quite good.I can't comment on the acting because I don't think the director gave the staff a chance to show their talents. While I very much like Woody Harrelson he was not the right actor for this role.It really is a shame that the director did such a poor job on this movie. It is quite clear that huge amounts of money were spent on sets, which were very good, but they were wasted by not focusing on a thread of a story.I did something that is extremely rare for me. I walked out about 10 minutes before the end of the movie. I just couldn't take any more.",4,5,17,9 November 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," By far the best infantry WWII movie ever
","Wow! I can't say enough about this movie and how well it was done. Mel Gibson managed to tell this true story in the best way it could have been told, with superb direction (and I can be easily critical of direction), superb cinematography, great acting, and a good story board.The battle for Okinawa was brutal. Over 100,000 died in that action. The Japanese soldiers were overwhelming at times, and ruthless in their battle action. Tens of thousands of American soldiers died there. It is wonderful that the action and story of Desmond Doss has been brought to the surface and exposed to millions. He was a true hero.If you can tolerate the brutality of war, shown in a very realistic way, then the rest of this movie will be amazing for you to watch. I am a big WWII movie fan (of which there are many hundreds if not thousands). I tend to mostly enjoy the movies that involve equipment and machines, but for an infantry based movie this one simply can not be beat. It's a 10 on my list and I don't give out many 10s.I know Spielberg has made many popular movies including Saving Private Ryan which is exactly in the same genre as Hacksaw Ridge, but I almost always find something lacking in Spielberg's productions (Schindler's List being the one exception). Not so here in Mel Gibson's project which sets a new bar for direction. It is as real as it gets.",10,11,21,6 November 2016
The Great Gatsby," Over the top
","This was an over the top stylized adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. I should have known better because I have not cared for Baz Luhrmann's movies.The cinematography was great, costumes were superb, I even liked the Gatsby mansion because I think that is what Gatsby thought Daisy would like.I'm not a big fan of Leo Diaprio, even less so of Toby Maguire. To me the only bright spot in the casting was Carey Mulligan who I thought fit the part well and she sure is beautiful.I nearly gave up on the movie about 1/2 way through and I rarely ever abandon a movie. It was so garish I couldn't find the story for all of the flash and absurdity. But I stuck with it. Four stars is about all I can offer for this one.",4,2,3,22 May 2015
From Here to Eternity," Lost it's luster
","I find it interesting that after watching this movie last night I am giving it 6 stars when I might have given it 8 or 9 years ago. I find that it has lost it's luster over the years. You just can't beat Burt Lancaster. Even if I just watch the movie to see his very strong personality and body movements it would be worth the time. He was such an unusual and interesting actor.Some of why the movie doesn't draw a higher score from me is because the pace of movies has sped up over the years, making this one seem slow. Also older movies tend to have a lot more dialog than new ones; whether that is good or not is subjective. But I find this movie lacked action.The morals of this movie must have stunned audiences back in 1953; perhaps that is what made it such a big hit.All in all it's still worth a watch.",6,2,4,13 November 2014
