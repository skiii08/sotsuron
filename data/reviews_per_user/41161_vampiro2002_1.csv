Ali," not a legend
","When I first heard that they were making this movie, I thought that it would be one of the greatest movies of all time. While Will Smith did a superb job of acting, I thought the movie showed how Ali was an arrogant,self-righteous man. He was a great man inside the ring. But outside the ring, he was not a very respectable person. The movie,however,was very good. It told more about the man than the legend. Wich is a rarity in hollywood.",Null,0,0,9 June 2002
