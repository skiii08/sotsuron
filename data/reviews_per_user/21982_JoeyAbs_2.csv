The Blair Witch Project," Their Should be a Sequel
","It has been the Best Horror Movie i ever seen. Their should be a Sequel in which a search and Retrival Team come into the woods to recover the Bodies( this time they have more technical instruments to tape, and to defend themsleves should anything happen)",10,1,3,7 August 1999
X2: X-Men United," One of the few sequels that are better than the original
","Bryan Singer is a genius. I loved the Usual Suspects, felt Apt Pupil was unapreciated and of coure X-Men was great. But he has outdone himself with X2. I loved the action sequences, and more importantly the film's message, which what makes X-Men work. I loved the characters especially Nightcrawler. Alan Cumming was a great casting choice. I just hope X3 can top X2.",Null,0,0,5 May 2003
