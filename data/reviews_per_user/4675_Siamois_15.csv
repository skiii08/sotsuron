Whip It," Whipping familiar ingredients together
","With her debut, Drew Barrymore plays safe as far as the story is concerned, but a lot of heart goes into the movie and she proves more than capable as a first-time director.Whip It goes through the list of clichés of coming-of-age and sports movies. The disapproving parent who's got other plans, the older veteran threatened by the new rookie, the witty girl that wants to get out of town and her somewhat witty best friend. The list goes on and some characters and scenes are homages to past movies (The Manson sisters are basically the Hanson brothers from Slap Shot) or some would say, rip offs.With the adequate pacing, solid acting and derivative story, this film would normally be worth a 4 or a 5 but what puts it above the average movie is all the conviction put into this. For starters, Barrymore does not go for quick editing tricks in order to cheat on the sports sequences. Instead of going for .5 seconds shots, the camera often sticks to these girls for a few seconds, making the film less flashy but much more organic. The film crew and especially the fantastic cast deserves all the praise they will get here. I cringed thinking of the beating these actresses were willing to take.These long shots also pay off when it comes to other scenes, such as the underwater sequence which is very lovely and comes off as authentic yet was no doubt the result of some serious work. There is also nice photography and a nice use of music. All these little things added together with interesting casting choices and some cachet make you think Drew Barrymore could have an even more interesting career behind the camera as she's having in front of it. You'll recognize also a lot of 'Barrymorisms'. Slightly odd characters, hints of girl power, a love for 80s teenage culture (We're talking about a girl who wore a Judas Priest t-shirt in the blockbuster Charlie's Angels and produced Donnie Darko in all its 80s glory).I wish the characters had more meat and the story didn't take the easy way so often. I also think the film is light-hearted yet lacks humor. More laughs would have definitely helped this become a classic. But as it is, it already beats most of the formulaic sports film out there, even if it doesn't bring new ideas to the genre. A final minor point is, I was under he impression Barrymore was constantly flirting between making an all-ages movie or a PG-13. Some scenes come off a little Disney-ish, while others are slightly more adult. Going firmly one direction or the other could have helped. But a well-deserved 6, close to a 7 for me.",6,0,3,4 January 2010
21," Decent drama neglects its core subject...
","First, lets get the obvious out of the way: several people have noticed they have 'seen this movie before'. Indeed, a small budget Canadian movie called 'The Last Casino' was released a few years before this one, with much of the same plot. But 21 is not a 'ripoff' of The Last Casino. As a matter of fact, both appear to be based on a book called 'Bringing Down the House' although only 21 properly credits the book. It would thus appear that it's the Last Casino which is technically the ripoff. I have seen both movies but it's been a long time since I saw Last Casino and will not compare them here.Now that this is cleared, it's time to look at 21 on its own merits, which are unfortunately few. The movie is competently directed, rather luscious and features a pretty impressive cast. The premise is rather interesting and Jim Sturgess, whom I had never noticed before, pulls an engrossing lead performance as Ben Campbell, a poor but extremely promising young man looking for a way ($$$) to get to Harvard. He gets the opportunity of a life time when a group of students led by a teacher offer him to be in on a counting card scheme to 'beat the system' and get rich quick. Naturally, Ben is portrayed as a decent guy who becomes conflicted between following the straight path or becoming caught in the high life of Vegas and quick bucks, not to mention his feelings for one of his partners in crime. And the script flows smoothly and the frames are pretty and everything is hip... but there are problems with the movies nonetheless and they start with expectations one might have.The movie is called 21 and the entire plot capsule revolves around Blackjack and casinos... yet you never get much of a feel for the game. It's brushed off by a script and direction which seem totally uninterested in that aspect. Instead, we seem content to follow young and ambitious Ben on his journey, where the director highlights how pretty and fast and tempting and easy everything gets in Vegas. Now, I do respect wanting to illustrate and emphasize that, but not at the expense of the actual game of cards and the science that goes around it. And that's where 21 fails most. Another rather important (and somewhat related) aspect is that of choices and decisions, or lack thereof. In 21, our protagonist almost never makes decisions. Be it at the game table or his personal life. The whole movie screams for decisions to be made, it revolves around the weight of choices. When to bet. When to stop. When to resist temptation. When to confide in close friends or family members. Yet these important elements are ignored, or handled off screen in the most bland way. As a result, the thrill we would (should) feel for Ben, the tension that should exist, is never there. We as an audience never feel any indecision, we never question what is going to happen as Ben goes from plot point A to B to C and so on... this ends up being a catastrophic failure.I really feel director Robert Luketic's previous experiences (his resume is filled with bland, vanilla romantic comedies that require a railroading script) put him as a disadvantage because 21 falls flat on its face. Kevin Spacey, as a sort of flawed mentor is wasted as his character only seem to further the plot and equally, Laurence Fishburne as a main antagonist with shades of gray is a non-factor for the story. The movie (much like Kate Bosworth) is pretty enough that you won't skip parts but it all feels remote and lacking in realism or real sense of drama. It's a tremendous idea but left unfinished and sketchy. How can an action-thriller with a super-heroic icon and a busy plot like Casino Royale succeed in highlighting both the romance, the gambling aspect and a fulfilling story while the much more straightforward 21 fails at highlighting anything? Poor story and direction.Watch The Cincinnati Kid or Rounders instead.",5,0,0,22 August 2008
Revolutionary Road," Perfectly directed and acted...
","With Revolutionary Road, the excellent Sam Mendes delivers his most powerful and gripping movie since his debut, American Beauty. Coincidentally or not, both of these dramas hit similar themes and their protagonists also share a lot in common.Suburban couples whom, on the surface, are seemingly perfect but in in reality are growing apart, trying to define or redefine their existence, having doubts about their lifestyles? This summary can be applied to both films and yet, it would be a terribly inaccurate injustice to say this film is 'just like American Beauty'.The story is definitely its own, so are the characters. Mendes' direction also really sticks to the movie rather than being formulaic. He is better than ever, ever image, every moment, every emotion perfectly captured. DiCaprio and Winslet? They nail their parts as a couple, the Wheelers. It's just perfect, nuanced, authentic.With all these people on top of their game and an interesting premise, Revolutionary Road could have easily been a 9, perhaps even a 10. Alas, the screenplay has significant flaws. For one, a few lines are weak. Nothing major but still. More importantly, there seems to be something missing. The whole pointlessness of their existence not made so clear, for instance. And then, there's the Wheelers' children.Yes, our suburb couple has children but where are they, exactly? Not really in this movie, unfortunately. I realize that with a director like Mendes, few things were probably left to chance and this was probably a deliberate, conscious decision. Perhaps as early as the screenplay, or maybe in the editing room? Whatever the case maybe, it's a weak point and prevents the movie from having the punch to become a TRUE, long-lasting American classic. I'm talking top 100 movie of all times. Had this movie been extended by 15 minutes or so (which would be entirely reasonable given it's actual running time) I think much could have been explained and the final third of the movie, as well as its resolution, would have had even more impact.We're still left with powerful characters and another movie that is fodder for us viewers, about the apparent inescapable cogs of the wheel of our lives.Do we really need to live in such standard ways? And more importantly, if we do, is it instantly wrong? As usual for Mendes, he explores those black and white questions and shows you the wide palette of gray between these two extremes.Kudos to Mendes, our two leads, as well as the supporting cast and Mendes technical team. The weakness of this movie is Justin Haythe, whose sole other screen writing credit is the laughably bad 'The Clearing'. There just aren't that many Alan Ball around to write perfect stories.",8,0,0,20 May 2009
2012," Eat popcorn and enjoy the end of the world!
","Knowing fully well that this was Emmerich project, I expected nothing more than a good old disaster flick and that is what this movie offers.Of course, with the rise of CGI in the last decade or so, most viewers are now accustomed to scenes of epic devastation, and with 2012, we get the impression the writers tried to up the ante once again with the disaster aspect. We get a mix of stuff we've seen in other movies, such as monster earthquakes, massive volcanoes and giganormous tsunamis. Protagonists do impossible stunts in airplanes, in cars and even underwater. Entire cities are wiped out. The whole thing is quite fun in that respect. The actual story? The characters? It's all very typical for that type of Hollywood entertainment. Ordinary people, scientists, politicians are all featured. You've got your typical 'good guys' trying their best to survive and some 'bad guys' showing traits such as greed and selfishness. Along the way, some characters live, other dies. Most get a chance to say the typical 'hollywood goodbyes' and some even redeem themselves before they die.Emmerich never lets you dwell too long on the characters, or what it means for the world as we know it to come to an end. It might be seen as a shame but that's par for the course in that type of movie. I'll give it an honest five. I think it does a good job at entertaining. But if you are looking for an intense drama, or to see the laws of physics or reality carefully applied, this is not the film to watch. What you get here is a very good bunch of actors doing a good (not great) job in a CGI-heavy movie. You get a story that covers all the bases, but doesn't do anything brilliantly. In short, decent entertainment, if you are entertained by this sort of film.",5,1,3,21 January 2010
Event Horizon," An underrated gem...
","Director Paul Anderson has let me down on a number of occasions but Event Horizon is not of of them. In fact, this entertaining adventure in space is his best film.The main reason Event Horizon is such a success is that it visits many genres, jumping nicely from one to the other. At its heart is 'horror in space'. Science-fiction with overtones of HP Lovecraft and Clive Barker. But the key to Event Horizon is that it always aims to entertain and never takes itself seriously. We don't dwell too much on the science, it's just made as evocative as possible for the story to work. The characters are sketched just enough for us to care about them, but Anderson is aware this isn't a character drama, so again doesn't lose too much time with sappy backstories. It helps that the cast absolutely rocks. The brilliant Sam Neill, Larry Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan and the very underrated Jason Isaacs. Despite the high tension and graphic horror, Even Horizon even has well-placed humorous bits, thanks in great part to the character of Cooper (played hilariously by Richard T. Jones).The architecture and science behind the ship (called the Event Horizon) is simply beautiful and great and contributes to the thrill ride. The ship itself becomes a character. The direction itself is a little sloppy. Some scenes rather uninspired and the editing a bit sloppy. Anderson hints in interviews that the film needed to be rushed due to studio pressure and since a lot of footage has apparently been lost, no true 'director's cut' will ever do it proper justice.What we are left with is a movie that is too entertaining to pass, especially for fans of horror and sci-fi. Repeated viewings show that the film has very few dull moments. A solid and unique entry that inspired subsequent films (such as Sunshine).Highly recommended if you do not take your sci-fi too seriously.",7,5,9,1 April 2009
Jerry Maguire," Probably deserves its classic status...
","Watching Jerry Maguire again recently, I can understand its status as a (cult) classic of the 90s but the movie did not have such a strong effect on me. We follow Jerry Maguire on his transformation from cynical, go-getter player agent to a less materialistic, better grounded person. Here's the first reason I had problems getting immersed: we only get but a glimpse of his former, superficial life and jump right into the 'epiphany' portion where he longs for change. From a dramatic point of view, it makes the character's transition less lifelike and we lose the impact of such a transformation. Not to mention all the comedy moment we probably miss out (cynical characters lend themselves well to comedy and good setups that can be exploited later on).As much as the central figure is Jerry Maguire, two other characters go through transformations themselves: Dorothy Boyd is Maguire's love interest. A young single mother in a precarious situation (fringe job, living with her sister and longing for partner to complete her family). Rod Tidwell is the typical feisty but underrated player at a critical juncture of his short football career, looking for a big payoff in his next (and likely last) contract.Tom Cruise is excellent in a role that fits him like a glove. He is right in his comfort zone in this role which makes it easy effortless to become Jerry Maguire. As much as sometimes we find him clueless and want to punch him, we greatly enjoy the ride. Renée Zellweger was probably put on the bigger Hollywood map thanks to her role as Dorothy Boyd. Zellweger, much like Cruise, is perfectly cast here. These roles as quirky, vulnerable, romantic interest are almost a speciality for her (think Bridget Jones, Me Myself and Irene, Nurse Betty) and she is immediately endearing and she makes people around her shine in scenes. A good actress with a good feel for chemistry and synergy. And lastly is Cuba Gooding Jr. as the sometimes hilarious, sometimes obnoxious Rod Tidwell. Gooding sometimes overreaches to the point where the character is nothing more than a caricature, and none of it is as well done as, say, the various weird, over-the-top characters that populate The Big Lebowski, for instance. The famous 'show me the money scene' probably deserves its cult status but loses a lot of impact the second time around. You wish the script was a little tighter in some places, that more context was provided. The mix of drama and comedy often feels a bit awkward. The peripheral characters are lacking. Particularly Dorothy's kid, Ray... who ends up annoying most viewers and is not endearing at all. Dorothy's sister and Tidwell's wife (both acting as catalysts to push Dorothy and Tidwell to bigger and better things) are also equally annoying. The direction is unremarkable. The cinematography is sub par. Every memorable scenes (there are few) is driven by acting and a lot of the quotes sound rather cheesy and corny for a movie from the 90s. 'You had me at hello' is what one might expect from a 50s movie, not the 90s. But through it all, Cameron Crowe manages to never sink completely into happy-happy Hollywood crapola, making Maguire a flawed and somewhat believable character. If only the lines had been refined. The writing is too self-conscious at times and the movie doesn't expand enough on the 'old Maguire' to make the journey he takes truly remarkable. It's still a good movie and deserves at least one viewing. Especially worth it for the great chemistry between the three actors, a very strong and engaging premise and some memorable scenes.I can totally see why it's a classic but it just didn't do it for me enough to buy a DVD.",5,2,5,12 October 2009
Paranormal Activity," Tense and scary
","I had heard all the praise Paranormal Activity received and was skeptical. But the movie conquered me by its efficient structure and raw execution. The movie doesn't lose too much time drawing you in the claustrophobic universe of a young couple, Katie and Micah. The setup is simple. They have started experiencing strange phenomenon that might be paranormal in nature. Micah doesn't take Katie's fear very seriously and decides to buy a camera and 'investigate' the strange happenings.This makes the whole movie shot from Micah's camera. The style and feel has drawn comparisons to Blair Witch, understandably. It has the same amateurish, documentary-style shooting style, both feature a small cast of unknown actors, the same feeling that some of the lines are improvised and of course, both are horror movies that rely more on atmosphere than gore or shock to scare the audience. Although I tremendously enjoyed The Blair Witch Project, it never quite scared me and I felt it could have been more tightly edited at times. Paranormal Activity progressively gets more tensed and features some truly chilling scenes. Katie Featherston (playing her namesake, Katie) is believable as one of the lead. Her character is more sensitive to the phenomenon so, especially in the movie's early stage, a lot of the feeling of creepiness must come through this character. Micah Sloat (predictably playing... Micah) is adequate, although I didn't think he had much to work with at times. Since this actor also served as cameraman, in some scenes he is reduced to voice acting.Overall, Oren Peli quickly established the pace and style of this movie, documenting the paranormal stuff in many scenes while the camera lays still. We as the audience can't wait for night to fall and see what might happen next. But as far as establishing the characters and their relationship, it all seems to have been left to improv. I wish I had known a bit more about them. But all in all, this movie does what it sets out to do. It has a creepy atmosphere without relying on gore, action, loads of special effects and it even avoids having one of those lame 'surprise twists' which have been popular with movies attempting to replicate The Sixth Sense's success.As my profile says, I give a rating regardless of external factors such as budget. I really do think this movie deserves a high rating. But I must praise all the people involved in this production. Kudos for using a lot of creativity and getting an amazing movie made on modest means. Proof that money doesn't always have to be an obstacle.",8,0,1,17 December 2009
Taken," Entertaining
","When his daughter is kidnapped abroad, a former CIA operative follows the trail of a sex trade ring and stops at nothing to find her.Taken walks the fine line between 'true action movie' entertainment and a a grim thriller. The formula works although there are times when you wish director Morel had made a clear choice between the two.The movie starts well, establishing ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills as a flawed father with the best of intentions. And once his daughter is kidnapped (during a brilliant iconic scene involving a call between Mills and his daughter) the tension rises considerably. The action sequences impress early on and some people have compared them to the Bourne franchise.However, the body count starts to pile up at rate that is hard to swallow when the feel and tone of the movie seems like a thriller or procedural flick. This is not Die Hard or Lethal Weapon where you expect a fun romp filled with humor and extravagant scenes and yet, the movie cannot be viewed in a serious tone as Mills leave a huge trail of killing and destruction behind him.Likewise, the sex slave ring angle gives a grim tone to the entire movie but Taken never fully explores that aspect, keeping the movie fast and furious. The second half of the flick stretches the confine of realism but without ever becoming tongue-in-cheek. Liam Neeson is perfect as Mills but the rest of the cast sleepwalks through the film. Casting Maggie Grace (25 year old during filming) as Mills' 17 year old daughter is very questionable to me. So this is really a Neeson one-man show.All in all, this is packaged as a tense thriller but is really just a good old action movie where the plot does not make much sense. There is nothing wrong with that but, with a tighter plot and an extra 15 minutes of character development, it could have been an even better movie.7 out of 10",7,1,2,20 December 2011
The Happening," Shyamalan's downward spiral continues....
","When The Sixth Sense was released, almost a decade ago, it was impossible not to take notice of M. Night Shyamalan and his strong directorial style. It contrasted heavily with other 'occult' and 'scary' offerings. And this was predominantly due to a style of direction that is both poignant yet sober. M. Night Shyamalan has since then continued to use that formula, basing each of his new movies on an intriguing idea and plot twists. At the heart of M. Night Shyamalan's undeniable influences are Stephen King and Alfred Hitchcock and this explains why his fascinating premises and the stylistic imprint have struck a chord with a large audience. Some trademarks:-Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance in his movies -stories are slow paced and there is an air of mystery and supernatural.-There are scares but the movies avoid cheap stunts like swear words, buckets of bloods and naked bimbos instead relying on primal fears, imagination to galvanize the audience. What horror there is, is handled in a classy manner.-Protagonists are usually ordinary people put in extraordinary situations.-Direction is a sort of modern, Hollywoodian 'cinéma d'auteur' style in some ways.Unfortunately, what should have been a winning combination has proved more and more tedious with each subsequent movies our director has released. Consider the slow fall: Sixth Sense: Top notch acting, pacing, photography. Amazing story. A superb twist ending that is elegant. We sense Shyamalan's direction in some plot elements but it doesn't clash with the viewer, nor does it prevent immersion.Unbreakable: Solid acting, pacing and general direction. Premise is amazing but treatment leads to a less compelling story than Sixth Sense. Twist ending falls flat, like Shyamalan was trying to repeat Sixth Sense. Tried too hard.Signs: Both Unbreakable and the Sixth Sense were emotionally charged and succeeded in that respect. We deeply care about the characters, their personal struggles and their journey. Here, what should be emotionally charged is just sappy and cheap. Joaquin Phoenix's talent is wasted with a crappy character. Overtones of spirituality are heavy handed. There's still great direction here and the premise is fascinating. As the story progresses, it only disappoints.The Village: Shyamalan corrects the overly sappy nature of his previous offering a little. But the whole buildup seems to revolve around the twist ending. One of Shyamalan's strongest premise but plot development is forced. Bryce Dallas Howard, much like Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense, is perfect and a revelation as a new star. We roll our eyes as Shyamalan makes his artificial cameo appearance. Movie's ending is flat. There's still the overall impression the direction is above average but it just doesn't give results.Lady in the Water: An awkward and silly mix of fantasy, horror and mystery. Some of the characters, like the 'bodybuilder' are just downright stupid. Shyamalan's role in this one is a bit more important but he very much deserves the Razzie award for it. The 'plot twist' in this one again shows the desperation of Shyamalan to repeat the Sixth Sense's success. Paul Giamatti, one of the great actors of his generation, does well, but some of the cast members surrounding him are just atrocious. Again, Shyamalan, as a director, intervenes in the plot, auteur-style, with a critic character but it is heavy-handed. By the end, you're just glad the movie is over as the weird mix between a horror movie and a Neverending Story knockoff is just painful to watch.Which brings us to The Happening. Again, the Shyamalan trademarks are there. Slow pace like the Sixth Sense, but not to good effect. In Mark Walhberg's first scene, we immediately notice he is miscast and on top of that, delivers an awful performance. At times, it's like nails on a chalkboard. Zooey Deschanels, an amazing indie actress who has been hit and miss in Hollywood movies, delivers one of her worst performances ever. I'm not even sure she tried, to be honest. And I certainly doubt Shyamalan provided much guidance. All the characters are flat. Most actors, including Leguizamo, are miscast. The story? Again, the premise is interesting but this must be the worse development of a story by Shyamalan so far. Plot holes and incoherencies abound. There's a vast list on the message board but as a glowing example, we see a woman talking to a relative on her cell... and she actually puts her on speaker phone for us, the audience, to hear the horror. It's so inelegant and so unlike anything you would expect from the guy who directed The Sixth Sense. The Happening reminds us of Hitchcock's The Birds but without any value in it.Shyamalan has reached the lowest of lows. It's very obvious by now that he continually tries to replicate the success of The Sixth Sense and it is no coincidence that each subsequent movie since has had a lower and lower ratings, much like sequels to a great movie will receive lower and lower ratings as the formula is milked and abused. And this where Shyamalan and Hitchcock differs. Where there are underlying links and similarities in themes, there's also a willingness by Hitchcock not to repeat himself overly. To break new grounds. And there's a perpetual attention to details. In Shyamalan's case, all I get is the impression of someone who keeps viewing The Sixth Sense and wonders how to recreate that hit. I had never seen a Shyamalan directorial effort that was actually crappy until this. I had seen sappy, manipulative and pointless stories but this is the first time the pacing and acting is actually that off. It's worth noting that in the Sixth Sense, Donnie Walhberg, a b-movie actor, had a small role that he pulled off brilliantly with the help of Shyamalan where his high profile brother Mark totally fails here.",3,0,2,1 September 2008
Die Hard," A masterpiece in the action genre
","In Los Angeles, a well-organized group of criminals crash a corporate Christmas party taking place in a high rise building and take everyone hostage, except for one down-on-his luck New-York cop. A bloody cat and mouse game between NYPD officer John McClane and the so-called terrorists ensues.It's been over two decades since Die Hard was released and having just watched it again, I am amazed at how well it has stood the test of time as a fun action flick. Die Hard created new standards in the action genre that have rarely been achieved this well since then. It all starts with the protagonist John McClane. The character being portrayed as a flawed cop with his own set of problems makes it easy for the audience to relate to his struggles. Director John McTiernan wisely decided to cast Bruce Willis, who was up to that point mostly considered a comedy actor on TV, rather than a big established action star. Willis grabbed this opportunity and turned John McClane into an iconic character in the genre thanks to mixing humor and toughness while still showing the character as fallible. The audience suffers with McClane as the character accumulate bruises and bumps and has to deal not only with the criminals but also with the incompetent authorities.Another element that explains the movie's success is the vast number of secondary characters who are surprisingly well fleshed out considering the very limited screen time most of them get. Of course, Alan Rickman as the evil mastermind Hans Gruber is perfect. But it is really in the small details given to other characters that we find many great lines.Die Hard's biggest achievement is probably in how it successfully mixes gritty action while injecting humor at just the right moments. After establishing the scenery in the first 15 minutes, Die Hard begins to gain more and more momentum, seemingly never letting the foot off the gas pedal. But despite that, McTiernan never takes the movie too seriously and we get several memorable lines and humorous moments.Setting the whole movie inside of a building creates a great sense of claustrophobia for the viewers. The action scenes are brilliant, we wonder how McClane will prevail against a bunch criminals armed with automatic weapons and worse. We share McClane's frustration when the police proves to be clueless, we laugh at the jokes. Technically, the movie is well shot, with few frills and the special effects take a backseat to good old action scenes.All in all, Die Hard is a brilliant genre movie which will appeal to all action fans but is brilliant enough to entertain viewers who do not usually enjoy this type of film.A classic.",10,1,2,20 December 2011
August Rush," A good, modern fairy tale
","There have been strong reactions to this movie, both positive and negative. A lot of criticisms stem from the unbelievable nature of several plot points, which I find strange seeing as this movie has very little to do with reality. To cut to the chase, opinions that this movie is 'worthless' or 'crap' should be safely discarded as rubbish immediately. This is actually a solid film, even if it has flaws. There is, however, a certain public that will be turned off by the fantasy aspects and Disney-like elements found here.The story follows a young boy raised in institutions and desperately wanting to meet his parents, which he knows nothing about. He is driven by his gift and passion for sounds and music. Parallel stories featuring his parents are also told and intersected in this movie. The direction here by Kirsten Sheridan is solid if we except the beginning of the movie, where the quick exposition to the characters and situation is absolutely awful and 80-ish in its rendition. In fact, Sheridan's main weakness seems to be in how to intersect the various bits and characters of the plot. But everything else is appropriate and on target.The cast is solid, starting with teenager Freddie Highmore. While Highmore doesn't turn a Dakota Fanning or Haley Joel Osment performance, he is endearing and most of the time, totally believable as our main character. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell are great and their scenes together showcase very effective chemistry, which was definitely required. Terrence Howard continues to slowly rise in Hollywood as an actor who should be taken seriously. Finally, Robin Williams has a turn as a stereotypical 'fairy tale baddie' that may seem over the top but is right on target for this genre.But the biggest star of this film is probably music. To make this movie work and rise above countless feel-good movies, great, inspired music was required and fortunately, we get it in spades here. From rock to classical to soundtrack ambiances, everything here is well-meshed together, if a little artificial. Lovers of music will be more than satisfied, while actual musicians may be a wee bit disappointed by the treatment. It's still way, way above average. It's very, very good as a matter of fact.I tremendously enjoyed August Rush, even with its small flaws. And I do believe those who couldn't get past those flaws are either missing the point, or simply do not enjoy this genre to begin with. Family-friendly entertainment has been a neglected genre, plagued with very poor entries that are totally uninspiring if we except a few movies. Lately, it seems we're seeing improvement and some thoughts put into the art of crafting good movies of this type. August Rush certainly exemplifies this and I recommend it strongly.",7,5,7,21 August 2008
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Brothers At War
","As the conflict between North and South Korea reaches a new high in 1950, two brothers are conscripted and forced to abandon the rest of their family in order to defend their country. The younger, Jin-seok, is the pride of his family, a peaceful, quiet student. His older brother, Jin-tae, has a good heart but a more fiery temper and is willing go to any length to protect Jin-seok and send him on his way home as soon as possible. The trials that this war inflicts on both men will transform each of them in different ways.This above would be Tae Guk Gi in a nutshell, although the film covers a lot of ground and is quite epic in its scale. Many reviewers have mentioned the influence Saving Private Ryan may have had on this movie and although I this this has been exaggerated, I can understand where they are coming from. The battle scenes do seem to borrow stylistically from SVP. They are quite intense, very big yet intensely up close and personal at times. They plunge the viewers right in the middle of all this chaos and can be quite gruesome. There are quite a few battles throughout the movie, and they unfortunately make less of an impact as time goes by due to some repetitiveness.Having said that, despite the epic scale and quite a few characters being depicted, the bulk of Tae Guk Gi focuses on the two brothers and how war affects them. It is here that the movie scores its better points but also where it fails at times. The changes they both go through are well depicted but unfortunately, from beginning to end the movie is wrapped in melodramatic overtones that make for an awkward viewing at times. Cheesy dialog, overacting and a downright silly score that accentuates it all are all part of the experience.The movie is nonetheless an intense experience, features likable if flawed protagonists. The characters surrounding them are also interesting and you wish you got to know some of them a little better. The movie gets props for portraying evils done by both sides during a conflict. Around the midway point of the movie, things start becoming interesting as it becomes evident nothing is black and white in war but unfortunately, the script doesn't make the best of this.This is a recommended war movie as well as a fine film on blood ties and how they cope when everything is on the line.",6,2,2,29 November 2011
Centurion," Playing cat and mouse with the Picts
","A group of Roman soldiers who survived an ambush are chased relentlessly by a hunting party of Picts. As with every other movie by Neil Marshall (The Descent, Doomsday) this big screen epic attempts to mix the grittiness of European filmmaking with the entertainment values of Hollywood movie-making. And as is becoming signature with this director, Centurion pursues his tradition to feature very strong and memorable female characters. While it is Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) who is the protagonist as the somewhat reluctant leader of our heroes, the most memorable character on screen is Etain, a Brigantian tracker played by Olga Kurylenko. Etain's tribe was massacred by the Romans and she took refuge with the Picts. Her backstory is a powerful device that explains all the hatred she has for Romans and the length she will go to exact revenge. Neil Marshall makes great use of actress Kurylenko and she literally eats the screen in almost every scene she is in, despite her character being mute. Etain reaches iconic status as far as I'm concerned, much like Karl Vreski (Die Hard).The actual plot, despite its historical context, is less Gladiator and more Apocalypto. Several battles are extremely gritty, entering gory territory as blood flows. There are a lot of CGI sequences mixed with traditional effects but they do not detract from the experience too much. Quintus' bunch of survivors are portrayed by a group of effective actors but the movie's short length prevents much characterization. Where Marshall is more effective is in the portrayal of the Picts. In very few words, several characters stand out throughout the movie.Everything is fairly entertaining but the movie never quite reaches classic epic status due to its short length and several incongruities. For instance, I still don't understand why two healthy and armed soldiers would run away from wolves, nor why wolves would pursue them (that simply flies in the face of anything we know about the behavior of wolves). Etain is also ordered to severe the heads of the men she is chasing but conveniently omits certain characters so that they survive their injuries, which makes no sense and is transparent bad writing. Likewise, when the Romans have a chance to steal or kill the Picts' horses, they simply ignore this opportunity. These plot holes add up pretty fast and detract from our experience, turning what could have been a classic into just a great pop corn flick.But an entertaining pop corn flick it is, despite its faults! I wish Marshall would be slightly less ambitious, as it seems he is at his best working on smaller scale movies but he still has a knack to shoot fun films and create engaging characters. Special kudos for not glorifying the Roman empire and especially, for not portraying the Picts as clear-cut villains. Although the structure of the film firmly puts the Picts in the 'baddies' slot, there are several hints and a lot of subtext that, on the contrary, showcases the Roman empire as bloodthirsty invaders, plotting backstabbers and savages themselves. Every amateur of sword epic will want to see this one at least once, possibly several times.",6,52,78,24 August 2010
Valkyrie," Does not meet expectations but still good
","Being a huge fan of Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie, I was eagerly awaiting for Valkyrie. It also helps that Tom Cruise has starred in few duds.Valkyrie ends up being a nice historical/thriller/war film but does not meet the expectations I had. Thanks to past experience, you would expect Singer to nail both the tensed, shadowy aspects of the conspiracy (Usual Suspects) and amaze us with the grand scope of World War II (X-Men). He doesn't impress with either. In fact, this looks like it could have been directed by any solid veteran filmmaker, and perhaps with added punch and flair. There are few memorable shots, few memorable scenes.Christopher McQuarrie does not elevate the story past an interesting chronicling of events. Perhaps this type of story does not suit him as well. It's still gripping but more by the fact it is loosely based on real events. McQuarrie has excelled with creating flawed, somewhat cynical and hopeless characters and making us sympathize with them. This would have been a golden opportunity to highlight the various motivations of those behind the coup, but we don't get much of that. Much of the movie centers around Cruise's characters. Some added scenes between various characters without Cruise would have added to the conspiracy aspect. Likewise, there are very few scenes dealing with his personal life. For instance, his family appear more like a background. Same with the injury, which is brushed over quickly.Tom Cruise is solid and dedicated and the rest of the cast I felt was very good. But there just isn't a script or strong lines here. Interestingly enough, after three Mission: Impossible movies that had very little to do with the TV series, this may be the closest thing Cruise has ever done to Espionnage/secret agent films. Closer in feel to a M:I than any of his movies.This is far from a bad movie. It is interesting. And the fact it is based on real events make it somewhat inspiring. But it is not the movie itself that inspires. More the thought that men were trying the overwhelming task of taking Germany in a new direction at such a critical time.Worth seeing once on rental.",6,1,3,21 May 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," When important issues are trivialized
","The core concept of this film made it an excellent candidate for griping, pulse-pounding cinema with a message. There is this seemingly ordinary man, Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler). One night he and his family are attacked, only him survives. The main culprit gets off easily thanks to the parody that can be the justice system and a career-driven prosecutor (Jamie Foxx). We are quickly introduced to Sheldon and his family and we feel for him when everything is taken from him, destroyed. On the other side of the coin, Jamie Foxx plays an interesting character in Nick Rice. When the film starts, Rice is a young, ambitious man who seems already jaded by the system, unaware that behind each case, there is a human story. But we still sense a decent man, a family man as well just like Clyde. Nonetheless, Rice makes a deal with the man who killed Clyde's family. This all takes place in the first 15 minutes of the movie or so, then the rest of the film takes place ten years later, when Clyde comes after everyone who was involved, killers and lawyers alike. What makes this movie extremely interesting early on are the lack of clear drawn moral lines. Both Sheldon and Rice are flawed individuals in an imperfect, cruel world. But the movie goes south very, very fast as the 'Hollywood factor' is cranked up. First and most important script mistake: Clyde is not an ordinary man. He's a tech genius and super assassin. Congratulations to writer Kurt Wimmer Gary Gray for making us relate to that dude early in the film only to make him yet another superhuman. When Clyde goes on a rampage, the plot becomes so far-fetched and unbelievable, it destroys much of the underlines themes that made the movie click with people. A great many people are dissatisfied with the holes perceived in modern justice systems. We see the flaws and the maze of procedures. We would like the accused to have their rights, but we also want justice for victims. Many of us have felt at one point or another that justice was not served and have felt disempowered. The premise of this film strikes a chord because the thought that an average joe might try to rectify this appeals to us. But he's not an average joe. Second script mistake: as the movie evolves, Clyde goes from being a misguided guy out for his own brand of justice to a megalomaniacal caricature, half-way between a comic book villain (think Magneto) and a terrorist out for mass destruction. Meanwhile, the seemingly arrogant, jaded D.A. Nick Rice doesn't seem to evolve at all in the 10 years since this incident happens. And we're not really exploring his character, inner issues or doubts he could have. All the grey zones, the lack of black and white that this plot built in the first 10 minutes quickly erode into a story that is black and white, with lines clearly drawn. Clyde is the bad guy. Nick the good guy (and a boring, inefficient one at that). The actual rest of the film? Lots of explosions and incidents that seem to come right out of an action thriller movie like Die Hard... only the whole structure of the film is that of a crime thriller, not an action movie. Because of that, because of the lack of humor (this is the plot of a serious film, executed like a humorous blockbuster) the film is terribly dysfunctional. The result is a forgettable entry that doesn't qualify as an effective drama, or an effective action film... or an effective anything. It's just a missed opportunity.",4,12,15,19 January 2010
