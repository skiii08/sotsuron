Marie Antoinette," A visually stunning, artful masterpiece.
","This movie was absolutely jaw-dropping to watch. The cinematography is just incredible; not just the camera-work, but the fact that every single shot felt like it was a moving Michaelangelo painting. I literally was so overwhelmed by the sheer perfection of some scenes that I felt almost guilty for not being able to look at the shot longer. The visual stimulation is really just incredible.Kirsten Dunst does perfectly as Marie Antoinette. She carried the entire film on her back and did so with nonchalant, graceful ease. It also goes without saying that the costumes and hair are surprisingly unique and fresh, especially for period movies.One thing the movie has garnered some attention for, and rightfully so, is the soundtrack. The use 80's-retro and modern music like The Strokes worked seamlessly with the aloof, carefree style Marie Antoinette conveys.There is no denying that a story with some degree of actual depth was lacking. The significance of what was happening to France at the time, the French Revolution, went pretty much unnoticed. However, if you read Coppola's interviews and get an idea of what she was trying to accomplish with Marie Antoinette, you'll know that this wasn't meant to be a historical retelling of the Revolution. The movie was about her as a person. Not necessarily her life, either - just her. Period.One specific scene that I thought helped to redeem the movie in the way of actual depth (probably taking it from an 8 to a 9, for me at least) was the balcony scene, when Marie Antoinette spreads her arms along the railing and bows her head to mob below her, as they go silent.If you appreciate style, beauty, and anything at all visual and artistic, I highly recommend watching this movie. However, make sure you do so with an open mind. The film's style is somewhat unconventional - don't expect a deep storyline, and pay close attention to detail, and you should be very pleased.",9,1,5,26 April 2007
