",Don't get me wrong. This film had good imaginative special effects. My favourite visuals were the R2 units being dispatched to fix the sleek silver copy of an SR71 Blackbird.I can't wait for the director's cut.Not with more footage but with all Jar Binx character removed. Otherwise I might buy the video anyway and re-edit it myself to remove that idiot. Hmmm.. actually that gives me an idea to get a pair of scissors and cut out all ewok scenes from my Return of the Jedi video.,1,0,1,11 February 2000
