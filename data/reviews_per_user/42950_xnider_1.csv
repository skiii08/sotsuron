Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Waste of time and money
","I was very disappointed with this movie. Like most people, I was caught up in the hype and could hardly wait to see it. I actually went to the theater to see it which is something I hardly ever do.If Jar Jar were not in this movie it would have been almost worth seeing. I would have rated this movie even higher had Jar Jar died a tragic death in the first 10 minutes. Unfortunately, I was so annoyed by this character that I couldn't focus on anything else.I give this movie a 5 simply because of the special effects.",Null,0,1,27 August 1999
