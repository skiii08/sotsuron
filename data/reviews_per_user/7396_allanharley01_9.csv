Iron Man 3," If you have a problem, hit something.
","Lots of references in this movie to the Avengers movie, none to the pre-Avengers movies (weird, huh? SHIELD obviously hyper effective, even in the super-hero community).I'd seen the Avengers movie and oddly, enough had forgotten it and had to ask my 11 year old son to remind me about the space aliens, Viking gods and general theme... scrub the last bit, the theme is the same.As per all the movies I've seen with my son over the last few years (with a few exceptions, lamentably notable, let me know if you want to know) this movie consisted of a) troubled hero b) encountering nonsensical/inconsistent evil/ villain and c) repeatedly hitting it in the face until good wins.My objections to this world view are manifold, mainly a) world war one, b) world war 2, c) any war, d)this whole jocks vs rest of world view is idiotic, d) seriously? can we not make films for ADULTS with this budget? etc how long have you got ( three hours plus I guess, e.g. Avabore).Cinematography good, Downey factor medium (low wit factor), Paltrow factor paltry (NO GOOD LINES FOR ANYONE).Best Croydon joke for years - yes.I nodded off in the house destruction scene BECAUSE I'D SEEN IT ALL BEFORE.Next......",6,0,1,11 May 2013
Minority Report," Nonsense, but stylish (SPOILER ALERT)
","An influential view of the 50's Sci-Fi universe (cf I Robot) but one that is a whimsy nothing more, So many films, so much spent on CGi and so little on actual thought. So long down the line this may seem unfair but the trend is the same even on current (2013) movies, e.g. Ironman 3.In short, this film does not stand up to scrutiny. Key point: the duplication of the murder scene. On pretty much any or every level of thinking about this, this is plainly nonsense (allowing for non and/or all of the precept).So - and I will make this a recurring theme in reviews - why spend SO MUCH on effects, CGI, actors and other ego-Mani-ism (sp?) when a) other films suffer and b) thousands are starving (just, generally).Very disappointing. With bite, and based on the early scenes, an interesting polemic on the submission of individual freedom for societal gain. As it is - pow! wap! ah-yeh!",5,0,0,11 May 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Self indulgent and reliant on reputation
","Reviews of this film are largely split into 2 camps; it's good because, or it's bad despite, it's direction by Tarantino.The question I asked myself after this was would this have been made without the Pitt/ Tarantino stamp? The answer was no; and the result was a film that made me so irate that I was moved to post my first review on IMDb...I found everything about this film treated the film goer with something approaching contempt. The script was thin with the exception of one well written character - Landa. Scripting for other characters was anodyne or non-existent, or, in the case of the 'Jew-Bear', simply a bit weird. Same for the other aspects of characterisation, that was formulaic and thin in nearly every case, especially the made-for-Pitt Aldo Raine and the other Basterds. Style pastiching that normally works didn't; subject matter was treated with either insufficient levity or indifference; scenes were badly edited or irrelevant. The redeeming aspects were cinematography and production values - style over content.So - am I taking it too seriously? No; this is not a funny film (though occasionally it seems to try) and the violence that is shown sits uneasily between cartoonish and unnecessary - a prime example is that of the surrendered German who was beaten to death; added nothing, in any way. In fact the tone of the film was so inconsistent in the way it considered the material that it made me very uneasy.For me - Tarantino needs to start making films to impress others, not just himself. Obviously (most of) the rest of the world disagrees, but that's something either Mr T or I will have to learn to live with...One of the most disappointing films I've seen.",1,191,350,13 March 2010
The Hateful Eight," When we look back, we will regret the waste of Tarantino's talent... unless
","Another film that demonstrates how good Q could be IF ONLY he found a good collaborator. So much of this was good and so much better than the appalling self-indulgent nonsense that was Inglorious Bastards (sic). Set up was good, characters were fully (if clumsily) sketched out, script was great.. to a point. BUT... the violence and the monotonous single theme pitch. Key point - if everyone behaves like a psychopath, then everyone is A BAD GUY. Personally I think that trying to normalise killing someone is a terrible thing to do, and anyone who tries/ does kill someone is at least morally compromised... sadly (and this is not just a QT thing of course) this seems to STILL be a moot point, though way down from the late 90s high/low point. Oddly the thing I liked about Reservoir Dogs was that it made the point that violence always has consequences, not the opposite.In this film, the killing was gratuitous, frequent, and, most inexcusable of all, made the film worse.But the thing that made the film dull was the constant - and I mean constant - race references. I mean, seriously? Did they really not talk about ANYTHING else? I mean, not even misogyny - which, judging by this film was at least a constant...As per Django, the denouement was rubbish. Made no sense and I think was actually impossible. Gave the viewer the sense that they were running out of film...In short - enjoy the ride. So much was right, so little wrong... but please, please, if you read these - YOU MAKE A FILM FOR THE AUDIENCE, NOT FOR YOURSELF. GET AN EDITOR.Peace...",7,1,3,20 May 2016
Face_Off," Slightly better than you might expect. Slightly.
","Slightly more well thought out than the usual Hollywood nonsense but only just. Nicolas Cage is... Nicolas Cage, EXACTLY as he is in every other movie, and John Travolta reprising his Pulp Fiction persona. The weird thing is, given the date of the movie and how long it has taken me to see this, is how UN-dated this feels. Exactly the same memes still play out in all the 'big' movies. Have we really not progressed in ANYTHING in 20 years?? Script is playful, filming and effects occasionally lazy and repetitive but also occasionally good, body count really WAY too high for this boll***s, female characterisation actually better than usual (but still shockingly s***).. meh. Seriously, how much do these things cost/ used to cost? A (slightly) above average movie with a depressingly timeless feel...Or - I'm overthinking it. Have a drink, turn off and enjoy the ride.",6,1,2,20 May 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The book is long. This...
","Padding. Padding padding padding.This was very thin. There are arguments for and against literal interpretations of popular classics, and this is against.Nothing happens for almost two hours, and then, when it does, you don't really care. I like Martin Freeman, even in the awful (nay sacrilegious Hitchhikers) but I wouldn't chose to spend this much time in his company without a drink - a fate not suffered by any of the crew.The original LOTR is approx. 1000 pages over 3 movies. The original Hobbit is approx. 400. The LOTR covers the destruction of an evil empire and hordes of hundreds of thousands of distorted man forms to recover the purity of Middle Earth from a messianic overlord.The Hobbit effectively covers exterminating a rogue frog.Padding! Enjoy.",6,4,8,11 May 2013
Django Unchained," Is there an Editor in the house? - SPOILER ALERT
","Well, much better than Inglourious Basterds.The characters and motivation worked and were believable. The distractions were theatrical rather than self indulgent. The subject matter seemed to be adult rather than the pre-teen bollosck of before.But: 1) I liked Tarantino because he seemed to have a view that suspense came from within, through inner and/or stylised projection. This was the case in this movie BUT was savagely broken by a couple of scenes 2) Good film making is, like good literature, theatre, poetry, pretty much any creative work about EMPATHY. Do not spend a long amount of anyone's time doing generating this empathetic feeling -then destroy it in a scene.This is where the editor comes in.The film fell apart in the last few scenes and a film I was really beginning to love fell into farce. Tarantino got away with this in Dusk til Dawn (roughly, getme) not here.The house exploding? The preceding scenes? Really? No. Pitch, tone, character, mood - EDITOR!!!!",7,0,1,11 May 2013
Cloud Atlas," Diabetes can kill
","I read the book and then saw the movie.Firstly, I really liked but do not massively rate the book - nicely done but derivative; enjoyable, but that's another review.Secondly, this film was a sickly saccharine, stylised and pointlessly primped version.For example: 1) Why have the same actors persisting? This was needlessly distracting, and, in the case of the Asian / caucasian cross-over laughable. Seriously? I mean, really, WHAT were you thinking? This is a black-and-white minstrels moment (in the UK, ask your (grand)parents, in the US.. leave that one hanging).2) Why turn perfect moments of literary emotional suspense into needless action sequences? (Soon-Li) 3) Why does EVERY story need a good ending. There's a clue to this in life, as in everybody DIES. Maybe this could be a Hollywood ending in at least a couple of movies a year....4) Much as I love a British accent from the 1940's (and I don't), maybe there are others??? For God's sake, it's like saying everyone in America lives in LA or NY and likes hitting other people in the face (see other reviews) So many other problems, but all minor compared to the above.Disappointing. Could. Have. Been. AMAZING.Wasn't.",4,3,6,11 May 2013
Up in the Air," Understated, witty and intelligent
","Why can't more films be like this? Pitched perfectly by both Mr Clooney (as always, playing himself) and Vera Farmiga, the performances captured perfectly the unintended consequences of the decisions we make when younger, even when we don't realise we're making them. The set-up works well; in the airport, creating isolation even when surrounded by people, and the self-deceiving cynicism of the office environment, coupled to the displaced values of the two protagonists. The key is that only Clooney believes it 100%, and the inevitable comedown is very well expressed.I've seen this twice over a few years and I'd forgotten how good it is, as a modern parable of self imposed isolation and alienation.Perhaps the best part is the ending; there is no meaningless resolution, no happy ending, only a glimmer of possible redemption.",8,0,0,16 November 2013
