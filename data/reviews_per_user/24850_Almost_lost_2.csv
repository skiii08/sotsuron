The Ring," ' Disturbing '
","This horror film is definitely the most disturbingly psychological movie i have seen for a while. If little children with dark hair creep you out then maybe a film to avoid - yet i watched it. Samara a disturbed and neglected young girl haunts a video tape - If someone watches it they die in ' Seven Days ' -Naomi Watts places Rachel - mother of Adian. Her Niece watches the video tape and she notices creepy pictures in her bedroom and decides to investigate. She has no idea what shes getting herself into. The video itself i found weird and much different to what i expected. This isn't your typical horror it has a lot of twists and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat or hiding behind it whichever. The Ring2 i thought Samara was more creepy in the way she acts and moves, yet the storyline seems abit teedias. I had to watch it a 2nd time to understand little bits. The first is better, because its unusual and no-one has achieved a movie like this. Acting from all the cast is very good. Naomi Watts succeeds in playing the worried mother figure very well. Worth seeing if you would rather have a decent storyline to your horror movie then i would recommend it. There isn't a lot of blood and gore but a disturbed girl crawling around trying to kill everything makes up for it.",8,0,1,30 September 2005
Troy," Breathtaking !
","I must admit i wasn't to enthusiastic about watching 'Troy', but after doing so i thought it was one of the best films i have seen for a longtime. The cast is very good, each actor playing the role excellently. Brad Pitt shows his talent through this, from changing between warrior and falling in love with a certain lady he shouldn't. Diane Kruger who plays Helen - she looks stunning in this film, def passes off as the most beautiful women ever seen. I was very impressed with the fight scenes, my favourite being between Achilles and Hector quite tense. Its setting is pleasing to the eye, set in the grounds of Greece the scenery is amazing. I would definitely recommend this even if this really doesn't appeal2u, you will love it by the end ( so much so, i bought it the following day!)",10,13,24,28 September 2005
