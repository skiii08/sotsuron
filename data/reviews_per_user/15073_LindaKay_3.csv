The Blair Witch Project," Over hyped but good
","The reviews I read were mixed but mostly were in big favor of the BWP. In general the movie was pretty good. The acting was great and the story was good too, including the last ten minutes. I may have enjoyed the movie more if I had been closer to the screen. As with most movies plays etc., you get more out it if you are more focused and are not distracted by your surroundings. You need focus with this movie. It is meant to be a documentary so I had no problem with the shaky camcorder and 16mm footage(apparently the character students were not in senior year). The biggest problem I had with the movie is that if I were scared and fearful of my life the first thing I would do is drop the camera no matter how dedicated I was to my work. Although Heather did admit she was using the camera as a way of dealing with the fear.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
Meet Joe Black," Twice as long as it should have been
","If this were a community theatre play rather than a movie, the audience would have been convinced the actors didn't know their lines.  Dramatic pauses can be effective, but long pauses between simple conversation bits is just ridiculous.  This had a deadly slow pace throughout.",Null,0,0,3 April 1999
Life Is Beautiful," A long-lasting impression
","One week after seeing this film, I am still impressed by it.  Yes, the movie was very funny in the beginning, but what stands out in my mind is how hard the father worked to shield his son from the horrors.  We all KNOW the horror is there, waiting at any moment to destroy both the father and the son, but the father protected his child in imaginative, intelligent ways. He truly did give him a most marvelous gift.  What a wonderful person he was - to find humor and selflessness in the midst of everything.",Null,1,2,3 April 1999
