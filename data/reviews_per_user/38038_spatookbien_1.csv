Catch Me If You Can," Is it over yet?
","This film is one of the most boring i have ever seen. The plot is established very quickly, then we are given around 2 hours of Di Caprio pulling off the most ridiculous, barely believable feats of money making while Hanks, who's character is given little background and no depth, stays one step behind. The ending is dragged out ridiculously, and gives little satisfaction.The real problem i found was that Di Caprio is on-screen almost all the time, yet he spends so much time pretending to be someone else, we never get to know his character and therefore i found it impossible to feel any emotion to his situation.After 1 hour, the film wears thin, after another hour, i was barely awake. Its films like this that make me wonder why Spielberg is still popular. Schindlers List came out 10 years ago, and since then he has not made one good film.",2,6,13,21 April 2004
