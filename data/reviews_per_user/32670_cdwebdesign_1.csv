Marie Antoinette," beautiful scenery and costumes, terrible movie
","I had higher hopes for this movie, in that it would at the least have a somewhat captivating story. I did not laugh, cry, or feel any emotion whatsoever throughout this film. The actors and actresses were not bad at all, but rather the screenplay and direction were terrible. It was like a slow starting novel, where you read 30 pages and it's not quite entranced you yet, and you know that just around the corner your patience will pay off. However, in this version, you wait 2 hours for the payoff, and it never delivers. I felt suffocated by the film, and to be quite honest, the credits were a breath of fresh air. I would recommend this film to anyone devoid of emotion, or with an interest in silent films; you may as well turn off the sound. The clash between old and new, with the background music vs. the modern day soundtrack, was odd, to say the least, and the dialogue was worthless.",1,34,56,1 February 2007
