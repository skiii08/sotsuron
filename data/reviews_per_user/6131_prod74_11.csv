50 First Dates," More romantic than funny
","Watching the trailer I thought that this would be a very interesting and funny film, but after watching the film I must say I expected it to be better. The story is very good and provides many opportunities for both funny and sad moments. It would probably work very well as a drama but what we have here is a romantic comedy. It is romantic and sometimes it is a comedy but it doesn't really work as it should. Maybe it should have less crude jokes and concentrate more on the leading couple (Barrymore and Sandler). There were some funny moments but it was not hilarious. I was left with the feeling that it could have been so much better. Still I liked it enough to recommend it, especially for a date. I give it 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,17 August 2004
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Classic Monty Python satire
","I first watched this one 15 years ago and it instantly became on of my favourite movies. Having watched it several times since then, I can honestly say that it still manages to make me laugh out loud at some scenes and generally put a smile on my face for it's entire duration. Next to Holy Grail, this is definitely the best Monty Python movie and one of the best satire/parodies ever filmed. The Monty Pythons crew play a large number of roles, doing an excellent job each and every time. Some scenes are hilarious (like the stoning, or the Biggus Dickus scene) and the rest will put a smile on your face without even realising it. And the best part is that there is more to this movie than just humor.Highly recommended to everyone (especially Monty Pythons fans). I give it 8 out of 10. An remember: Always look at the bright side of life!!",8,2,6,16 September 2004
Akira," Great Animation Film
","I only recently watched Akira (though I have heard a lot about it) and I must say I am impressed (so much that I bought the DVD). This is, beyond any doubt, one of the best animated films in existence. Visually impressive, solid direction, with a compelling story (if a little complicated), just the right amount of character development, good and very appropriate soundtrack and an extensively detailed New Tokyo, Akira manages to be as groundbreaking as it was when it was first released. It's only drawback is that most people (including me) will probably have to watch it again (and again maybe) to completely understand the full story. Highly recommended (especially to anime fans). I give it 8 out of 10.",8,49,88,22 September 2004
Underworld," Stylish and Entertaining
","Being a fan of White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade I was looking forward to watching this movie. Although there were many elements from the game in the movie (I think White Wolf is going to court for this) it is not based on the game. And in my opinion that would make it a much better movie. Still, it was an entertaining movie that I enjoyed both times I watched it.The main characteristic of the film is STYLE. Everything was stylish, sometimes even at the expense of other aspects of the film, like the action or the story. The atmosphere was very good, a gothic, underground feeling was apparent through the whole film. The action was good and well choreographed. The music was ok, nothing special. And the story was interesting but I feel it was not used to it's full potential. A little more character development and more attention to the details would have made this a far better film.******SPOILERS****** There were two major mistakes I noticed. 1)When Selene tells Kraven that the Lycans were after a human, he says that Lucian would never be interested in a human. But Lucian is supposed to be dead (only Kraven knows he is not). Oops! I guess he gave that away. 2)When the captured werewolf tells Selene and Viktor about Lucian's plans he mentions that they need the blood of a descendant of Corvinus that is untainted (meaning that he must not be a vampire or werewolf) for the merging of the two species to work. Yet Michael is bitten early on by Lucian thus becoming a werewolf (and becoming tainted). I guess they forgot about it. *******END OF SPOILERS******To sum it up, this movie has some problems but it still manages to be entertaining. Let's hope they get it better on the sequel. Recommended for everyone at least once, as long as you don't have high expectations. I give it 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,4 August 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A pirates life for me
","I loved this movie the first time I watched (when it was playing in the theaters) and I loved it again when I watched it yesterday. And I bet I'll love it the next time I watch it. It's a fantastic movie. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie. Did I mention I loved every minute of it?This one has everything: good and entertaining story, well written script, fine direction, good acting (excellent acting in the case of J. Depp), great costumes and locations, nice looking effects, humor, cool characters, swordfights, ghosts, romance, great villains. WOW!! In short, this movie is awesome. And besides, pirates are cool!The best thing about the film is, without a doubt, J. Depp's character: Jack Sparrow (sorry, I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow). Depp delivers an outstanding performance, effectively shadowing everyone else, as the goofy, somewhat crazy pirate captain, proving once again he is a great actor.If you expect deep ideas and dealing with important issues you won't find it here, but if you just want to be entertained and have a whole lotta fun I strongly recommend Pirates of the Carribean. I give it 9 out of 10 simply because of the fact that it provides 2 hours of great fun no matter how many times you've seen it.",9,2,4,22 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Good Special Effects, Bad Everything Else
","I went to see this movie knowing that the best part would be the visual effects, but I also expected a decent story. Well, I was right about the first part. The only thing that makes this film watchable are the visual effects. Everything else is below average.Thai main message of the film (that we don't treat nature as we should and nature will find a way to correct that) is left totally undeveloped and by the end of the film it seems more like an impossibility rather than something that could actually happen if we are not careful. The ecological, political and ethical messages of the film are somewhat naive and instead of adding to the film they detract from it. And the fact that the father and son story takes first place in the film is not good at all.The film tries to talk about many things at the same time and fails every time. But it is not successful as an action film either. While some scenes (like the flooding of NY City) are spectacular and create some tension, the rest of the film just has too many problems. For example, I could not feel the threat of the climate changes because even though they threatened the entire world, all we saw was the destruction of LA and NYC. And the end was just terrible. All this just passed away and everything will be just ok?I recommend it only for the excellent visual effects. I give it 6 out of 10 (again for the visual effects).",6,0,0,9 August 2004
Van Helsing," Decent, mindless entertainment
","Decent, mindless entertainment. That's all I really need to describe Van Helsing, but since I must write ten lines or more I'll try to elaborate.This movie is, obviously, no masterpiece. But then again I don't thing it was meant to be one. Viewed as an action movie paying homage to old monster movies it provides enough entertainment, so that you don't feel sorry about wasting your money or your time.On the good side, Jackman and Beckinsale are good enough, there is enough action to keep the movie going, the effects are decent (not too bad not too good) and it's always good to see the classic monsters. On the bad side, this movie has the worst Count Dracula ever (which really hurts the film), the CGI effects are overused and the script is below average.To sum it up, it's probably worth a viewing, just don't expect too much. I give it 6 out of 10 (mostly because the main villain was laughable).",6,1,2,30 September 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Surprisingly Good
","I rented this movie a couple of days ago and having heard very little about it I didn't know what to expect. Reading the story on the back cover I thought 'nothing new here, it's been done before'. But, I'm glad to say, i was pleasantly surprised. Sure, the time travel theme has been used before but not in quite that way. This film managed to entertain me, make me think (god knows how many times I've asked myself 'what if.....') and stayed in my mind for a while, which is much more than I can say for most of the films I've watched the last couple of years. The film deals with many subjects, from child abuse to murder and drugs but presents them as facts of life, which adds a very dark tone to the movie. I found myself caring for the characters and i was eager to see if Evan (the main character) can set things right with each attempt he made. Of course, there were some plot holes and minor things that didn't add up, but then again what sci fi or fantasy film doesn't have those. The acting was above average, with the kid actors stealing the show.To sum it all up, this is a great movie, one of the best released this year. I recommend it to everyone and give it 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,10 July 2004
Shrek 2," Funny and entertaining!!!!
","I watched Shrek 2 last night with my girlfriend and we enjoyed every single second. This movie is amazing! We laughed out loud on many occasions. Amazing animation, great humor, tons of references to movies, fantastic characters. Man, this was even better than the first one.I don't have many things to say about the film, except that it was excellent. One of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I especially enjoyed the fact that almost every character from almost every well known fairytale was mentioned. Pinnochio has two scenes that are hilarious.Great entertainment for the whole family. Highly recommended for a very pleasant viewing. I give it 8 out of ten.",8,0,0,21 July 2004
Big Fish," Wow!!!
","After this movie Tim Burton is definitely in my top 5 list. I liked many of his other movies, but this one is, in my opinion, his best. Big Fish caught my full attention for it's entire duration and left me with a feeling I had just watched something special when it ended. Everything about it was great.Great direction and editing. Beautiful images, some very powerful and emotional scenes and fantastic use of flashbacks. Great acting. Every actor in the film delivers a solid and balanced performance. Great story. A beautiful and entertaining story and a very good script to support it. Great effects. Very well done special effects that fitted perfectly with the story. This movie is interesting, thought provoking, funny and touching at the same time. Not many movies can claim that. I can't recommend it strongly enough. Go watch it now. Or watch it again, I know I will. I give it 10 out 0f 10 (my first 10).",Null,0,1,30 July 2004
X2: X-Men United," Great film
","If you are a fan of the X-men comic books it is impossible not to like this movie. Some of the best characters from the comic book are here (Professor Xavier, Storm, Rogue, Wolverine) and the adaptation from comic book to film is very successful. But even if you are not a fan of the comic book or you have never heard of the X-men (though this is highly unlikely) this still is a great movie.It's visually great, the score fits in perfectly, the acting ranges from adequate to very good (Ian McKellen is great as Magneto), it's packed with action and, like any good comic book, raises some issues (like prejudice) which are treated superficially. There is enough character development to actually care for the characters and Singer's changes from the comic book work just fine.The first movie was pretty good but this one is even better. I recommend it to everyone and give it 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,23 July 2004
