Scarface," A masterpiece
","This movie is truly a masterpiece that will be remembered for a long time to come. It's way more than just a gangster movie and captures the hardship, emotions and deception of the dark world of the drug-lord. Solid acting is observed all the way through. Al Pacino plays the role of the Cuban-American drug-lord, Tony Montana, brilliantly. Tony's amazingly ruthless and determined approach in his ascent to the top is a marvel to watch, yet he is sensitive and honest enough to recognize his humble background and lack of intellectual skills.What was also striking about the movie though, was that the main characters around Tony (friends, family and adversaries) were caught between their loyalty for him and their own dreams of happiness or greed. Yet, as time goes on, there is a tangible sense of realization brewing inside these figures, just waiting to burst to the surface. This progression produces a spectacular conclusion for each of Tony's devotees. As he gradually begins to hit the self-destruct button, they inevitably follow suit, with tragic consequences.The message is clear: if you want to fly too high in a world where you make up the rules as you go along, you will burn your fingers and eventually fall, far and hard. This is amply demonstrated in the final scenes of the movie with the lead character's quite spectacular 'fall from grace', in more ways than one !",9,0,1,22 November 2005
