The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It's not THAT terrible..
","I have read all the books and seen all the movies. Twilight: was okay, not terrible and not great. New Moon: Horrific mess. Terrible acting and dialogue. Eclipse: Better but still nothing special. Breaking Dawn Part 1: The best of the series so far.Now before people start going 'Oh, she has no taste' or 'She has no clue what she is talking about' let me explain.First, lets starting with the acting and dialogue in general. It was 1000 times better than any of the other movies. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have finally shown us that they are not the stiff cardboard's they appeared to be in the first 3 movies. You can tell that Bill Condon was able to break them of their horribly awkward style. The dialogue was still corny in some parts, but for those of us that have read the books we ALL know that is how the books are too!! You can't escape the basic overall story-line. If they had deviated from the story people would be complaining about that too.Second, for those of you who are saying 'Oh my god all they did was get married and have a baby. Why did they need a whole Part 1 for that'. THAT'S WHAT THE FIRST HALF OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT! I mean c'mon people, yes it's annoying but really? Of all the things you could complain about this is the first thing you can think of. Read the book, understand the story and just get over it.Third, for the 'twi-hards' yes some stuff was left out. The terrible blonde jokes that Jacob tells Rosalie, Rosalie making a dog food bowl for Jacob, the more in depth part of the pack life. We need to remember that it is a movie and not everything can be included.My opinion, the movie as a whole was good. Yes there were those corny moments as well as the awkward ones. I appreciated that a lot of the dialogue from the book made it to the movie. Some things could have been included and some left out. Every one of the actors had some decent lines in the movie but the stand outs in my opinion were Kellan Lutz, Jackson Rathbone, Elizabeth Reaser and Boo-Boo Stewart. They could have been utilized way more.",9,2,8,26 November 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," For those of you who don't get it...
","Okay, to all the people who have a problem because this movie is not exactly like the book, grow up. Name one movie that is EXACTLY like the book. There are none or very few. People should not go into a movie that is based on a book and expect it to be exactly the same.I have read all four books. This movie was WAY better than the first movie. Chris Weitz did an AMAZING job. I can only pray that the next two movies are as good as this one.As for the whole vampires bursting into fire whiners, these books were written for teenage girls. Girls don't want to see a hot guy burst into flames. Interview with a Vampire would have sucked horribly if Lestat or Louis burned up. We all need to have open minds.BRAVO to the actors and director of New Moon!!!!",10,15,33,22 November 2009
