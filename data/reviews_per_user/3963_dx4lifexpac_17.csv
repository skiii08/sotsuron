The Blair Witch Project," boring!
","what's the big deal with this movie someone please tell me? all it is a bunch of annoying people lost in the woods. what is so scary about that? you don't see anything chasing after them when they are running away, what's so scary? it was boring, though the ending was pretty good other then that this movie is a waste of time. you want a real horror movie go get halloween or texas chainsaw massacre, not this horrible movie. i give it one star.",1,2,4,12 December 1999
The Thing," good but not Carpenter's best
","The Thing i feel is a bit over rated, i'm not saying it was a bad movie cause it wasn't bad but it wasn't all that good. i found the first 30 minutes very slow, it does pick up but The Thing never reaches it's full potential. Kurt Russell was great like always and John Carpenter also was great. it's cool how The Thing can get into the bodies of the people he kills it gives the movie suspense which was good in the final 40 minutes of the movie. like i said The Thing is not bad but not that good, but i would recomend it i give the The Thing 7/10, if you wanna see great films with Carpenter and Russell check out Escape From New York or Big Trouble In Little China",Null,0,1,21 August 2000
The Exorcist," classic?
","i have seen alot of horror films growing up but i never saw The Exorcist i have heard about it i mean who hasn't? i have been told by many people how scary The Exorcist was so when i finally got around to seeing it i found it too be a bit boring at times and not scary. i'm not saying The Exorcist is a bad movie cause it's not.  just not my kind of horror film or maybe due to the fact i heard so much about it i was expecting something else i set my standards to high. someday i'll rent it again and maybe now that i know what to expect i'll like it alot more. i recomend The Exorcist but don't listen to what some people say on how great the movie is cause you will expect too much like i did just watch it without high hopes, so this way the movie gets a fair chance",Null,0,1,9 September 2000
Good Will Hunting," a masterpiece
","Good Will Hunting is an american movie classic. after i saw this movie i knew then and there i wanted to work in film. Matt Damon is amazing in this movie. he should have won for best actor at the oscars. it's a real good coming of age story about two best friends Damon and Affleck. the movie has real human emotion, and i must admit that the scene when Matt Damon broke down and cried i had tears in my eyes. a very moving film. Good Will Hunting should have gotten best picture, it's much better then Titanic. after seeing this movie Matt Damon and Ben Affleck became 2 of my favorite actors. now that they are so famous it's cool that they still remain best friends. i give Good Will Hunting 10/10",10,3,8,29 February 2000
The Evil Dead," the way horror should be
","the evil dead is such a great horror movie, it's very scary, if only horror movies of today could do this. 5 friends go to a cabin in the woods for vaction where they play a tape that brings up demons and the demons kill and go into the bodies of the people in the cabin till one man is left to try and stop them. the evil dead is very scary i jumped back a few times, and there are times when the demons can be funny too, and there is a lot of blood in this one, as the movie goes on it becomes a bloodbath. director Sam Raimi did a truly great job, he used a lot of wierd angles, but they were great. the evil dead only took 50 thousand to make, but it's still great. if you're a fan of the horror genre rent this. you won't regret it. i give the evil dead 8/10 good for suspense and a lot of scares",Null,0,1,18 February 2000
Psycho," i had to comment again
","i had to give another comment on Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. in my first comment i said it was ok, but one night i had nothing to do and Psycho was on so i watched it and this time i loved it i saw the sequels first and saw the boring remake first so all the suspense for me was gone watching the original, but now i see what a classic Psycho really is, Anthony Perkins was great and is so under rated as well, i give Psycho 9/10",8,10,18,5 September 2000
Psycho," not that good
","i feel this movie is way over rated, i mean don't get me wrong it's a classic, it started the horror genre. but was it really that good? i feel no it wasn't. the first 30 minutes are very slow, once Anthony Perkins enters the movie it gets better, but even then it's kind of slow. but it is very suspenseful, the reason it's so popular is cause, it's the first real horror movie. and Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job directing this movie the shower scene just might be the greatest shot ever. i feel that Halloween blows this movie away big time, though if you like suspense rent psycho. and you might get a scare or two i give psycho 6/10.",8,0,4,19 February 2000
Army of Darkness," groovy
","Arm Of Darkness Evil Dead 3 was a classic film, once again Bruce Campbell rocks! the first 2 Evil Dead movies were horror/comedy this one is comedy/action/adventure. Sam Raime did a good job directing but he did a better job in the first 2. there were some great lines from Bruce Campbell who plays the poor fated Ash. not as good as the first 2 but Army Of Darkness does deliver, im also glad that i got the happy ending its about time something good happens for Ash. i give this movie 7/10.",Null,1,1,1 April 2000
Scream 2," underrated MIGHT CONTAIN A SPOILER
","scream 2 gets too much heat, it's no where near as good as the original but it's still very good, somebody has taken their love of sequels one step too far the tagline says it all. the one thing about the movie yes it was a little slow at times, i watched it the other day and saw a few scenes they could have done without, take ten minutes out of the film and it's almost as good as the original. scream 2 was in production before Kevin Williamson even finished the script, then after it was done some how it got on the internet and Kevin Williamson had to do a major rewrite and do it fast, so he did a great job in little time, the movie is filled with suspense and a few good scares, and how can you not love Dewey he was so funny in this movie, though one of the killers was a little silly with the motive it was friday the 13th done backwards, i give it 7/10",Null,0,0,12 February 2000
Scream," a true classic
","in the 90's we have had some really bad horror films the genre was dead, the last good horror film was in 1988 with Halloween 4 but that all changed in 1996 when Kevin Williamson wrote Scream the movie is very suspenseful, the first 15min to this film is horror at it's very best. Wes Craven the master of horror did a great job at the directing the cast was great, the only problem i have wit this movie is that so many bad horror films tried to cash in after this. alot of people say how original this movie is, that is not true it rips off countless horror movies but Kevin Williamson mixed it together the right way. if you're a horror fan you will find this movie very funny with the rules to survive a horror film speach by Randy. if you're not a horror fan you will still probably like this movie. and Deputy Dewey is just so classic, the one original thing in this film is when you find out who is behind all the murders what a twist it takes i never saw it coming, check this movie out you will love it good for a few scares and laughs. i give it 9/10. the only good horror movies to follow this were the ones wrote by Kevin Williamson, and once again what a great job by Wes Craven the king of horror",Null,0,0,10 February 2000
Halloween," the best horror film ever made
","i first saw this movie about 15 years ago when i was only 6 years old and i remember sitting on my bed so scared that i was about to cry, i had to sleep with the lights on that night and the t.v. right then and there i knew i loved horror films. i have seen halloween countless times since then, i don't get scared the way i did, but for some reason each time i see this movie i get freaked out,John Carpenter directing in this movie is amazing the best i have seen in a horror film and i have seen many in my 21 years. Jamie Lee Curtis is so great in this movie she is the scream queen, dr. loomis played by Donald Pleasence is one of the best characters ever in a horror movie. there is like no blood in this movie there are only four kill scenes, now you're probably saying no blood and only four kills what kind of horror movie is this, it's the best that's what it is. there was no need for too many killings cause the story is strong enough to keep you into the film. every where Jamie Lee is the shape is right with her, and it all builds into the greatest final 20 minutes in all of horror, the score to the movie is so scary it gives me the chills every time i hear it. i give this movie **** out of ****, if you want a true horror film that will scare you rent halloween, trust me you will love this movie.",10,0,0,9 February 2000
Carrie," film at it's very best
","i have to rate Carrie in my top five all time horror movies. Sissy Spacek is just so great in this movie, and Brian Depalma did an amazing job at the directing. everyone can relate to this movie in a way. Carrie is always picked on at school, and come prom night well they push her way to far. Carrie can be sad at times by the way she is picked on, the kids in school just don't like her, i think we all know what it is like to be the outsider at one point in our lives. the final 20 minutes are just so great. the movie is just as good as the book if not better then the book. Brian Depalma shot the movie a little like the way Hitchcock did psycho. you can see the influence, and another thing if you listen to the music at times it's the music from psycho, and the high school is called bates high school. to enjoy this movie you don't have to be a fan of the horror genre, check it out it's a classic i give Carrie 9/10",Null,0,0,16 February 2000
Final Destination," very creepy
","Final Destination was a great movie. it's all about death coming for you and after i left the movie i was freaked out. there is alot of suspense in this film. i thought Kerr smith from dawson's creek was funny in this movie, on dawson he's very shy and cries alot but in this he's the tough guy so i got a kick out of that. after seeing this movie i will never fly again and i'll always pay attention when crossing the street. see this movie you won't be let down. i give Final Destination 8/10",Null,0,0,27 March 2000
Rear Window," Hitchcock at his very best
","there are now words to describe how great a movie Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is. when i first saw it i was glued to the t.v James Stewart is in a wheelchair after he broke his leg in an accident so to pass time he watches the people in the other buildings across the street, and he thinks he sees a murder, nobody believes him but he is sure something went down after a while his girl friend played by the great Grace Kelly starts to believe him, so now he and her are out to prove this guy killed his wife. did he? the only way too find out is to watch, Rear window is such a great suspense/thriller/mystery nobody can make films like this other then Hitchcock i give Rear Window 10/10",Null,0,2,31 August 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," second best horror film only to halloween
","nightmare on elm street is a classic a couple of teens are having dreams about some guy named Freddy Kruger and the dreams prove to be all to real. Wes Craven did his best work ever, this is the only good part in the series. Freddy was pure evil in this he was not the joke man like in the others, and this movie is so scary i have seen it many times and i still get very afraid while i watch it in the dark. stay away from the sequels this is the only good part. see the sequels if you like horror/comedy. if you wanna get scared then rent nightmare on elm street. i give it 10/10",Null,0,0,13 February 2000
The Breakfast Club," John Hughes at his best
","i can not put into words how i feel about The Breakfast Club i love this movie so much, it has a great cast for it's time, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez were all so great but Judd Nelson is what made this movie what it was playing John Bender, i know all of his lines in the film yeah i know i saw The BreakFast Club one too many times, John Hughes has made so many great movies but this is by far his best work ever, i give The Breakfast Club 10/10, it's a classic, and wont be forgotten any time soon",Null,0,1,7 December 2000
Evil Dead II," great follow up
","i'm a big horror fan but i never watched the evil dead trilogy cause i'm into slasher films and zombies, but after i saw evil dead it became a favorite, and everyone told me that the sequel was better then the first, so i finally got around to seeing it. i feel the original is a bit better, but evil dead 2 is very close. i could not stop laughing through out the movie. the first was horror/comedy but this one is comedy/horror. there are so many great scenes to this movie, like when ash's hand turns on him and starts beating him up, then he cuts his hand off and he tries to kill it and the hand gives him the middle finger, or when ash falls down and everything in the room begins to laugh at him, and when i say everything i mean that like books lamps chairs, sounds silly yes, but its not the kind of movie you take serious. Sam Raime did a great job as the director once again, he has to the in the top 3 directors in horror. and Bruce Campbell as ash you cant do better then him, he rules. this is a must see for any horror fan. i give evil dead 2 8/10",Null,0,1,27 March 2000
