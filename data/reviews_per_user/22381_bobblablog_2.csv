Sucker Punch," Call me a Sucker...
","The movie features some of the most brilliant CGI I have seen since making people look semi-animated became cool. Great cinematic, including long periods without speaking, built up suspense making the 'real world' of the movie very dark and ominous, and let you know from the offset that this was not going to leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Each imagination world Baby Doll and her companions entered, however, was as vivid as the last, giving the movie a video- game feel. The weaving in an out of delusions allowed them to create a different world portraying some of the most used gaming backdrops: a nightclub, modern war trenches, a siege of a Medieval castle, and a super spy mission. Each world featured its own kick-ass action scene supported by a killer soundtrack.Instead of developing its own score, which I don't think would have worked well with the different levels of film, the soundtrack consisted of adapted versions of hit songs (including White Rabbits and Sweat Dreams) which synced up really well with each scene and added to the video-game aura of each of the fantasy sequences. Think of what Donnie Darko did with 'Mad World' except instead of using it ever few minutes, they picked one that worked on a scene by scene basis.It turns out that the long periods without talking and the over the top action scenes were to cover up that no one in the movie really had anything to say, and when they did either sounded like coming out of fortune cookie or was just downright dumb (if those are two different things). One of the main characters was literally crying more than she spoke, and frankly for good reason. The plot was pretty straight forward and you never really got into it, turning the parts where they are trying to make things make sense as just a way to get from one action sequence to the next. A few things didn't make too much sense at the end, but you wont really care because the storyline was pretty dull and ended frustratingly and you kinda realize that maybe Baby Doll was in an asylum for good reason.I was definitely a bit over optimistic thinking that Sucker Punch (2011) would essentially be 300 part duex with 5 semi-naked girls instead of a semi-naked Gerard Butler, and hoards Ninja-Robot and Nazi-Dragons instead of hoards of disturbing deformed Persians. If there was one thing I regret its not seeing this in theaters. Seeing the graphics on the big screen with surround sound would have made the viewing experience leaps and bounds better.",Null,0,3,30 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Movie put a Sick Charm on me
","No matter how hard they worked on this movie, it was going to make a billion dollars anyways, and frankly they did not really seem to work that hard. Despite the rave reviews from every kid who still thinks their letter from Hogwarts was lost in the mail (even though owls deliver it) I'd like to make a claim on the contrary, it sucked.I realize that there was nothing they could do about the acting, it wasn't like they could find a new lot of kids to play Harry (despite how good Daniel Radcliffe is in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying), Ron, Hermione and the rest of the magical crew, but frankly they're not great and there is more than one reason that Emma Watson decided to make the change from acting to modeling, and is getting a real American education. But the directing and production staff new these short coming coming in and would logically try and work around them by focusing more on the action and the dramatic silence of the emotion situations the seventh book was chock-full of. This didn't really happen either This was the first Harry Potter movie shot in 3D, and they probably should have done another in 3D to work out the kinks first. Every major action scene in the movie, which was a lot because the whole thing was essentially one big battle, was changed from having over the top CGI effects and stunts, to having the scene inexplicably go into slow motion and have something flying at the screen. I'll admit, it probably looked awesome in 3D, but in regular definition it just looked goofy, taking away from the dramatic effect of the situation.As for the non action scene dramatic situation, they were nothing more than a lightning round of awkward situations and over the top one liners. Whether it was strict adhesion to the book, trying to get in every 'important' scene and subplot, which they kind of gave up on in the first movie, or that they were really trying to play on the awkward boy-girl coming of age angle that most of the viewers are probably going through themselves, I don't know. What I do know is that Ron and Hermione spent more time making out than grieving over their (very) recently killed friends and family, and that every few minutes there was a scene were some random wizard dude (Ron, Harry, Nevil) sat next to some random wizard girl (Luna, Hermione, Ginny) and didn't say anything, making me almost wonder if they just happen to be sitting there not talking and suddenly realize the camera was still rolling.All in all I revert back to my original analysis: it sucked. Many of my friend called seeing this movie the end of their childhood, and frankly it was the end of mine. A loss of innocence to even consider wanting to go see some kid-friendly, over-hyped, poorly done, Warner Brothers poor excuse for a movie ever again.",Null,3,6,24 July 2011
