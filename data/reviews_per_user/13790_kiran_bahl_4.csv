Scarface," TONY MONTANA ROCKS!
","I finally saw this much talked about movie the other day, and have to admit - I was spellbound.  It's a great mix of romance, comedy, and emotions.  There's also violence, greed, lust, everything a movie needs to make it a blockbuster - which Scarface DEFINITELY is!",9,0,0,3 August 2001
The Godfather: Part II," A Sequel That's Actually Better Than The Original!
",FABULOUS!  I've never seen Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro portrayed in this way before - they were absolutely magnificent.  I still can't get over the fact that Godfather:  Part II is indeed much BETTER than the original!  :)  Watch it!,10,2,2,3 August 2001
The Godfather: Part III," Okay, Now I'm In Love...
","Can you believe the 3rd part in a trilogy can be BETTER than the first two!?!  Godfather:  Part III proves this with ease.  I could watch the three parts anytime, and always notice something different and new.  Al Pacino is of course the central, main character, and no one could've done a better job.  I have bought all Godfather memoribilia now and am loyal to this epic!!",10,0,1,3 August 2001
The Godfather," It'll Make You An Offer You Can't Refuse
","The Godfather left me completely speechless after watching it.  Once you realize there's a Part II, you quickly go out and buy that as well.  Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are superb in this epic!",10,0,4,3 August 2001
