Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not even a cat mouse game ...
","Now something like this doesn't work for me,if I consider previous three installments.This movie cannot even be considered as good,if I am an enough good movie goer & specially when I am a die hard fan of this series. Direction:No offense but Rob Marshall fails to deliver this time after you have seen his work in Chicago or Memories of Geisha.I don't know but I missed Gore when I was watching this movie.for him it is 5/10.Its like zero to his work. Writing and Screenplay:Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio didn't impress as they did in the previous movies.Story fails to keep you interested,on the edge of the seat is a far cry. Actors:Depp tries hard to keep up but the story does not have much scope for him.But not to forget he is the only thing for whom I would ask you to see this movie.Penelope,Geoffrey,McShane were OK.Music:Hans Zimmer did his job quite well but still i feel something was missing. What Impresses:The Mermaid sequence and the relationship thing between mermaid(Syrena) and Philip was good. What we miss :The enthusiasm was not there.I missed the sunlight (brightness),whole movie is dark and then 3D diminishes brightness.The grandness,the larger than life visuals that was part of the previous three movies was not there.I think They shouldn't have created this one.",5,0,1,25 May 2011
