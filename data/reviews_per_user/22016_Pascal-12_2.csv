E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Typically Spielberg
","I watched ET when I was a kid, about 11 years old. I loved it. I think, this is a movie every child should have seen at least once. It's a wonderful story about friendship and about overcoming difficulties. A young boy befriends an alien and must then fight for the freedom, and eventually the life, of his friend against people who don't understand. The movie also features Drew Barrymore and Erika Eleniak. Drew was too young for me then, but I did have a childhood crush on Erika. In retrospect, ET is everything I hate about Steven Spielberg. It's blatantly emotionally manipulative. Every scene practically had a big neon sign on top saying 'SMILE', 'LAUGH' or 'CRY'. The movie tries to be multi layered and only succeeds in being pretentious. I'm too annoyed by this to really enjoy the movie, which, I can't deny, is still really good. But when I was a kid, I loved it and I think every kid will love it.",Null,0,0,7 July 1999
The Mummy," So 90's
","This is yet another movie in the style that has become so popular in the second half of the 90's. Lots and lots of expensive special effects and no big names in any of the leading roles. Just like 'Independence Day', 'Starship Troopers', 'Jurassic Park', 'Stargate', etc. Movies you have to watch on a big screen with massive THX sound. If you like this style, you'll like The Mummy. If not, don't bother watching this movie. 'The Mummy' is funny, fast and over the top. I's not really scary, but then, I don't think it was meant that way. The story is OK, but why the mummy uses biblical plagues in stead of other terrors is beyond me. But they look cool! And the half decayed mummy itself is the most realistic living deadguy I have ever seen.",Null,0,0,17 June 1999
