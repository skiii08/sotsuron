The Sound of Music," Deserving of 'Classic' status
","This would make my short list of one of the best movies of all time. The fine acting by a wonderfully endearing cast, the beautiful music, the magnificent scenery, and a truly wonderful story makes this one of those movies you want to gather your family around once a year for a special viewing.",10,1,7,26 August 2001
Event Horizon," Very dark, very chilling. Among the best horror films.
","Just when I thought horror films were becoming boring and predictable ala Halloween and Elm Street Nightmares, my faith in the genre has been restored. Turn the lights down, grab a glass of wine (you may need a stiff drink), and get ready to be blown away.",9,2,4,24 July 2000
