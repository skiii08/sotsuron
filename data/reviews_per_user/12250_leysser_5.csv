The Blair Witch Project," Another story.
","The first time I saw this film I was happy (I came to the cinema with Adela, and we were interested -the reason doesn't matter- in being terrified) and plenty of curiosity. It happened in a little Italian city: Perugia. The experience was absolutely forgettable. In Italy all the films must be translated and edited. But nowadays, in Lima (Peru') at last, I have watched the film (in a cable channel session) one more time, in its original version and language. What a different experience!. Those strange sounds, the shouts... that atmosphere of desperation; all these elements have contributed to make a very convinced film. It really was one of the scariest films I've ever seen.",Null,0,1,4 May 2001
Billy Elliot," Sensational!
","A very beautiful story (although the fact of the clear influences, for instance: 'Shine'). A great direction, A sensational young actor, And a marvelous sound-track Maybe the best film of the last year. I'm still astonished. It is always a strange feeling being shocked from a good film. Nine points",9,0,0,24 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Perseverare diabolicum
","As Seneca said 'errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum' (!). I you don't believe that a director could commit the same error, nor to persist into destroying his Masterwork, then see this movie. The result? 14 viewers in the avant premiere a Perugia (a cinema with 1000 posts). What a pity!",1,3,9,19 May 2002
Notting Hill," Splendid!
","Ah, Miss Julia Roberts!. What a marvelous performance! She did all the film. Although the fact of her condition of 'superstar' (those lines are not less appropriate about Hugh Grant) she achieves to involve the spectators. We believe in her. And not also, one more time a movie give us a gift (usually forgotten): the strange hope that remains after the sight of a dream coming true. Many of my friend suggest me to see this film. I did it at last, and I'm in debt with them.",Null,0,0,4 May 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Over-rated.
","Chinese martial arts, means epic. China itself means philosophy and dreams like EÃ§a de Queiroz 'O Mandarim' The director of this movie is achieved to destroying not less the tradition than the essence of chinese stories and films. He is also destroying my expectations. In another user comment I can read: 'scenes copied from Dragon Ball-Z'. It is clear. But it is too unforgively the fact of transcript lines of a 'helping-book', not literature of course, like Coelho's 'O Alquimista'. 'Feeling the sound of your hearth' and other things like that. Chuang Tzu could be a great fountain in order to do a better work. Four points, no more.",Null,0,0,19 February 2001
