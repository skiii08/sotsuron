Blade Runner 2049," How Could Anyone Make Something This Good?
","Blade Runner 2049 is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movies nails every key aspect of filmmaking from the direction, the performances, and the CINEMATOGRAPHY. Roger Deakins outdid himself in this film with some of the best shot in film I've ever seen. Ryan Gosling, as always, is fantastic, as well as Ane de Armas. You expect some to say that this movie was 'too boring' or 'not enough action' and I guess if you were expecting constant thrills, you could have been disappointed. And yes, this movie is LONG, running at almost 2 hours and 45 minutes, but there isn't a moment in this movie that felt unnecessary. However, this movie is amazing and you should see Blade Runner 2049 without a doubt.Blade Runner 2049 - 10/10",10,25,56,9 October 2017
Baby Driver," Edgar Wright is a Master!
","When I saw this movie in theaters, I left with a feeling of aw! I was so entertain and shocked by the stunning film making on display, that I have hard time finding a flaw with this movie. Yes, It could get a bit cheesy and yes, Lily James' character is slightly stupid, but all of the flaws could be cleared up by saying that Edgar Wright knows this. He made this film was such style. Just watch the opening scene of this movie and tell me that Edgar Wright is not a master in what he does. Watch the tequila Scene and tell me that isn't awesome. Ansel Elgort is amazing, as well as all the other performances. There isn't much else to say. This movie is simply awesome and one of the best!Baby Driver - 10/10",10,1,4,9 October 2017
American Made," American Made was American made well!
","American Made was a perfect blend of comedy and thrills that always had me entertained. All the performances were great, with Tom Cruise standing out as the best. It has been said that most of the budget went to Tom Cruise, but I don't think that's the case. Because Tom Cruise has worked with Doug Liman before, and I think that this movie was made to look low budget. It makes this almost fictional story somewhat realistic. This movies is insane by the way. The only real problem I had was that the during first 20 minutes, I had a hard time getting into the movie. It was because I wasn't quite connecting with Tom Cruises character, but as the movie went on I was into it, and I think with a re-watch this won't be a problem. Overall, American Made was a blast and I highly recommend you see it.9/10 - Amazing Movie",7,1,4,3 October 2017
