Captain Phillips," Majorly thought provoking!!
","Set in the year 2009, which is not too long back, Captain Phillips starts off with the journey of a man and his disgruntled crew. It very quickly takes a turn when a bunch of pirates board the ship and fear mixed with commotion breaks loose. Made in a slightly documented style, the film revolves around pirates from Somalia opening up a whole new outlook at why a native Somalian would turn against mankind in such a brutal fashion. The pirates are portrayed with emotions and a history proving that they are indeed human.Tom Hanks leaves the audience spellbound with his amazing acting. Hanks, who portrays Captain Richard Phillips is captivating with his brilliance in acting. The composure he maintains and the PTS he suffers right at the end makes the entire ordeal so much more enjoyable!!Bottomline - A serious movie with some spectacular acting.",9,0,3,21 December 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," money well spent!!
","the movie is pretty entertaining!! Taylor looks amazing!! the acting is good!! overall, much better than the book. however, it does lack suspense and thrill. it is a perfect movie for people who love romance and only romance. not so great a movie for those who prefer drama, suspense and thrill with just the touch of romance. more over, definitely not recommended for children. just like the previous movies,this one lacks the gripping need to stay focused. a person might tend to drift of in the middle and it would not necessarily matter.as Meyer produced the movie, she has indeed done a better job with it than she did with the book. it will be interesting to see how the second part goes as most of the essence of the story is covered here.",7,4,11,26 November 2011
Skyfall," Not bad!! Not bad at all!!
","Skyfall!! Every time I hear that word I am instantaneously reminded of Adele's gripping song. One like no other, it certainly deserved all the Grammys it won her.Interestingly enough, the latest Bond movie was named the same. And not until the later half of the movie do you understand why it was named so. A movie title with such history and emotion thrown into it. A movie that started a little slow but soon, very soon picked up pace and met the already set 'Standard of Bond' bar and raised it even higher. Packed with crazy unbelievable action coupled with the typical sarcasm of Craig, this movie craves for the undivided attention of the audience....which dare I say it, it easily gets.I don't know about you but being a feminist myself, the climax left me a little shaken. It's not everyday one of the most powerful fictional female characters is replaced.M, you will be sorely missed and no one, no one can take your place. Nope, not even Lord Voldermort ;)",7,1,4,31 January 2014
Gravity," Stunningly Brilliant!!
","'Dont let go' they said; 'Dont let go off the rope' we thought; 'Dont let go of hope' they meant. Gravity is a serious movie that leaves one speechless and spellbound, wanting more. 91 minutes with Sandra Bullock trapped in space is enough to make the audience jelly-legged when the movie ends. No violence, no bloodshed or guns or cars, no weird looking creatures of outer space, no romance... but just one woman who struggles against the odds for survival. And still this movie was far more impressive than all the others that have violence and cars and so on. Bottomline - Definitely worth a watch on the big screen (preferably in 3D), if you are in a mood to be gasping like you have run a marathon.",10,5,18,21 December 2013
Rise of the Guardians," A family flick.
","Do you believe in fairy tales? In creeps and ghouls and ghosts and boogymen? Do you believe in hope? And joy and love and other things, like children do? If you say no, you will love The rise of the guardians. If you say yes, you will definitely love The rise of the guardians. Dreamworks has pulled out all the stops with this super adorable animated film. It has a great cast voicing the characters but that is not enough is it? So guess what, the film has an awesome story line and some well done graphics as well.For an hour and thirty seven minutes the film twists and turns through fear, sorrow, magic, joy and hope. There is not a single boring minute and for once, for what seems like after a really long time, I found a film completely unpredictable until the very end. Bringing in a concept of what is sadly true, the fact that childhood is dying and with it is hope and faith and childlike belief of whimsical characters like Santa and the Easter Bunny, the Rise of the Guardians gets one thinking about the metaphorical fears and dangers threatening mankind, showcased throughout the entire film.Animation lovers will especially enjoy the final few minutes of the film where there is an obvious interpretation from a scene in The Lion King staring Scar (Let me know if you can find the correlation just like I did ). Bottomline - A must watch for children and adults of all ages.",10,1,1,21 December 2013
Interstellar," Intense!!!!
","There is only one word to describe Interstellar and that is intense. Oh my god, a movie like no other. It's been around 3 hours since the movie ended and I am still reeling from it, desperately trying to hang on to the little shred of sanity I have left in me.Based on the rave reviews it received, the ridiculously high IMDb ratings and of course the fact that all most all the theaters were pretty much completely prebooked, I decided to pick this over Big Hero 6 this weekend.and that is probably one of the best decisions I have made (in all fairness I do not know how big hero 6 is, but still). So, the movie starts off like any other normal sci - fi Hollywood drama, you know, a little slow, with a lot of big words and explanation. However, you might want to pay attention to the first half as it sets the base for the second. The second part starts and seems to go on forever. From the first appearance of Matt Damon till the end of the movie, you are thrown into a mixture of emotions and slowly start losing the grasp on reality. Amazing direction, screenplay, acting coupled with some brilliant background scores sets this movie on the path to wining a couple of Oscars hands down. Bottom line - a must watch for sure. However, ensure that you have some Tom and Jerry stored on your laptop that you can come back to.",10,2,7,9 November 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Rowling masterpiece
","Fantastic beasts and where to find them is a true Rowling story. It reminds you of the first two Harry Potter films ie it gives priority to the story. For example, simple things like the wands in this movie made me beam with joy because they looked exactly as they were supposed to - a normal piece of wood that holds immense power.From the beginning of the film (when the newspaper montage is shown) one can see Rowling's flair and style of writing. The film is a mixture of dark scenes and vibrant bright scenes which (like her books) has the effect of the ever lasting battle between good and evil. The story covers it all - romance, mystery, plot twists and turns and a brilliant climax. As always, JKR uses her eye for detail and leaves nothing to imagination. As the story begins, the audience starts having questions and as the story progresses, all those questions are indeed answered. The only negative here perhaps is that if you haven't read the books (and especially if this is your first Harry Potter experience), you probably won't appreciate it as much as a seasoned Potterhead would as there are a lot of references (that arnt explained in detail - they don't have to be if you have read the books) from the Harry Potter series. For a seasoned Potterhead however, these references, some subtle - like the Hallows' necklace; some not - like Leta Lestrange; make the movie all the more enjoyable.Finally, Jonny Depp is Gilderwald to the T. The few minutes he is on screen makes your skin crawl in a magnificent way as you want to face him but somehow do not. Bottom line - I loved it. Can't wait for the next part. Cannot believe it isn't a book. And simply cannot stop obsessing.",10,22,42,23 November 2016
Inside Out," Brilliant animation. A family entertainer.
","Let me start off with the bad (as yes, the were few. But few, as I said.) 1. As the trailer clearly states, the story revolves around the little voices in our head. The little simple everyday emotions that every human being no mater how old will endure : Joy, Anger, Sadness and Fear. Yes, these are very basic emotions and one could argue that you certainly have more complex emotions out there in the world - one's like guilt, sympathy, narcissism and so on - but if you look at it from a child's point of view (yes, our Riley is simply 11 years old) every emotion ultimately bogs down to those simple few in the end. So, well, I guess I was wrong. Looks like this isn't a bad thing at all. 2. It was pretty kiddish. Yes, I love Disney and yes, I love my animation. But, yes, Inside out was perhaps a tad bit childish. Now for the good and the great - 1. Brilliant animation - Ridiculously good animation. Pixar has clearly outdone itself. Stunning 3D effects definitely put this in the Frozen league. 2. Interesting twist - It had a nice interesting twist that completely saved the monotony of the movie. You find yourself affected by sadness and are on the brink of despair when, suddenly, tada, here's your typical (or perhaps not) Disney-ish twist. 3. Its a Disney movie - I think that says it all. Bottom line - Go watch it. Chances are it will win an Oscar (and of course 'Lava' is a bonus).",10,6,30,28 June 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," loved it
","How often do we see a sequel that is better than the original? Almost never right? Well, your wrong. HTTYD 2 far surprises the original. While I thought the first part was interesting and invigorating the second killed it. It was dark, dense and yet brought warmth to.your heart. Plus the highlight for me was the fact that it was close to impossible to predict. Right from the appearance of the dragon thief to whom it was to what happens to Hiccup's father, everything was just when it shouldn't be (if you get my drift). The only negative was perhaps the fact that the ending was a little too similar to the first part. However, I can't wait for part 3. It will be really hard to top the work done in 2010 and 2014.",9,3,5,27 July 2015
Big Hero 6," Trust Disney to wow us!
","I cannot get over how adorably cute this movie is. The movie constantly hits all the right notes. It is adorable, quirky, witty and completely emotional at the same time. The love portrayed between a young boy and his brother, a man and his daughter and of course a young boy and his robot is amazing. It definitely is in the frozen league and m certain there will be tremendous fan following for baymax. Now that I have seen it, I am not surprised at all that it grossed way more than interstellar. Everyone needs movies like big hero 6 that leaves you warm and fuzzy right to your core. I am satisfied with your care. - once you get familiar with this quote, if you cried when you did, rest assured, you are awesome.Oh and btw, don't worry, the ending leaves you happy happy happy.!!!!!P.s. It is probably the only Disney movie where the characters do not burst into a song. :p Bottom line - must watch for humans of all ages..!!",10,32,51,16 November 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Spend money on the movie instead of the book.
","I read. A lot. I am a fiction junkie, if such a thing exists. When a book is made into a movie, what do I do?Step 1 - Read the book. Step 2 - Watch the movie. Step 3 - Spend blissful hours criticising the movie. And that is exactly what I had planned to do for the 2nd part of breaking dawn. Until all my plans went up in flames that is. :-OBreaking dawn part 2 - dare i say it, is a must watch. Especially if you have read the book. It out-passes the book in ways you cannot imagine. The climax especially is so very intriguing, gripping and all other - ings a person (well, me) actually screams out loud in surprise and wonder. Watching the second half of this flick is probably worth having to endure the horrendous first half. Bottomline - Climax so good, it will be on repeat mode on my laptop for days to come.",8,1,7,21 December 2013
Jack Reacher," Intense!!
","Spoiler - my review is full of praise.Everyone loves Tom Cruise. Well almost everyone :p. And I love him too. He is good. Real good. Jack Reacher, like almost all of Tom's movies is intense and full of word play. I hate the fact that I missed it on the big screen and ended up watching it on my tiny 32' tele at home. Oh the horror!! Rest assured, if you miss a minute cause you have something on the stove or you had to get the door, you will be lost for almost the rest of the movie. Add defying-rules-of-nature action to the intense plot and the Sherlock kind of amazing powers of deduction and voila, you have Reacher at his best. A movie pretty much fit for all ages if you enjoy murder mysteries. I can't wait to read the book it was based on. This is the first time in like forever, a movie has inspired me to read the book it was based on. Bottomline - Kick back and relax with family and friends on a Sunday evening and enjoy two hours of intense concentration. :)",8,4,7,15 February 2014
Despicable Me," No No its not great, not even good. just OK.
","Finally saw this one. I am giving this title a moderate 5. Why? Cause of was moderate. It doesn't wow you, doesn't make you laugh more than a moderate number of times, sorta gets repetitive and is tremendously predictive. Yes, the animation was really good. But sadly that's not gonna cut it anymore cause let's face it, the 3D effects and animations of every single film has been outstanding over the past couple of years. The movie tried really hard but fell short at pleasing me or hitting the right notes. So much so that I am skeptical about watching the second part. The only good that came out of this is that I am looking forward to Minions as that is probably the only good thing in this movie.",5,1,2,27 July 2015
A Walk to Remember," Touching story.. Excellent acting..!!
","Based on the book by Nicholas Sparks, this movie falls under the genre of Romantic Dramas. Beautiful acting, beautiful screenplay and some very good direction makes this a must watch if you like romantic movies with a lot of clichés and an ending that leave you feeling miserable.But if you are a fan of romantic comedy, then I would suggest you give this movie a gentle pass no matter how much people rave about it cause let's face it, the more beautifully sad movies are shot, the more emotionally effected the audience gets. A big shout out to the cast and crew for an amazing effort that pays off through the screen, whether big or small.Bottomline - Even though I personally am not a fan of the romantic drama genre, it did not stop me from noticing exactly how excellent the walk to remember actually was as a movie in itself.",7,0,0,21 December 2013
The Martian," Average. Not worth the hype.
","First of all, the Martian was nothing like Gravity. I guess that was my biggest problem. Having loved movies like Gravity and Interstellar, this one did not come close to the performance bar let alone pass it. Everything about this movie was average. So highly disappointed with Matt Damon.1. Directing - The director worked with what he was given but there was so much more he could do. For example, there is a scene where Damon is severely undernourished and is skin and bones. His face isn't shown. The very next camera shot shows Damon 'who was supposed to be skin and bones' completely healthy and as muscular as ever. No, the space suit cannot hide a body's figure. 2. Writing - I wasn't impressed with the script. It wasn't very different but the only good thing was it was light, had a lot of humor and the story kept you going. However, every twist and plot was extremely far fetched and close to impossible. A person with common sense just sits there going '-_- seriously? Whom are you kidding? That is so not possible!'3. Acting - The acting was top notch. I expected big things from such a promising cast and then delivered. Very pleased.4. Production design - It was brilliant. The sets, both on Mars and on earth were amazing. I was blown away. The red planet was indeed red and the equipment all looked fancy and expensive. Tick. Tick. Tick for The Martian.5. Sound - The sound track and background score was average. Neither catchy nor lethargic. Bottomline - Go watch this if you have nothing better to see. P.s. Forget watching it on the TV.",5,6,13,18 November 2015
