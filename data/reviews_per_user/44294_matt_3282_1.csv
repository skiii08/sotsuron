Sucker Punch," Not Sucker Punched; but not good, okay not terrible.
","My wife and I were warned by a trusted Blockbuster employee to not rent this movie; he said it was terrible. Our trusted Blockbuster employee repeatedly begged us to not rent the movie, but we really liked 300 and we are fans of comic book movies and fantasy/fiction. After watching I would compare the movie with Watchmen mixed with Kill Bill and Sky Captain World of Tomrrow, with a very confusing mess of a plot. I just got done watching the BlueRay DVD and did I hate it, no, did I like it, no. I really like to contribute to IMDb to help others with choosing movies; however with this movie I am really at a loss for words. Final word, if you have absolutely nothing going on, watch it, maybe I just didn't understand the message the director was trying to relay.",Null,0,3,5 September 2011
