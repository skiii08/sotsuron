The Blair Witch Project," An interesting movie
","I´ve just readed some reviews about this film. Some people say it´s a s*** and other people say it´s a masterpiece. For me it´s just a good and interesting movie. I really like it. And the million dolar question is: is it scary? In my case, I saw it in a theater and I did´t get scared. But in my way home, chatting about it with my boyfriend, I finally understood the end of the movie, and I came out in goose flesh. So I think is a good horror film, in the line of Ringu. No blood, very little chill moments, but a frightening feeling for some days after see it.",8,0,1,4 April 2003
