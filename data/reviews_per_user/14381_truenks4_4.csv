The Incredible Hulk," A Short Movie,But It's Much More Better Than Ang Lee's 'Hulk'
","When Ang Lee's 'Hulk' disappoint all of his fans,the second part maybe be not too great.But at least,it seems like a dream that this movie did ho first Hulk did'n. Hulk is back and with a little taste of Blockbuster style,and no so close to the comic like the first part,without that Blockbuster. The incursion of Abomination did a big Bang of the public,just imagine a Big Monster v.s a Big Monster,Â¡Just watching a battle with super special effects!. I recommend this movie to everyone,yes,to everyone,including those ho only love or prefer another type of movie. The Incredible Hulk will be too furious if you don't see his new movie!",10,2,6,13 June 2008
Spider-Man 3," ¿Most Great Battle?
","I see this movie whit a special hope...Spidey was my big hero,but Spider-Man 3 is not the best of the other 2 films.This is not a Spider-Man movie,is a Peter Parker movie.The special effects are great,but the battles is not the best of a movie.The final sequence is not projected in this film,then,Spidey is swining around the city,here in Spider-Man 3,that sequence is not projected.One of the best villains,Venom,fight Spidey in this film...i mean,Venom fight Peter Parker in this film.Harry's death was a bad selection in this film.Other bad point is the incursion of Gwen(i think).One thing good for me was the Christopher's Young Score.Spider-Man 3 is not best than Spidey 2.",8,0,1,13 November 2007
Spider-Man," Danny Elfamn, the Greatest compositor in the world.
","I admire Danny Elfman,he is a great compositor.When i had 'Danny Elfman compose the score of Spider-Man',i had no bad things against him.The score is of the most best, more than Superman score by Jhon Williams.Danny did a god jab on the music.By now, i still admire his score,the music is something god on a movie.I don't think there's someone ho can ''crash'' Elfman score.I recommended this score to everyone who like the music.Spider-Man can't be completed with a great music like this one, so, they call Danny Elfman to it.I still hope this: Danny will be back, one day,to compose once again a Spider-Man score.Â¿You are with me?",9,0,1,14 November 2007
Hancock," Forget all they say,go to see it!
","Will Smith once again hit on target.Hancock may be not so good like The Dark Knight,but it still are enough to go and get satisfied. The history has good lines,and some original. The music is not so great,but it hear good. The casting is very good too,so you can feel the reality. The Special Effects are perfect,but some times they see too CGI. The final is good too,the typical 'good end'. With these elements,you have a good movie,one of the greatest summer movies,and for me,it's enough to put in to the Top 250. I don't know why some of you don't like it,and i know that somebody will be in no deal with me,whatever,everybody have they opinion. But if you see too many bad comments,forget them,the movie is very good,and it get action sequences with incredible backgrounds. See it,you going to like it.",10,1,5,24 July 2008
