Hereditary," good storyline almoat ruined by some shocking acting
","The film is extremely slow to start with and only really starts getting good an hour in. Toni Collette does a great job. the actress who plays Charlie ( Milly Sharpiro) was hyped up and the audience is left wondering why quite near the start. however the acting talent of the man who plays Peter (Alex Wolff) is non existent. it is so bad it's cringy and if he cries like that in real life, I hope he will never be a sad man...",6,0,1,2 December 2018
