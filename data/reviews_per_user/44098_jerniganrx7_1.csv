Vertigo," A MOVIE THAT WILL STAIN YOUR MIND OF EMOTION..
","I just recently rented this movie from a video store and did not think of it to be all that- I figured just another IL' movie but boy was I wrong! I can honestly say this is a spectacular movie on a totally different level compared to movies of today. The story is not a very complex, Its your typical drama/murder-mystery, but the way Big Al had the actors do their scenes was just perfect and this in turn makes the movie very strong and captivating to watch. The cast could not be any greater; Jimmy Stewart' who doesn't know this guy-But the real shocker is the blonde in the gray suit-actress Kim Novak, who I did not know was awesome in this movie.I am a 29 year old guy that has seen his fair share of movies but none that stain my mind the way this one did. The use of strange behavior and deceit left me with a cold feeling inside. But the master of horror has no problem pulling this off. I heard that this movie was one of Alfred Hitchcock's favorites and I have to say one of mine as well.",10,7,10,5 July 2004
