Skyfall," Bond must Die!
","The best I can say after watching this movie is that bond must die. Cubby Brolloli must be spinning in his grave. This has to be the worse Bond movie I have ever seen seen since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' with Mr one hit wonder George Lazenby. A thin crust pizza style plot. Threads that go nowhere. Mediocre Bond women. No gadgets to speak of, (Desmond Llewelyn must be spinning in his grave). No one line quips after dispatching a Bond baddie. This franchise is going down faster than Blofeld's Ocean Lair in 'Diamonds are Forever' which was Sean Connery's worse Bond movie ever since he had already said he was retired from Bond but came back after George Lazenby quit after his awful performance. Qos showed a great performance by Daniel Craig and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but in this movie Bond and M (played by Dame Judi Dench)seem as if they should be wrapped up by the fire sipping on Geritol cocktails and rubbing Ben gay on each other. It portrays Bond as a washed up substance abuser. He doesn't smoke in this movie (another Bond trait).The villain in the movie doesn't carry the over sinister look we all know and love and further more does not act the part. It's been 50 years now with mostly great plot lines. Please leave the franchise as people would like to remember it as part of Cubby's legacy, get back to the magic that makes Bond the way he is,or quit making Bond movies altogether.",1,12,22,30 November 2012
