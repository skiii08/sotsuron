50 First Dates," Funny. Adam Sandler Funny.
","Adam Sandler is a comic genius...however this movie doesn't prove that to the extent of some of his earlier movies (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, The Wedding Singer), but it does come close. This is as much of a sophisticated comedy from Adam Sandler as you will get (however that doesn't say much). I am a big Adam Sandler fan, I think he is perhaps the most unique comedic actor ever. The plot of the movie sometimes gets a little bit repetitive, but Sandler and Barrymore are quick to change that up. All in all, its a great movie. I recommend it to anyone who isn't in a serious mood, as 50 First Dates acts as a crossover between an Adam Sandler Comedy, and a dramatic comedy.",Null,0,0,19 June 2004
