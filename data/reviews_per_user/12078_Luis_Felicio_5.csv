Blade Runner 2049," Nice try, but there is only one Blade Runner
","When i saw the European premiere of Blade Runner back in 1982 i thought I've seen the future, and 35 years have past and the future is now, but not as dark as it was portrayed in that masterpiece. I always thought that there could not be any remakes or sequels of a perfect work of art. When it was announced that Ridley Scott was working on a remake/sequel i wished it was a rumor. But it was not. After seeing the new Balde Runner 2049 it confirmed my suspicions. Why do they had to recreate scene by scene from the original ? The trash car, the umbrellas, the 'throw the hero into the wall' the Atari, Pan Am, Coca Cola ads, the viewing of photography's, and zooming on them, the music is a Copy of the Vangelis masterpiece ..... even a 'new' character that looks almost like Pris .... and bringing back Rachel was not a good idea. Harrison Ford should have refused this part. OK the newer generations will love it, but its all about CGi. And real Cinema is not CGi, its story telling and acting. 7 out of 10 is the most i can give it.",7,2,10,5 October 2017
Ready Player One," Too see more then once, a instant classic.
","I haven't been so excited about a scifi movie in a long timeSpielberg just hit the Jackpot, its a visual journey through Pop Culture from the last 30 years. So many easter eggs that you have to watch it over and over again to get them all. The IMAX 3D version is worth the money and the story is very pleasent and credible (havent read the book)
Its a 140min of a journey trough all the things you love from the last 30 years, from Saturday Night Fever, to The Shining, to all the movie and computer games heroes.
Very well played by Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are great in their parts.And Steven Spielberg is as young and fresh as a daisyTop my list with 10/10",10,27,56,30 March 2018
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Much worse than Twilight
","I saw it last night and what a disappointment !!!Its a 130min gushy of a troubled Bella who swings between Edward an Jacob, looking for the who she loves more. It's all about Looonnnggg closeups of Bella and Edward kissing, or attempting to do so, an on the other side, there is the Looonnnggg fixation of Jacob for Bella and their Looonnnggg staring and trying to kiss each other.The hole story should fit in a 90min feature, and not more.Much worse than Twilight.Its only for the fans, don't waste your money if your not.Final word, this film is so boring.2/10And lets see what they are making for the third part !!!",2,548,988,20 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Too much gibberish, Oh George what have you done !!!!
","Im a huge fan of the Star Wars saga since i saw the first one in 1977 After being overwhelmed by the announcement of the last 3 episodes to complete the 9 part saga i was waiting for something good from this instalment.
But what i got was a bunch of new toys specifically designed to feed the game/toy industry. The script it was written for a comedy not a Sci-Fi movie,the only thing good on it was the Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) character, very convincing and well played. The rest, just forget it, it was worse than seeing Jar Jar Binks again.
I miss the pure enjoyment of the real Star Wars
Oh George what have you done !!!!Waiting for the final one, don't blow that one too please.4 out of 10 is the most i can give it.",4,1,2,1 January 2018
Joker," Outstanding in all aspects
","This is a remarkable achivemente by Joaquin Phoenix, a MASTERCLASS of acting
This is a future film cult and should be on the list of every acting an preforming scholl, as well as for film directing and editing10 out of 10 (can i give more ?)",10,1,4,13 October 2019
