The Lobster," Sheer waste of time
",As a confirmed movie buff I am usually fascinated and appreciative of most celluloid excursions. The opening scene of this movie has a scene that sums up my thoughts about The Lobster. A woman is driving in a dreary atmosphere alone on an endless road. She stops and gets out where there are 3 donkeys. Walks up to one of them and shoots it dead.I felt as frustrated as that woman on watching this meandering excuse of a story and wished the director could have been shot to avoid the creation of this pathetic 2 hours of time waste. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz are wasted here. Best avoid. Movie ends suddenly. There is a time in the movie when dialogues go from English to French with no sub titles. Like i said... do avoid this.,1,52,92,6 December 2015
