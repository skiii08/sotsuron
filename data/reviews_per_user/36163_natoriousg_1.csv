Lucky Number Slevin," My 3rd comment in about 50 flicks
","OK I've only written 2 review prior to this film, and I only write on flicks that really impress me. I have written on 2001, a space oddysey, and baraka, and now... on lucky number slevin. This... I guess it has to be called a thriller if confined to one particular category has twists that only the most experienced thrill-expert could have foreseen, and I did not see what was coming! Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis should set off some automatic *must see* bells, but just in case, if you haven't seen this flick you need to if you enjoy thrillers. Once I saw the cast I knew it'd be unpredictable, but about 2/3 of the way through the movie I was thinking to myself, 'wow this is incredible even for this high caliber staff!.' It's well worth a rental, so give it a shot thrill seekers!",9,0,0,11 June 2009
