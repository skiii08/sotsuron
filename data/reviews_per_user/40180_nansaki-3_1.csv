Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," disappointing to the extreme
","i really thought i would love this film...i was totally BORED as were my European friends here in Athens, and stunned by the predictability of it. guess i'll have to go back to ali. g. the sex scene was horrific and why the black censorship thingamagig on cohen and not on the fat guy??????...tho we did love the pentacostals and the rodeo..otherwise.just plain stupid and way beneath cohen's great skills..but who am i to say...having seen the box office #'s. we did know that pamela was prepped for her role. also, boring. i hope sasha makes tons of cash and THEN comes back in his true role as innovative entertainer with all the unexpected stuff...this was all scripted and i don't care what anyone says about spontaniety... baloney...",2,5,11,12 November 2006
