Scarface," You need to have guts!
","When I watched Scarface, I got greatly influenced by it. The Great Al Pacino, who is admired by the Bollywood king Amitabh Bachan himself became my role model. His style and acting just carried me away. The character Al Pacino played is just remarkable and filled with confidence and wrath. Originating from nix he came out to become the most powerful man. He got what he wanted and never looked back. I learned a lot from this character. And all I would write here is: 'All that I came into this world with are my balls and my words' Yes, we should live up to our words and always speak the truth. And success will be on our side. I would suggest you to watch this movie as soon as you can.",10,0,2,21 December 2010
Requiem for a Dream," Its all about drugs
","This movie was recommended to me by my friend. The story line was good and the music was lovely. The direction was superb at some moments. I was bit annoyed with the excessive repetition even though they might be necessary for the movie to build up a good background. The mother's role emotionally touching, it tells us what we do to our parents when they get old and how they must feel when they are left alone. Drug addiction is shown in a very good manner, one can learn a lot from this movie. Stay away from Drugs...!",6,1,2,21 December 2010
Iron Man 2," Technology is good
","Was expecting a lot from this movie, as I loved the entertaining first movie that came before it(Iron man). Robert Downey was as good as ever, I couldn't take my eyes off Scarlett Johansson. She is bold and beautiful. I would suggest you all to watch 'Iron Man' (part1) before laying your hands on this sequel. These movies will always be loved by engineers. And that's one of the reasons I love them. The technology is not only used but it is also tried to explain the reason behind it. This makes it look less like a fiction.The Iron man movies tells you about how a single man can turn it all around by using his mind. The utmost intelligence is unparalleled and can't be defeated by the highest of all odds.",7,1,2,21 December 2010
Blood Diamond," The inside story.

Why a certain group of people are being exploited again and again? Why so many people have to leave their homes and move to refugee camps.This movie gives you a good look at the details and tells you a story that is often ignored. It revolves around a soldier cum smuggler who has learned his way around the governments, businessmen, journalists and the rebels. He would say and do anything to get the things done his way.

Jack Reacher," A good investigation takes different perspectives
","Starting with a professional shoot by a sniper, this movie revolves around an ex-army man Jack Reacher.It lets you look at both the ends of the story and allows you to figure out the things slowly. There is reference made to the methods followed in the army and how they are quite different from that of the police. At the same time, it also refers to the hardships faced by soldiers and the effects of rigorous training on their lives.It also makes you think about 'freedom' and its meaning. Even if you are living in a democracy, can you be called 'FREE'? How many of us are really free from debt, anxiety, stress, fear, failure, indignity and betrayal? Why do we have to keep trying to solve this conundrum?Well, if you like movies that may exercise your brain a little, than go for this one. It also involves some good action sequences. Though they don't last long as it is often a soldier against a hooligan.",7,1,2,20 April 2014
