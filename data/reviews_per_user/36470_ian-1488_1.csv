Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Brilliant. Satyrical and honest. And a wonderful ending...
","Happy and enjoyable. Though I can understand why American audiences don't like it. Hey, learn to laugh at yourselves occasionally guys! The rest of the world does. Borat pokes fun at all kinds of groups. In his own, unique way. I accept that this is not a snapshot of American life, or at least I hope it isn't, but it's sure as hell funny. Some wonderful one liners scattered throughout the film. And he does satire soooo well. Keep it up Borat, all of it. Absolutely no scruples about who he offends or befriends. And the friends he makes are those whom most 'decent, god fearing! Americans would try to shun. So instead of mocking the film, mock the sad people who take his comments seriously. All kinds of life get caught in his net. And some struggle to cope with his perverse sense of humour. Laugh a little America. And relax.",8,0,5,8 December 2007
