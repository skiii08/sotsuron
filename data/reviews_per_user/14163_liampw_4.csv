Hereditary," This movie had no point.
","I'd like to know what was the whole plot and aim of this movie? It had no plot, no story, no path no nothing! Incrediblely awful! The most exciting it got was when the kid was decapitated. That is where it should have ended because litterally nothing happened after that. At all, period.",1,2,7,6 October 2019
Us," Another 2019 let down
","Once again a hugely hyped horror movie fails to deliver its promised end product. It never got off the ground for me. The plot seemed thoughtless, almost like it was rushed. It just did not impress me.",4,4,6,6 October 2019
Bird Box," Good, but not great.
","Seem to be dull at times, better at others, having mgk in this movie is like putting ketchup in your oatmeal. Tainted it. But bullock wasn't bad, the plot was okay and it was almost like the directors wanted you to think you knew what was going to happen, then changed direction just to surprise you, except it doesn't.",5,0,3,5 January 2019
It Chapter Two," Worse than mediocre.
","Where to begin! Poor acting, over acting, poor plot, poor execution, needless, unnecessary attempted sexual assault scene, very poor cgi and... oh yeah the F-word is used about 6000 times. One of the worst horror films I've ever seen.",2,4,6,6 October 2019
