Hereditary," A terrible waste
",I am not tough on reviews but this has to be the first film I had ever given a one star. I don't think I have even ever given lower than a five to any movie. The movie had a great star cast and everyone acted well on their part. What this movie lacked was a decent story and the chills a horror movie suppose to bring. To me this was more of a sick movie than a horror movie. It was longer than typical horror movie and still lacked the suspense. All that time was wasted on slow paced story and no horror. I am surprised how people has given this movie perfect rating. Save your time and money and watch something else. This can wait to be watched on Blu Ray.,1,16,35,17 June 2018
Deadpool 2," Best sequel ever made
",Let me start off by saying this is a better movie than the first one. The story the humor the story all fits perfect. From the start you will be hooked however things takes a turn when the movie shifts its focus from Cable to the Russell. From the trailers it all seems like cable would be a badass and he in fact was but the movie completely shifted away from him. Why would you take such a strong character and not utilize it. He could have been taken seriously but instead he suddenly becomes Deadpool partner when his plan is revealed. Not only that he saves Deadpool at the end. It was all about that kid which pretty much destroyed Cable character. Because of this I had to give the movie an 8/10 Overall it's a great flick and must watch,9,2,6,27 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," 2 Much 2 Handle For Spidey
","When Spiderman came out i watched it when it was released on DVD considering it would be a movie for kids i didn't bothering going to watch it on big screen, but boy i was wrong. The day i watched it, i regret for not watching it on BIG screen. Then came Spiderman 2, but for some reason i couldn't watch it in theater and had to wait for it to come on DVD, although i got it free on UMD when i purchased my PSP. Beside Spiderman 3, my fav one is Spiderman I because it was absolutely fantastic, the second one was good but doc has never been my fav villain and perhaps thats why spidey 2 was not as my fav as the first one.Spider-Man 3 was the first spidey flick that pushed me out of my couch and put me in front of wide screen between hundreds of spider-man fans to enjoy it. I was so excited to see this black spidey flick and must say i enjoyed it and now it has been in my fav spidey movies list. The goods you all know, but bad is what i will talk about.The movie itself is more than 2 hrs long, but even that time is not enough for what is going on in the movie. The movie had too much going on, Peter-Mary Jane love, then Mary Jane failure in her career, then Harry revenge as new Spidey black outfit story follows along with a man suspected in the killing of uncle Ben, named Fint Marko AKA Sand-Man and at last the Venom.Don't know why but this movie could have been great with just Sand-man alone as a single villain, or maybe with Harry Osborne. Sand Man is a great character which need a lot of character development which this movie definitely lacks, not just for Sandman but for all, even Venom. The makers could have had only Venom in the third installment of this spidey flick as well if they wanted to save Sand Man for future spider man movies but looks like they wanted it all at once like it was end of the world. Unfortunately it didn't quite well worked. Before you even enjoy Sand Man, Harry comes, then the love story, and after that comes black spidey and at the end Venom. Before you enjoy one character, another comes and eventually movie ends. I loved both Sand Man and Venom but due to lack of time both didn't get enough screen time. In fact Venom comes in the last 15 min of Movie, so character development was missing on a massive scale.The visual effects are awesome, especially that of sand man and venom. Harry had some nice gadget to show off too. Overall, even though too much was cramed into one movie, the third spider man flick did not disappoint me and can say is one of my fav in the series. I hope makers will not put too much in the next spidey flick.",10,1,2,1 August 2007
Avengers: Endgame," A mind blowing epic conclusion to an Infinity saga
","One thing I did before seeing endgame was to avoid all teaser and trailers and spoilers. With that said, I had no idea about what I am going in to see apart from what I had imagined in my mind as to what's going to happen next and I can tell you that most of what I had thought really did not happen that way. I would advise to watch a recap of MCU on YouTube and do watch Infinity War once more to refresh your memory. Just like infinity war, the movie starts right off the bat, moving story forward in a well paced manner. Since movie is three hours long they divided the movie into three sections, all sections well used:1. Gather the avengers
2. Make and execute the plan
3. Final battleThe movie is so well paced that the three hours just went by and there is not a single moment where you will lose your interest or get bored. The best part about the movie is the way how the past Marvel movies are connected to this one will be a surprise treat for you. Marvel has done justice to bring Thanos to big screen and given him two movie to fully show what he actually is capable of doing. He is no joke and you will see it in the later part of the movie. He is the baddest villain and the final battle has proved it.This movie was not all about action, as a matter of fact only last part of the movie is action yet still the movie manages to hold its audiences with a bunch of surprises and to the edge of their seat during final battle. The mission are also going to keep you tight on your seat. The movie is full of humor thanks to Rocket and Thor and Iron man. Surprisingly Hulk has some great comic moments as well.At the end the movie pays homage to previous marvel movies and their characters whose story ends with Endgame however they could be back anytime if Marvel wants them to. This is one in a life time movie that you will remember. Don't miss it and watch it in theater.",10,1,2,5 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War - the War has begun
","Infinity War deserves to be one of the best Marvel movie to have come out, if not the best. It truly combines all characters into a single story telling which is well laid out and gives every character a chance to shine.Without going into the story and spoilers, I will highlight the pros and cons of the movie Pros: 
Thanos - after a decade of waiting we get to see him and he does not disappoint at allCharacters - most of the characters are in the film except of Hawk eye (whom I never liked) and AntMan. Each character gets good screen time especially Thor and Iron man and surprisingly Spider-Man tooStory - story is not so complex and continues where Thor 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 and CA Civil War ended. You will easily follow it if you can stay up for two and half hour Cons 
Thanos - yes that is true. There is no doubt he did an amazing job but his portrayal wasn't all that. I wished to see him in his full armor suit but he was bare head. Also he's supposed to be strong overall but movie seems to show the infinity stone makes him strongerMissing characters- AntMan was missing and I have no idea why. No Captain Marvel cameo End credit - there are end credit scene but you have to wait 15 mins for it after entire credit roll out and the scene is barely 20 secEnding - by the time movie finish you will know this is just the beginning. The entire movie was focus on Thanos collecting the infinity stone. What he is going to do with it is probably in the next infinity War Climax - this was the let down for me. First the main fight takes place in an open ground of Wakanda. Second so many creatures took most of the screen time that Thanos himself comes at the end and the fight is very small. There was no scene at the end where all avengers jump on him to fight him (beside the scene at Titan where Ironman Spider-Man and doctor strange all fight him at once which was a better scene than final battle). This was a major let down also because the final scene was on open ground and not in the main city. Once one small scene in the beginning was shot in NYC which was pretty small and quick. Scenes - some of the scene in trailer were not in the film it could be they are part of Infinity War II since they shot both films together Hulk - no hulk smashing this time since Bruce banner had trouble becoming a hulk he is given a hulk buster armor Overall the movie scores 8/10 on my scale and I hope the next part fills in the gap that were missed in Infinity War",8,1,7,2 May 2018
A Quiet Place," A rebirth of classic Three Mustekers
",From get go I knew this is coming from the classic three musketeers and it turned out to be true but in a new style. There is nothing new to offer in this movie but the way movie starts and holds off until the end will keep you on the edge of your seatA family trying to survive and over come three creatures that hunts by sound and what happens next and how they overcome them is for you to find out I gave this movie a 7/10 because movie could have been better without having too many character taking the hit but it is what it is.,7,1,3,7 April 2018
It Chapter Two," Movie like IT should be praised
","IT chapter 2 picks up when the first one ended. The story follows smoothly and transitions to adulthood and intro to their lives and routine is well shown. Pieces picks up perfectly and Pennywise makes a return immediately without having audience to wait for an hour. Moreover we get to see Pennywise more in its original form and the acting definitely steals the show.
Everyone has done their part well and looks fit for their role.
Movies like it should be a praised in the horror genre. It hardly has jumps and scared but will keep you on the edge of your seatThe movie ends well with a satisfactory ending.
The only draw back I see is the long run time but given the story line and ending which was easily an hour of horror show, I couldn't find a moment where movie run time could be cut.An excellent follow up to the first chapter and a great finale. Will sure miss this franchise",9,2,5,8 December 2019
Green Book," A classic in modern time
","Going in to this movie without any expectation I was surprised to see how a movie like this can miss the lime light of media and hypeThis is one of those movies that are made once in a decade. With a great case, powerhouse performances by every characters and a gripping story this movie has a a lesson we all can learn and relate to.I hope more movies are made like this",10,4,9,9 December 2018
Annihilation," Don't waste your money and time
","This is a great example of an over hype movie with no story direction. Great visuals and casting Natalie Portman doesn't make a great movie, a great script and storyline does. Not to mention the horrible sound track at the end of the movie which ruined the whole experience",1,7,14,23 March 2018
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons As a Show is Better
","I am The Simpsons fan since 2002. Ever since i watched the first preview of Simpsons Movie with that Supderman logo, i have been dying to see the movie. Finally on Saturday, i went to see it, and here is what i think of it. You all know the movie PLOT by now so i won't go into detail with it. The Simpsons movie is well funny, storyline is good and almost every character is seen in the movie (some might not have any dialouge) I have to say i was Let Down by this movie, it just didn't meet my expectations. First of all, the movie was way too short, i don't know why. Due to its short length, many characters are cut-off, and some don't even have screen time they deserve. The movie itself seems to be fast-paced due to lack of time. New character were useless because not enough character development was there. It would have been better to represent classic existing Simpsons characters with more refined role to play, than introducing new love of Lisa.Another thing is that as the film makers mentioned how hard they had to work to get the right story for Simpsons Movie, i don't think this movie does justice to the story. To me, the movie was more focused on the jokes than keeping the plot going. Also the theme was good, but the lack of time prevented a good point between Bart and Flanders to be discovered by homer deeply. Everything seems to be happeninig so quickly, like Simpson family moving to Alaska, then going back to Springfield, the overall journey went by just with a blink of an eye. Also less screen time was given to famous landmarks of Springfield such as Moe's Tavern, Nuclear Power Plant. The filmmakers spoiled some BIG jokes that the movie had to offer by showing them in the Simpsons Movie promos, like Bart naked skateboarding scene, Spider-pig. What has been deleted from the final versing of MOVIE?Also to keep the movie PG-13, the makers of this movie took some scenes and dialogs out from the final movie which they originally showed at the Comic-Con such as when the mob comes to look for homer, Lenny asked Moe 'so who are we going to kill again' and Moe replies 'I think people in the front knows' and another scene when mob climbs through ladder in Lisa's room and Homer Hits Lamp,camera, and toilet paper has been cut from the movie which i think was disappointing because it was one of the hilarious scenes in the movie. Another good scene that has been changed is that when Homer goes to dump the Pig-Crap into river, the warning boards were hilarious that were shown at comic con, but in the movie the wording has been changed due to its rating that the movie makers wanted to have. You can see those scene in you-tube when u searched for Simpson movie scene. Anywaz, back to movie, the animation are good, especially the background is well done and can say is computer animation, the characters are hand drawn, but has been colored by computer so its worth watch in big screen. After seeing the movie, i truly believe that The Simpsons as a show is much better, after all a show is a show and this is where it all started. If makers of The Simpsons were to do a poll for whether to make a sequel to Simpsons Movie or another new Season, i would prefer a new season because there are thingy that make this show and it can't be done on movies. Despite the disappointment, i still give this movie 10/10 and can watch it again-again n again, the movie is sure a Must-Go to watch in Theaters, cuz u never know when u will see Homer again on BIG screen.",10,2,7,29 July 2007
