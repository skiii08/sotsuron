The Finest Hours," A decidedly mixed bag of a movie
","Some mild spoilers.I grew up on the east coast, and I know a little about the crazy storms there; I also am a sailor, and have had my share of vomit inducing rough rides in my current west coast location, but I have never seen *anything* like the storm described in the book this movie is based on, although I can extrapolate a little to get some idea of what it must have been like... a truly terrifying experience. Those are the spots of the movie I think they got right - you had a sense of the extreme cold, the wicked seas, the hopelessness of the rescue mission, the desperation and determination.What I thought was a failure were the personal portions, which were altered significantly and often painted people in a poor light, which angers me in a 'based on a true story' movie and was totally unnecessary. For instance - Miriam and Bernie were already married and she was sick with the flu and worried in bed when Bernie went out; the total drama and mockery of her 'asking him to get married' was unnecessary (she DID propose to him, apparently, but they had already been married for over a year at the time of the rescue) and didn't enhance the story, nor did Miriam's lecturing the commander, Daniel Cluff. Every military spouse I have ever met and spoken to knows the risks of the life and would never barge into the CO's office and demand he/she be removed from a mission. It seemed forced and silly because it was - it wasn't true, she never did it, and at times they almost made Cluff seem like a buffoon - which from what I have read, he wasn't.There was also no need to contrive the story about Ray Sybert and someone on the ship knocking heads - there was enough drama, and I think it detracted from what personally happened in a harrowing situation. Sybert stepped into the Captain's shoes when the boat foundered and there was enough there without concocting something ridiculous about a makeshift rudder and beaching when by the book's account that didn't happen, and I am not sure that physically it would be possible.It would have been better if the movie had stuck with the FULL story of that day - the attempt at a double rescue of crew of two oil tankers that had BOTH split in half. The Fort Mercer story had a lot of nail-biting moments too, and I think that movie that showed this double rescue would have been better than what was produced. Bernie and his crew were genuine, gold-plated heroes, and the Coasties rescuing men from the Fort Mercer were also, and I think celebrating them - people who go out in the worst conditions to rescue absolute strangers - is a triumph on it's own, especially considering the backdrop this record storm created.",6,0,0,25 November 2019
The Death of Stalin," Surprising dark comedy that manages to show evil with humour, without excusing it
","I wasn't sure what to expect, but this movie was recommended to me. As a descendant of someone who suffered under Soviet communism (farm collectivised, friends dragged off, etc), and sensitive to how revisionist history sometimes dulls the edges of evil, I was very curious as to how this crazy, fearful time would be presented. How do you make the terror that Solzhenitsyn expressed so passionately, funny?The performances are top notch - from Beria to Zhukov, the cast were amazing; Michael Palin was good as Molotov (as he chose to play him), although the way he characterized him I disagree with. The humour comes in seeing these brutal and merciless men terrorized by their own fear of what could happen and knowledge that they could be next on the list, (in fact, Molotov's wife was in prison as a traitor). Seeing these men nervous, fawning, scheming and obsessing over things was funny, because the script was clever and managed to preserve the absurdity and callousness of the Soviet regime whilst showing the duplicity, machinations and plotting against each other. The egos were preserved, the desire to criticise and use anything as a way to climb up way was shown, and even though you knew they were real people, it was hard to feel sorry for any of them, seeing and knowing what they did.It is a rare movie, in that it took a terrible time, made a dark comedy, yet didn't sugar coat things but pulled you in. The dialogue, quips and chemistry between all the stars were terrific, and I actually laughed loudly at Jason Issacs' portrayal of Zhukov; it was brilliant, and shows what a talented actor he is (Lucius Malfoy as a Soviet general? IT WORKS.) Buschemi had a lot of depth playing Khrushchev, another great performance by him. See it - I guarantee it won't be what you expect but it will be worth your time! A new favourite.",9,0,0,13 January 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Great movie, re-energized my love of SW after disappointing #7
","Some light spoilers.I had very low expectations going into RO, because I felt horribly let down by #7. Sure it hit some buttons in the sense that the universe was there, some familiar faces (and ships) were present, but there was too much humour, it felt like #4 re-imagined, the plot lacked cohesion, (parts of it, like the planet sapping the suns was just laughable), emo villain (Khylo Ren) wasn't impressive, and a weak, semi-hysterical heroine who runs off into the forest when she discovers something difficult was disappointing.I almost didn't go to SEE Rogue One, because after 1-3 and 7, I couldn't take any more disappointment. I LOVE Star Wars, it was a seminal series for me with lots of attachments and importance, and I couldn't take another battering by it. I love space and science fiction, and Star Wars grabbed the love I had of that genre and made it alive in front of my eyes. I am grateful for that.My boyfriend's company had extra tickets for RO however and I went. At first I was confused a little - the story line comes together in pieces in the beginning, jumping from a remote planet to a prison to a mining colony, etc - but slowly the shape takes form.Jyn is a terrific character; she tries desperately to hold what is happening at bay, because as she says to Saw, her former father figure, 'all this has brought me is pain', and it's believable. But when confronted with a message from her real father Galen and what is going on she becomes a dedicated fighter, willing to sacrifice anything to stop the empire and make Galen's sacrifice mean something.I loved the characters - from Bodhi, the cautious rebel who fully embraces the Alliance, to Churrit, the almost naively faithful guardian of the Jedi temple. The danger and urgency seem real - something 7 was lacking for me - and Cassian is a great character; a man hard from years of fighting the Empire who softens yet stays true to his principles.The locations are great - from Scarif, the Empire's repository of plans to Yavin 4, faithfully reproduced as the rebel base, to Jedha, the site of a Jedi temple. I loved how everything isn't all spelled out - you know for instance what Jyn has is Khyber around her neck without being told, and you are left to wonder a bit how Bodhi really came to want to help to alliance; whether it was mostly because of the rape of Jedha, his homeworld, his admiration for Galen, or even more than that.K-2SO, voice acted by Alan Tudyk, provides a few light moments in a story that feels urgent, deadly serious. The last 45 minutes or so, when the rebels decide to join the fight on Scarif whilst Rogue One is trying to steal the plans is amazing. I saw this movie in both Real 3D and IMAX, and it is stunning in both. It has some of the best space fighting and cinematography I've seen in any Star Wars movie.When I first heard Peter Cushing's voice, I was surprised - I knew he had died years ago. His CGI is better than Carrie Fisher's at the end, FWIW. Tarkin is as creepy and loathsome as you remember him, and I am glad he was able to be included here, as he is key to the continuity and it segues into Star Wars: A New Hope.The movie for me, however, wasn't without flaws. When General Dravin tells Cassian to kill Galen rather than capture him, it seemed ill advised - after all, the station is operational and Galen could be the only person to provide information on it to the rebellion. I do admit a capture operation is a bit more involved and perhaps Draven didn't want to sacrifice the forces necessary for it. Also Tarkin destroyed the repository on Scarif, which I also thought wasn't very reasonable. I don't believe he was certain about the status of any upload and the records for the ENTIRE empire were stored there. A huge loss, I would think, and if the Death Star is so impregnable as Tarkin seems to believe, then why worry even if they DID get the plans for the Death Star? Then I realised there might be another consideration - Tarkin knew that Director Krennick was on Scarif, and could have also been getting rid of a thorn in his side.Despite these few questions, I think the movie is excellent and holds up well - perhaps better - after a few showings, when you have a bit of an orientation and you can enjoy the smaller details, drink in the battles.",9,2,6,14 January 2017
