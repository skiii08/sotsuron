Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great computer animation and a great movie
","This is a really good film many good things in this one. I don't think this is as good as the other three but still it's awesome. Having Yoda back and R2D2 was cool. I liked the Darth Maul character and his lifesaver but the only thing was they didn't really tell much about him at all like where he came from I know he was with the emperor. Liam Neesen who I really like since he comes from one of my all time favorites KRULL did a good job in this. In the next one I hope they have C3PO in it more than what they did in this one. Hopefully by the third prequel they will have Luke,Leid and Han in it. My favorite character was of course Jar Jar Binks he was hilarious!!!",10,0,0,19 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," A really great film!
",I liked this one.....Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci did a fantastic job.......The heds coming off really looked real and the tree that had the headless horseman come out of was really cool. Johnnny Depp had some funny lines in it like being afraid of spiders and stuff. Christina Ricci was gorgeous in this....I give this 5 ***** stars all the way Great fun and entertainment in this movie!,Null,0,0,17 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great movie and my favorite of the series
",I liked this one a lot. I liked the scenes with Jabba at the beginning I thought he was a good bad whatever he is. The scene where Luke and the gang are in Endor is awesome with the biker scouts speeders. The ewoks were cool. The ending to the special edition to this is awesome too. Then you see Vadar with flames surrounding him. What a way to end this great trilogy. 5 ***** stars all the way and the best of the series at least to me.,10,1,2,12 August 1999
There's Something About Mary," A Very Funny Movie But Not As Funny As Dumb And Dumber
","There's a whole bunch of funny things happening in this movie but Dumb And Dumber was funnier. Cameron Diaz did a terrific job as Mary and Ben Stiller was good too and he had all the bad luck getting thrown in jail, had a really bad day going to the senior prom with Mary. Anyways it's a really funny movie specially the dog scenes!!!!",Null,0,0,22 January 1999
The Truman Show," Worst Movie Of 1998
",I Can't believe all the user comments on this movie and they liked it. They should be shot!!!! I Couldn't believe I wasted my money ON THIS PIECE OF s--t!!!!!! And to whoever thinks that this is better than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN should go to rehab!!! And here is 10 reasons why this movie sucked 1. there's no point to this 2. it's a waste of money 3. you'll fall asleep easily 4. wasn't funny 5. Jim Carrey doesn't fit in 6. it's a story that doesn't make any sense at all!!! 7. you'll wish the movie screen would just burn!!!! 8. it would make you leave in two seconds 9. DUMB AND DUMBER 2 IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THIS 10. EVEN JIM CARREY HIMSELF PROBABLY COULDN'T BELIEVE HE DID THIS!!!!!!,Null,0,6,16 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Empire Strikes Back
",Again what can I say about this film other than it's pure genius. This one tells a lot like Luke meeting up with Yoda and finding out that Vadar is his father. The battle scene between Luke and Vadar is fantastic! Great movie I give this 5 ***** stars all the way!!!,10,0,0,12 August 1999
The Breakfast Club," Young man have you finished your paper!
