Vertigo," Just misses being a masterpiece
","I know that many people consider this Hitchcock's masterpiece, and some consider it the greatest film of all time.  True, it has many elements of a masterpiece.  It is a major mood piece.  The sad, elegaic melancholy is sustained throughout, thanks largely to Bernard Hermann's score.  The acting is first rate, even by Novak.  The color is masterful.  All this having been said, why then do I say that this just misses being a masterpiece.  Because, to me, the film has a serious flaw which mars the film, although it doesn't destroy it.  The flaw occurs in the scene that occurs about halfway through the film, after Madeline has been dead for a year, when Scotty meets Judy Barton, also played by Novak.  After Scotty brings her back to her hotel room and says goodnight, Judy begins an internal monologue, accompanied by a visual flashback, that gives away the whole plot.  After this, there is no more suspense!  The viewer knows something that Scotty doesn't.  Wouldn't it have been far better for the viewer to have been kept in suspense as well and find out the truth at the same time Scotty does.  If you don't believe me, watch the film again and fast forward past this scene, and see if it isn't an improvement.  Otherwise, a masterpiece.  9/10",9,4,7,10 June 2004
The New World," Visually beautiful--if you can stay awake
","This film tells the familiar story of Pocahontas, Powhatan, John Smith, and John Rolfe in a manner appears to be intended to be more historically accurate than most of the fantasized versions of the story that have been depicted over the years. For the most part, it succeeds, with some glaring exceptions. Malick's most daring venture was to cast a 14 year old actress in the role of Pocahantas, which puts her not far from the age--traditionally 12--that the real Pocahontas was at the time she intervened to save Smith's life. The young actress is half Indian and half Caucasian; I guess they couldn't find a full-blooded Indian for the part. The first disconcerting note, at least for this viewer, occurs fairly early in the film when Pocahontas raises her arms and we see that her armpits are shaved. An Indian girl, in 1607? Not likely! This inattention to detail threw me out of the film's frame of reference, reminding me that I was watching a film and that this is an actress who, even at this tender age, can't allow her image to be besmirched by being filmed with hairy underarms.The film is visually beautiful, as Malick's films usually are. The camera glides over some of the pastoral scenes, and we get a sense--as we are clearly meant to--of how pristine and unspoiled the North America was before the white man came. The actors in the three principal parts all perform competently and are successful at conveying their thoughts and feelings nonverbally. They don't have much choice, because there is very little dialogue. And, thankfully, the Indians are not portrayed as saintly or noble, but quite accurately as people going about their business who are alternately fascinated by and fearful of these intruders. They rightfully foresee that the settlers might not want much now, but they might want much more later.So, the film has much to recommend it. But it has a fatal flaw: it is excruciatingly slooooooooooooooooooow and boooooooooooooooooooring. It could easily have been pared by a third and edited to an hour and a half length. Instead it plods on for two and a quarter hours, long long after I had come to appreciate the visual poetry and had gotten its obvious points (in case you don't know what they are, this film will be a delight for tree huggers and cultural relativists).In the final analysis, I suppose the film is worth seeing, but have a few strong cups of coffee before you do.",6,2,7,26 June 2007
Marie Antoinette," I prefer the 1938 version
","The praise lavished on this film by some critics mystifies me. There is no reason (other than enriching a studio's coffers) to do a new version of a well-known historic episode unless the new version adds something new and previously unknown. This film decidedly does not. It obviously attempts to attract a younger audience with its annoying use of rock music on the soundtrack and its inclusion of a pair of modern sneakers amid a pile of period shoes. Things like this worked for Baz Luhrmann in 'Moulin Rouge,' but they don't work here. The 1938 film of the same name is much better, if only because the great Robert Morley is perfectly cast as Louis XVI, capturing perfectly his dunciness and overall arrested development. Here that part is woodenly played by a clueless Jason Schwartzman, looking like a young Stanley Tucci. Altogether, this film is a bore and a wasted effort. Oh well, at least I enjoyed looking at brief glimpses of Kirsten's bare butt (if it was really hers and not that of a body double).",7,1,3,9 November 2007
Closer," Nearly flawless, marred by miscasting
","This film is that rarity of rarities in mainstream films: a film about intelligent, articulate adults that is emotionally honest. This can probably be credited primarily to Mike Nichols, who has never flinched from depicting lacerating emotional honesty in his films ('Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,' 'Carnal Knowledge'). The screenplay, adapted from a play by its author, is first rate, giving us dialogue that represents how urban adults actually talk to one another, and it can be forgiven the contrived way in which it depicts the meeting between the Law and Portman characters, unfortunately reminiscent of Jennifer Lopez in 'The Wedding Planner.' Fortunately, that happens in the very beginning of the film and as we get involved in the characters we can forget about it.Much of the credit for the film's success can go to the actors, especially Owen, Law, and Portman. Owen, whom I have never seen before, is a dynamo and probably the nastiest character in the film. He seems to delight in spewing verbal invective. Yet, he is still able to display emotional vulnerability. Law plays down his sex symbol image and plays another rotter who enjoys playing nasty tricks on people. Portman is simply fantastic playing a seemingly emotionally vulnerable and needy young woman who is not as innocent as she seems.The films principal, and only, serious flaw is the casting of Julia Roberts as Anna, perhaps the pivotal character in the film. I have read that Cate Blanchett was first cast in the part, but then withdrew. This is a pity; Roberts is totally miscast. Yes, she's beautiful, but she plays Anna with such emotional coldness that it's a mystery why two men like Law and Owen would become obsessed by her. They react to her as they might to a sexual dynamo, which she definitely isn't in this film. Perhaps if she brought a bit of the vulgarity she did to playing Erin Brockovitch to this role, their obsession might be understandable. It might be even more understandable with a different actress. But in spite of this flaw, it's a memorable film. 9/10",9,0,0,23 December 2004
La Vie En Rose," Great performance, so-so movie
","There is no question that Marion Cotillard deserved the best actress Oscar for her performance in this film. That having been said, it must also be said that there is no other reason to watch this film. It seesaws between repeated biopic clich√©s and incoherence. Crucial elements of Piaf's life are left out or, when they are included, they are underexplained and left dangling.For example, we learn that the boxer Marcel Cerdan was probably the love of her life, but he was married with three kids and refused to leave his wife, before he was killed in a plane crash. According to this film, Piaf had at least two husbands, but we learn absolutely nothing about them, the circumstances of their marriages, and how at least one marriage ended. How many times was Piaf married, anyway? Better look elsewhere, because this film won't tell you. Another example: when the Gerard Depardieu character is murdered, we never learn why he was murdered (there is a hint that mob activity was involved) or why Piaf was a suspect. And was Piaf ever a prostitute? There are indications that she was under the thumb of a pimp who had her sing on the street for his profit and who threatens to make her 'spread her legs,' but whether she ever does is unclear.To sum up: see this film only for Cotillard's performance. Otherwise, it is a mess.",6,1,2,29 September 2009
Signs," Not suspenseful, not exciting, not logical...but well acted
","Mel Gibson's powerful screen presence is the only thing that saves this dismal attempt at a scifi suspense thriller. We are intended to accept Gibson as a former priest (presumably Episcopalian or Eastern Orthodox, since he has been married and has children) who renounced his faith because of a personal tragedy.  Then we are to believe that he and his family being scared out of their wits by an extraterrestrial invasion will provide the impetus for him to regain his faith.  Well, maybe it would, but I think finding out that we are not alone in the universe would have the opposite effect on most people.There are several unexplained and illogical elements in the plot.  For example, why does his young daughter have a phobia about drinking water?  We know plotwise why she does, because all the undrunk water around the house comes in handy later in a plot device I won't reveal, but why does she have such a phobia in the first place?  Why does the mere unseen but suspected presence of the extraterrestrials cause a beloved family dog to become viscious enough to try to kill the little girl, forcing her young brother to stick a knife in him, and cause the other dog to be tied up, but appear to have no such effect on humans?  And what is Mel going to do with all that corn?  He lives on a one crop farm with acre upon acre of corn, but there don't appear to be any farm implements anywhere in sight, nor are there any hired hands.  Are Mel and his brother going to pick all this corn with their bare hands?Now let's get to the extraterrestrials.  They appear to be the most incompetent extraterrestrials ever to appear in a scifi film.  We are to believe that they have a technology sufficiently advanced to allow them to travel from another solar system light years away, with hostile intent, yet they don't appear to have any weapons with them, no ray guns, no laser beams, not even a pitchfork.  Moreover, one of them can't even get out of a locked pantry.  Maybe he was the doofus of the bunch, since he was one of the ones who got left behind.  The depiction of the extraterrestrials is also singularly unimaginative, since the only one we get a good look at appears to be wearing a rubber suit that looks like it's the same one worn by James Arness the 'The Thing from Another World' back in 1951.But as I said, it's well acted by Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones, and the children.  Otherwise a ludicrous mess.  4/10",4,2,3,9 July 2004
