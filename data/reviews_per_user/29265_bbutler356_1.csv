Miracle," The climax of the movie was ruined for me.
","I don't happen to know that in hockey there are THREE periods, not four quarters.  How many average Americans DO know this?  Then during the hockey game against the USSR (the climax of the movie) they kept showing the scoreboard which had FOUR quarters listed on it, and we were clearly in the THIRD of these four.  Therefore I thought that there was a full quarter to go, so instead of really going with the action, as the moviemakers intended, I'm sitting there enjoying the movie, but excitedly waiting for the 4th quarter.  Suddenly it's all over and I'm thinking that this was one of the stupidest oversights I've ever seen a movie maker commit.  The movie was good, if you realize that you're watching the last period of the hockey game.Pitiful.",Null,0,1,4 April 2004
