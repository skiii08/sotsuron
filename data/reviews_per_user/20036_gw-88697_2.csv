Insidious: Chapter 2," Boring And Pointless
","I suppose this crap keeps people in a job and food on their tables. Road sweeping is more entertaining to watch. I can't include spoilers when it's already spoilt, a bit like rotting fish.",1,1,3,19 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What Is This Flick About?
","I've never lasted beyond 1/2 an hour watching this crap. It's SO BORING.
From what I've seen of it, it's just Robin Hood and his Merry Men with spaceships. Pfft .....
Fortunately, that 1/2 hour of boredom had inoculated me from watching any further Star Wars junk.",1,4,14,19 January 2018
