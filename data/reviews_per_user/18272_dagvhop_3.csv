Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," very, very boaring spacecrap!
","This is the most dull and overhyped film I`ve ever seen. What is wrong with Lucas? Can he even direct at all? No, I don`t think so. Nothing happens in this film, the actors are stiff like carrots and the FX are quite lame. And this Jar.Jar blink,sight! He interfers so much in this film that you hope he will be shot in million pieces by some poorley datamade enemy.This film sucks BIG! 2\10 and the point are for nice costumes and Williams music.",1,0,1,9 August 2001
Memento," utterly brilliant and genius movie
","At last a movie which turns a basic thrillerstory into an utterly brilliant and genius movie.  I will guaranty you that your wits will get a really good massage because the linear-timeline in Memento is up for a treat! We are for example presented with one timeline which goes backwards in realtime but forward in filmtime, and so on. To write about what the movie is about is not nessesary just go ahead and rent it! The acting are great, the editing could have been just a little tighter, but the real genius are the director and writer!",9,1,4,27 February 2002
Singin' in the Rain," one of the best
","It`s one of the most enjoyable movies I`ve ever seen. Story is good, the singing is better, and the dancing is amazing. This is a must-by DVD for everyone who enjoys life. If you don`t feel good after this movie I suggest a visit to the head-doctor is a must.",9,1,4,9 August 2001
