Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You either Love it or Hate it... and I loved it.... NOT
","Exactly what I said - you either love it or hate it.. yes.. there are certain things that are funny, such as the 'NOT' and the hotel scene with the naked men at each other... but otherwise, as a female, I found it overly distasteful. Even if women were a lower in the social hierarchy, I don't believe any culture could stoop so low to almost brand women as close to 'prostitutes'. Marrying any woman the man wants? That's absurd! I know its all a joke, but I find that kind distasteful and have gone too far. I have no sympathy for the character, rather, he's a disgrace to travelers who truly want to learn other cultures, and taken the whole 'women' identity thing way too far. I think the movie would be better if the Borat character could create more sympathy, apathy.. not just toilet humour. Cheap humour with no substance. Go watch for cheap frill laughs.",5,2,5,14 December 2006
The Prestige," Clever, dark, haunting and competition to its deadliest..
","The author of this storyline must have the most disturbed and brilliant mind ever! This story may be sci-fi, however, the issues that we could relate to, is astonishingly in abundance. Take the core of the movie - competition of magicians. It is a reality that you must have the better trick to lure more customers. In this phase of competition, it is called healthy competition. As time passes, you move onto the next phase - resent. This is the phase where you begin to figure ideas to eliminate the competitor. Then comes the final phase - obsession. From healthy to obsessed. Obsession is the phase where you go beyond competitive elimination - which is now dangerous and life-threatening. Just like the 3 stages of magic which was the theme of the movie - The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. These issues, although depicted in a sci-fi way, is very true in reality. Humans compete for business. Humans begin to try damaging other people's business. Humans begin to assassinate other people so they could have their turf for their business. We live in a very twisted world, and this movie is no different.You can see here, that this movie could be depicted and interpreted in many ways. Obsession could be seen as a disease, slowly gnawing your life away, leaving marks at each milestone it eats. Just like the missing finger of Borden, and the injured leg of Angier. It is full of meaning, similes, metaphors. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and will blow your mind away. Every time you think about this movie, you seem to always think of something new, like I did with this comment above! I think this will be a classic, just like thrillers such as Seven. Dark, haunting and full of meanings.. the best psychological thriller of this era!",9,2,3,14 December 2006
The Departed," Interesting, full of twists.. great for those who haven't seen Infernal Affairs, cringe-worthy for those who have...
","This film is made into a movie of its own. Although based on Infernal Affairs (HK production), the story have been slightly altered perhaps to fit the culture of American street gangs. I do admit, there are many things I do not like about the film, being a fan of Infernal Affairs, it is more wishy-washy, and Jack Nicholson was... well.. not that wonderful. I read somewhere that apparently Jack Nicholson didn't even research for his role, so he just 'naturally' played him.. so you can see, this character ended up being more of an 'evil clown named IT', rather than the terrifying controlling leader of the mob. That really disappointed me, because characters in control (Chinese Triad bosses, Godfather, etc) are all very strong, controlling and more level-headed characters, whereas Jack Nicholson's character is more a clown than a boss. Another cringe-worthy scene is where they hired poor Cantonese speakers to act as triads from China (speaking Cantonese?? you mean they're from HK or Canton?). Any Cantonese speaker will cringe and laugh at how poorly they spoke Cantonese! I know that's not overly important for those who doesn't understand Cantonese.. but just makes the film more tacky.. you know... just unrealistic .. so it's tacky.Leo DiCaprio was surprisingly good, hands down for his magnificent performance - a great mature comeback from his gone teen-heart-throb era.Besides that, the story of course is brilliant. No one can deny or hate the story-line, as it is magnificent, unique, and clever both in the HK and the Hollywood version. My vote is given for the story line and Leo.",7,0,2,14 December 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Beautiful gripping realistic tale of a tragic hero, who'll leave you crying for more
","Thanks to the Smith Family, I was able to see the pre-screening of this movie with my partner, and we were both absolutely surprised at how good this movie was! At first, my impression was that it will be mostly comedy, because of the type of movies Will Smith was in. Then I was skeptical because the description of the movie was something that sounded serious! But then, even as a serious character, Will Smith was a great actor alongside his side Jaden, which gave the whole 'father-son' figure all the more real.As a medical equipment salesman, Chris Gardner (Will Smith) barely made enough money to pay rent and support his family. The situation just gets worse, his wife (Thandie) leaves him, he struggles to take custody of his son (Jaden), then he got kicked out of his apartment, lived in a cheap motel, living off 23 bux, kicked out of the motel, then right into sleeping in the toilets at the train station. By that moment of the film, you'd be gripping and crying for this character, pondering if it's possible to get more worse than the worst. But then the theme of fatherhood and Chris' determination to provide for his son makes this character the most admirable and self-less man ever. He believed he could find happiness, and he believe he could do it. Even with all these obstacles, he takes one look at his son and he gets back on his feet to face the cruel world once more.This is a story that'll leave you in awe, and fill you with hope, that you can do it, and make it, as long as you believe you can do it.",8,7,13,14 December 2006
