Angels & Demons," Entertaining, which is all that I ask of it
","Despite all the flaws with Dan Brown's writing style, Angels and Demons was a very entertaining piece of 'detective' fiction. Where Da Vinci Code had many scenes of sitting around, sipping tea and discussing art, A&D had a much faster pace to it, which translates significantly better to the screen. The history aspect which DVC capitalized on is surely present, but to a somewhat smaller degree, allowing the plot to stand on its own two feet.Fans of the book should know it stays mostly true. Sure, you can whine about stuff like 'omg no guy in wheelchair' or 'omg she was his daughter not his partner', but the essence is definitely intact. One twist at the end is left out, but it felt forced anyways in the book, so I believe its best as is.Still has the weaknesses of the book, but is much better than its predecessor as it is less of the 'history' lesson (note the quotes). Tom Hanks still isn't perfect, but he's learned some of his lessons from the last one. Overall, if it looks like the kind of thing you'd like, you probably will. If not, you won't. It's a simple little movie like that.",7,1,4,2 June 2009
Walk the Line," Walk the Line stands tall as a great biopic with excellent chemistry, acting and music
","I'm going to admit, I never really did ever listen to any Johnny Cash. Hell, Ring of Fire and The Man Comes Around are the only two songs of his I've ever even heard. Then again, I had never really listened to any Ray Charles, yet that didn't stop me from loving Ray in 2004. Especially with all of the awards buzz, this was one that I really wanted to see. So, does Walk the Line really walk the line or does it burn, burn, burn? Walk the Line, as we all know, is the life story of Johnny Cash, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. It starts with his child life on a farm, where his father Ray (Patrick) has become dismissive of Johnny since the death of his brother. When Johnny becomes eighteen, he signs up for the army during WWII. Upon his return, he marries his highschool sweetheart Vivian (Goodwin) and gets a failing job as a door-to-door salesman. His real passion though is his band, which he started with two neighbours. They manage to secure themselves an audition, and after using songs Cash wrote in the army, the get a record deal and Cash becomes a star almost overnight.That's how it begins, with Cash as a genuinely good person. Of course, as we've seen before in celebrity biopics, that goodness soon fades as he picks up a pill-popping habit and begins cheating on his wife with fans. He is almost never home to see his wife and children, which leads to the slow destruction of the relationship between Vivian and Johnny. It all seems like fairly standard stuff, which it is, but still is effective.While on tour, Cash also falls for singer June Carter (Witherspoon), whom he has admired since he was a child. This relationship ends up being the keystone of the whole movie, with everything else moving out of the way to concentrate on this aspect. The two of them obviously care for each other, though it is Cash's self-destructive nature that keeps them from truly acting on their impulses.The chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon is quite remarkable. Even from the first scene they share, you can tell that they are destined to spend their life together. Where they truly explode together is on stage, where the bond between them seems even stronger in their duets.Speaking of the stage, it should definitely be noted that all of the actors do their own singing. The songs in the movie are performed exceptionally well by all involved. Sure, they often sound nothing like the original singer, but this makes the movie feel much more real, with performances rather than what could arguably be called an imitation in Ray.The acting is what truly makes the movie. Phoenix is absolutely exceptional as Cash, making a very well known character his own as opposed to Foxx's approach in Ray, which was to get the character to the very last detail. Witherspoon possibly one-ups Phoenix as the incredibly radiant June Carter, displaying both the on- and off-stage persona with ease. She could have easily turned June into a cliché, but instead she seems like an incredibly real person. While the jury is still out on whether it was deserving the Oscar win for Best Actress, it was great nonetheless. Also, a special mention to Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick (the T-1000 himself), who were both very impressive as well.So, who would win in a fight, Johnny Cash or Ray Charles? To be honest, Ray is the better overall film in my opinion. Walk the Line still does stand tall as a great biopic with excellent chemistry, acting and music. The fact that everyone did their own singing is a definite plus. Walk the Line is definitely a great movie to see if you haven't already.Overall Rating  83%",8,0,0,2 April 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is the funniest movie ever (no exaggeration)
","Had I seen Da Ali G show even once before in my life, I may have had some inkling as to what to expect when seeing Borat. Having thus far avoided all that is HBO, I had no idea. It just had a funny name and lots of good press, so it seemed like it was worth a shot. It was on the cheap night, so I really couldn't be too disappointed. Now the word 'disappointed' being even remotely associated with Borat seem like pure lunacy. Borat elevates itself above even the slightest comparison with fellow gutbuster Jackass Two, proving itself to be simply the best comedy made in years.If you never watched the show (like me), Borat makes sure to get you acquainted relatively quickly with a tour of Kazakhstani TV talking head Borat's world. Borat lives in a poor village, associates with the town rapist, is considered rich for having a clock radio and occasionally plays ping pong at the local rec center. He is dispatched to America by his producers in order to bring back information to benefit his country. Along the way, he catches an episode of Baywatch, and makes it his mission in life to steal the virginity of Pamela Anderson.If that last sentence didn't clue you in, the movie is not meant for the plot. It boils down to a horny Kazakhstani guy wanting in Pamela Anderson's pants. That's the whole fun of the movie. We follow Borat from place to place as he chases Pamela Anderson and tries to get footage for his documentary at the same time, all the while exposing just how stupid the American public is. We have him exposing pretty much every person in the South as a gay-hanging bloodthirsty redneck in just one scene, for example. If this movie wanted to be completely political, it could do so and be quite riveting.However, Borat hardly tries to be political. It tries to just be as funny as humanly possible, and it does that incredibly well. This is basically all due to Sacha Baron Cohen, who plays Borat as such an absolute idiot that you still love him despite him being a completely racist and ignorant prick. How he manages to completely disappear into the character, I may never know. Even more amazing is what the reactions he manages to get out of people (all supposedly unaware, although common sense tells us that there was some staging involved), which are all absolutely perfect.What exactly Borat does is best left to you to find out, as giving it too much of a description might just ruin it. Suffice to say that Borat is the flat out funniest movie I have ever seen. I have never laughed so hard in my life, and then still been able to laugh at it simply by remembering the gags. Some of it is pure lunacy, but a lot of the movie is borderline genius. There's a lot of it in bad taste (such as Borat talking about vaginas or wrestling with a naked fat man with little superimposed black bars), but if you can stand it, those bits prove to be the funniest in the entire movie.I know this review is shorter than normal. Simply put, I don't want to spoil anything. The movie is all the better if you know as little as possible. I have seen Snakes on a Plane, Accepted and Jackass Number Two in theatres this year and I laughed more at this than all of them combined. Hell, this is comparable with Airplane and Blazing Saddles, basically becoming an instant comedy classic. Don't waste any more time reading reviews, get out there and see Borat immediately. Just don't forget your friends, because that'll make it all the better.",9,1,18,18 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin near-perfect 90s style flashback
","You ever had a really bad day? You know, the kind of day where nothing seems to be going right and just about anything that could go wrong does? No matter how bad your day may have been, I'm going to assume that the crap Slevin has to go through in this movie can top that. Even if it is about someone having a really bad day, Lucky Number Slevin is one hell of a good movie.Slevin (Hartnett), as stated above, is having on hell of a day. It starts out with him getting fired from his job. He goes home to find out he is being evicted. Without a home, he plans on staying with his girlfriend for a while, only to wind up walking in on her with a strange man. He instead calls his old friend Nick and goes to New York to stay with him. En route to the apartment, he is mugged. When he gets to the apartment, Nick is nowhere to be found. And, to top it all off, two gangsters show up at his front door to collect on a $96,000 debt that Nick owes The Boss (Freeman).Instead of demanding the money, The Boss offers Slevin (whom he assumes is Nick) a second option, which is absolve all debts by killing the gay son of rival gangster The Rabbi (Kingsley), who recently murdered The Boss's son. At the same time, The Rabbi picks up Nick/Slevin because Nick owes him around $30,000. Also, nosy detective Brikowski (Tucci) is investigating Slevin's appearances with both bosses. To top it all off, a mysterious assassin named Goodkat (Willis) shows up, apparently playing both sides of the fence. Slevin, with the help of curious neighbour Lindsey (Liu) is now caught in the middle.Right from the beginning, where Goodkat tells a story about a mob killing to a man in an airport, the movie tells you it is a con with a reference to a 'Kansas City Shuffle', where everyone looks to left and you go to the right. If you are good at solving this kind of movie, odds are you'll get the main twist sure enough. It's the little twists that are almost completely unpredictable, and they make the ending one of the best in recent years. The first two-thirds are a total setup to the incredible final act.The movie's style seems to be a mix of Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects and Get Shorty, which is a very good thing. It has a comedic flow with a great edge to it. In fact, there is almost nothing in the movie to suggest that it wasn't Tarantino directing another Elmore Leonard adaptation. Yes, that is right, I just compared this to Tarantino, and it deserves the comparison.The problem with the style is that the movie is often self-contradictory, or throws some very confusing scenes at us early on, which I will now dub WTF moments, due to the fact that they made me wonder exactly what the hell was going on. Some, such as myself, love this type of movie, but others may not like being stringed along as they will be constantly in this movie. Throw in some time-jumps, and this movie adheres to basically every Tarantino rule, which not everyone will like.One aspect I really liked was the paranoia from The Boss and The Rabbi, both of whom live in buildings facing each other, too afraid to leave their bulletproof glass shield for fear of high-powered rifles. The minor thugs they have all seem to fit into some kind of caricature, which helps keep the movie's style flowing in a Leonard-like fashion. Sure, stereotypes they may be, but they work well for the movie.One part I was worried about was the star, Josh Hartnett, who seemed quite out of place when compared to the rest of the cast when looking at the roster. Surprisingly, he steals the show with a character seemingly written just for him. Slevin is a smart-ass, sly and semi-pathetic character, and Hartnett completely convinced me, easily proving to be the best role I have seen him in to date. Not saying that this is some performance that will seriously garner any awards attention, but he stands tall, perhaps even rising above, the rest of the cast.The rest of the cast is comprised of some true greats from Hollywood, including two Oscar winners and Bruce freakin' Willis. Morgan Freeman definitely fits in with the Leonard style, with an edge much akin to Delroy Lindo in Get Shorty. Ben Kingsley creates a quite interesting character out of The Rabbi, which contrasts well to Freeman's cool, yet one-dimensional, Boss. Stanley Tucci seems largely ignored, but does exactly what anyone could have hoped for in his screen time. Lucy Liu did exactly what was needed for a female lead, which was to look attractive and bounce off Hartnett well. The two of them have definite chemistry, which is a major plus. Finally, Bruce Willis does what he does best as the mysterious assassin Goodkat. Even if the man says nothing, he still emanates kickass, and just by being in this movie the movie automatically rocks (well, not really, but you get the point).For anyone who loved the 90s, this movie is for you. It has all the style of the greats from that era, as well as a twisty, somewhat convoluted plot line that any fan of the genre will love. With a solid plot, excellent cast and plenty of style, Lucky Number Slevin is exactly the type of movie that we almost don't see enough of anymore. So, bring on more of the same, because even a copycat of this would be worthwhile.Overall Rating  94%",8,2,9,12 April 2006
Finding Neverland," Finding Neverland Focuses on all the Wrong Points
","Plot: 13/25: Sir JM Barrie (Depp) is a playwright who is having trouble finding inspiration. His latest play was a complete flop, and the stage director Charles Frohman (Hoffman) is breathing down his neck for something new. Meanwhile, his marriage to social-wannabe Mary Ansell Barrie (Mitchell) is falling apart. While out walking his dog in the park, he meets four young boys, Michael (Spill), George (Roud), Jack (Prospero) and Peter (Highmore) and their widowed mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet). He befriends the children and their mother, becoming a new friend and a new father rolled up into one. Peter, however, does not accept Barrie, and acts too grown up for his age. These children become the inspiration for his next play, about a child who does not want to grow up.Meanwhile, because of his newfound friendship with the family, there are rumours going around about him cheating on his wife with Sylvia, and worse rumours about him and the children. The sequences about Barrie's social life taking a pitfall are much more interesting than the children from a story perspective. The movie tries to evoke too many emotions with the children, especially Peter. More scenes about Barrie's social life and marriage crumbling would have prevented this movie from being just attempting to evoke sympathy.Visual Effects/Directing: 23/25: I'll admit, the really brilliant part of Barrie's scenes with the children is the exceptional. When Barrie is playing with the children, we are treated to see deep inside the imagination of the group, and seeing it cut away from the land of imagination and back to the real world is done masterfully. The effects are brilliant, really bringing you into Barrie's world, though the final Neverland effect is more confusing than artistic. Overall, though, the effects are fairly astonishing. Maybe not technically, but artistically.Acting: 20/25: Johnny Depp, what can one say about him? He has shot off like wildfire ever since his incredible performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, and now I cannot walk down the street without hearing about him. This is for a good reason. Depp has quickly become one of the best actors working today, and FN is no exception for him. He truly becomes JM Barrie in every way, a man who is still a child at heart.There has been a lot of buzz about Freddie Highmore (Two Brothers) in this film, but I personally do not believe he lives up to it. Well, he does seem good, but mainly because the other three children are all so annoying (especially Michael) that Highmore stands out as being the only one I can listen to without having my head explode in three separate directions. Winslet (Titanic) is good, but not as good as she has shown in Eternal Sunshine, which she was rightly given her Oscar nomination for over this. Hoffman (Rain Man) is good, but he is in more of a cameo role than anything else.Overall, the acting is good, but those kids are so incredibly annoying I had to mark it down.Entertainment: 13/25: Finding Neverland could have been better, but instead of trying to be a look into the crumbling of JM Barrie's social world or about simply how he was inspired, it tries to reach out of the screen and yank at the heartstrings. This is just what some people want, but it seems to try too hard to evoke sadness when it should be inspiring or intriguing. It has a lot of potential, and lives up to some of it, but it could have been better.Total: 69%: Finding Neverland could have been a lot more. It shows vast potential, but is focused on all the wrong things. Sure, it is good for tugging at heartstrings, but it does so forcefully by making you sympathetic. It could have been better, but is still well-acted and very well directed, so this is not a complete waste.",6,0,4,30 April 2005
Star Trek," Great popcorn fun, even if the sequel will probably be better
","This is not the second coming of Christ as many seem to be making it out to be. Its not particularly deep, the supporting cast seems to be extended cameos put there to please Trekkies while making a movie solely about Kirk and Spock, and, sorry to say, the little pistols still look like weak pieces of plastic.That being said, its probably the best popcorn movie of the year so far. The action setpieces are well made, time travel is handled well and the cast is uniformly entertaining (even Quinto, who I'm still not convinced can pull off anything other than Sylar). The reboot structure involving time travel is unique. Eric Bana is a great villain, unfortunately underused.However, I can't help but feel a Batman Begins syndrome is going to happen with this version of Star Trek. Sure, Star Trek is a good movie, but I get the distinct feeling the next sequel will be truly where this franchise will shine, since this entry probably works best as purely a setup.Now if they can find space for some tribbles...",7,1,9,2 June 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One, unlike any other Star Wars picture, is just a movie
","The release of a new Star Wars film is never just another movie. Through their relative rarity, a Star Wars movie is a major event, taking over the cultural conversation and, of course, the toys and adverts for the season. It worked last year, when the prospect of a new Star Wars lit the world on fire, aided by the fact that is decidedly didn't suck. Disney's decision to slot canon but non-saga films in between Episodes at first seemed promising, a chance to explore the universe in interesting ways. Instead of giving freedom to filmmakers to tell original stories, however, Disney has instead greenlit a young Han Solo movie and Rogue One, the story of the theft of the Death Star plans. While the former really seems like a shameless cash-in with no reason to exist other than an easy couple hundred million, Rogue One had a bit more potential, telling the story of the rebels who didn't quite have a Chosen One status to protect them. While Rogue One mostly works as entertainment and does keep a lot of the necessary Star Wars feel, its indebtedness to its predecessors and lack of focus keep it from ever really popping. For the first time in the franchise, Rogue One really feels like just another movie, something that passes two hours effectively enough but doesn't leave you wanting to explore more or spend more time in its world. Instead, it left me wishing for what it could have been.There are at least three great ideas within Rogue One that could have been expanded to make their own movie, but instead get stuffed into a planet-jumping escapade. There's a movie about Rebel spies gathering intelligence, and defections from the Empire. There's a movie about extremist factions in the Rebellion, and how they interact with the more moderate yet still militant Alliance (and what extremism even means in these circumstances). And, most prominently in the last act, there's a Star Wars version of Saving Private Ryan, of Rebel soldiers on a doomed mission. The hints towards this last idea make up the best act of the movie, and there does seem to be some juice in making more movies about The Star War itself. Instead, Rogue One tries to keep the bones of a normal Saga film by having the main characters move all over the galaxy, but continually loses focus in the process.Having the main characters mobile works well for the Saga films, but the central crew of Rogue One isn't developed or interesting enough to pull the same trick. For a movie with such a welcomely diverse cast (although still overwhelmingly male), the actual characters in a Rogue One are pretty bland and inseparable. Most pass without much impact, notably Diego Luna's Rebel captain, while others try to make up for it with hammy performances, notably Forest Whitaker's extremist leader Saw Guerrara. While Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso isn't quite a Chosen One in the vein of Luke, Anakin, and Rey, her familial tie to the Death Star plans makes her feel more like a plot device than a character. Although he does get some of the best lines of the film, droid K-2SO feels like a factory-approved fan favourite rather than an inspired creation, answering the question of what a more homicidal C-3P0 would look like. Riz Ahmed's presence makes up for his character's complete lack of definition, but there's no comparison of this batch to Rey, Finn, and Poe in Episode VII. Poe similarly had little definition, but the little touches the script and Oscar Isaac's performance gave him made him feel complete with relatively little screen time. Outside of K-2S0 and Donnie Yen's force-sensitive preacher, I can't say that any of the characters in Rogue One are half as memorable with twice the screen time.The biggest issue I have with Rogue One, though, is how enslaved it is to A New Hope (some mild spoilers follow). As the Death Star is an obvious connection, certain characters make sense to bring back, such as Grand Moff Tarkin, Mon Mothma, and even Darth Vader. But Rogue One doesn't stop there, and bringing back the likes of the two Mos Eisley bar thugs serves only to distract from the story at hand. In order to bring back Tarkin, a CGI Peter Cushing wanders around. This might have been convincing as a hologram but is directly at the nadir of uncanny valley among flesh-and-blood actors, robbing him of his authoritative presence. Rogue One's reverence does give it some strength, reinforcing to a more convincing degree than the original saga the connections between the Death Star and the nuclear nightmare. It also nails the run-down aesthetic in the same way that The Force Awakens did (an inner-city ambush is a highlight for this). But its a necessarily lesser picture because of its indebtedness.The first shot of Rogue One mirrors the first shot of A New Hope almost exactly, but with a fantastic fake-out that announces itself as reverent, but different. Unfortunately, it overloads on the former and underperforms on the latter. Whether the infamous reshoots had anything to do with it or not, Rogue One is more concerned with comforting its audience than being its own thing. That's not to say its without merit, though. Star Wars is a fantastic universe to be comforted in, and the final forty minutes of the film deliver on the promise of a story of forgotten heroes, of sacrifice and slim hope. The audience's knowledge that said hope is fulfilled by a farmboy from Tatooine is the only thing that keeps it from being completely depressing, and I could have done without the constant winks toward that. The finale sequence still stands as both exciting entertainment and a promising launchpad for future side stories in this universe.",6,2,4,29 December 2016
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead Good Zombie-Beating Fun!
","I'm by no means an expert on zombie movies. Hell, 28 Days Later was the first one I saw, and it failed to make a great impression on zombie movies as a whole. However, when I saw Dawn of the Dead earlier this year, I had a permanent respect for the genre. I have since seen the original Night of the Living Dead and plan to see Day of the Dead and the original Dawn of the Dead. Was I ready for a zombie spoof, though? I knew a few spoofs would go over my head, but Shaun of the Dead looked like a pretty funny movie, so why not? Plot: 1.4/2: Despite some people saying this movie uses zombies as backdrop, it is a zombie movie through and through. This isn't a romantic comedy with zombies, it's a zombie movie with romantic elements. That being said, Shaun does have a sufficient plot for a no-brainer zombie comedy. Shaun (Pegg) is a 29 year old loser. He works at a job with high-schoolers. His girlfriend Liz (Ashfield) dumped him because of him being unreliable. He is the constant mediator between his flatmates, the workaholic Pete (Serafinowicz) and useless, penniless Ed (Frost). He also sees his mother Barbara (Wilton) very rarely and hates his stepdad Phillip (Nighy). That's his life before it happens. It started a night after Shaun and Ed got wasted to forget about Liz. Shaun has set a goal to get Liz back, see his mother and set his life in order when Ed finds a girl moping around their backyard. When Ed and Shaun investigate, they find out she is trying to bite them and she can live through having a metal pole shoved through her stomach. Soon, a couple more like her arrive. They watch TV to find out that there is an epidemic of crazed behaviour. The attackers will not stop barbaric cannibalism unless their brain is neutralized. In other words, zombism. After finding that Pete has been bitten, Shaun and Ed make a plan to pick up Barbara and Liz, also ending up taking Phillip and Liz's flatmates, twat (that's the word they use) David (Moran) and failed actress Dianne (Davis). They decide the best place to hole up is Ed's favourite pub, the Winchester. The rest of the movie is what happens once they are in the Winchester. For a movie that combines the two genres (comedy and horror) that are often the most stupid, the plot of Shaun of the Dead is about as good as anyone could expect. It's not a twisty one, very linear, but simple enough to be an easy watch but not seem stupid.Comedy: 1.8/2: This movie is British humour at it's best. Whether it's Ed's utter incompetence or Shaun's zombie denial, SotD is one funny movie. The only problem is it's not everyone's type of comedy. British comedy isn't for everyone. There is some bits that are really in-your-face, such as orchestrated zombie beating or the final newsreel montage, but there are many more subtle bits. Also, some of the bits are there for people who rewatch the movie to make connections, as there is a lot of foreshadowing that is hilarious the second time. If this is your type of comedy, this is your type of movie. With zombies. It also helps to have at least some knowledge of zombie movies, or else many references and spoofs will go over your head.Horror: 1.6/2: For a movie based mainly on comedy, Shaun of the Dead is extremely gory. It is probably gorier than Kill Bill Volume Two or Dawn of the Dead, maybe even the Passion. As much as I like gore, it does not add much to the horror factor. While many scenes are frightening, Shaun doesn't attempt to be a horror movie out and out. The aforementioned scene involving an orchestrated zombie beating could have been scary as hell without pool cues and Queen. What it does attempt is done very well, so I give it credit here.Acting: 1.9/2: I thought the acting was very good. Simon Pegg was a great Shaun. Moran, whom I've seen on Just for Laughs before, was excellent as David. And let's not forget Bill Nighy (Underworld) as the stepdad Phillip. Nick Frost didn't do an excellent job, but he was the scene stealer. Granted, any actor on a half-decent day could pull off that feat with the material he had. Another special mention to Penelope Wilton, who I thought played a great Barbara.Entertainment: 1.7/2: It all depends if you like this type of humour. If you like British humour, even though this isn't as outlandish as Monty Python, you will like this. If you are a zombie movie fan, you will like this. Exclude those two things and this is not your type of movie.Bonus +.1 for this: Ed plays none other than TimeSplitters 2 throughout the movie. I almost fell off my couch. For those who are non-gamers, TS2 is the best split-screen multiplayer game ever created (on this generation) and it's on all three major systems. Seeing this game here just made me smile. It's does have some zombies in it, so it's not completely out of place, but I would think something like Resident Evil would be more appropriate.Total: 85%: Shaun of the Dead is simply hilarious, so I highly recommend it for those who like this kind of humour and mildly recommend for those who don't. It's also great for the gore aficionado on your list. It is one that I personally am going to buy, so it is one that I believed was good enough to own. See Shaun of the Dead.",9,0,1,3 February 2005
Hostel," Hostel is the movie Saw wanted to be
","What is it with horror movies these days that believe that simply throwing buckets of cheap gore on a body equals scary? Cringing doesn't necessarily mean fear if it is ridiculous enough to be unbelievable. Movies like Saw have come close, but still never really achieve true fear. Hostel is the latest attempt at the gore flick, and for what it's worth, it is the movie that Saw wanted to be.The basic plot of Hostel takes quite a while to actually get into. Two friends, Paxton (Hernandez) and Josh (Richardson), are backpacking across Europe with Icelandic hitchhiker Oli (Gudjonsson) in search of drugs and girls. The first forty minutes or so is mainly one sex scene or nudity shot after another, with some smoking pot in between. They get a tip from a man in Amsterdam about a hostel (basically a hotel) in Slovakia that has some of the best girls on the planet, and the threesome head out to Slovakia. While they do find girls, they become trapped in a sick nightmare to satisfy the bloodlust of a group called the Elite Hunters, who torture and kill for fun.Of course, the torture scenes are meant to be the scariest. However, this isn't the case. It is not the physical act of torture that is necessarily scary. Sure, it is nice and gory, but it really isn't anything we haven't seen before. What is truly scary is that the movie seems as if it could actually be real. We all know there are true sickos out there who would pay for the ability to take a life in whatever way they deem fit. It has a degree of reasonable disbelief that makes the scenario believable, even if some events in the mandatory escape are a tad coincidental.To be perfectly honest, the fact that people watch movies like this in the first place is proof that the urge to kill is present in all of us. There is an inborn bloodlust that begs to be able to take life, much the same as a sexual urge. The sexual urge and bloodlust are even compared in the movie in a great scene where an escaping hostage idly chats with one of the butchers (Hoffman). The movie strikes a nerve deep inside, which is much more powerful than a couple of gore shots could ever be.Not that you have to look at the psychology behind the movie to enjoy it (I don't even know if the psychology was intentional). If you are the type of person who likes movies that rely on pure gore to unnerve you, Hostel definitely has what you need. The torture scenes are incredibly gory, especially one part where an eye is cut out. There is also the always painful tendon cut, chainsaw accident and drill insertion. Hostel doesn't necessarily break new ground in terms of gore, but it does rank fairly highly.Where the most effective thrills come from is the escape sequence near the end. The whole time where the survivor is trying to escape the factory is incredibly tense and bloody, with the audience never really sure if the director is actually going to let this person live. The ending does get bogged down a bit after the factory is behind the survivor, as the movie then relies heavily on coincidence and revenge, but it still remains tense, which is a feeling unfortunately missing from most horror movies.The acting in the movie isn't great, but it is better than the average horror movie. Jay Hernandez doesn't come across as anything special at first, but he actually seems to pull a good performance out of his ass when it comes his turn to face the hunters. Richardson is decent enough as the most three-dimensional of the group, as is Gudjonsson as the fun-loving Oli. Vlasak is very creepy as one of the hunters who meets the group early on. Bit player Rick Hoffman has an excellent cameo as a hunter who basically reveals all about the organization.While Hostel does bog itself down with a much too long opening and a slightly unbelievable ending, the meat of the movie is some of the best horror movie stuff in a while. It taps a nerve that says a lot about the human bloodlust, and is actually a comment on the film itself. Why do we see movies like Hostel? We see them because we wish to satisfy our bloodlust, and this is the closest we can get, just the same way as someone may watch a porno when they are unable to actually have sex. Even if you don't appreciate the psychology, there is plenty of gore and tension to make the movie a scary ride. Basically, Hostel is what Saw wanted to be. It is a believable nightmare, and that is something truly rare in today's horror films.84%",8,13,21,19 August 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Considerably better than expected, The Last Stand is now forgiven
","Despite all the negative feedback, Wolverine really is a worthy entry in the X-Men series. Sure, Deadpool is wasted (except as a setup for a sequel), the effects are shoddy even after completion (a particularly laughable bathroom scene is of note). And finally, yes, the story is predictable and not particularly involving.It makes up for this with exciting action sequences and Hugh Jackman. Jackman truly has made the role his, and much badass-ery ensues in the film. Also, since I have been asked this by pretty much every girl who knows I saw this, yes, Jackman is topless for approximately half the running time.Its definitely not the calibre of the first two movies, which really ushered in comic book movies after a bit of a dry spell and in my opinion have only been matched by the first Spiderman, Iron Man and the new Batman films. That bad taste from X3 is definitely wiped away though, and I'll gladly pay for the next entry without too many qualms.",6,2,5,2 June 2009
Constantine," For Something This Early In The Year, Constantine Is Probably Worth Your Time
","Another dark comic book movie? After the mediocre Daredevil and the terrible Hellboy, I wasn't sure about this. However, this had the whole fire-and-brimstone thing going for it, and I am always a sucker for that. However, due to the poor luck of this genre, I had mediocre expectations. Was Constantine a mediocre movie? Plot: 16/20: John Constantine (Reeves) has seen hellliterally. He died after committing suicide and was brought back. He sees demons and angels, and whenever a demon breaks the balance by using more than influence against humans, he deports them back to hell. Apparently, God and Lucifer made a wager to see who could take in more souls, heaven or hell. They are not allowed to force anyone, just influence, and only half-breeds of angels or demons, who, to the untrained eye, are the same as normal people, are allowed to walk amongst humans. During an exorcism, Constantine finds a demon attempting to escape, which worries him that hell may be attempting some mischief. Around the same time, Constantine also finds out his chain-smoking has given him lung cancer and he is dying.Meanwhile, Detective Angela Dodson (Weisz) is investigating her twin sister's apparent suicide, though she doesn't believe her sister, a devout Catholic and someone who claimed to be able to spot demons, would have committed suicide. Of course, the two stories intertwine, as Angela receives a vision telling her to find Constantine, who decides to help her, as they unravel a demonic conspiracy. Also, in Mexico, a scavenger has found the Spear of Destiny, has been granted superpowers and is on his way to the States.Well, it gets a little more in depth than that, but that kinda sums up the beginning. I guess the plot isn't great, and there are some loose ends and holes, but it holds up pretty well and is filled with that religious irony we all expected. It throws a few twists, and the visit at the end is great, but the plot becomes somewhat convoluted and twisted near the end, and is overall predictable. It brings more good than bad, however.Action: 13/20: Constantine, much like Hellboy, isn't all about the action. Unlike Hellboy, when we do get some action, it is a real treat. The scene near the end involving Constantine barrelling through a room of demons, which many have dismissed as silly, I found to actually have payoff and be a visual treat. The lack of action is apparent, and some scenes seem as if their sole purpose is to fill the void, ending up feeling a little forced. One particular scene involving a beetle demon just seems there to kill time. When you look at it after it's all done, it really doesn't have enough, but what we are given is pretty good.Special Effects: 19/20: The effects here are great. The half-breed demons look appropriately goopy, while the full demons are decomposed and burnt, really looking like they've been through hell. The angels aren't really too distinguished aside from the wings, which look believable enough. The only time the effects fail is one scene involving Balthazar (Rossdale), which seems too CGI for it's own good. Overall, great effects.Acting: 9/20: Surprisingly, Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) is pretty good here. Sure, he's still stoned out of his mind, but it fits the role. Most of the rest of the cast overacts, especially Weisz (The Mummy). LeBeouf (Holes) has almost exactly the same role he had in I, Robot as the young sidekick who doesn't get any respect from his superior, which seems to be his niche these days. Like I, Robot as well, LeBeouf's character gets little screen time (granted, he gets some). Finally, Peter Stormare (Armageddon) has a good appearance as Lucifer. Most of the cast overacts or isn't used or explored enough, so I can't give it a good mark for acting, even if Keanu fits for once in his career.Entertainment: 17/20: In the end, Constantine is a pretty good time-killer. It probably won't get you to think much after it ends, but it does what it set out to do and proves to be a worthwhile movie to see this early in the year.Total: 74%: Not incredible, but better than Hellboy and Daredevil. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an action fix this early in the year, though I am very split on this one. It had a decent plot, great effects and, when it got to it, good action, but the action wasn't prominent enough and the acting was mediocre at best. Still, it's worth a look, though unless this really catches your eye, maybe wait for a rental.",7,3,19,21 February 2005
Troy," It May Not Be 'The Iliad', But It's Still A Good Time at the Movies
","Troy (2004) War Epic Reviewed 5/16/04 Starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Peter O'Toole, Brian GleesonPlot: 2.3/2.5: This is the story of the fall of Troy, adapted from the epic poem 'The Iliad' by Homer. Achilles (Pitt) is the greatest soldier Greece has ever seen, and has one them many battles. Greece has finally made peace with Troy, much to the chagrin of Agamemnon (Cox), war pig and brother of Greece's king Menelaus (Gleeson). Unfortunately for peace, Menelaus' wife Helen (Kruger) has been having an affair Prince Paris of Troy (Bloom). When it is time for the Trojans to leave, Helen goes with Paris, and a war starts over love. The Greeks, led by Achilles, and the Trojans, led by Prince Hector (Bana) are now faced with one of the most memorable tales in Greece's history. The only reason I didn't give full points is because it apparently takes a few too many liberties. I have never read 'The Iliad', but apparently the war is supposed to last ten years, not three weeks. Achilles was also supposed to love his best friend Patrolocus, who is turned into his cousin in the movie, and Achilles falls for Trojan Breseis. These inaccuracies don't bother me since I never read 'The Iliad', but I couldn't bring myself to give full points.Action: 2.5/2.5: The action is great. While the war scenes aren't on par with Braveheart, many of the fights are brilliant. The fight between Hector and Achilles is one of the best I have ever seen. Very entertaining.Acting: 2.5/2.5: This is the category that may trouble some. While I never thought Bloom was great (he was terrible in Pirates of the Caribbean), his normal crappy approach works for the cowardly but determined Paris. Pitt is a pretty boy, and doesn't work wonders for me, but gets the job done as Achilles. Bean is a good Odysseus and Kruger is a decent Helen. I would have given a 2/2.5 for these alone, but Bana, Cox and O'Toole do such a great job, it is worth more than full marks. Bana did so good it almost made me feel bad he had anything to do with HULK (he should feel bad too). Cox has always struck me as great, and this proves it. O'Toole is a great Priam, and manages to keep his accent very much in check. I want to see all three get award noms for this.Entertainment: 2.5/2.5: If you can sit through a 2 hour 45 minute movie, this is for you, no matter what.Bonus -.2 for Pitt's almost nudity: Self explanatory.Total: 96%: Now this is a movie. It is without a doubt the best of the year so far and it has a chance of doing well at the Oscars (but what do I know). While it is not as good as Braveheart, it is a great movie that anyone with any attention span should see.Also See: Gladiator, Braveheart",8,5,10,17 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," So much more than a gay cowboy movie
","I'll admit, the first time I heard about a gay cowboy movie with huge Oscar buzz, my mind went immediately to that episode of South Park about the independent films with gay cowboys eating pudding. Of course, my second thought was whether or not it would actually be more than just that: a gay cowboy movie. While, I will admit, I was a little scared to go an see this, just because, like any teenage guy, there is a hidden layer of homophobia we often let get the best of us, since I had the opportunity to see this before the Oscars (making it one of two Best Picture noms seen so far, along with Crash), I wasn't going to pass it up. Thankfully, I didn't, as while Brokeback is certainly flawed, it is a moving romance, in spite of the subject matter.The story of Brokeback Mountain is fairly simple at first, but escalates later, meaning that it is hard to tell enough without spoiling it. At the start, Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Quaid) as ranch hands to take care of getting some sheep across the mountains. This means that the two of them are alone with no company besides each other. One night, after some drinking, the two of them end up sharing the same tent.Well, you can probably guess what happens next. Suffice to say that the two of them had a little more than a hangover the next morning. Instead of trying to put it in the past, Jack and Ennis actually fall in love and continue their relationship until the job is done. They both go their separate ways, get married and have kids. When, four years later, Jack contacts Ennis, they have an affair that puts their normal lives in turmoil.It's when they start the affair that the movie kicks into gear and becomes interesting. This would be about forty five minutes to one hour into the movie. Not say the first half is boring, but it definitely pales in comparison. Before it reaches that point, there seem to be a lot of pointless scenes that really have no significance whatsoever. It could have used a little more editing, to say the least.It is also worth noting that, for the sake of any straight males like myself in the audience, the homosexuality in the movie is actually not all that unnerving. The director played it smart by giving us the most graphic scenes early in the movie, so that the two of them making out later on really isn't that uncomfortable by comparison. In other words, don't be afraid of this movie just because of the content, as if you stick with it, that all becomes a footnote.The main problem about the movie is that it becomes apparent that Ang Lee has no idea how to build up to a romance. I get that they were inebriated, but the first time that Jack and Ennis get intimate, it just seems completely out of nowhere as they had barely bonded whatsoever before then. Not to mention the fact that Ennis was engaged at the time. It seems that they go from just barely past strangers to in love within one night. The same problem does exist, although to a much lesser extent, with Jack and his wife Lureen (Hathaway), though it can be disregarded as the whole sequence of events that encompass that go by fairly quickly.Even if the opening may be awkward, we definitely feel the passion between Jack and Ennis once it has been established, which is a sure sign of the excellent acting. You can really feel the passion they have for each other, despite the conditions under which that passion occurs. Neither of them were expecting it, nor wanting it, to happen, but it becomes an obsession that they both deal with in different ways. Gyllenhaal's Jack is filled with delusions that they should run away with each other and leave their life behind. For his part, Gyllenhaal is absolutely perfect, though it is Ledger who gets the more complex role. Jack Twist is very outgoing and impulsive, and Gyllenhaal shows the depths he sinks to as well as the child inside. Ennis Del Mar, on the other hand, is much more conservative, but his body language says it all, and Ledger perfects that. Both are incredible leading performances.It would be wrong to praise the leads so openly and ignore the supporting cast, as one in particular stands out. That one would be Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife, who watches her marriage fall apart after Jack re-enters Ennis' life. There isn't much to say about her without spoiling parts of the movie, but suffice to say that her performance is definitely award worthy. Anne Hathaway, who plays Jack's wife, does not get as many powerful scenes, but she does quite well considering she was the Princess Diaries star not too long ago. The whole cast overall is quite exceptional, with two incredible leading performances backed up by two strong supporters.Brokeback Mountain isn't just a movie about gay sex. It is about a passion that two individuals have for each other but have to keep covered up for fear of ruining their imperfect lives. After a while, you even forget it is about gay sex at all. That is the true mark of great movie making, especially when dealing with a topic so controversial. This movie definitely has its flaws, but it is one of the best romance movies I have ever seen. It took risks, and they paid off to make one of the best movies of the year.Overall Rating Â– 89%As a footnote, Crash is still my favourite for Best Picture, though I'd have no bad feelings is this took gold.",8,11,14,9 February 2006
Terminator Salvation," Satisfying enough entry into the canon
","Starts off horribly, with ham-fisted references to the older, better entries in the series (nothing ever comes across less natural than 'What day is it? WHAT YEAR!?'). Eventually, however, becomes a solid thriller worthy to stand along T3 at least, then ends in another bit of a trainwreck.Overall, there's more good than bad. The more subtle references (GnR, the shotgun strap, even the necessary 'I'll be back') work wonderfully even if the obvious ones are cringe-worthy. The action can be very good at times. New character Marcus is actually very interesting, if only they didn't spoil his arc in the trailers. Bale is a good choice as Connor, truly coming into the role in the second hour. Even Yelchin as young Kyle Reese evolves over the movie to become reminiscent of Michael Biehn. Plus it has possibly the best quasi-cameo of all time, which even with prior knowledge still knocked me off my feet.Ergo, T4 gets a cautious recommendation, but it shouldn't upset fans too horribly much. It could've been done much better, but its still good popcorn fun.",7,3,6,2 June 2009
500 Days of Summer," Do not fear the chick flick, 500 Days of Summer is amazing and very thoughtful
","'This is a story of boy meets girl, but this is not a love story' the narrator warns at the opening of 500 Days of Summer. 'I'm not looking for anything serious' Zooey Deschanel's Summer warns Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tom at the beginning of their relationship. Both the audience and Tom absorb this, but at the same time ignore it, and the revelation of its truth takes both the audience and the main character for one hell of a turn. Far from the chick flick it may seem to be, 500 Days of Summer is an incredible insight into male infatuation and perception that promises to be the indie hit of the year (think this years Juno).The style of the movie is quite original, especially for those expecting a standard romance fare, so just go see the movie and don't read the reviews if at all possible.500 Days begins around day 300, where Summer breaks up with Tom. This leaves 200 days for this to turn around though, right? We then revert right back to day 1, and continue to jump around in time over the 500 days span, from their first meeting in an elevator listening to the Smiths to their conflicting visits to IKEA and such.It reminds me in a sense of the brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which by the way I cannot recommend enough. The perception of Tom is what we see, and while it seems that many instances are romance clichés, when it is (through choreographed dance) made clear that the movie is through Tom's eyes and not a third party, we start to look below the surface of what is being shown. Failed relationships are not remembered as they actually happened, and the movie plays with this to a considerable extent.The leads make this journey incredibly believable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, through movies like Brick and The Lookout, has become one of my favourite actors out there right now (3rd Rock was a looooong time ago). He should be immediately identifiable for most guys, and decently lovable for most girls. His performance is nothing short of exceptional for the genre. Deschanel is also spot-on perfect as the girl who knows what she likes but has no idea what she wants.I must give a brief praise for the soundtrack. The karaoke scenes make amazing use of The Pixies and The Clash (points for the most proper use of Train in Vain ever), and the inclusion of Wolfmother near the end is, for lack of a better word, awesome (yeah, thats right, Wolfmother in a 'romance').Do not fear the chick flick, 500 Days of Summer is amazing and very thoughtful. I fear somewhat that people expecting a chick flick will view it as a downer and guys won't see it because it wears the clothing of romance, 500 Days is the best movie of its kind I've seen since Eternal Sunshine, and by all means is a must-see.",9,1,3,13 August 2009
Ocean's Twelve," Ocean's Twelve, Overall, Is OK, But Not As Slick as the Original *some spoilers*
","12 is the new 11. What kind of tagline is that? While this movie may have one of the worst taglines ever, it was a sequel to a fun little heist flick called Ocean's 11. While it could have been done a little bit better, Ocean's 11 was a very fun caper movie with a great cast. Ocean's 12 got an even bigger cast, but I did have some skepticism as to the plot. Regardless, it had been three weeks since I had seen a movie in the theatre (as neither Alexander nor Closer was playing and nothing good was out the first week). So is 12 the new 11?Plot: .8/2: Terry Benedict (Garcia) is angry. Since mastermind Danny Ocean (Clooney), problem solver Rusty Ryan (Pitt), rookie Linus Caldwell (Damon), explosives expert Basher Tarr (Chealde), brothers Virgil (Affleck) and Turk Malloy (Caan), millionaire Reuben Tishkoff (Gould), computer nerd Livingston Dell (Jemison), inside man Frank Catton (Mac), grease man Yen (Qin) and old pro Saul Bloom (Reiner) robbed his three casinos out of $160 million in one night, he has been looking for an opportunity to get back, regardless of the fact that he got paid back from insurance. When rival French thief the Nightfox (Cassel), who wants to prove he is a better thief than the 11, gives him their locations, he pays each of them a visit and tells them they have two weeks to pay him back with interest. Tishkoff is the only one who can afford to pay back his share, so they decide to go to Amsterdam to find an opportunity to make some cash quick. Unfortunately, Saul bows out. They meet with Matsui (Coltrane), who gives them a job worth 2.5 million euro and chances to make more if they succeed. Unfortunately, the Nightfox beats them to the punch and Europol gets involved, with the case led by Rusty's former squeeze Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones). Frank, who left a boot print, is quickly arrested and Matsui tells Isabel that Rusty and Ocean are involved. Ocean meets with Nightfox, who tells him that if he can get an Italian Fabergé egg before the Nightfox does, he'll pay off Benedict for him. For all necessary purposes, the plot works well, but there are problems. Much of the plot is easily predictable, aside from a few key points. Most of the 11 get painfully little to do, especially Frank who gets taken out of the movie barely a quarter into it. Linus is the only one who does more than he did in the original. Tess Ocean (Roberts) is left out for a while, but her part in the plot twist near the end is both good for the plot and the comedy. The Nightfox rivalry seems to be right out of Heist Movie 101. There is also a bit about Isabel's father that anyone with half a brain can successfully predict right off the bat. The plot is OK for a sequel, but by making half the cast seem to be there for the sake of being there, it loses some credit.Comedy: 1.2/2: Ocean's Twelve is mediocre as a comedy. It has it's share of good moments, such as the opening sequence, Topher Grace's cameo and Tess' disguise, and really doesn't have any bad jokes, but it fails to use opportunities often. For example, Bernie Mac is a wasted opportunity. He is a great stand-up comic, but they never use him for anything funny. On the other hand, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan are still funny. It does have some good moments and thankfully doesn't do anything here badly, it just doesn't try often enough here.Heist: 1.8/2: The actual thefts are great. The only complaint is that not everyone was used. While they may have had another purpose somewhere, Cheadle, Mac, Jemison, Reiner, Gould and Qin are not used to do their areas of expertise in any of the actual thefts. That's 6/11 that don't get to do their job. A little high, huh? Still, the thefts are interesting if not enthralling.Acting: 1.9/2: While having an all-star cast does reduce the believability, it does increase the fun. Damon (The Bourne Identity) is the only one that shines here, playing the wide-eyed rookie Linus. Pitt (Se7en) is still as slick as he was in the original, and Affleck (Chasing Amy) and Caan (Sonny) are good, even though they get few scenes to shine in. Clooney (Solaris) is not nearly as witty as in the first, but he is still the best choice possible for Danny Ocean. Garcia (Godfather III) is menacing in his first few scenes, but disappears through the rest of the movie. Cheadle (Swordfish) still has the funny voice. Zeta-Jones (The Mask of Zorro) is good, but nothing spectacular. Bruce Willis has a hilarious cameo as himself. The cast isn't here to make you believe the characters, but it does add to the fun factor greatly.Entertainment: 2/2: Ocean's Twelve is the kind of movie anyone can enjoy. It's audience encompasses just about everyone. While it won't gain quite as much acclaim as 11, it still is a fun caper flick.Total: 77%: Ocean's Twelve is overall a good movie, but falls short of being as cool or fun as the original. It owes it's credibility thanks to a great cast and a couple smart heists. While I won't say to go see it in theatres unless you really liked the first, this is definitely worth a rental.",7,1,2,2 February 2005
Capote," Hoffman's Incredible Performance Carries Capote
","It seems that biopics are the new fad for the Oscars. Last year, four of the five nominees were biopics. This year, only two managed to make the cut. Good Night and Good Luck was a solid history lesson, so it set the tone that I expected from the other option, Capote. Seeing as, prior to this movie, I was unaware a man named Truman Capote even existed (and even less aware that Capote was pronounced 'ka-po-tee' and note 'ka-pote'), I was seeing this as a film, not for education or because I happened to love the book or anything like that. Even from that perspective, Capote is one hell of a powerful film in its final act.For those who are as unfamiliar with the subject matter as I am, a little background is required. Truman Capote (Hoffman) is a best-selling author best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's. He is now writing articles for newspapers, currently researching a quadruple homicide in Kansas. With the help of childhood friend Harper Lee (Keener), he goes to the town and acquaints himself with police chief Alvin Dewey (Cooper) to find out everything he can. After consideration, he decides to make a new novel instead of simply an article as the killing fascinates him.Once the killers are caught, Capote manages to secure interviews with them. He becomes intrigued by Perry Smith (Collins), an articulate and artistic soul who committed this apparently motiveless crime. In order to squeeze the whole story out of him, Capote buys himself more time by buying better lawyers for the killers. This leaves Capote with an internal struggle. He becomes attached to Smith, yet cannot complete his novel until the two are executed.It is in this problem that the true villainy of Capote is shown. He is willing to see this man whom he has come to love on a deep level be executed for the simple purpose of finishing his work. Sure, he lies to himself constantly, but he is always putting himself first and essentially destroys himself with his egotistical obsession.Had the movie been fictionalized, the role of Capote would have been difficult enough. However, since Capote was a very famous figure, the role would seem to be downright impossible to pull off. Lo and behold, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely stunning. From a dramatic perspective, he is incredible at showing the intense emotions that Capote feels in the end. After viewing a brief featurette, it is also obvious that he absolutely perfects the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Capote. He isn't Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he is truly Truman Capote, and it is one of the best performances I have ever witnessed.Also worth mentioning in an outstanding supporting performance is Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith. He is simultaneously chilling and sympathetic as the killer who had potential for much better. The scene where he finally describes the murders to Capote is among the most powerful I have seen recently, mostly thanks to Collins' unemotional narration. It is a shame that he was snubbed for a nomination that was given to William Hurt, who may have been great, but was not nearly as memorable. While on that topic, it is also a shame that Catherine Keener was nominated. While she was good, she was not given enough material to be nomination-worthy, and that nomination should have gone to Thandie Newton for Crash.The main problem with the movie is that, for the first half anyways, it is quite dull. Sure, Hoffman is still great, but the movie just can't hold interest while Capote investigates the town. It does become more interesting once the killers are caught and Capote starts involving himself with Perry Smith, but it doesn't really kick into gear until Capote starts becoming anxious for the execution. This is more of a payoff movie, as it never really sinks in how good it is until the end.As stated above, the payoff for the movie is near downright incredible. The last forty minutes of the movie are incredibly powerful and make this one an easy recommendation for those who can appreciate dramas. Extremely strong performances from Collins and especially Hoffman definitely make the movie much more than simply another biopic. Capote is not quite a must see like Brokeback Mountain or Crash, but it is certainly one that you shouldn't walk away from disappointed.Overall Rating - 86%",8,1,1,6 May 2006
The Village," Don't Avoid the Village Because You Think It Might Scare You. Avoid Because it Sucks.
","The Sixth Sense was good. Unbreakable was OK. Signs was OK. The Village, well, it looked bad. I'm sorry, but Shymalamadingdong was not making a great impression with this one. I did want to see it, if just to say I saw it. So is the Village worth anything at all? Plot: 5/25: Basically, we have a village (shocking, huh). It is apparently the 1800s or so. This village is residence to a very small number of people. There is a group of elders, who have meetings only they are privy to. Oh, and the forests around the village are off-limits because they are surrounded by monsters, called 'Those We Do Not Speak Of', which is an oxymoron in itself (apparently, Shyamalamadingdong was too lazy to name them). Anyway, the villagers and the creatures made a truce. The villagers stay out of the forest, the creatures stay out of the village. This means that the villagers are isolated from the outside world. So when a child dies due to illness, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks to go to the town across the forest to retrieve medicine for future purposes. He, of course, gets a no, but curiosity gets the best of him and he takes a few steps past the boundary before getting scared off by a noise. That night, the creatures visit and leave warnings. Stay out.There is also a love plot that involves Lucius and the blind Ivy Walker (Howard), daughter of the leader of the elders Edward Walker (Hurt). Lucius has a love for Ivy, and they get engaged once he saves her from the creatures. But this gets Ivy's friend Noah Percy (Brody) jealous, and Noah is, well, retarded.Of course, there is the Shyamalanic twist, but unlike that in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, this one is painfully obvious. There are actually two, one I knew right away and another that is just fill in the blanks work after all the holes you poke through it earlier. The twists are disappointing, to say the least. The actual plot is actually pretty dumb once you sit through it once. It is fairly original, I'll give it that, but nothing more.Horror: 6/25: To say this movie provided no thrills isn't true. It provides a couple. Mostly cheap ones at that. Shyamalan is a master at the type of camera tricks that make something scary, and this is no exception. It just never seems really horrifying. It's not a scary concept, but some cheap camera tricks make it a little scarier than it should be. Without Shyamalan behind the camera, this wouldn't be scary, it'd just be dumb.Acting: 8/25: The acting here is much like other movies when I say they took some good talent and ruined it with one of the worst scripts I have ever seen. Everyone talks like they're in the company of the Queen of England, so we get long, drawn out sentence and words that haven't been casually used since Shakespeare was shat out of his mother's womb. This pretty much ruins Phoenix and Weaver here. They are both good actors, but the script hurts them. Adrien Brody, despite an Oscar under his belt, is not right for this role. William Hurt gets his share of crappy lines, but he makes the best of it and isn't half bad. Bryce Dallas Howard, despite this being her first real role, is the only one here who is impressive in the least. If this is what she can do with a bad script Entertainment: 0/25: This is one of those movies that feels like it never ends despite being only a bit over 1 ½ hours. The whole dialogue problem really makes this much worse than it should have been. I really couldn't wait for this to be over.Total: 19%: Shyamalamadingdong made a poopie. That's basically the best way to put it. The Village is boring, stupid movie that really is guaranteed to disappoint anyone who even remotely liked the other three. Enough said.",2,1,4,3 February 2005
District 9," Original and exciting, avoid if have fear of shrimp
","It happens all too often where aliens invade the Earth violently, with vastly superior technology and intents to harvest, destroy or both. There's very few that humanize these invaders in a non-cliché way. And here's one that humanizes the aliens as blue-collar workers entering our xenophobic lifestyle. By paralleling human discrimination, District 9 is actually one of the best sci-fi movies to come out in a long time.The plot of District 9 purposely mirrors the Apartheid rule of South Africa. A bunch of aliens crash in Johannesburg, discovered to be blue-collar workers and moved out of their mothership in what initially seems to be a humanitarian move. The settlement they are given, however, quickly becomes a slum known as district 9. A private interest group known as MNU oversees district 9, but appears to have other interests, namely in the advanced weaponary aboard the ship. Nigerian gangsters take advantage of the 'prawns', trading cat food (which the aliens love) for weapons, although they are unable to use them. Their solution is to, of course, eat the prawns to gain their power.Due to the conditions of district 9 (ie being so close to the regular people), MNU decides to move the aliens to district 10, further out of the city. The task is left to Wikus van der Merwe (Copley), a mild-mannered office worker who just happens to be connected through his father-in-law. While serving notices, he finds a suspicious canister in the house of the alien 'Christopher Johnson', and is sprayed by it.What happens next really shouldn't be spoiled, but suffice to say things don't go well for Wikus after this. The exact effect of the spray is almost laughable at first (a fine case of applied phlebotnium, a magical substance that does whatever the plot requires it to do), but it services the plot quite excellently. But really, alien fluid? C'mon.Wikus himself is a truly excellent character. While never as nasty or fully aware as his superiors, he is far from completely sympathetic. He threatens poor Christopher in an extremely evil way involving his son. He views the aliens as a pest. He aborts a group of alien children by fire without a second thought. He is the definition of asshole protagonist. It is a tribute to Copley's excellent performance that we are completely aware of this yet still sympathize with him at the end.The true hero of the story is Christopher Johnson, the prawn with the plan. His reaction to discovering the experimentation of MNU is one of justified rage, but usually he is logical and mild-mannered. The same cannot be said of the other prawns. They earn they're reputation often, although not usually unprovoked. I'm glad the aliens weren't glorified as 'pure beings', but perhaps they could've standed to have more than two sympathetic characters. Christopher's son CJ is also a little too Hollywood-cute for a shrimp-looking alien.There are three distinct acts to the movie. The introduction, which has a very well done mockumentary feel to it. The change to traditional narrative by the second act is impressively subtle. The conspiracy of the second act lets way to traditional sci-fi blow-stuff-up by the third act. Its a little intellectually disappointing that this route was chosen, but at the same time, I'll be damned if it isn't awesome on so many levels. Let's just say more heads explode than in any more ever before, and a man is killed by a flying pig carcass. And all on a relatively small budget. Bravo indeed. Unfortunately, the trailer steals away a lot of the suspense from these sequences.Now for some random thoughts too small for their own paragraph: The bad guys are maybe a little too two-dimensional, showing no real moral dilemma. This is acceptable for badass Colonel Koobus, one of the slimiest sci-fi bad guys ever, but a little more humanity would have been nice. The soldiers also suffer from the stormtrooper effect to a ridiculous degree, getting wasted like candy. The alien weaponary seemed far too advanced for a ship of worker bees, and I feel it should have been more comparable in power to human weaponary. But it was still really cool.Even though it loses some respect in the last act, that last act IS ridiculously cool. The extremely original and refreshingly low-budget feel of the entire movie warrants a must-see status among sci-fi lovers, and film lovers in general. More exciting than most blockbusters out there right now and more thought-provoking than most dramas, District 9 is highly recommended.",9,0,1,14 January 2010
Meet the Fockers," The Most Gut-Bustingly Funny Movie of 2004! *Very Slight Spoilers*
","Meet the Fockers (2004)Comedy Released 12/27/04 Reviewed 1/2/05 Starring Ben Stiller, Robert deNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo, Alanna Ubach, Ray Santiago, Owen Wilson, Tim Blake Nelson, Spencer & Bradley Pickren Written by John Hamburg & James Herzfeld Directed by Jay Roach Rated PG-13/14A for Crude & Sexual Humour, Language, Partial Nudity & A Drug ReferenceIt's safe to say my expectation for Meet the Fockers were low at best. I still wanted to see it, but I couldn't expect much of it. Meet the Parents was very good, so I would give this one a fair chance. Nothing better to do to end the holidays. So is the focking sequel in the circle of trust?Plot: 1.9/2.5: Gaylord (he prefers Greg) Focker (Stiller) and Pamela Byrnes (Polo) are almost ready to get married. There is just one thing left to do before they make everything final. Pam's parents, Jack (deNiro) and Dina (Danner) have to meet Greg's parents, Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand). As we know from the first, Jack Byrnes is an uptight ex-CIA agent. So when he meets the Fockers, as you can guess, he is completely out of place with their eccentricity. This seems like a very paint by numbers type movie, and as much of that as it is, it has an impeccable way of placing all these characters into situations suited to make Jack and Greg as uncomfortable as humanly possible, whether it be trying to hide Pam's recently found out pregnancy, a bastard child or Jack's grandson's first word (the grandson being Debbie's son, who does not appear in this movie). The plot isn't too important, and while it is paint-by-numbers, who cares?Comedy: 2.5/2.5: Meet the Fockers is simply hilarious. There is no other way to put it. It has been so long since a truly funny movie like Airplane or even Scary Movie has come along, I have begun to forget what a comedy is supposed to be. This is what I call a comedy. This is just one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is a little off-the-wall. When one character can say 'And one more thing about my vasectomy' and it sounds normal, you know that this is pretty off-the-wall. It isn't quite the same type of comedy as the original. This one is much funnier than the first. This is gold.Acting: 2.5/2.5: OK, this isn't a movie to showcase the acting from. However, the actors are incredible here. DeNiro (Analyze This) is playing it straight like never before. He is having fun, but he tries enough to be like his old Goodfellas-esquire roles to separate from the rest of the cast. Hoffman (Rain Man) and Streisand (A Star Is Born) are having lots of fun, and it shows as these two carry this movie from the first time we see them. These are two Oscar winning actors having the time of their lives, and it works great. Stiller (Zoolander) may only be good in small doses, but that's what we get here. He's everywhere, but the Ben Stiller in him only comes out a couple times, so it's funny but not overused or tiring. Polo (Beyond Borders), while still mainly in the background, does have a few more lines and works well. Danner (The X Files) is much more in this one, up from a practically nothing role in the original, and while she still isn't too prominent, a few good bits go her way. The actors are not in an award-type movie, but they do exactly the best we could want.Entertainment: 2.4/2.5: There is some complaining about this movie because the Fockers are too unbelievable. If they were believable, we'd have a bad movie. Some complaints about the reused jokes. They are reused because they're funny. They aren't often though. There are some Focker jokes, but they're only here and there. Sure, it is somewhat crude and offensive in areas, but nowhere near as crude and offensive as most funny comedies out there. It's usually the crudeness that produces comedy, so if that's the price, I'll pay it. Meet the Fockers is entertaining for anyone.Total: 93%: I can't believe my focking ears, but Meet the Fockers is even better than the original and easily one of, if not the, funniest movie of the year. Despite some critics bashing it, you should see Meet the Fockers as soon as possible. Sneaking in right at the end is one of the best of the year.",8,0,1,1 February 2005
Cars," It's not Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but Cars is good family fun
","When it comes to animated movies, there is only one name that matters: Pixar. Pixar popularized the CGI method with Toy Story, which remains my favourite animated movie of all time. They have since consistently made smash hit after smash hit. Even if I don't think that Monsters Inc. or The Incredibles even compare to Toy Story, there is no denying that Pixar always manages to keep its own brand of magic in every picture they release. Despite all of that, the concept of Cars did scare me a little. It seemed a little too loose and almost unimaginative by comparison. However, with a chance to see it for free, I couldn't say no, and thankfully not, as even if it isn't quite in the same league as Finding Nemo or Toy Story, Cars is a pleasant timewaster for the whole family.Like any other good Pixar movie, Cars is a coming of age movie, this time focusing on the world of race cars. In this world, the cars manifest themselves as conscious entities, with no drivers or anything of the sort. Lightning McQueen (Wilson) is the current hot rookie in the driving world, and is going after the Piston Cup, the greatest achievement for a race car, which would lead to numerous well-paying endorsements and fame beyond belief. During the final race, his tires blow out in the final laps because of his denial of pit stops with him in a great lead. He manages to hobble his way into an exact three-way tie with retiring champ King and the scheming Chick Hicks (Keaton), who has been stuck in the King's shadow for his whole career.On the way to the tie-breaker race, McQueen falls out of his transport truck and, while being chased by the police for speeding, ends up destroying the road in the small town of Radiator Springs. Despite the advice of town leader Doc Hicks (Newman), who despises anything related to racing, McQueen is forced to stay in Radiator Springs to repair the road. It is in Radiator Springs that McQueen realizes that there is more to life than simply fame and fortune.Of course the movie is contrived and clichéd. There is a love interest in the form of Sally (Hunt), possibly the only other normal car in the area (by McQueen's standards, anyways). He also finds a new best friend in Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). Everything else fits into the general mold that movies like this come in. The protagonist is a snob on the way to an important event, gets sidetracked unintentionally, wishes to leave at first, begins to identify with his new surroundings, finds some tie to his old life in the new town, is whisked away by others and doesn't want to leave. Sounds familiar, but for a kids movie, little things like originality in the plot are not mandatory.What are important are good visuals, and Cars definitely has that. The environments are all nice and bright with extensive backdrops in the racing district, and appropriately drab in Radiator Springs. The car designs are good mimicks of real life, while at the same time giving a good amount of character depth in expressions. Of course, there is nothing dark in a movie for kids, so there are plenty of bright colours and cute characters (most notably Guido the technician). While it doesn't push the envelope for animation, it certainly doesn't fall short in any way, shape or form.As for laughs, Cars does have a handful of funny bits. The most notable laughs come from Guido, who is easily the most memorable character in the movie, especially near the end when he performs his five-second pit stop or with any dialogue between him and Ferrari lover Luigi (Tony Shaloub). Mater also gets some good laughs in, representing the traditional redneck comedy you would expect from Larry the Cable Guy. One sequence in which Mater and McQueen go tractor-tipping proves to be very amusing. Throw in a good line every now and then (FREE BIRD), and Cars does have its fair share of laughs, though there are numerous laughless stretches and some jokes that are never fully explored (such as Fillmore the hippy van's organic fuel).As for the voice cast, despite the great range of talents, they are somewhat unmemorable. Wilson does decent as the protagonist, Lightning McQueen, but isn't as unique as Tom Hanks was as Woody or Albert Brooks was as Marlin. Paul Newman is appropriately authoritative as Doc Hicks, but never rises above the character. Bonnie Hunt is, like Wilson, decent but forgettable as Sally. Larry the Cable Guy does embody the hick-town in his voice, and Tony Shalhoub gives the most memorable performance by far as Luigi the Italian tire salesman. Michael Keaton never really gets a chance to shine as Chick Hicks, so he really isn't to fault that Hicks is not a memorable villain. Despite their comic fame, Cheech Marin and George Carlin are almost unrecognizable due to lack of dialogue. There are some good voice cameos from the likes of Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and Dale Earnheardt Jr.Cars isn't even close to being Pixar's gem. It isn't nearly as funny as Toy Story or as compelling as Finding Nemo. Even so, it falls into the general range that would include other animated films like Ice Age, with a solid number of laughs, a few chuckles and a good cute factor. Cars may not be the best, but it is a solid choice for family entertainment.82%",7,1,2,19 July 2006
Hero," Great Cinematography but Nothing Else makes Hero Extremely Overrated *Slight Spoilers*
","I could tell this was going to be weird. It's another crazy, flying, slashing, kicking, Chinese Matrix-wannabe. I knew that Quentin Tarantino, one of my favourite directors, put his name on this to keep it from being edited and nothing more. That's right. Tarantino has absolutely nothing to do with this. It was kinda his Kill Bill's fault I was inclined to see this. Kill Bill was great, and I would love to see another scene compare to the Crazy 88 sequence. I needed a fix of crazy Chinese flick. This one did have extremely high ratings and it was now on video. So is Hero really as good as they say it is?Plot: .4/2.5: OK, we have this guy namedNameless (Li). He has slain three great assassins who were bent on killing the King of Qin (Chen). This takes place back when China consisted of the six warring nations, with the battle between Qin and Zhao being what we care about here. OK, so these assassins were bent on killing the King and Nameless killed them. Nameless is going to have a customary drink with the King for having killed the assassins. Nameless tells the tale on how he discovered how to play the assassins against each other. He knew that two of them, Broken Sword (Leung) and Flying Snow (Cheung) were lovers, but he finds out that they have since split up as Snow had an affair with the third, Sky (Yen). To put everything in place, Nameless killed Sky first, which brought Broken Sword (or as I call him, BS) and Snow back at each other's throats. After some bickering, Snow killed BS. Then Nameless challenges Snow and kills her as she is weakened by her emotions. The King nods, and then says he thinks Nameless is full of lies and tells him what he thinks really happened. We get to hear the story from Nameless, the King and finally the truth. It's a nice little story, but in the end, it's just a crappy fairy tale for the most part. The story is very run of the mill, even if the whole perspectives thing may be interesting for a while, it eventually gets boring to see the same thing over and over and over again with the only difference being a slight costume change. The actual story is a bedtime tale. This one drags like that dog from National Lampoon's Vacation.Action: 0/2.5: OK, I may have loved the Crazy 88 in Kill Bill. I loved it dearly. It obeyed the laws of gravity, something this movie does not attempt to do. The action is more some kind of ballet than real action. The beauty of the surroundings is flaunted too many times and leaves the action in the backseat. The whole flying thing takes any tension that was possible and throws it down the drain. It's tough to get into an action scene that is supposed to be artistic.Here's a case in point. In one scene between Ziyi and Cheung, they fight in a forest in autumn. Now, the whole flying leaves thing is beautiful for a while, but it's hard to get into the action if you can't freaking see it.Then there's a scene involving jumping on water that's not only unbelievable to a fault, but repetitive.Also, let's not forget seeing BS and Snow laying the smackdown on an entire army who apparently falls down before it's their turn and have shields that couldn't defend against a paper airplane.Don't even get me started on that whole arrow repelling thing. You know, just because it's Chinese and crazy doesn't mean that it has an excuse to be crappy. An artsy sword flick can be just as much of a stupid action flick as Walking Tall.Acting: .3/2.5: Everyone in this movie is one dimensional. Basically the only person with any emotion in the whole flick is Tony Leung. While I may not be the best judge of acting in Mandarin, I can still tell when someone has the skills of cardboard.Entertainment: 0/2.5: Hero is meant for artsy people and those who are stoned. If you're stoned, you'll get a kick out of the pretty colours. That's about as far as the entertainment value goes.Bonus+.5 for the cinematography: OK, this movie has some beautiful cinematography. It doesn't matter in the long run, but it does showcase a lot of pretty colours. -.1 for this: In one flashback involving the King fighting Broken Sword, the King runs through a bunch of green things looking for him, but when he's running, he makes a weird noise that sounds like he's revving a car. It's funny, but it's stupid.Total: 11%: Just because Hero's from China doesn't mean you aren't just another stupid action flick. I guarantee if it was exactly the same, except American made and in English, no one would like it. Sure, it looks good, but that means near diddly. If I wanted art, I'd go to a museum. Hero is just a bunch of pretty colours and once you get past that, you have a shallow plot, over exaggerated action and one-dimensional acting. Curse you Tarantino for bringing this one overseas!",2,0,3,2 February 2005
The Hurt Locker," An excellent example of how to make a non-political Iraq War film
","My advice is to see the movie and not read the review if you were planning on seeing it anyways.Movies based on current events can be a strange breed. They're often preachy and always biased. However, they often get good reviews regardless, so I wasn't putting too much stock into the amazing reviews for The Hurt Locker. I remember when I saw 500 Days of Summer, I had the choice of seeing this instead. Both were only playing in the one theater in Toronto at the time, and it turns out they are both two of the best movies of the year hands down.The Hurt Locker defies expectations and, instead of being about the war, is a character study. The movie has zero poltical stance. It portrays the bombers as monsters and many other Iraqis as sympathetic. If it had been about the bombers, it would have probably found some sympathy, but this isn't their story.This is the story of Staff Seargent William James, assigned to a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, replacing their recently blown-up teammate. James is reckless, which pisses off his teammates whose lives are put in danger. This is made explicitly clear during his first job, where he holds up a speeding taxi (and bomber suspect) with a pistol.James is a static character, and while he learns over the course of the film, he doesn't change per se. The initially unsensible character simply becomes more and more clear to the audience over time. In fact, I would bet his actions early in the film would seem quite natural if seen a second time having gotten to know the character. Renner's performance is absolutely excellent and completely believable and the most realistic and complex badass to cross the screen as of late.The movie also focuses on his teammates, who do evolve over the course of the film. Veteran soldier Sanborn is the straight man of the film, and at first appears to be the main character. We sympathize with his troubles with James and his position of responsibility. The other member of the squad is Eldridge, representing those who really don't want to be in Iraq. He's not a pansy, but he panics and desperately wants to go home. Both of these characters serve as foils to James, and as such are often sidelined, but nonetheless add to the film.Aside from those three, few characters are expanded upon. Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes are excellent in small roles, the latter as perhaps the closest the movie comes to commentary, singling the issue of military contractors. Lost's Evangeline Lilly and House's David Morse also make cameos.While not an action movie, The Hurt Locker is chock full of tension. The situations that James puts himself into are pulse-pounding and the outcome never seems certain. There's a sniper battle which is excellently filmed (one odd slow-down shot aside), although some parts of it make little sense (notably the accuracy of the enemy sniper). I've also heard some complaints from people who know their stuff about realism, but these are moot to the average film viewer. This is one of the most suspenseful movies of the year hands down, and whether realistic or not, it certainly FEELS realistic.The Hurt Locker is an excellent movie that only gets better the more I think about it. A great character portrayed with a clearly Oscar-worthy performance with ridiculous amounts of tension add up to make The Hurt Locker one of the best war movies of the decade and proof that contemporary war movies can work without being political.War is a drug.",9,27,40,21 January 2010
Million Dollar Baby," MDB is a great movie, but is it Oscar worthy? Maybe. *Some Spoilers*
","Million Dollar Baby (2004) I realized after the Academy Awards were announced that I hadn't seen a single one of the Best Picture noms. Granted, Ray and The Aviator were the only ones that ever played at my theatre and I almost say both of them, but never did. When Million Dollar Baby came out in a late release here, I said 'Why the hell not.' I didn't go all January, this and Hide & Seek on the weekend would help make up for it. This was probably the one I would have liked to see the most afterall, besides maybe Sideways. Why? It has the same director as my personal choice for last year, Mystic River. Not to mention it is on a million critic's lists. So is this really the contender for the Oscar, or is it just Rocky with Swank instead of Stallone? Note that there are some mild spoilers in the Plot and Entertainment sections, but nothing I would fret about.Plot: 22/25: Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a boxing trainer who has taught many boxers how to get to the top, only to be thrown aside once they get a shot at the title. He does his work at the gym belonging to his old friend, half-blind ex-boxer Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Freeman). When trashy Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) asks for him to train her, he initially says no because he doesn't train girls. When she starts training at Eddie's gym constantly, he eventually caves and says he'll train her, but won't manage her. Skip along a little, Frankie, of course, becomes her trainer/manager. She has become an excellent fighter, knocking out most competitors in the first round. But when she gets her shot at the title, something happens that shifts the entire mood of the movie.Essentially, this is two different movies in one. The first half is the very entertaining and surprisingly funny training part, while the second half, which I will not reveal at all, is the half that is nominated for the Academy Award. There are some problems, though. The plot seems a little stretched, having many worthless scenes that don't accomplish anything but make the film 2 hours and 17 minutes. There is also a big loose end involving Frankie's daughter that is never even close to tied up. In all, the plot is good. If you don't like one half, you'll probably like the other.Boxing Action: 21/25: While there aren't any fights that quite match Rocky vs. Apollo Creed in the first Rocky, we do get treated to many more than Rocky ever gave us. Granted, most are very short, as Maggie has, like I said before, a tendency towards finishing in one round. All the fights are entertaining, often funny, so if you want a boxing movie, while this isn't really about the boxing, I still recommend it for you.Acting: 25/25: The acting for this has been getting a lot of accolades, so I had high expectations, especially since the three leads all had Oscar noms. Eastwood (Dirty Harry) and Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption) are both very good in their roles, though, to be honest, it wasn't too much of stretch for them. The roles they played were similar to others they've had. Swank (Boy's Don't Cry), on the other hand, is extremely good here, and out of the noms for Best Actress, I am rooting for her to take the gold for a second time. The rest of the cast is well suited, and as I have no complaints, I'll give it a perfect score here.Entertainment: 20/25: As I stated before, this movie changes halfway. The first half is very entertaining to just about anyone, for the most part, but the second half drags a little bit, with some scenes that seem unnecessary, as I stated in the Plot section. The whole boxing theme may throw off some more mainstream moviegoers and actually divert more serious moviegoers from seeing it.Total: 88%: Million Dollar Baby is a great movie. Is it Oscar worthy? Maybe. Is it better than Rocky? Hard to say. Is it an easy recommendation? Yes. This a movie I can recommend to anyone who likes boxing, anyone who likes dramas, and almost everyone else too. It carries on here and there, running about 20 minutes longer than it should have and carries a couple loose ends, but it ultimately leaves you thinking about it the day after.",9,0,2,2 February 2005
Clash of the Titans," Fun, but not enough Titans
","Clash of the Titans, from the title alone, made many promises. We expect to see many monsters of Ancient Greece, and we expect them to do battle, alongside humans and the Gods. We expect many many epic battles, lots and lots of CGI and appropriately over the top performances to go with them, but mostly, we want the monsters. While Clash delivers on some level for each of these promises, it surprisingly really lacks in the monsters department.It must be said as fair warning, you do not get to see Kraken VS Hydra or anything like that in Clash of the Titans. The action is centered squarely around demigod Perseus, who for our purposes is basically a man secreting badass. After Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken on the city of Argos, Perseus and a group of soldiers go in search of a way to kill the Kraken, encountering many perils along the way.The problem is its always Perseus and the soldiers who end up fighting the monsters. I'm sure I'm not the only one who expected the beasts to fight one another at some, mythology be damned (not like its particularly close to the myths anyways). Only four real combat beasts emerge anyways: the Kraken, Medusa, a mutated Acrisius and some random giant scorpions. Not even the Gods get to fight much, despite the much-hinted battle between Zeus and Hades.The Kraken in particular really should've had a battle with another beast thrown in, and its use seems like a wasted opportunity. The scorpion battle is quite exciting, though is broken up as its really four fights with different scorpions simultaneously. The Medusa sequence is easily the best of the film, as although we know from a plot perspective Perseus can't die, the fate of the group of soldiers is considerably less clear. It all makes for a very tense and rewarding sequence, somewhat hindered by the surprisingly poor CG on the Medusa character model. Shame, as the rest of the monsters are quite good looking.The cast is quite good on paper, but it doesn't work as well as expected. Worthington is a suitable lead, but I see him heading to Stallone-esquire B-movies quickly if he doesn't find more interesting characters. Liam Neeson is fairly underused, and aside from the 'Release the Kraken' line, never gets any moments. Ralph Fiennes is the biggest disappointment as Hades, spending far too much of the time whispering like a bad Sith impersonation than being actually menacing. The standout is easily Mad Mikkelson as the leader of the soldiers. While not a terribly meaty role, he has more than enough charisma to be much more interesting than Perseus himself.Clash is definitely not a waste of a matinée ticket, and I felt I got almost what I expected. But I know it could've been more, and it seemed to be purposely saving certain creatures for a sequel. Its solid fun, but hardly the must-see some might think from the trailers.",6,3,6,3 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," This isn't Alice, this is a fanfic
","First things first, Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel, not a remake. No, its not Through the Looking Glass, its an entirely new sequel with an 18-year old Alice finding her way back to Wonderland (well, Underland, but whatever). Sequel is perhaps not the best word, because really, this is a fanfic with a budget, and as such is plagued with narrative issues. Which might be OK, but its visuals are also somewhat disappointing considering the pedigree, and the 3D effect is eye-straining.Alice has grown up and assumed her childhood adventures were a figment of her dreams. Then she is distracted by a rabbit with a stopwatch after being proposed to by rich d-bag and falls back down the rabbit hole. Turns out, they need Alice to slay the Red Queen's dragon, the Jabberwock, freeing the people of Underland from her reign of terror. With the assistance of a militant Mad Hatter, a wise smoking caterpillar and a loopy White Queen.If only Alice could convince herself it wasn't just a dream all over again. Maybe some people have considerably more lucid dreams than I have, however the fact that Alice goes through a solid three-quarters of the movie before finally realizing shes not dreaming. The movie seems to try to treat it the same way, despite it being blatantly obvious Wonderland is a reality. Its enough to make any viewer despise Alice for the entire course of the film.Not that she's particularly hard to despise, since she's portrayed very flatly. She's not particularly naive or stupid or ditzy, just very flat and boring. In a movie as full of out-there characters as this, it would seem that thats the only way to play it, but it makes it very hard to care for the lead.As for the rest of the cast, they clearly try to be as out there as possible with scattershot success. The best of the bunch is clearly Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Red Queen, who eats up scenery like a buffet. Even if we hear 'off with her head' perhaps once too many times, her performance still comes close to saving the movie. Crispin Glover carries a villainous presence as the Knave of Hearts, a captivating role at first though eventually he amounts to nothing. Anne Hathaway also has some entertaining moments as the Gothic White Queen. While her makeup may not be as strange as for the other characters, her performance certainly is.The problem is too many characters crowd the film. The problem with a fanfic is that certain characters meant for only one or two segments end up with incredibly inflated roles. In the original Alice, the minor characters took over the movie, but had their segments and then got out of the way. The new film tries to keep the cast continually growing, giving these minor one-dimensional characters enough screen time to make us sick of them.The biggest instance is clearly the Mad Hatter, a character never meant for a role this big. Sure, he was memorable in the old Alice, but it was a concentrated dose. Here, he's given full lease over the movie, and gets flat out annoying. Johnny Depp does not help, as he seems on his own version of auto-pilot, not doing anything with the character we wouldn't expect of Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow. Its another eccentric role that unfortunately doesn't feel much different than his others, and one of his most underwhelming performances in general.Can't get by without mentioning the 3D effects. After seeing Final Destination use them as a crutch and Avatar use them beautifully, my feelings were that the 3D can be used for good if the effort is put into it. With Alice, it was obviously a last-minute add-in, because the effect wears on the eyes very quickly. I eventually just started having fun tilting my head side to side and changing the colour tint. Suffice to say the film is probably better in 2D.The movie has some Gothic themes for sure, which may frighten kids more than the ads imply. For one example, there is a river of human heads. Cue nightmare fuel. The movie wants to seem grown up with these things, clearly thrown in to appease fans of Nightmare Before Christmas, but the plot is unable to keep up. The movie ends in a gigantic battle, just a lazy excuse for the few who wanted to see the Tweedles do battle. Its a lazy ending, thats for sure.Tim Burton may have seemed like the perfect choice on paper for Alice, but it just didn't work. Most of the blame lands on the lazy fanfic of a script, and the over-reliance of small characters. It has some nice visuals and the Red Queen is certainly entertaining, but all ye stoners would be better off to keep watching the cartoon.",4,8,15,28 March 2010
Avatar," If you are willing to be amazed, Avatar delivers
","There is a definite downside to overhyping. It doesn't matter how good the movie is, if its being touted as the next coming of Christ, anything short of that will be met by with rage from the fanboys. After the first trailer, Avatar seemed to be clearly heading into this territory. A seemingly predictable plot, strange looking blue people and a bunch of unknowns boded poorly for the movies success. I myself was unassured, but knew it had to be seen anyways. I'm glad I did, because Avatar is the best blockbuster experience of the year, although not without its faults.Avatar skips through the opening pretty quickly, starting off with paraplegic ex-marine Jake Sully (Worthington) awakening after a six year journey to the new world Pandora. Pandora is littered with various dangerous creatures, spirit dandelions and a valuable rock known as Unobtanium, but most importantly for our purposes the hyper-spiritual humanoid race known as the Na'vi. Unfortunately, the Na'vi have settled right on top of the richest Unobtanium reserve on the planet. Industrialist Parker Selfridge (Ribisi, with the least subtle character name ever) wants them off, and ex-Marine mercenary Quatrich (Lang) is more than willing to blow them to hell to get them to move. The science team, led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Weaver) is more interested in studying the Na'vi and their connections to the Earth, and want a diplomatic solution to the mining issue. When Sully's brother on the science team is murdered, he is brought in due to his genetic structure being compatible with his brother's avatar, a Na'vi-human crossbreed body that can be controlled remotely.Sully's job to infiltrate the Na'vi becomes more complicated when he begins to fall for their culture, their spirituality and Neytiri (Saldana), a warrior princess. The core plot itself unfolds very predictably, and from the trailers alone the basic structure is given completely. The plot moves along at a brisk enough pace though that, even if its coloured within the lines, its a fun journey to take.My biggest gripe with the movie is the lack of subtlety in the spirituality of the film. The deity Ewya that the Na'vi believe in is invoked far too much, oftentimes unnecessarily. It gives the movie a bit too much of a tree-huggy nature to it at times, and could have been done without.The plot is clearly meant to parallel Iraq, and as such many of the humans are portrayed as boneheaded violence monkeys (guess which side thats supposed to be). There are a couple characters to offset this thankfully, but enough need to be still violence monkeys to allow for the climactic battle, which is like a ramped up version of the Ewok fight in Return of the Jedi. Its an amazing action setpiece, and if thats the sole reason you wish to see the movie, it will not disappoint.The effects were one of the most hyped up aspects of the movie, and they do not disappoint at all. The computer effects are some of the best ever seen on screen, and succeed in creating an entire new world. The Na'vi people themselves manage to avoid the 'uncanny valley' effect and are entirely believable, rarely seeming robotic or, well, computerized. The environment is completely believable, but not that far above what one sees in modern video games. Some of the landmarks, such as the floating mountains, are a bit excessive. Sci-fi can explain away many things, but gravity should still make the mountains rest on the ground. And what the hell is a flux vortex or whatever, aren't we above making up sci-fi gibberish? The 3D effect is very well done. The only time I'd seen it done well before was in Up, where it was subtle to the point of almost being unnoticeable. In this case, it is noticeable, but never distracts from whats important. There are no pop-out moments to draw attention to it, but the effect works wonders to immerse the viewer in the movie.Cameron wisely stuck away from A-listers, with B-list recognizable faces mixed with complete unknowns. Sigourney Weaver is by far the biggest star in her movie, but is believable enough in her determination (a very similar performance to her own in Gorillas in the Mist) to not let this get in the way. Worthington, a complete unknown before production on Avatar started, is an excellent lead and can possibly become the next big action star. Saldana brings a very elegant flow to Neytiri, and Ribisi is an excellent pigheaded moneyman.The true standout in my opinion is Lang as former Colenol Quatrich, the badass mercenary who warns of the low gravity making the marines 'soft'. Lang, who showed his funny side with a memorable role in The Men Who Stare at Goats, now portrays one of the most convincing and frighteningly badass villains in film. Its one hell of an entertaining performance, and here's hoping creates many an internet fad.Avatar is an excellent blockbuster, but the predictibility of the story perhaps makes it slightly less than the heights the fanboys had hoped. Still, its an amazingly entertaining movie, and a must-see experience. Just try not to get over-hyped.",8,1,3,14 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Fittingly Retro Touch, But Ridiculously Overrated
","Maybe I would have liked it more if it didn't have so much hype. Sure, horror movie standards aren't too high these days, and I applaud Drag Me to Hell for being somewhat retro. However, it just isn't good, as camp nor as terror.The gypsy curse plot can only go so far without requiring some shaking up, and DMTH is void of any form of twist to make it interesting, instead feeling like something typical in a half-hour segment of the Twilight Zone. The gore is relatively subdued (it is PG-13), and when it does show up in one 'eye-popping' scene, its laughably CGI. It's hard to tell whether or not it actually wanted to be laughable, especially in one scene where a demon dances on a table, or an attack via handkercheif.Credit where credit is due, Drag Me to Hell has some creepy bits, especially in the first half, but the movie just tailspins into stupidity. I really don't understand how this is so highly rated other than pure Raimi fanboyism. If you're a horror movie buff, you'll probably find something in this movie that you haven't seen in a long time, living in the environment of far too many PG-13 horror wannabes, but other than some nostalgia, this is a very run of the mill and forgettable horror flick.",3,5,12,2 June 2009
Saw," With Some Doctoring, Saw 2 Could Be The Next Se7en
","Ah, Saw. From the buzz, I was hoping this would be my gory ray of sunshine. It was supposed to be the successor to Se7en. Now, Se7en is the ultimate in detective movies. Nothing of the genre could stand up to Se7en. Could Saw be what I have been waiting for? Plot: 20/25: The killer is loose. They call him the Jigsaw Killer, because of his calling card; a piece of skin cut from his victims in the shape of a puzzle piece. He isn't your typical serial killer. He puts his victims in extreme situation where, if they don't complete his outrageous challenges, they will end up killing themselves. If they make it out, they have a much bigger appreciation for life.His current victims are photographer Adam (Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes). They wake up in a small, broken-down room chained to pipes and with a dead body in between them. They also find a pair of saws. They are each left a tape explaining what they must do. Gordon must kill Adam, and Adam must survive. If Gordon fails to kill Adam, his wife Alison (Potter) and daughter Diana (Vega) will be killed.As they race for their survival, Gordon tells us the story of Jigsaw killer. Gordon was a suspect himself for a while, due to them finding one of his personal belongings at the scene of the crime. We learn of the previous victims, including one particularly nerve-racking one involving a reverse bear-trap attached to someone's head. We also learn of Detective David Tapp (Glover), a cop who becomes obsessed with Gordon and the Jigsaw killer.The plot is better than most other horror movies around. There are some holes and it isn't exceptionally difficult to figure out the twist, but it keeps you interested.Horror: 17/25: This isn't your everyday horror movie. It doesn't attempt to outright scare you. There are very few pop-outs. This one tries to unnerve you through gore and outright creepiness. In my humble opinion, it fails.The movie is basically advertised as excessive gore city. In reality, this movie is no gorier than movies like Dawn of the Dead or Kill Bill. In fact, it is significantly tamer than those. The reason this one is usually called gorier is because it makes you think about what you are witnessing. However, when you take a look at it, it really isn't too gory.As for creepy, this movie can be creepy at times, but really, how scary is a robot on a tricycle? It's not scary, it's just weird and stupid.This movie isn't nearly as unnerving as Se7en. In fact, it is only slightly unnerving. Maybe I'm just desensitized, but this doesn't work too well as a horror movie. It is more intense than most other horror movies today, so I give it credit for that, at least.Acting: 6/25: To start off, Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) has gained a lot of weight. This guy needs a job. Unfortunately, this movie just won't look good on his resume. He is TERRIBLE. He should really stick to comedy. Whannell (The Matrix Reloaded) is below average as Adam, as is Monica Potter (Boston Legal). The only good performance is that of Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon) who is given the only real character as an obsessive detective. The acting, overall, is the main weakness of the movie.Entertainment: 16/25: Saw has an interesting concept. What would you do if you were placed in a situation where your life was a pawn in someone's sick game? Would you run? Would you cry? Would you just accept it? Looking at it from this perspective, Saw is a good movie.Looking at it from another perspective, Saw can feel very boring at times and the acting ruins the believability a movie like this desperately needs. The directing is obviously trying to be Se7en 2 (or would it be 8ight?), and it doesn't measure up. The movie is obviously going for unnerving rather than flat-out scary, but it isn't as creepy as it could have been. This movie is an underachiever.Total: 59%: Saw could have been a lot more. I could see the potential just oozing from this movie. The plot was good, and it had a creepy style to it. Unfortunately, the acting prevented a lot of the horror from coming to life and the movie holds few surprises. With some doctoring to the formula, Saw 2 could prove to be what Se7en fans expected from this movie.",6,1,2,23 April 2005
Up," Tragic, Mesmerizing and Utterly Hilarious, One of Pixar's Finest
","Pixar has never disappointed (so long as we block Cars from our memory). After Wall-E, the bar was set higher than ever. Wall-E was a beautiful haunting picture, made not for children but more for people willing to absorb the imagery without needing to be guided by dialogue. Despite the success of Wall-E, I think Pixar realized how it may have alienated children to some extent with its long first act, and has included more colour and dialogue in their next picture, Up. However, even if a slightly less mature picture at times than its predecessor, Up ranks among the best Pixar films to date and may actually be its most haunting.Up is the story of 78-year old widower Carl Frederickson. After the death of his wife, he finally decides to do what they always dreamed of doing and having a house on Paradise Falls. However, when his houseship has an unexpected passenger in young boy scout (sorry, 'Wilderness Explorer') Russell, his journey becomes something else entirely.Carl is probably the most tragic character Pixar has ever made, possibly even including Wall-E. The opening montage of his life is probably the single most tragic thing I've ever seen in an animated feature. Even Russell, the requisite annoying-yet-noble child, has his share of tragedy surrounding him, also dealing with themes much more mature than the standard studio. It's a tale of a man trying to live his life in its twilight, and its done wonderfully.Of course, no kids want to see a tragedy, so importantly, Up is very funny. There's a man with an army of talking dogs, from which much humour ensues (particularly from Dug, the 'SQUIRREL!' dog from the trailer, as well as Alpha, a Rottweiler with a malfunctioning collar). Then there's the large-bird-thing Kevin, also producing some very funny material. Despite the tragedy of the whole story, you really can't help but be entertained, and certainly this is a very funny movie.I do have my complaints, however. The climax seems too stereotypical, a pitfall of all kids movies. It works, however, even if it doesn't blow away. Also, as a physics major, I have some issues to settle with the mechanics of walking around dragging a flying house, but its a pure fantasy movie, and eventually i coerced my brain into shutting up in that respect.One final note: the 3D aspect. I did see it in 3D, and was very impressed. Unlike most 3D movies, there was not a single 'OMG 3D' moment in Up (forgive the expression). The use was subtle, yet did add a degree of immersion to the film. It also made the dogs that much more frightening at times. The movie definitely is very good in 2D, but the 3D gives it an extra layer, even if not necessary. If the idea does make you queasy, go for the 2D, because the 3D does not drive the soul of the film.Overall, Up is a triumph. Pixar seems more focused than ever with these last few films, and I'm absolutely loving it. If this implies that Toy Story 3 will be the best yet, bring it on.NOTE: There's a 3D Toy Story 3 trailer attached. That makes it worth admission alone.NOTE: The short film before the movie (as standard with Pixar) is not their best, but its very cute and works its magic to warm you up for the film.",9,2,4,2 June 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Goblet a choppy step back for the series
","I've always been pretty middle-of-the-road when it comes to the Harry Potter movies. I do love the books, which have always been top-of-the-line fantasy. The movies, on the other hand, have straddled mediocrity. The first two felt quite empty, but the third brought the series up a notch with a great new atmosphere and a much darker tone. We could only hope the fourth would continue with this train of thought.The fourth year of Harry Potter's life as a wizard begins with him automatically at Ron Weasly's house, ready to go the Quidditch World Cup (no introduction with the Dursleys this time). Afterwards, Harry (Radcliffe), Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) are back on a train for the fourth year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Things aren't all the same this year, as Hogwarts is hosting the Triwizard Cup, an interschool competition of the best of wizarding students. After a representative has been chosen for each of the three schools, the goblet of fire gives out one last name, that of Harry Potter, who is now forced to compete in this extremely dangerous competition.Despite popular opinion, the fourth book was my least favourite of the six currently out there. Why you ask? Because it was overly long with countless points that really didn't affect the plot one way or another. The whole Triwizard cup could have been done without had some tweaking took place. When 90% of a book is completely inconsequential, this does carry on to the movie, as much of that 90% is required to be shown again.Another prospected problem for the film is that the book was much longer than the other three. This means that the movie cut out a lot of stuff, such as Hermione's war with journalist Rita Skeeter (Richardson) and the elf rights lobby, that might irk fans of the book. Even with all of this cut out (mostly for the better), the movie still feels like it is trying to condense everything too much. A lot of scenes feel like they were cut short, and a lot of characters have a minuscule part compared to the book. The most obvious instance is concerning the rival champs, Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour, who probably say a combined total of twenty words. This will annoy anyone familiar with the book, but truly confuse anyone who didn't read the books as they are given no time to absorb the information being given to them.While the Triwizard cup may have been unnecessary in my eyes, it does provide for some great visuals in the movie. The opening event where Harry must face a dragon looks great, even if it isn't entirely logical. The final event is also handled quite well. The touch of magic in the world that has been present throughout is still intact, such as the moving images in the paintings and such. The visuals are great all around.One thing that stands out about this part of the series is that it starts what I like to call the phase where Harry discovers himself. A big part of the tournament in the Yule Ball, which forces Harry and Ron to get themselves dates. The movie handles the process with all the male insecurities they can fit into the short amount of time allotted, and actually works out quite well as a breather from all the Triwizard talk. The Ball itself isn't quite as I expected, seeming more like a high school prom (complete with an absolutely horrid band) than an actual ball, but regardless, this was one part they got right.The ending of the movie is what many fans of the book have been waiting for, and it doesn't disappointÂ…much. Note that this paragraph is probably a spoiler for those who have gone bookless. Voldemort is represented quite well by Ralph Fiennes, though he seems like more of a creature than a human as I had thought of him. He also seems way too energetic at the end. Regardless, it brings the darkness that I loved in the third one back to the movie. Also, I loved the little hint towards the KKK reflected in the robes of the Death Eaters.The acting of the three leads is much more mature than it was in the first couple movies. Radcliffe is full of insecurities as a child who truly does not want to be in his own position. Grint also has improved, being the immature Ron Weasley we all know from the books. The biggest change is Emma Watson, who has matured greatly into quite a good young actress. She doesn't try to appear any more mature than any other teenager, but her anger scenes are done exceptionally well, considering how mediocre the three of them were back in Sorceror's Stone.As for the adults, the only one worthy of special mention is Brendan Gleeson, who is absolutely perfect as Mad Eye Moody, the new defence against the dark arts teacher. His quirks are all excellent to watch, yet you can always see some kind of deeper meaning in whatever insanity he performs. He provides some great levity along with some very good non-humorous moments. The other mentionable actor is Michael Gambon, who picked up the role of Dumbledore from the late Richard Harris after The Chamber of Secrets. While I did prefer Harris, Gambon has filled his shoes quite well, and aside from the voice it is difficult to tell the difference.Despite all the problems, Goblet is still better than the first two entries, even if not by much. I am confident the problem lay with adapting the book rather than the minds behind the film. This really doesn't help expectations for the next two, which are even longer. Even if the problems are understandable, that doesn't stop Goblet from being a choppy film that will disappoint fans of the book and confuse fans of the films.",6,0,0,11 March 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Anchorman Crosses the Line Between Stupid and Plain Pathetic
","Plot: 0/25: Plot? What kind of movie do you think you're watching? This movie has no plot! I remember hearing something about the news, but PLOT! Peh! OK, if you want a plot, fine.Ron Burgundy (Ferrel) is a big shot anchor for a San Diego news station. He and his news crew, consisting of womanizer Brian Fantana (Rudd), cowboy Champ Kind (Koechner) and retarded Brick Tamland (Carell), are the top shits of San Diego, having a rivalry with #2 news crew, led by Wes Mantooth (Vaughn). Their world gets shaken up when their boss Ed Harken (Willard) invites a woman, Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) to join the news crew.It kinda just goes on from there. It's a stupid movie, there isn't anything to be surprised about here. It is as contrived as possible, it doesn't pretend to be anything different. This isn't a plot type movie, but it doesn't even string well. It's convoluted, filled with pointless scenes and makes Harold & Kumar look like an intelligent movie. At least Harold & Kumar was funny.Comedy: 10/25: To say this movie isn't kinda funny is a lie. There are some funny bits, mostly due to just how random it is. Steve Carell is simply hilarious as Brick, almost being the saving grace to this movie. Unfortunately, just as many jokes fall flat and suffocate in a deep pile of vomit. When a comment about a whale's vagina is seen as a highlight, a movie has serious problems.Acting: 5/25: Will Ferrel (Elf) is known for putting himself out there and making an ass out of himself. That he does with expertise here. But ponder for a second, was that really that tough? Any person off the street can do that, providing they have four intact limbs. Ferrel, overall, is painful here. Applegate sucks, but at least she isn't the main cause this one drowns, unlike when she destroyed Surviving Christmas. Carell (Bruce Almighty) is great here, once again adding at least a couple points to the bank for this waste of time. And then there's the cameos. Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaugh, etc, etc. Why the hell would they waste their time with this? Especially Robbins, fresh off an Oscar win? They must owe a favour or something.Entertainment: 2/25: If you are wasted out of your mind, this movie is perfect for you. Just do yourself a favour and do not see Anchorman sober. If you do, you are left with something that will make you sit down and ponder 'Why am I watching this?' Total: 17%: OK, I must be dead or something. Its 2005, I didn't think I'd be seeing anymore crappy 2004 movies. But no, this one crept up on me and took dump on my face with tired jokes and cameos that just don't fit. This one crosses the line between stupid and plain pathetic.",5,6,13,3 February 2005
Ray," Ray Is a Great Movie Brought To Life By Excellent Acting
","OK, I never listened to Ray Charles music before. I'll be the first to admit it. However, from the second I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it and I knew it would be great. After all the hype about Jamie Foxx and the Best Picture nomination and Best Actor win, I knew it was my duty as a movie lover to see it. So does Ray live up? Plot: 23/25: If there was ever a celebrity's story that deserved a biography, I am convinced this is it. This movie deals with the early career of blind jazz pianist Ray Charles Robinson (Foxx), mostly from the late '40s until the early '60s. This encompasses the growth of his popularity, his unique gospel/jazz style, the creation of his greatest classics, his marriage to Della Bea Robinson (Washington), his affairs with his backup singers Mary Ann Fisher (Ellis) and Margie Hendricks (King), and his heroin addiction, the last of which is the main theme of the movie. We are also told, through a series of flashbacks, the story of his childhood and how he coped with his blindness.Probably the most impressive thing about this movie is that, while it is clearly made by someone who idolizes Ray, is unflinching in portraying just how bad all the things he's done are. It is just as much about his drug addiction and adultery as his music. It never pretends that Ray Charles was a perfect person, and makes him out to be anything but.There may be a few too many flashbacks and it may deal too much with his brother's death, but it is overall a great representation of the rise of a superstar and his demons.Music: 25/25: I never listened to Ray Charles before this, but if this isn't the type of music that raises someone to fame, I don't know what is. The music is great, just as anyone would expect.Acting: 25/25: As you've probably already heard, the acting in this movie is about as good as it gets. Of course, the Best Actor winner Jamie Foxx, who broke out of his Booty Call shell earlier in the year with Collateral, deserves every single accolade he's been getting for his electric performance as Ray Charles. It is probably extremely difficult to convincingly play a very well-known figure, and Foxx is so convincing he could walk into a bar and say 'I'm Ray Charles' and, even though you know Ray died (R.I.P.), you just might believe him. However, just because Foxx is brilliant here does not mean that the rest of the cast should go unnoticed. Regina King (Jerry Maguire) is fantastic as Margie Hendricks, the backup singer whose life Ray destroys, and should have had at least an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast, while not excelling to the heights of the aforementioned two, give their all and are all great.Entertainment: 21/25: To say this movie is perfect is false. At 150 minutes, it does feel a little long. However, it is worth it all if you stomach sitting down for that long.Total: 94%: Ray is a wonderful movie. It keeps an electric feeling to it and it's main character, while, at the same time, being an unflinching look at a man and his demons. A truly incredible story is backed up with some great music and some of the best acting we've seen in a long time. I guarantee you that Ray is an experience all should see.",8,0,1,5 March 2005
Inception," Inception is the best sci-fi movie since The Matrix
","Every so often a movie comes along which completely changes the notion of science-fiction. Avatar did it not too long ago, thanks to its special effects in the same vein as Star Wars. But often times effects have little, if nothing, to do with innovation. Blade Runner and Alien certainly aren't remembered mainly due to their special effects, and while The Matrix may have ushered in a new era of effects and action scenes, perhaps the strongest effect it had was altering the way we think of science fiction in films itself. Inception is one of these movies, transcending genres and becoming more than just a great sci-fi movie, and is the best sci-fi movie since The Matrix eleven years ago.I went into Inception having avoided every trailer to keep it fresh. I was aware the movie was about dreams and directed by Christopher Nolan and that was already too much information. Having seen it, this doesn't really matter; no trailer will explain this film enough to ruin it. It creates its own universe with a distinct set of rules which are blended into the narrative naturally.But what is it about anyways? Inception is essentially a heist movie, except instead of stealing anything real, the group we are concerned with steals ideas by infiltrating the subconscious of their dreaming targets. Except this time, they plan to plant an idea in the subconscious to bring down a company at the beckon of the Saito, head of the rival corporation.The heist crew consists of a bunch of interesting characters, who despite not fitting any kind of 'five man band' or any other cliché all feel fairly fleshed out, at least enough to care about the fate of each one. This may partly be due to the very likable cast, ranging from Juno herself Ellen Page to perhaps my favourite actor in the business right now, Joseph Gordon Levitt. Ken Wantanabe also joins in the fun as Saito, perhaps his first truly major role in a Western blockbuster since his Oscar nominated turn in The Last Samurai. Cillian Murphy tones down the creepiness he excels at as the target of the heist, and is actually quite sympathetic.Of course, the emotional center of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb, an expert at the game wracked with guilt over what happened to his wife Mal. In most sci-fi movies, the 'past guilt' storyline is ridiculously overplayed and usually a large distraction from the meat of the story. This may be the first time that this part of the story *is* the most intriguing (which is saying something given how damn intriguing the rest of the film really is). DiCaprio gives a great performance, as does Mario Cotillard as the wife, full of both spite and love. I will say no more, for this is the only part where spoilers matter, but its a very organic and touching storyline which will no doubt be widely discussed.In these dreams, the subconscious presents itself as various persons who can become violent if they feel the dream is tampered with (or if the mind has been trained to defend itself). This is half for the sci-fi aspect and half for the sole purpose of giving us action scenes, but either way it works. Gun fights initially seem out of the place, but when the stakes for living in the dream are later raised (rather arbitrarily might I add, one of the few weakly reasoned plot points) they become rather harrowing. The better action sequences directly take advantage of the dreamscape, notably a zero-gravity sequence.Effects are not the reason to see the movie (Avatar this ain't, plot structure is much more important), but regardless the movie is stunningly beautiful. Any movie about dreams will have some interesting cinematography and Inception certainly fits the bill. No hippy-esquire backdrops are used, making this much less of a stoner flick than it may well have been and all the better for it. And best of all: it all makes sense in context and never feels like it was done for solely for rule of cool.Inception may well be Nolan's masterpiece, certainly capable of standing next to The Dark Knight and Memento. In ten years, it may become a classic held to the standards of The Matrix and Blade Runner. Some may find it too intellectual or prententious, but this will be the minority. Anyone with even a vague interest in sci-fi owes it to themselves to see this movie. Its the best science fiction film in years and a strong early contender for the best movie of 2010.",8,1,3,16 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Great setup, but unsatisfying
","To say Sherlock Holmes had high expectations is an understatement. Lets face it, Guy Ritche post-RocknRolla directing Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, along with his pet actor (and sole reason to watch Revolver) Mark Strong, not to mention Rachel McAdams. So when Holmes wound up being merely good, it was really easy to be disappointed.Holmes takes on a more book-accurate version, which is great. Holmes is far from stable, an eccentric nutbag, although brilliant (its easy to see that House was based off this version of Sherlock). The biggest difference is Dr. Watson, who, by being played by Jude Law, is immediately obviously not the bumbling fatman following Holmes as one might expect. Instead, he's competent and possibly the only one able to save Holmes from himself.The pair soon finds themselves in the middle of a mystery and Lord Blackwood (Strong), a villainous leader of a cult group, seemingly comes back from the dead and begins offing his cult elders, who all believe in some heebie-jeebie stuff the movies takes way to seriously and is only able to explain through outlandish means. Strong has proved himself a good actor, but fails as the villain, not using his screen presence as much as he could.Rachel McAdams also appears as Holmes' long-lost love interest and femme fatale, although she eventually must take on the damsel in distress role. She perhaps lacks some of the more direct sex appeal, but is nonetheless effective in the role.As for the main pair, they are both played excellent. Robert Downey Jr is possibly the best possible actor to play an eccentric like Holmes, and Law complements him very well.The movie has many more action setpieces than one might expect from the title, but alas, they are there. And they are quite good, especially when they invoke a certain monstorous mook. Ritchie directs them with plenty of kinetic energy without getting too Bourne-ish, but they do sometimes go too far over the top.In all, Holmes is an entertaining but unsatisfying end-of-year action flick. It desperately wants a sequel, which I hope it gets simply because there is lots of potential. Here's hoping Ritchie utilises it more next time.",6,0,4,13 January 2010
Arrival," Arrival's human elements outshine its speculative ones
","Arrival is the kind of major Hollywood movie some sci-fi fans have been eternally asking for. It's a story of alien vessels descending on Earth that doesn't present itself as an excuse to blow up the White House, or immediately turn into a cheap thrill ride. Its main focus is on something technical (linguistics), and it doesn't immediately turn into faux-mathy quantum-this relativity-that technobabble but instead lets it drive the plot. It involves nations colluding and high stakes, yes, but it also is consistently a very personal story that never loses sight of its main character. It leaves plenty of room for imagination while not resorting to magical excuses. But something's still missing for me. Arrival is a sparse, thoughtful, beautiful film that I just can't love, mostly because it's payoff simply didn't entirely work for me. To go on much further would be clearly spoiler territory, but suffice to say that the movie doesn't cheat with any twists nor does it betray its tone. In fact, its payoff is incredibly affecting dramatically. While the viewer in me interested in human stories left satisfied, the world- investigating nerd in me felt a bit let down.Arrival's sparsity and humanistic elements come to the forefront immediately, starting with flashback's to Dr. Louise Banks' (Amy Adams) daughter dying young, and allowing the landing of the aliens to happen entirely offscreen. We only see what Dr. Banks sees, and only get a full-out effects shot once she's brought in by the military as a linguistics expert. Twelve crafts have landed sporadically around the world, and while Dr. Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) try to figure out just what they want, they must work with the other eleven nations while also staving off aggression towards the visitors both foreign and on their base. It's timely that international mistrust plays such a large role here, considering the current nationalistic trend in politics, but Arrival mostly shies away from that form of commentary. It has more sympathy for the aliens themselves, and condemns those who see mystery and respond with fear. Alt-right- esque commentators make brief unsavory appearances, panic spreads through a literal game of telephone, and when Renner notes that they're having 'Coffee with some aliens', it's possible to mishear as something very politically relevant today.For all that it has to say about how we treat those deemed 'other', Arrival is more interested in it's sci-fi elements than its political ones. And while they don't entirely land for me, they take big swings and hit home emotionally. A lot of it's successes have to do with its score, beautifully subdued and often incredibly sad, and Villeneuve's command of mood, painting the movie in a washed-out blue haze on Earth and surgically cold blacks and whites on the vessel. Its alien design is fairly minimalistic, with the gravity- bending trick seen in the trailers as its lone flashy moment. Otherwise, it's content with its giant black obelisks of vessels, remarkable for their unremarkability. Amy Adams gives a career-best performance in the middle of a fantastic career, important as the movie rests entirely on her shoulders. No amount of disappointment in the end result can erase the fantastic buildup, and if you're able to go with it all the way, the reward is memorable and touching.",7,1,6,7 December 2016
The Terminal," The Terminal Takes Flight Due To A Spot-On Tom Hanks
","Plot: 1.5/2.5: Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a citizen of Krakozhia, a country near Russia, who is travelling to New York. While he is in the air, his country is thrown into a coup, and is no longer recognized as a nation, for the time being. This creates problems for Navorski. He lands and the airport finds his passport is invalid. Airport bureaucrat Frank Dixon (Tucci) informs him that, because he is no longer a citizen of any nation, he cannot enter the United States of America. Also, he cannot go back to Krakozhia. He has fallen into a crack in the system. The only place he can go is the terminal in the JFK airport. This is the story of how he waited for his country to get out of hard times so he can finally step outside. Of course, it isn't just Navorski hanging around. He meets stewardess Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones), and they find, despite obvious differences, they are quite alike. He has numerous run-ins with Indian janitor Gupta (Pallana), who thinks Navorski is a spy. He also tries to get information for Enrique Cruz (Luna), who supplies Navorski with food in exchange for information on immigration officer Torres (Saldana), whom he is smitten with. He also has a need for money to pay for food, and needs something to do to pass the time.The premise itself is interesting. Being stranded at an airport terminal uncertain of whether or not you'll ever go home, with Dixon being a great add-in. It could have made for great stuff, but unfortunately, it manages to screw itself over. The sideplots, for the most part, are utterly stupid. While I liked the bit about how he got a job and everything, the side plot about Cruz and Torres ends up exactly as we were hoping it wouldn't. I could hear a little 'LAME' echoing around in my skull. The sideplot involving Warren seems to be just a diversion to make the movie take up a full two hours, and Navorski's reason for going to New York is really half-assed. That being said, this does have a lot of heart to it. Navorski is an incredibly sympathetic character and Dixon is an incredibly unsympathetic character. If this movie had been 1 ½ hours instead, the plot would have been great. As it stands, it tries to do too much and branches way too far off course.Comedy: 2.4/2.5: The Terminal is a very funny movie. It's not like it cracks jokes or anything, so it's not as gut-busting as, say, Meet the Fockers. It does have a sweet, pitiful humour to it, thanks mainly to some great set-ups and an out-of-the-park performance by Hanks. It does slow down at the end, but still holds up enough to make it very enjoyable, whether Navorski is getting hit by quarters or walking around in a bathrobe.Acting: 2.5/2.5: Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) is absolutely incredible as Navorski. The accent is spot on, the mannerisms are spot on. Even the progression as he learns English is noticeable. This is the second time this year he's done a completely different voice (the first being The Ladykillers), and he once again nails it. Tucci (Big Trouble) is hilarious and great as the airport bureaucrat from hell. Zeta-Jones (Ocean's 12) gets a nothing character, but that's the scripts fault mainly. A special mention is in order for Kumar Pallana, who is hilarious as the obsessive janitor.Entertainment: 2.3/2.5: This is the type of movie just about everyone can enjoy. Teenagers may say they thought it was too 'sweet', but in reality, they loved it. I can see people poking holes like it was Swiss cheese, but I doubt anyone will really see this movie and not leave with a positive feeling toward it.Total: 87%: The Terminal is one of the best movies of it's type ever made. It's the type of sweet and kind movie that everyone pretends to be sick of but really likes a lot. Hanks deserves a lot of credit, as the weight of this movie falls almost entirely on his back, with only Tucci taking any other credit. I really can't see anyone having an overall negative view of this, so I recommend the Terminal to the world far and wide.",7,1,2,4 February 2005
The Ringer," The Ringer a decent diversion, but not very funny nor memorable
","When I first heard of a movie about fixing the Special Olympics, the first thought that came to mind was how tasteless the movie would be. Sure, South Park got away with having an episode about the Special Olympics, but we've come to expect the most blatantly offensive stuff possible from South Park. Then, when the name Johnny Knoxville was associated with the film, it all made sense. Who else can do the outrageously offensive like Johnny Knoxville? Surprisingly, the movie isn't really offensive at all. Also surprisingly, the movie isn't very funny at all either.What starts this whole need for this retarded scheme seems a little overly complicated, but it serves its purpose. Steve Barker (Knoxville) is facing a small crises. After getting a promotion, his first task is to fire kindly old janitor Stavi. He can't bring himself to do it, so he has Stavi mow lawns at his apartment building. This plan works alright until Stavi loses his fingers in a lawnmower. Steve, without any medical insurance for Stavi, now must come up with $25,000 in two weeks or Stavi will lose his fingers.Enter Steve's Uncle Gary (Cox), who is having problems of his own with his bookies. He then comes up with the idea to have Steve, who was a track star and drama star in high school, to enter the Special Olympics, presumably being able to wipe the floor with the disabled and allowing huge winnings if Gary bets on Steve over the favourite, Jimmy (Flowers). After much argument, Steve agrees to go along with the scheme to help Stavi.Everything else that happens in the movie follows the path that anyone would expect. Steve (now known as Jeffy) passes himself off as 'special', but finds that the actual Special Olympians are talented enough to basically wipe the floor with him. He falls for cute counsellor Lynn (Heigl), but obviously doesn't have a chance with her since she knows him as Jeffy. He also manages to befriend that actual disabled athletes and essentially become one of them. The movie doesn't try to deviate from the formula for something of its type, even if it does have an interesting twist by making it about the Special Olympics.A plot that lacks in substance or creativity is pretty well a staple of comedies with the likes of Johnny Knoxville, so that would be entirely forgivable if the movie managed to still be funny. This is, of course, the main problem with the movie. It simply isn't all that funny. Sure, there is the occasional chuckle from the behaviour of the 'special' athletes, but other than that, the movie has almost zero laughs.It would be easy to blame Knoxville for this, but he is definitely trying. He does a good job overall with his impersonation, but his character is never really written anything funny. He is made to be pathetic, but not laughably so. We all know that Johnny Knoxville can be funny, but in this movie, he is just made to be warm and fuzzy, and never funny like he should have been.The one surprising thing about this movie is just how light-hearted it is. Seeing as it stars Johnny Knoxville, I was expecting a crass and crude comedy that consisted mainly of fart jokes and slaps in the face towards the disabled. The movie is actually hardly offensive at all, portraying the athletes as real people rather than children, just with certain problems. They aren't walking around wearing helmets or falling down randomly or anything else you would expect from the likes of Knoxville.The fact that it is inoffensive definitely makes The Ringer tolerable, but it still doesn't stop the fact that the movie just isn't that funny. While it is a decent nothing-better-to-do rental, there is no way to recommend this whole-heartedly. There was potential, but the movie wastes it all. Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie more than just a pleasant deviation into something a little more memorable.56%",6,1,2,4 July 2006
Easy A," A good movie with trouble in the details
","There's a good movie lurking within Easy A, I can say that with great certainty. A film aiming to make Emma Stone the new Molly Ringwald, it succeeds in a few departments. Emma Stone shines, and the movie offers a few instances of great dramatic intrigue. However, one sin it commits brings it down greatly: it does not manage to be consistently funny.Emma Stone stars Olive Penderghast, a small town high school student who manages to top the gossip chain by creating rumours of her promiscuity. Using it to help the woeful male losers pretend they got action, Olive bathes in both gift cards and infamy. However, once the consequences of her actions become apparent, the spotlight is suddenly less bright.The plot definitely has some dramatic high points, above all relating to the teacher/guidance counsellor married couple played by Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow, a story that perhaps would have been better served as the main plot line rather than a sub plot. Olive being solicited for the real deal is also a dramatic high point. Many of the supporting actors not brought in for comedic relief absolutely sell these moments and make them by far the most memorable parts of the film.Emma Stone is an incredibly charismatic lead and is well positioned to be the teen queen of the generation. It is a testament to her performance that she is incredibly watchable even while given a terribly wish-washy character, who until the end flip-flops between regretful and infamy-loving at an alarming rate. While some of her one-liners are decently amusing, some stand out as particularly horrible, notably the Tom Cruise line from the trailer (how was that line considered good enough to make the promotional material?).Two major parts of the plot and cast fail miserably though. While a male romantic interest was necessary, Penn Badgely as Todd seems to be something out of a particularly bad John Hughes movie. This is made ten times worse when the film pokes fun at those very same John Hughes movies. Perhaps if the male lead was less of a underwear model, the overall theme of the film would be less muddied.Also failing epically is Amanda Bynes as the hyper-Catholic Marianne, whose circle ostracizes Olive. Her acting is consistently hammed up and her groups actions and interactions seem far too cartoonish in contrast to the films real dramatic tension. The movie also seems perhaps a little too gung-ho on an anti-religion slant, using religion as a shortcut to indicate people just not minding their own business.The general kookiness of some of the characters is also somewhat offputting. Olive introduces her best friends parents as very strange people, seemingly only to keep us from noticing how very strange her own parents are. They are clearly portrayed as loving, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson clearly have fun, but they aren't as funny or important as they should be.In all, the film has many issues, but a great film does lie beneath them. Even with those issues, the movie could have been forgiven if it was at least funny. While it has some great moments and will surely be a star-making vehicle for Stone, Easy A doesn't quite make the grade (worst pun ever, I'm aware).",5,9,15,6 October 2010
Fantastic Four," Nothing Fantastic About It
","Well, after a big slump, comic book movies have made a comeback. This year already had a few entries. Batman Begins and Sin City were both exceptional, and Constantine was at least decent. Sure Elektra was also around for 2005, but we'll just forget that one exists. The final of the five major releases this year was The Fantastic Four. Now, Marvel had plenty of well-accepted conversions in the past (X-Men and Spider-Man for example), though others (like Hulk and The Punisher) didn't fare so well. Which side does The Fantastic Four fall on? The basic premise of The Fantastic Four, to make a brief comparison, is like that of The Hulk, except a little bit dumber. Basically, Dr. Reed Richards (Gruffudd) and his partner Ben Grimm (Chiklis) are a pair of scientists who have hit some hard times. When they find out that a cosmic storm is about to pass Earth, the employ the resources of billionaire Victor Von Doom (McMahon) to test out how it would affect human DNA by bringing a sample to his shielded space station. So, Reed, Ben and Victor head off to the space station, along with Victor's current flame, Sue Storm (Alba), who also happens to be Reed's ex. The final member of the team is Sue's brother Johnny (Evans), who, despite being an immature womanizer, is somehow a spaceship pilot. How he managed to become a pilot is unknown, though it does say that, in the future, we really must have lowered our standards. Also, why they send these five when it seems that Ben is the only one with space experience is a little puzzling.Anyways, when they get there, the storm is apparently moving much faster than first thought, and they all get hit with it before the shields can react. This causes them all to get certain special powers. Ben turns into rock and gets intensified power. Sue can turn herself invisible and create force fields. Johnny can turn himself into fire and fly. Reed can stretch his body like a rubber band (surprisingly only one reference to his genitals, just for us Mallrats fans). The four of them become quick celebrities, dubbed the Fantastic Four by the press. Victor, on the other hand, sees his company go down the tubes due to the failure in the space station, and, with his power to control electricity, is now lashing out.Victor never does get to wreak havoc like Norman Osborne (aka The Green Goblin) did in the first Spider-Man. In fact, no havoc is really wrought at all. It seems the whole movie is just about the four of them interacting until the final half hour, at which time Victor goes a little nutters. Up until then, we have absolutely zero action scenes, unless you count a big rescue scene early on.So, what exactly fills this middle up? It mainly revolves around Grimm, aka The Thing, who is the only one of the four who cannot turn back to normal form. He is understandably ticked and Reed is trying to invent a machine to reverse the process and return Ben to normal. The other part of the movie revolves around Johnny, aka The Human Torch, who has taken to his powers and wants to exploit them to become a celebrity. It's all well and good in theory, but the lack of action really does hurt.The other plot point, as you probably could have guessed, is the flame rekindling between Sue and Reed. It does seem obligatory, and overall just doesn't work. Gruffudd and Alba have very little chemistry together, making their romance just seem fleeting. Then you have to factor in the fact that Alba is far too young for the role. While Gruffudd is sporting some grey hair, Alba still looks in her mid-twenties, showing off plenty of cleavage and bleach-blond hair. Basically, she is the walking rack of the movie. Gruffudd isn't much better himself, showing that he is by no means a leading man. Chiklis is pretty good underneath the giant foam suit that is The Thing, and Evans, even if you have to hate his character's guts, does a decent job as the a-hole of the four.The movie could at least be a little better if it took itself even a little bit serious. Grimm's torment and Johnny's ego are both subjects that could be dealt with in a way that actually affects the audience. The way that it decides to go is basically as a huge comedy, with lame jokes everywhere (mainly spouted out by Evans), only of which one or two are actually grin-worthy. Especially annoying is one sequence that seems like something that would fit better in an episode of The Real World. This feels less like a comic book movie and more like a wannabe spoof.Well, the best thing I can say about The Fantastic Four is that it as at least tolerable. I can sit through it without gagging much, unlike some other comic books movies, such as Hulk or Batman & Robin. Still, there really is no value to seeing this either. It completely lacks on action, the jokes are lame, the acting is mediocre and the plot is pretty ridiculous. It's not necessarily what a comic book movie shouldn't be, even if it does contain a lot of aspects that say otherwise, but it has nothing that a comic book movie should have. Overall, it is just a waste of time. There is nothing even mediocre about this, let alone fantastic.Overall Rating  32%",3,0,1,27 January 2006
Click," Click part tragedy, part Sandler comedy, and the mix just doesn't work
","Adam Sandler movies aren't quite as funny as they used to be. Billy Madison was by far the funniest, and it's been downhill since then, with The Longest Yard being his worst comedy yet. At the same time, Sandler has been involving himself in many more serious projects, such as Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish. Click could be said to be a combination of the two, half a tragedy and half an immature fantasy comedy. It is this dual personality that is the main fault of Click, because it simply exists at two opposite poles.The main premise of Click is something that everyone has probably thought of at one time or another. What if you could have a remote control that controlled events around you? Would you use to help others or to exercise all of your guilty pleasures in your darkest dreams? Would you give yourself a clean slate and start from page one? Would you use it for trial-and-error, trying something and if it doesn't work feeling free to rewind? Click never delves too deeply into the psychology behind being your own God, because it is more obsessed with making it a personal tale rather than make the main character a metaphor for the audience to relate to. The movie follows Michael Newman (Sandler), a man with a beautiful wife (Beckinsale), two young children and the hope of soon making partner in an architectural firm, which has caused him to work insane hours and ignore his family. He doesn't have time for the regular things, such as taking his kids camping or making love to his wife.As the straw that breaks the camel's back, he is having problems with the excessive number of remotes in his home which apparently control everything from light fixtures to the refrigerator. He goes out searching for a universal remote, finding only Bed, Bath and Beyond to be open. He ventures into the Beyond section and finds Morty (Walken), who gives him a top-of-the-line non-returnable remote for free, citing that sometimes good guys need a break. He leaves it up to Michael to find out that the remote controls his entire universe, allowing him to pause, fast-forward, chapter select, hear commentary, etc.As you would expect from any Sandler movie, it starts out with him abusing his powers for personal benefit or for fun. He gives himself a tan using the tint, he revisits old childhood memories and he torments the child next door. He also uses it to skip past hard work periods or dinner with his parents (Winkler & Kavner), which leaves him as a near-zombie in autopilot. Some of what happens is fairly funny, just because we all know we'd love to do the same thing if given the chance, or because we manage to revel in Michael's joy with his new toy as he makes everyone speak Spanish or has James Earl Jones narrate his life. More often than not, it is about as crude as you'd expect from a Sandler movie, which bodes pretty bad, hitting lows such as dogs (yes, plural) humping a stuffed toy duck or Sandler farting into the face of his boss (Hasselhoff).The movie does a quick 180 halfway through, turning into a tragedy as the remote automatically skips years at a time based on what he previously skipped. Basically, this means that he has spent most of his life on auto-pilot, and we see his life fall apart basically. As a tragedy, it works well, having a couple strong emotional moments near the end as he tries to stop his life from self-destructing.The problem that exists is that Click is possibly the most bipolar movie I have ever seen. The first half is the Sandler brand of immature fart jokes, while the second half is a tragedy that seems perfect for date movies. To find an audience who would appreciate both the tear-jerking drama and the dog-humping humour would be quite a task. The fact that Click could have worked going in either direction adds insult to injury, as we potentially could have had two good movies with distinctly different moods, but the same subject matter. Instead, we have an amalgamation of the two approaches, and it is far too jumbled to be effective.From an acting perspective, Sandler is surprisingly strong, though nothing that would gain him much more respect after turning in good performances in Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish. The rest of the cast is mostly forgettable, aside from a terrifically sleazy David Hasselhoff. Beckinsale is definitely strong, though it is far from career defining work. Even Christopher Walken, one of my personal favourite actors, is wasted, having a couple good lines here and there but more or less floating through the movie.On a side note, the aging is done incredibly well on all characters, considering the movie spans more than twenty years. It isn't hard to mistake Sandler for a sixty year old near the end of the cycle, though the same effect isn't as noticeable on Beckinsale or Astin. Seeing an eighty-year old Henry Winkler proves to be one of the movie's more heartbreaking visuals.There may be some gold hidden deep with Click, a movie that could have easily been much more. As it stands, it is likely to repulse just as much as it attracts. There is no way that a movie can be both a tragedy and have someone fart in David Hasselhoff's face. There was definitely potential for a movie about one of the most common fantasies in life, but few of the possibilities were realized. Maybe in a few years, the concept can be revisited with either a fully comic or fully dramatic attitude, or at least a more subtle blend of the two. The bipolarity of the movie essentially cancels out the audiences, making Click a movie for almost no one.46%",4,3,6,22 July 2006
Sin City," Ten Years Later, We Have Found The Next 'Pulp Fiction'
","Plot: Since Sin City, much like Pulp Fiction, is a combination of three different stories that interconnect in some ways, it seems more fitting to give a score for each story rather than combine them.'Sin City/The Hard Goodbye': 9/10: The first story opens up with street thug Marv (Rourke) making love with Goldie (King), a prostitute whom Marv has become smitten with. When he wakes up in the morning to find Goldie dead and the cops on his tail, Marv is outraged. He escapes the cops and, with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Gugino), he sets out to find Goldie's killer, including a meeting cannibalistic killer Kevin (Wood). Along the way, Goldie's twin sister Wendy (also King), whom is under the impression that Marv killed Goldie, sets out to kill Marv.It's a great set up here, but Marv's strength becomes almost silly. This is basically the only one of the three stories that ever feels like a traditional super-hero type comic book.'The Big Fat Kill': 10/10: My personal favourite of the trio, it focuses on the character of Dwight (Clive Owen), who was briefly seen in Marv's story. While he is with barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy), her former lover Jackie Boy (Del Toro) arrives and forces his way in with his friends. When Dwight threatens Jackie Boy, they leave, but Dwight follows Jackie Boy into Old City, the major prostitute hangout, and warns the prostitutes about him. He finds out that the prostitutes, led by Gail (Dawson), have already taken that initiative and, using the young Becky (Bledel) as bait, their assassin Miho (Aoki) effectively turns Jackie Boy and his friends into Pez dispensers. However, things take a turn for the worse when they find out Jackie Boy is Jack Rafferty, a highly respected cop.This is the best and bloodiest of the three.'That Yellow Bastard': 8/10: This one is the worst of the three, but that does not mean it is by any means bad. In fact, it's opening scene, which is shown right after the opening credits, is better than the opening of any other story. It starts with Hartigan (Willis), apparently the last honest cop in Sin City, going after serial child molester 'Junior' Rourk (Stahl) who has kidnapped 11-year-old Nancy Callahan (played later by Alba). The problem is that Junior's father is Senator Rourk (Booth), who has covered for his son of numerous occasions. Hartigan is determined to bring him down, punching out his partner Bob (Madsen) when he tries to stop him, and eventually saves Nancy and shoots Junior three times, one of the shots castrating him. Then Bob comes along and shoots down Hartigan.After we hear the other two stories, this one is picked up again. It is 8 years later, and Hartigan has been locked up in solitary for the whole period, while Senator Rourk badgers him to sign a confession to Junior's child molestation charges. Hartigan has been receiving letters from Nancy Callahan weekly, and when they stop and a human finger is sent to him, he leaves to make sure she is safe. However, he is followed by Junior, transformed by multiple surgeries into a yellow creature. When he finds Nancy in a strip bar, the two of them leave together to escape from Junior and attempt to clear Hartigan's name.This one had great potential. Seriously. The opening scene shows that. For the most part, it lives up to it. The only real problem is Yellow Bastard. Sure, it makes for a nice visual effect and causes the villain to stand out, but the whole explanation being a side-effect of basically de-castrating him is a little vague.Action: 13/15: Of course, with all this violence, there must be some cool action scenes. And there are some. However, this movie is more about maintaining the feel than giving some good action. Once you look back at it, there aren't many action scenes, but then again, that isn't the main attraction of the movie.Visual Effects: 15/15: Even if you hate the rest of the movie, not a single person can say the visual effects are bad. The movie feels exactly like a comic book, and to go even beyond that, this movie can almost be called art. The black-and-white effect conveys the comic book roots as well as the dark seediness of Sin City, with the splashes of colour calling attention to specific areas, whether it be Yellow Bastard or splashes of blood.Acting: 19/20: The first thing that you notice about the movie, before you see it, is the humongous cast. Needless to say, most of the actors do great in their roles. Granted, Madsen (Reservoir Dogs) doesn't give the best performance of his life the first time we meet him, and Alba isn't necessarily the best choice, acting-wise, for Nancy. However, we are treated with many noteworthy performances.However, two performances stand out above the others. The first and foremost of which is Rourke. Now, Rourke hasn't had a great performance in a long time, but the role of Marv was made for him. He looks tough as nails, and has a true flame of determination in him. The other standout performance is from Del Toro (Traffic), who plays just about the sleaziest cop in Sin City, and really makes you both hate him and want to see more of this character.Entertainment: 16/20: This isn't a movie for everyone. It is very violent, and very dark. However, if you can stand the violence, and if this style appeals to you, than you should not walk out disappointed.Total: 90%: Sin City is basically the most accurate representation of a comic book ever. Kudos to everyone involved for making this movie, and it is now on my checklist to read some Sin City comics and hope for Sin City 2.",9,0,2,6 April 2005
The Ugly Truth," Another summer wasteland romcom
","If Apatow and Meg Ryan movies had a child, it might be The Ugly Truth. Its a cookie-cutter romance filled with lots of cuss words and scatology to make it seem 'edgy'. As much as the actors want there to be more involved with the movie, the bones just aren't there, and after a few early giggles, The Ugly Truth is exposed as a poor effort.The Ugly Truth opens with Heigl's character Abby as a depended-on news producer who's love life is in shambles due to her obsessive need for control (she has a checklist of ten things she expects in a man). This is only made all the more clear when she calls into a male romance show led by the a scruffled Mike Chadway (Butler), who chews her out and calls her fat. Of course, Mike is soon hired by her network as a correspondent to increase ratings. Cue shenanigans.When Abby meets her new 8-packed doctor neighbour (I think he may have extra abs), she falls head over heels and is absolutely clueless how to proceed. Mike finds out and teaches Abby to treat the good doctor as a man, and no one knows men like Mike, who becomes Abby's Mr. Miyagi of men in order to get her to stop complaining about his show.There is some basic truth to what Mike says. Yes, men don't like being controlled. Yes, men don't fall for personality at first sight. However, the movie works in broad strokes, and as such ends up as both male AND female chauvinistic. Mike's a pig and Abby's a bitch. Somehow through each other they get a little closer to the middle.Of course, that's because the genre demands it. The movie follows the flow of rom-coms to a ridiculous extent. There really isn't much original at all going on in this plot. The ending is particularly terrible, the character shifts being far too sudden.The movie has some funny bits at the beginning, with Butler playing the over-the-top pig. Unfortunately, once we get over the fact that there's some particularly nasty cuss words in a rom-com, most of the rest seems pretty stale. A half-hour of mildly-funny does not make up for a very unfunny next hour. Admittedly, there were a few unintentional laughs towards the end.The actors do their best. Heigl is cute and annoying, as she should be, and has a future in these kind of movies. Butler shouldn't be wasting his time, but does what the script demands quite well. Eric Winter seems to be fit enough for the dreamy doc role, even if his face is a little creepy. Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins are the saving grace of the first third as the husband-and-wife co-anchors, but they quickly fall to the background after their time is up.The Ugly Truth is just another entry in the wasteland of summer rom-coms, even if its one that earns an R-rating. No amount of dick jokes can make up for that.",3,5,10,14 January 2010
Shark Tale," Some Funny Mobster Jokes Can't Keep Shark Tale From Going Belly-Up
","Plot: 8/20: Oscar (Smith) feels like a little fish in a big pond. Literally. In the world of the fishes, he is a simple tongue scrubber at the Whale Wash (a car wash for whales). Oscar also happens to be a rapper wannabe, and his best friend Angie (Zellweger) is secretly in love with home, for a reason that remains a mystery to me. Oscar is sick of living at the bottom and wants to live at the top of the reef, where all the 'somebodys' live.The sharks, whom all the other fish are afraid of, are essentially the mafia. The current godfather, Don Lino (deNiro) is soon retiring and leaving control of the reef to his two sons, Frankie (Imperioli) and Lenny (Black). Frankie has the brawn for the job, but Lenny, on the other hand, is afraid to eat anything alive, and has become a vegetarian.Also, Don Lino is cracking down on pufferfish Sykes (Scorsese), who owns the Whale Wash, to pay up for protection. To come up with the money, Sykes cracks down on Oscar to pay the $5000 he owes. Angie lends him the money, but he blows it all on a horse race. When Syke's bodyguards Ernie (Marley) and Bernie (Doug) are torturing Oscar, Frankie is attempting to train Lenny. When he sees Oscar, he tells Lenny to attack. Ernie and Bernie run, but Oscar is tied down. Just so happens that Lenny sets Oscar free instead. When Frankie sees this, he chases Oscar himself, only to be hit by an anchor and killed during the chase. Lenny runs away, and Oscar takes credit for Frankie's death. In doing so, he becomes a phenomenon, the legendary Shark Slayer, and finally lives at the top of the reef.However, when Don Lino finds out about this, he is going to get very angryTechnically, the plot works. It doesn't come with any clever twists or anything really original. It is a nice send-up of mobster movies, though the rap influence is cringe worthy at time. And by 'at times', I mean through 90% of the movie.Not to mention the whole 'Be yourself' message is pretty worn out by now.Comedy: 12/20: Surprisingly, this movie manages to have some funny bits. However, they only occur when it attempts to satire the mobster movies. Aside from the opening sequence and one or two jokes here and there, all of the comedy is derived from the mobster spoofs. Some are subtle, some are more obvious, but this movie does manange to be a rather clever mobster spoof. Most of this may go over the heads of the younger crowd, but it manages to keep the older crowd interested, at least for those parts.However, when it tries to put on its pimp face and do the normal silly crap we despise in animated movies, it falls flat on its ass. There is nothing I hated more than seeing a Martin Scorsese voiced pufferfish wearing a pimp hat and touching his butt and saying 'I'm hott!' It just isn't necessary. It just isn't humane.Animation: 7/20: DreamWorks made Shrek, and Shrek looked pretty good. Then they made this, and while it holds up to old standards, it isn't all that pleasing to look at. The sharks looks good, but some of the fish, namely Oscar, look pretty bad. They manage to make the characters look like the actors playing them, which works well with people, but bringing the concept over to fish doesn't work as well. A mild taint of the actor is fine, but do not try to recreate the actor. Sykes is probably the only fish who looks good, and the technical crew had better luck with the sharks than the fish.There were also some major inconsistencies. Oscar's size grows and shrinks multiple times. Sometimes, he's small enough to fit in anywhere. Sometimes, he's big enough to logically fake taking down a shark. They really needed to fix that problem there.Voice Acting: 13/20: The voice cast has some bright spots. Robert deNiro (Goodfellas) is the obvious choice to spoof many of his old roles, and he does it pretty well. Granted, how hard could it really be? Its voice acting, it doesn't take much talent.Jack Black (Orange County) is the only real standout. He does a great voice for Lenny, and is the only one who doesn't sound like just his real self.The rest are mediocre. Scorsese just embarrasses himself with stupid pimp lines. Smith spews out enough bull that he gets on my nerves. No one else really deserves mentioning.Entertainment: 8/20: If you are in the mood for a gangster spoof, you will find parts of this hilariously entertaining. However, if you are one of these types, chances are the rap influence will just annoy you. Those who enjoy rapper slang will likely not catch the gangster references. It's a vicious cycle.Bonus-.3 for the advertising: We get pumped full of ads for Gap and Coke and, hell, we even get ads for Preparation H. Will it never end! At least it doesn't try to hide it at all and just comes out and says 'These people paid us!' -.3 for rap influence -.5 for the end scene: Just to show that this movie is riding off of Shrek's success, there is a dance sequence at the end. Kill me now.TOTAL: 36%: I could tell that Shark Tale, beneath all the rap influence and bulls*** messages, was a decent gangster spoof. However, to look through all that crap for a couple jokes is just not worth it. Kids will not get the gangster references and basically only enjoy a pufferfish in a pimp hat. Adults will like the gangster references, but will cringe to tears at the rap influence. It is a lose-lose situation.",2,2,5,13 April 2005
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man has Oscar written all over it
","After Million Dollar Baby made it big last year, it was pretty much a given that another boxing-themed movie would be released this year. Exactly what kind of boxing movie was out in the open. So why not take a theme from another successful movie from a couple years ago, combine it with MDB, and throw in a biopic because those are in now. So we now have a boxing biopic set in the great depression. As much as it may seem like just a combination of some other themes that worked recently, Cinderella Man works extremely well on its own even when compared to everything else like it.The subject of Cinderella Man is boxer Jimmy Braddock (Crowe), who was working his way to the top undefeated before the Great Depression came and took away everything he had, leaving him and his wife Mae (Zellweger) struggling to make enough money to feed their three children. Braddock is working at the docks, but there is little need for men, so he often does not get shifts. Occasionally he gets an offer for a fight from his longtime manager Joe Gould (Giamatti), but his former reputation no longer exists and he performs abysmally. After one particularly bad fight against a low-level boxer, where he manages to break his hand for a third time, boxing promoter Jimmy Johnston (McGill) strips him of his licence, leaving Braddock with a broken hand and little work at the docks.After some time, Gould contacts Braddock about having him replace a fighter who dropped out of a match against the #2 title contender, Corn Griffin. Braddock agrees due to the high payout win-or-lose, and ends up beating Griffin in the ring, spurring the resurgence of his boxing career, as well as his wife's fears for his life. These fear are much enlarged when Braddock finds himself in a fight with Max Baer (Bierko), the world champion who has killed two men in the ring.There is also some sidestories that deal directly with the depression, most notably one involving fellow dock worker Mike Wilson (Considine), though these tend to disappear once Braddock's boxing career starts up again. This is a blessing for the movie, as any more depression stories once it kicks into high gear would ruin the flow, though they are often very moving in the first half.The plot moves along at a surprisingly quick pace. Most of the time in movies like this, the story tends to linger on some elements for far longer than it should. That never happens here, and while it does run at a solid 2:15, it has enough plot to fill a three hour movie under normal circumstances. This makes Cinderella Man a much more re-watchable movie than others like it.The first half of the movie is definitely there to give you an understanding of Braddock and the times he lives in, but the movie gets really good once the boxing action starts up. The fights are extraordinary after the Griffin match, with perfect direction throughout them all. The slowdowns at times of specific pain for Braddock are well used and only pop up when the scar is going to become a plot piece for later on (such as his broken hand). The rounds go by fairly quickly, but always are long enough to get you involved in every fight. The one involving Art Lasky is particularly good, as is the final bout with Baer. The only problem here is that there are only four notable fights, but any more would make the movie inaccurate, so these four fights are made exceptionally well.The acting is also incredible on all fronts. Russell Crowe turns in his fourth Oscar worthy performance in a row, after Master & Commander, A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator, this one ranking right up near the top. Renee Zellweger, who is not normally one of my favourite actresses, also brings in a surprisingly powerful performance as the torn wife who knows they need the money but can't stand to see her husband in the ring. Then there is Paul Giamatti, who was unrightfully denied an Oscar nomination for last year's Sideways. While he doesn't have quite as much to work with this time around, he proves himself incredibly worthy and definitely deserves serious consideration. Also worth noting are Bruce McGill as a boxing promoter and Craig Bierko as a deliciously antagonistic rival.Usually in a review, the critic has something bad to say about the movie. Oddly enough, I cannot think of any criticisms for Cinderella Man. Sure, maybe it could have been a little more, but from what is delivered is flawless, being Ron Howard's best movie in ages and turning in some great performances from Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti. This movie has Oscar written all over it, and if you call yourself a lover of movies you are obligated to see this one.Overall Score  96%",8,0,1,18 December 2005
Up in the Air," The most relevant movie of the year
","For such a new director, Jason Reitman certainly had the string of hits. Starting with corporate-sleazeball-with-a-heart gem Thank You for Smoking, and continuing with Oscar-nominated hipster fuel Juno, his third film, Up in the Air certainly had a lot to live up to. While skewing more towards his first film than his more popular second, Up in the Air is still a moving, funny and, most impressively, relevant drama.The film focuses on Ryan Bingam, a man whose job it is to fly around the country firing people. Ostensibly, he helps them find new jobs (relocation services), but for the most part, its to help supervisors too cowardly to fire their own employees. Due to his job, he lives in airports, spending at least 300 days of the year in the air. He's saving up for record-high air miles, he has gold cards to all major hotels and car rental services. He gives motivational talks on how baggage such as family, friends and any commitments in general.Of course, whenever we are introduced to a character like this, we immediately know that something or someone will change him over the course of the film. In this case, there are two. The first is Alex, a woman Ryan meets in a hotel bar and proceeds to wildly forrnicate with. Like him, she spends much of her time in the air. She has gold cards, texts dirty and refers to herself as Ryan, 'but with a vagina'.The second is Natalie Keener, a new and fresh employee at Ryan's company. She has the bright idea of cutting air travel costs by doing all firings over webcam, which Ryan opposes due both to concerns of the quality of job decreasing plus (mainly) how it would ruin his lifestyle. To show her the ropes, Natalie is forced to shadow Ryan on his trips in order to learn the ropes, during which time she learns the harsh reality and Ryan learns the follies of his ways.It sounds cliché, I know, but honestly it goes in some unexpected directions. I highly doubt anyone would have expected the ending to be the way it is based solely on trailers. It does stretch a bit at the end, and perhaps is a bit too vague in the ending, but it usually has a good pace to it and is overall quite clever, and often funny.The movie also happens to be incredibly relevant given the current economy, as a major focus is the moral decay inherent in making a living taking away the jobs of others. The fired employees are all played realistically (even Zach Galifinakis) and never too over the top. JK Simmons in a cameo is particularly effective. The little documentary-style compilation at the end is a bit much, but this may be the movie to sum up the year 2009 perfectly.The cast is by all means excellent. Clooney plays Ryan as very confident and self-centered, yet rarely does he come across as selfish. Its the kind of role Clooney specialises in, and he's damn good at it. Farmiga basically plays a female Clooney, and manages to keep up with him somehow. Jason Bateman is unfortunately underused as Ryan's lazy boss. The true standout is Anna Kendrick as the naive Natalie who, despite an annoying crying scene, steals the show.Up in the Air is by all means an excellent film and one of the most relevant of the year. In ten years, if someone asks me for one movie to sum up 2009, this will be that film. Maybe not the hipster breed some Juno fans might expect, but for a trip into the lives of the busy, look no further.",8,1,3,13 January 2010
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Ricky Bobby delivers the laughs with more efficiency and speed than Anchorman
","Is stupid always a bad thing? Not really. Just look at some movies like Billy Madison and Dumb and Dumber. By normal standards, those movies would be horrible, but they manage to be funny enough to become must-haves. Then there are the clever stupid movies, like Airplane and The Naked Gun, which are actually recognized by bigwig critics as classics. However, stupid usually is a bad thing. Plenty of dumb movies fall short, relying on terrible sight gags and offensive material to try to squeeze out a laugh. One of the more recent entries into the category of bad stupid movie is Anchorman, which surprisingly many critics liked. Well, I pretty much hated Anchorman, with Steve Carell being the saving grace. So, despite my misgivings for Anchorman, I went ahead and saw it's spiritual sequel, Talladega Nights. While it does have it's fair share of dead moments, Talladega is a much better movie than it's predecessor and guaranteed to be at least good for a laugh.The plot of Talladega is much like you would expect from a movie co-written by Will Ferrell. It's simple and stupid, but does have some foundation. In fact, this movie actually does have a plot that is passable. It follows the life of Ricky Bobby (Ferrell), a pit crew member who gets to fill the shoes of his team's racer after he quits midrace. After catching up spectacularly and placing third, he is noticed by many corporate sponsors and becomes the NASCAR champ overnight. He marries racing bimbo Carley (Bibb), manages to get his best friend Cal (Reilly) as his sidekick driver and makes millions upon millions of dollars. After his career has hit a peak, he is challenged by French Formula One champion Jean Girard (Cohen) and ends up in a horrible wreck during the race which leaves him traumatized and afraid of speed. The rest of the movie is basically about the downward spiral his life runs and how his estranged father (Cole) returns to give Ricky his balls back.Like Ron Burgundy in Anchorman, Ricky Bobby is a completely self-obsessed asshole who allows his kids to threaten the elderly and takes his friendship with Cal for granted. Unlike Burgundy, Ricky actually has a turning point, and that alone makes Talladega a better movie. While in Anchorman, Burgundy was always a total dick, Ricky Bobby actually manages to garner some sympathy, even if he is a little stupid, which actually gives the plot some substance, albeit very little. In short, it makes the movie easier to watch for those who appreciate something to string together the laughs.Oh, and the laughs are plenty. While there are definitely some bits that flounder, such as basically any scene with Girard, there are plenty of chuckles and a solid amount of big laughs. The movie is definitely at its best when things are hectic, such as when Ricky stabs himself in the leg and his crew chief (Duncan) tries to use another knife to pry it out or the incredible sequence where Ricky re-trains with his father. The conversations in the movie are also so outlandish that they are hilarious, most notably one conversation debating whether or not to pray to Baby Jesus or the grown up one with a beard. There may not be something for everyone, but if you laughed at any time during the trailers, you're bound to find something enjoyable in Talladega.The ensemble cast in the movie is pretty amazing. Will Ferrell is, as always, a lovable dumbass. No one can do blind panic humour like Will Ferrell, nor can anyone be so believably dumb. The supporting cast is full of Oscar-calibre actors such as John C. Reilly, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan, as well as comedy standbys Molly Shannon, Gary Cole and Sacha Baron Cohen (better known as Ali G). Reilly is easily the standout from the supporting cast, stealing every scene he is in as Ferrell's even dumber sidekick. Gary Cole also turns in a hilarious performance as Ferrell's estranged father, especially during the training scenes. Duncan is also great, but he doesn't seem to have enough material to work with (though he does have one of the better outtakes at the end of the film). The only disappointment is Cohen as Girard. Sure, Cohen is game and plays the part well, but his scenes get a little dull and repetitive after a while.As a side note, this movie is easily the most advertisement raped movie since The Island, and possibly even moreso. Granted, the film uses the ads as comedy for the most part, such as how Ricky Bobby is contractually obligated to mention PowerAde at each meal's grace, but it does seem excessive. At one point, a commercial for Applebee's is played in the middle of a crash sequence. Since it is NASCAR, most of it is making fun of the blatant advertising present (especially in one sequence where Ricky stars in a slew of commercials, the best being 'If you don't chew Big Red then f*** you!'), it still is a little too much.All that Ricky Bobby ever wanted to do was to go fast. Well, this movie is definitely fast with delivery of gags that are much more hit than miss. Sure, the movie isn't without it's problems, but it is funny enough to make up for any missteps it takes, with a great cast to back it up. If you liked Anchorman, then you'll love Talladega. If you didn't like Anchorman, still give this one a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised.86%",8,0,3,17 August 2006
