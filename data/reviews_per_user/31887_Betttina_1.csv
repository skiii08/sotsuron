Catch Me If You Can," Fun and Funny
","I have to be honest - I only wanted to see this movie because I adore Jennifer Garner.  Her scenes alone were definitely worth the cost of admission, but the rest of the film far outdid my expectations.  Spielberg did a fantastic job directing; DiCaprio was amazing as all of Frank's aliases; and Hanks' accent was simply outstanding.  I was prepared to write this review and praise only Garner, but this entire film impressed me very much.",Null,0,0,29 December 2002
