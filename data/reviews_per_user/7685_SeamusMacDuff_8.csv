10 Cloverfield Lane," Horror with a Twist - And a Drop
","A girl in a car accident awakens to find she's in an underground bunker with an oddball farmer and an average Joe with a broken arm. The farmer insists some outside calamity* (nuclear war, aliens?) has occurred, so he's keeping her safe with him. Until when, no one knows.The next part is a taut, claustrophobic thriller as the two 'guests' try to figure out if Howard is making it all up or is just crazy.** They find some clues about his daughter and the outside world, where a ravaged woman shows up at their door to die.Their plans for an escape go awry, revealing that Howard is indeed crazy. She escapes, killing Howard, to find the air isn't poisoned.As another commenter noted, this would be a good ending point. But then the twist: there was an alien invasion **So it was both! And they come after the girl. Suddenly this rather normal person turns into MacGyver, downing an alien/ship with a homemade Molotov. (Note: Scotch doesn't quite cut it here. And where'd the beast on the ground go?) She then learns about the resistance on the radio and turns to join them.*Major nit: After whatever calamity Howard says may have occurred, wouldn't you want more info? Howard's bunker doesn't have so much as a radio. Okay, maybe he has reasons to keep things secret - even if he's right about aliens (because he is crazy and wants a 'family') with him. But the other two never ask a single question about this. 'What is the radio saying? TV? Cable? Landline? Cell? Internet?' Maybe some are down, but to never ask about any??",7,0,0,16 March 2017
12 Monkeys," As If Made by Monkeys
","When a film features time travel or mental illness - two things where almost anything can happen - you need a tight plot and some careful editing to keep the viewer truly engaged. Trying to figure out the plot's mystery and trying to figure out WTH is going on are two different things. Terry Gllliam is doing what he does, but only fans attuned to his ways will 'get' this film.Plot is semi-Terminator: someone is sent back from the future to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Well, not prevent, but just cure things after 99% of the population is dead. Why they aren't trying to stop the virus from happening instead of curing it later is never explained? (Do the bizarre future rulers just want to reign?) Nor is it explained why a convict is sent. 'Because he can remember things?' Pfft.Willis sleepwalks through the role. How Madelaine Stowe (90s hubba hubba) ends up falling for this sociopathic, filthy, mental defect is another bizarre angle. It gets real hard at times to put up with Brad Pitt's manic maniac act. Very grating on the nerves.Better to watch the Marx Brothers 'Monkey Business', which is part of this film. Their tomfoolery made more sense.",3,2,5,31 March 2019
The Love Guru," Bad, Truly Bad
","This film is as bad as the other reviews make it. Mike Myers is merely indulging himself as he tries to make another Austin Powers franchise. Don't worry - not happening!Constant mugging, lame plot, lack of jokes, repetition upon repetition (unfunny pun names, 'Mariska Hargitay', pulling out books, etc.)The real problem may be the casting:Myers - Painful without the right support and doesn't get it. Alba - Beautiful - and 1-D acting. Cast as hockey team owner??? Troyer - Midget hockey coach??? A black hockey star - Riiiiight. Ben Kingsley - Embarrassing.",1,10,20,6 September 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Unrequired Epic
","I am a longtime Tolkien fan who likely read most of his works before most of the posters here were born. Peter Jackson did an absolutely superb job bringing LOTR to the screen, due in large part to sticking very closely to Tolkien's work. (Okay, Arwen got inserted to provide a love interest, but she replaced Glorfindel in part.) And while LOTR may be both my favorite novel and film, I wouldn't say I'm a Jackson/Tolkien fanboy as many here appear to be with their 10 of 10 scores.Given the success of LOTR by sticking to the story, I was nervous when I heard The Hobbit would also be a trilogy. Show me the money! The Hobbit is shorter than any of the 3 LOTR volumes. More importantly, it's told in an entirely different way. The Hobbit is a fairy tale, told breezily with large sections of narration. Its dwarfs are largely comical. LOTR though is an epic, deep in setting, detail, and dialogue. Still, because of the breeziness (e.g. important events are covered in a few pages, the narrator intentionally skipping forward intentionally in some places) I had hopes that Jackson's understanding of Tolkien would compensate.Did he? I must say, a mixed bag there. Certainly borrowing the settings, cinematography, tone, music, etc. from LOTR helped. Freeman's Bilbo matches Tolkien's pretty well, a simple fellow thrown into an adventure. The initial scene with the history of Smaug was a good way to give context to what follows. Whenever Jackson is sticking with Tolkien, things are great such as Gollum's scene.When Jackson is on his own though, the film drags. Jackson had to mine every reference and back story for additional screen time. It's safe to say than when a character not in the book is on screen, something ain't right. Radagast, Galadriel, Saruman, and CGI Azog add little. Moreover, the battle scenes are excessive in the extreme. In the book, there as no fight with the trolls nor with orcs approaching Rivendell. The 'main' fight with the Great Goblin was over pretty quickly, with the dwarfs needing to flee rather than fight. That all 14 continuously and miraculously escape unharmed from multiple situations drains all the drama. (Just the fall into Goblintown should have killed them all.) But Jackson has to have his CGI/video game fun, even though this too is filler.All in all, The Hobbit is not a bad film. Go see it. But it would have been better had Jackson told the tale it in just two films, sticking to Tolkien and thus the success formula for LOTR.",7,8,19,22 December 2012
1917," Gripping and Enthralling
","This film pulls you in and doesn't let go. You'll experience everything of the horror of trench warfare in WWI. Last time you felt this immersed was 'Saving Private Ryan'. Beautifully filmed, well acted, with as basic a plot as could be: get through enemy territory quickly or a lot of men will die.The POV perspective throughout can be a bit unnerving, but also helps pull you in. Same for the extended shot takes. You'll feel you're along for the ride. One to see over again.Only thing that cost it a 10 were some 'Huh?' moments. If the mission is so critical, why send only two men? A squad can move just as quickly - they're walking after all - with more chance of success. We see airplanes throughout. Why not have them fly over and drop the orders? The plane crash was unbelievable; one plane, into the one building around and on top of the men?? The killing then was not at all the way at the time, when there was still a sense of chivalry - as evidenced by them saving the pilot - particularly among pilots.",8,0,2,24 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Some Many Problems...
","1. Poe: Prank call to the Huks; childish. Then a single fighter - one fighter - manages to get through and cause major damage to this 'dreadnaught'. Later, just one bomber destroys the indestructible ship by 'dropping' bombs in zero gravity. Riiiight. Poe mutinies, and is undone. All is forgiven because, well, he's a major character. Oh, and BB8 can do anything. Anything!
2. Huks acts like the befuddled owner of Moe's Bar rather than the commander of a fleet. His military abilities are nil. Only after Poe attacks does the fleet launch their own fighters? They aren't ready to attack the moment they come out of light speed? For the final battle, rebels line up in a trench in front of the door - so he lines up as well as interminable time is taken to drag the cannon into place? He has air dominance then - but not a single fighter strafes the trench? 
3. Rey - Who is she? No one. But she has some Jedi mind-link to Kylo. She can do anything without any training, well because. The trip to the dark hole with the infinity mirror served absolutely no purpose.
4. Luke Skywalker has been reduced to shambling hermit. He's grumpy and uninteresting. ('You kids get off my island.') Light saber tossed, alien walrus milked, cuty porgs introduced for marketing. How did the hologram actually fight Kylo, sword to sword? Hamill hasn't acted in some time, and it showed.
5. Yoda - Why?
6. The slow motion, film-filling chase scene was ridiculous. 'Their ships are too quick.' Again?! No one thought to make a very quick jump to light speed to get ahead of the rebels. But it gives the rebels time to cook up a Rube Goldberb plan introduced by a gratuitous Moz cameo. Break away from this chase to go to a casino planet to find a nameless codebreaker - gratuitous Del Toro - to bring back to sneak on the ship to save the day? That it didn't should have been expected.
7. The casino planet was totally unneeded. The nameless breaker (a 1% arms dealer) is identified, but while they can't get to him they happen to be locked up with an even better choice, the grauitously cast Benicio Del Toro. He pops them out and solved their problems with the help of some indestructible riding beasts. Except he didn't and made things worse for he rebels. (With all those arms dealers, why haven't the X-wing and Tie fighters been upgraded in 30 years?)
8. Finn and Rose serve no purpose - except for diversity points! Speaking of, note that the First Order is all white and nearly all male but the rebels are so diverse (including aliens) to defy all logic. The two can operate any equipment available, and survive two major crashes with no explosions. That the giant door was open just long enough for them to fly in with no one expecting them was ridiculous. Was there supposed to be some romantic chemistry here? Nope, everyone loves each other like siblings.
9. Leia - She gets blasted into space but flies back and is her (very) old self in no time. Meanwhile, gratuitously cast admiral Laura Dern shows up in a gown with a neck like a crepe column to lead things. Diversity, with Poe giving the qualifying observation. She has a plan but won't tell anyone. That's leadership! Later her plan is revealed but 'someone has to stay behind.'. Why? Surely these ships cannot be run by a single person. Oh, that's right so she can do something dramatic and unexpected. If running a ship at light speed is as devastating as shown, you'd think light-speed based impact weapons would exist.
10. Phasma - How did she survive? Who cares? She came back just to get snuffed by underling Finn. So glad we got to see her one eye.
11. All the transports run to a convenient old Rebel base that's somehow safe. Nearly every ship gets picked off before they get there. Great plan.
12. Snoke - Who is he? How did he accomplish all that he did? No answers, just a you-see-it-coming death after delivering the typical villain speech.",2,1,3,27 December 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Jackson and The Acorn
","The other reviews here are totally on point about how Jackson deviated from Tolkien's beautiful, charming story of a hobbit in creating a bloviated trilogy epic to mirror Lord of the Rings. (Where Jackson was superb.) In doing so, he created and brought in unnecessary characters, added banal dialog, inserted a stilted love story, and kept the CGI battles - single and mass - going on so long that viewer fatigue sets in. He forgot that Bilbo is the main character. And even with all the filler, many questions and elements of the ending in the book went unresolved.There is a touching scene (in a movie with few) where Bilbo shows Thorin an acorn he brought from Beorn's garden to plant in his own in the Shire. At the end, Thorin tells Bilbo that the simple, warm things like home and hearth are worth more than all the gold in the world.Would that Jackson had remembered this in directing The Hobbit.",3,8,18,29 December 2014
Life," Some Scary Stuff, but Illogic and 'Twist'
","An homage to 'Alien', where a crew in space find themselves threatened by a creature from another world. The effects are dazzling, as the crew is in zero gravity the entire time floating and shooting themselves around the space station. There are some good points about scientific hubris and some scary moments as 'Calvin' evolves from a single cell to a jelly/starfish to a full on floating, slithering killer.However, there are numerous plot holes including how their entire triple-quarantine system fails. When Calvin escapes the lab by squeezing into a tiny fire control vent, he should be trapped in that closed system. BTW, the flamethrower was out of fuel so how did it trigger the sprinklers? When the Soyuz comes to push them into space, there should have been no way the crew member could have opened their hatch; they had to expect that maybe someone wouldn't want to go into oblivion. Calvin's indestructibility was another. (He's carbon based and needs oxygen, but can survive in space? He hibernated on Mars and in the lab.] Finally, the twist end - that you can see coming - was really more of a cheat. Both escapees were pretty calm if their respective missions weren't working. I was hoping for a double-twist, 'War of the Worlds' ending where Calvin jumped into the sea and dissolved in the salt water.",6,3,6,26 March 2017
