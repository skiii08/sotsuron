Hereditary," The New Exorcist?
","Speaking about things being hereditary, the reviews on the poster must have been passed down from the family of the movie-makers, because this movie was very much on the rubbish side of life as well as death. What looked like shaping up to be a slow moving yet interesting build towards a tense scary ending proved to be a slow road to nowhere.Well, actually, the movie did actually go somewhere, just to a load of silliness.Granny dies and the family who didn't really like her are grieving yet not grieving because granny was apparently a cantankerous, controlling and bossy woman and all those bad things grannies can be.She clearly had a plan for her grandchildren who are couple of the most troubled children you could hope to come across. Her daughter, Toni Colette, seems just as screwed up in her own way and the only person that appears to have any sense is Keyser Söze who is not 
Keyser Söze, Gabriel Byrne, trying to gather whilst being surrounded by a bunch of crazies in his family.The grieving mother stumbles across a way to contact the dead through a person who is dubiously mysterious to her from the past, which makes no sense to me, and from there on in things just go from bad to worse. For her as well as the paying public.'This generation's Exorcist'? I don't think so. Because when bodies in that movie started doing creepy, horrific and virtually impossible things, it was properly scary. In this movie, it all just turns out to be laughable.'Deserves to be treated with the same respect we have for The Exorcist, The Shining and Psycho'? Not on your Nellie. Whoever wrote that review needs to have a Toffee Crisp and never write a movie review ever again.'Dazed and Confused' it seems. They must've been when they watched this.Certainly not one I would be passing down my family tree as a film to go and watch.",3,3,6,21 June 2018
Darkest Hour," Go Gary!
","Of course it was a magnificent performance from the always great Gary Oldman. I think we always knew it was going to be the case. From the trailers and from a long history of fine performances from the man.It was easy to forget it was actually him with all the blubber around his jowls, taking on the doubters all around him as he tries desperately to find a way to lift the mood of the nation with the mighty German army about to push the last of the British troops into the sea on the northern coast of France.It was almost a behind-the-scenes sequel to the movie Dunkirk as we work towards the civilian fleet sailing off across The Channel to pick up the stranded soldiers.And thanks for the help America!They certainly build the mood nicely as we feel the pressure mounting on Mr Winston, who has to make some pretty tough decisions with a war cabinet pressing for a peace deal with Hitler.'YOU CANNOT REASON WITH A TIGER WHEN YOUR HEAD IS IN ITS MOUTH!', he screams at Chamberlain and Halifax.Given my knowledge of the big cat family, I'm not sure you can reason with a tiger at any time actually. But then again, maybe with a nice juicy steak. Hitler of course was a famous vegetarian, so I don't think a 12oz ribeye would do the trick.Of course there were some fine performances from the supporting cast too. Ducky from Four Weddings was superb in her part as Mrs Churchill, as well as Aussie Ben Mendelson in his role as the King.I do have to wonder if anybody in the 1940's could actually pronounce their R's properly. Or should I say 'pwoperly'. Many of the characters seemed to suffer from this.It was also interesting to see the internal anguish that Winston was going through after being thrown in at the deep end. Because of course, we all know how it all turned out so it's easy to forget just how hard those tough decisions of sending men to certain death must have been for a man trying to save a nation.But thanks to a scene with Winston talking to the the real people on the ground, or rather Underground, it was made clear that the British people would rather die than bow down to fascists. Upon looking up whether this situation actually took place, it appears it didn't, but rather was put in for dramatic effect. However, it very well could have in a different way given Mr Churchill's tendency to go missing on occasion and apparently often to go talking to your every day person on the street. Either way, it was a fantastic scene that summed up the resolve of the British people at a very dark time.Mr Oldman must surely be up for an award, if not the top award for his portrayal of the man who refused to bow down to tyranny marching its way across Europe.",8,1,2,22 June 2018
Deadpool 2," Dead Good
","I really wish the golden arches of McDonald's weren't looming just across the road from the Cineworld in Brighton. Very tempting. Not healthy. Very tasty though.Deadpool 2 is pretty tasty too.It starts pretty much in the same vein and with a similar feel as its predecessor which in my humble, is both good and bad. Well, not really bad, but being R-rated, with swearing, people being turned into shish kebabs and breakings of the 4th wall and meta references, the first Deadpool movie was a very original breath of fresh air to the huge superhero genre.Especially with all that DC crap trying to challenging and ultimately failing to rival Marvel Studios' success.So sadly, we can't have that same breath of fresh air in the sequel but for me, the latter part of the movie really picks things up. There's one part in particular that takes a similar scene from the original but makes it way more hilarious. And from that point, we are properly off and running.We are also treated to some nice surprises, bits of character development and story arcs therein and a surprise Marvel fan favourite villain that is foreshadowed for much of the movie.A character, like Deadpool himself, who was done a grave injustice in a previous X-Men universe movie, but who gets an excellent redemption in this movie and I'm sure we will be getting to see more of them in the third outing which I am sure is very much on the table.Deadpool 2 is still laugh out loud funny with a great story and superb addition to the franchise.",8,1,2,21 June 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Welcome Home
","I believe here we have the best one yet.In 2002 the big Spider-Man movie raised the bar for superhero movies and in 2004, the exceptional Spider-Man 2 raised it again.Here in 2017, Spider-Man: Homecoming tops both.The second not by much, because let's face it, Spidey 2 is up there with the best, but Tom Holland's Peter Parker fits perfectly into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Very much needed after the very disappointing Spider-Man 3 and the very average Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2.Thankfully Marvel Studios managed to do a deal with Sony to be able to use their biggest character on the big screen and again have done a fantastic job of making it more about the person than the superhero. That young person who despite having gained awesome powers, hasn't quite got used to his new-found abilities yet and is constantly making bumbling silly mistakes.Hence the reason he needs 'Happy Hogan' looking after him and Tony Stark guiding and feeling responsible for him.And of course, they have Michael Keaton. A veritable coup by Marvel, securing the services of the Oscar-nominated Birdman and former Batman to play the suitably armoured flying monster guy, the Vulture. A great villain helps in making a great movie, as we all know very well.He started in DC's psychologically-disturbed non-superpowered Batman and ends up in the super-fun amazingly-powered Spider-Man. Good progression, I say.So, anyway, off he and his henchmen go, plundering away at and developing old Avengers battle alien technology and making a mint in the process. Hovering under the radar of the big guns and the authorities until the meddling kid in red and blue tights stumbles across their nefarious behaviour and sets about putting a stop to their criminal activities in an attempt to prove himself to his mentor and become an Avenger.You can also expect a couple of nice references to scenes from the comics, some interesting revelations and a surprising little twist along the way. Marvel always has a fantastic way of making you think you might have seen too much in the trailers when in fact, you haven't. At all.There are plenty of lovely healthy relationships built up between Peter and his high school peers and of course his (very sexy) Aunt May, with lots of trademark Marvel gags and laughs along the way in this coming-of-age movie, as Peter - with the help of a technologically-advanced spidey suit - learns and develops into yes, the greatest superhero of all time.Yep, I said it. Again.All we can hope long-term is that Sony pictures - who still own the movie rights to the Wall-Crawler - don't trample on what Marvel Studios' have done in a very much well-worked and welcome second reboot of the Spider-Man movie story.Nothing to fault here because finally, we have a truly amazing Spider-Man done right, that whilst being a superb movie in it's own right has set up what should certainly be a brilliant sequel.",9,0,1,21 June 2018
Justice League," Back on Track
","Well get me some Kryptonite!DC might actually be back on track.Man of Steel wasn't quite as bad as people said, but still not really good, Batman v Superman was an overly-long incoherent mess, Suicide Squad was simply awful, Wonder Woman was good but overrated, and Justice League...Was actually pretty good!We actually do get a coherent plot here that actually makes sense and ties together quite nicely. The antagonist, Steppenwolf, a pretty powerful sinister villain causes all sorts of problems for all the superpowered heroes around him.And of course, there are no spoilers to be had in DC's worst kept open obvious secret that Superman was always going to return. And when he does it's handled very well indeed.DC still has a lot of work to do and some ground to make up to catch up to Marvel Studios, who I think are probably too far ahead and possibly out of sight, but for me, this was the best movie in the DCEU so far.",7,2,2,23 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," To Infinity And Beyond
","Marvel Studios has over the years come under criticism for its lack of great villains in their movies. I'm not sure I totally agree with that assessment as I always thought Loki was pretty good, and Michael Keaton's Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming I really liked, I have to say. The Winter Soldier was another great one I reckon, as was the Red Skull. But I guess I can see where people are coming from with regards to some.Thanos however, more than makes up for any villainous shortcomings in the MCU. He wields awesome power with his nefarious intentions, but Marvel also manage to give him an incredible depth and intriguing method to his madness in this latest confluence of superheroes from all over the universe.We've known Thanos has been coming big time for a number of movies now and in this latest blockbuster he arrives with a bang. Or maybe more with a click of the fingers. Anybody who knows anything about the mad Titan and his skullduggerous designs on the universe in the comic books knows that that is pretty much all he has to do to achieve massive genocide on a galactic scale once he gets all six of the Infinity Gems in his gauntlet.Can Earth's Mightiest Heroes the Avengers, as well as a number of others and Galaxy Guardians stop him?Well, like many others over the record-breaking opening weekend, you will have to go and see the movie to find out. Of course, the movie technically comes in two parts even though the second instalment is not going to be 'Infinity War part two' as originally announced, but rather named something else. A title that was apparently held back because it might have spoiled certain aspects of this movie.It's never going to be easy incorporating so many different characters into one film - many of which who are pretty big in the comic book and movie world already - but following previous success with The Winter Soldier and Civil War, the Russo brothers pull this off again to great effect.This movie does jump around the universe a lot from scene-to-scene, but has a very interesting ending indeed. And for god's sake, unlike many others who still appear to not have cracked the code yet, make sure you stay for the post-credits scene. Because if you know anything about any of the characters in the spacey world of (Captain) Marvel, the next couple of movies in the on-going saga are going to be a real treat.Make mine Marvel!",9,1,7,21 June 2018
Black Panther," Black To Their Best
","A Marvel-ous juxtaposition of colourful African tradition & dress and space-age technology, thanks to a vibranium meteor crashing into central Africa thousands of years ago.We also get some lashings of black history and moral tales therein as T'Challa struggles with his new position of ruler of the mysterious country of Wakanda following the death of his father T'Chaka in the terrorist blast in Vienna as seen in Captain America: Civil War.It also turns out that his Royal predecessors also appeared very stuck in their ways with regards to how they dealt with the local tribes and the outside world all around them, which the new ruler wants to see changed. There is after all, so much more the wealthy can do for the less fortunate. Even if it does mean revealing your secret mountain of vibranium.The newly appointed modern king also has to confront a secret that his father and a good friend kept from him. This leads to a rather unsavoury assault and challenge to his throne.And along the way, we don't just get the odd touch of dealing with a few race issues, feminism gets a good look-in as well given the extremely bad-ass female Wakandan army headed up by General Okoye. Proper not-to-be-messed-with she is, I can tell you.Throw in princess Shuri, sister to T'Challa, who is a funny James Bond 'M'-esque character who invents, builds and supplies weapons and super suits for her brother and we are well on the way to a quite relevant Marvel movie, that is full of action and fun.And we must not forget Andy Serkis who is as amusing as he is menacing as the illegal and ironically-named arms dealer baddie, Ulysses Klaue.Black Panther quite up there with the best of the Marvel Studios movies to date, but one that remains solid throughout and pushes the franchise not just forward but in a slightly different direction.Roll on Infinity War and Captain Marvel that's what I say!Make mine Marvel! And Infinity.",8,1,2,22 June 2018
