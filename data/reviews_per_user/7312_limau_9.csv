Alien 3," Ruined the Alien series
","If this is just another Sci-Fi flick I'd probably find it acceptable, but wouldn't think it as anything special. But it isn't, it is the third of the Alien series, and as such, it is absolutely dreadful as it ruined what could have been the greatest series of Sci-Fi films of all time.Plotwise it is pencil thin, another person more imaginative might place the action on Earth with the aliens creating havoc, or a planet discovered to be the source of the aliens. The possibilities are endless, but what have we got instead? A woebegone prison on a misbegotten planet full of refugees from other films. There is nothing new or interesting about this film, just a lot of regurgitated stuff from earlier Alien films and filled with dreary characters. Worse that Ripley was killed off so you can't have anything but the turgid Resurrection. If the director wanted to make a statement or do a prison drama, he should really have done it with another films and not ruin this great series.Absolutely unforgivable!",2,403,431,1 May 2006
Fight Club," Great ending, everything else quite dire
","I find this film hard to watch, not because of the violence, but rather I don't really care about the characters to want to keep my eyes on the screen and found myself looking at something else more interesting half the time. All I can think of when I do watch is - 'Why?'.Of course it became clear why towards the end. And it is also clear to me that the film relies on the boys' fascination with violence to keep the film going until the ending when you can see what is happening, at which point it actually got quite thrilling. Otherwise there isn't really anything that is very interesting, just a middle class boys' fantasy of a more exciting existence while living their own very comfortable but dull lives. It's for boys who get stuck in this contradictory existence - hating the good life they have, wanting to destroy it but in truth will never give up their comfortable lifestyle. It's as stupid and as childish as the insertion of naughty bits into the film.It is for the ending that it got higher vote that it did, nothing much else to recommend it otherwise.",5,0,3,2 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," An observation
","It is perhaps in the nature of IMDb that even the best movie is likely to be given poor reviews and very low votes by some. I have seen that for many good films, but for Brokeback Mountain, a film which is critically acclaimed and widely lauded, this effect is particularly striking. It is often useful to look at the hostile as well as the favourable reviews in order to get a more rounded view of the film, but in the case of Brokeback Mountain, it is worth looking more closely at the hostile ones to see what is happening. The bad reviews generally are of the two following types - 1) Complaints that the movie is too slow and boring, not enough characterisation of the main or minor characters, too few words spoken, etc. It is perhaps unfortunate that 'slow and boring' is always the criticisms that any thoughtful movie is likely to attract, some people simply won't make any effort to understand a movie that doesn't have constant action or flashy cgi. They may also expect everything to be explicit spelt out so they don't need to work out what is happening by themselves. Brokeback Mountain is therefore unsatisfactory for them, it being largely about the private emotional lives of the protagonists, much of which is left unspoken. However, for those who are more thoughtful, they will find a beautiful story, simple yet complex, sparsely told yet highly emotional in its effect.2) People who haven't seen the movie but nevertheless will insist on pronouncing on its (or rather lack of) worthiness. Some of them even pretended to have seen it, but the errors in their reviews showed that all they did was to read other similarly ignorant reviews. Some probably even pretended to be what they are not - a couple of gay cowboys turned up one immediately after another to trash the film (one of these self-described gay cowboy even derided it as gay propaganda with little coherent explanation why it is so), how likely is that? These reviews are often stupid and dishonest, they don't make the slightly sense to anyone who had actually seen and understood the film. Some of these people will say that the film is 'average' or 'OK', but then it give a 1 out of 10? Do they understand what 'average' means? Brokeback Mountain is by no means the perfect film, there are parts which I find unsatisfactory, either I find these parts not well-acted (Cassie, for example, overacted with her huge drops of tears in her last scene when Heath Ledger gave a perfectly restrained performance in the same scene that still managed to show his anguish and desolation), or I thought perhaps could been done differently or better. However, it is not possible to give it a vote 9.5, so a 10 it will be, if only to do my little bit to counter those dishonest people who voted out of hatred and spite rather than having genuinely seen the film.",10,37,44,28 February 2006
Lost in Translation," Interesting but unsatisfactory
","Lost in Translation is a film about two people who found each other at a time of loneliness and shared a few moments of fun, happiness and consolation. A modern day Brief Encounter of sorts. It has its touching moments and it leaves a sense of sadness at the end.It is the kind of film I would like, but I don't. Perhaps it lost me at the beginning, when the main character Bob Harris, as played by Bill Murray, displayed a 'can't be bothered' attitude towards the people who pay him a fortune to do a job (he should realised that if he can't be bothered to be nice then don't take the money!). There is also something vaguely racist and offensive about the portrayal of Japanese in the film as some weird alien creatures to whom you don't owe some sincere display of courtesy or civility. And so for me there is little sense of empathy towards him or his feeling of loneliness and boredom, and the story falls a bit flat from then on.Charlotte is played with great sensitivity by Scarlett Johansson who is a revelation in this film. As for Bill Murray, despite the praises he has garnered in this film, I'm not really sure he can really display anything deeper apart than making a few faces or just looking bored. It's fine for Ghostbusters but not really for film of this type which requires something much more subtle.",5,0,1,9 March 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," 'Look at us. Look at what they make you give.'
","The Bourne Ultimatum concludes the trilogy that started with Bourne Identity in which a man (Jason, the eponymous Bourne), shot and left for dead in the sea, found himself unable to remember who he was, and so started a quest to find and recover his lost identity, as well as to discover his own past and attempt to remedy the wrong done. Thus began a thrilling series which featured relentless action and frenetic chase scenes that covered three continents and which, once started, never let go of you as a viewer. The Bournd Ultimatum is to my mind the best of three, it features some of the best action sequences seen, for example, the tight, well-paced, and supremely well-done scene at the Waterloo station. It brings a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy that leaves you exalted, but still somewhat saddened at the journey he had to undertake, his discovery and the cost to him. If I want to nit-pick, I'd say that the Tangier chase and fight scenes went on just a little too long, and the relationship between Nicky and Jason was never fully explained. The Bourne Supremacy is I think the weakest of the three, primarily because of the sheer illogicality of the plot - if Abbott (Brian Cox) had a secret so grave that he would kill his own man and himself over it, then surely he would have killed Jason Bourne when he have the chance to do so in the first film. It does, however, feature the best car chase sequence (the Moscow one) I have ever seen. Many people have complained about the shaky camera technique, but apart from a couple of moments which I found irritating in Bourne Supremacy, it had worked pretty well in general, especially in the Waterloo scene as it heightened the confusion, agitation and tension of the moment. If we want to see the point of the film, it is what Jason Bourne said to the Paz who asked him why Bourne didn't shoot him when he can - 'Look at us. Look at what they make you give.', echoing the same words said by the dying Professor in Bourne Identity (a rather nice link back to the first film). He was asking Paz to reflect on what he has given (his whole life, his own judgement, and above all, his humanity) for the cause he has undertaken, the unquestioned surrender of his self to a higher power to be used as it so wished, and implicit in it a question if this is the right thing to do. Bourne himself discovered the limits of how far he can sacrifice his humanity when, at the assassination attempt of Wombosi, he was faced with having to kill the children (since there must be no survivors who can bear witness to Wombosi's killing). This, he decided, he would not give, and is what ultimately saved him as a person even if his hesitation nearly cost him his life.Some may read the film as a very specific (and I think, very parochial) attack on the CIA, however, I would see this as of more general relevance to someone in the service of any organisation (perhaps a governmental or secret service one on one side, or a terrorist organisation on the other) that demands certain sacrifice of their humanity for what they do. Read the terrible events in the news that occurred regularly all over the world (perhaps another bombing in Iraq, or Burmese soldiers killing monks) and wondered perhaps if the ones who perpetrated the dreadful deeds at the behest of their organisation would just reflect on this - 'Look at what they make you give'? The film also questions whether any organisation, given untrammelled power, would exercise their power in a responsible way. And if you are prepared to give your all to that organisation, would your trust be abused?But let's not get too carried away with philosophising. This film is, ultimately, an action-packed entertaining film, and as such, it is a great success. It is a fitting end to the Bourne stories, but, do I want another one? Well, perhaps yes. There is the risk any new film may ruin what is a near-perfect series, but I think these three will stand on their own as a discrete trilogy, and anything else will be a bonus.",9,7,11,10 October 2007
The Thing," One of the best of its type
","The Thing must be considered one the best within the genre of Sci-Fi horror movies, together with the first two of the Alien films. Set in Antarctica it captures the atmosphere of isolation, eerie feeling of fear and terror of the unknown. Together with terrific special effects (the head sprouting legs and scuttling away must rank amongst the greatest scenes in the annals of Sci-Fi horror), and good acting by the principal actors, it is one the most memorable of films. I was somewhat shocked and disturbed by the film when I first saw it, and the feeling of unease lingered in the mind for some time.The final scene is also one of the most interesting in the film, it leaves the story perhaps unfinished and in the viewer a deep sense of unresolved tension and unsettled fear.I probably would have given it a 9 or 10 for its sheer brilliance, but viewing it again many years later the shock factor has somewhat diminished, perhaps lowering unfairly the appreciation of the film. Hence the slightly lower vote although it probably deserves more, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who haven't seen it before.(vote amended to give a 9, it does deserve it on second thought.)",9,1,3,8 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," An entertaining film
","Considering that the director had to remove a huge chunk of the back story in the book in order to fit all the important elements into the film, this film works surprisingly well. Some of the deletions, for example, the long-winded story of the missing witch, are probably an improvement, while others, such as scenes with Dobby and SPEW, are understandably not included. The story of Crouch and his son is greatly truncated but nevertheless well-done - particularly the scene where Barty Crouch suddenly realised who Moody actually is.It is a fine entertaining film, as long as you don't expect great performances from the three teenagers. Some of the supporting cast, however, are wonderful, in particular Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson), and of course, Snape (Alan Rickman). Michael Gambon, however, is disappointing - Dumbledore simply isn't someone so excitable. Ralph Fiennes works well as Voldemort and I look forward to seeing him in the same role in future films.This movie is an improvement on the first three. The three tasks are well-done and spectacular, in particular the Dragon chase and the underwater scene. The maze scene pales somewhat in comparison, but works fine within the film. The last scene is especially memorable, with the sinking ship and flying carriage, a touch of poetry that compares well with the best of Terry Gilliam such as the dream sequence in Brazil, the waltzing commuters in The Fisher King and dance with Venus in Baron Munchausen. An enjoyable film for the whole family.",8,0,0,2 March 2006
Donnie Darko," An interesting little gem
","This is an intriguing film with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the title role. Is Donnie Darko slowing going mad, is the weird giant rabbit a friend or an enemy, and is there something sinister going on? The story unravels and you get drawn into the strange world of Donnie Darko and his journey which reached an inevitable, melancholy but strangely satisfying conclusion.I won't say much about the plot, but you might need to have a second look to understand exactly what is happening. Only one thing needed to be said - if you ever want to watch this film, watch the original version, avoid the Director's cut version. The director's cut added unnecessary scenes and pointless graphics which, although perhaps the director thought might think help explain the movie better, is a big mistake. The original version is mysterious and all the better for it, and if you don't understand it completely, it matters not a jot. In fact it is silly to try to make sense of the science as some tried to do because it is hardly the point of the film, and in any case Hollywood simply can't do science well in most of its films. Just enjoy an intriguing journey through the mind of a disturbed (or may be not) teenager.",9,15,24,7 March 2006
The Birds," Absurd film that doesn't stand up to scrutiny
","The Birds is one of the films that is considered to be a classic, its technique and direction in creating tension, menace and horror are often studied and mimicked. It tells a story of a town that was attacked and besieged by birds that turned, for uncertain reason, deranged and vicious. It exploited the idea of something that ordinarily appears harmless but which suddenly became violent and deadly.There is no doubt that the director had used his considerable talent to create an eerie atmosphere, and applied various technique to create the suspense and terror that makes the viewers fearful and tense. However, there is nothing much beyond that. When examined critically, looking at the why and how, the film falls apart. Why do the birds attacked? Can they really be so powerful, even threatening to peck through doors? How come the people are doing so little to counter the menace? Are the people there really so clueless as to how to kill birds, even if there are lots of them? A moment that illustrates the absurdity of this film is when the Melanie went to the loft and suddenly found herself faced with hundreds of birds that attacked her. Anyone with any sense would not even go into the room when they see a big hole in the roof, or would just turn and run out of the room, but no, she went in and then just stood here, waving her hands around and fumbling for the door knobs behind her (doesn't she know how to turn around? It's easier to see the door knob and stop the birds from attacking your face that way you know!). The way it was done was purely for creating the horror, damn any sense of logic of how any normal person would have behaved in such situation.It is a lazy piece plot wise, showing a director more interested in creating tension and suspense, jettisoning completely any sense of coherence and logic, or indeed any interest in the outcome of the film. It perhaps has too much of an influence on other films, as we have now seen so many films of the horror genre that are purely interested in the creating fear, terror and suspense, with people behaving not like any real person would and getting into stupid and terrifying situations. The technique for creating fear is everything, and in the process, the people in the story are completely lost, no longer individuals who thinks and acts, just puppets that don't think but merely react, and in an absurd fashion.",4,4,7,12 November 2007
