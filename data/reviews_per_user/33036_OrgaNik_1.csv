10 Cloverfield Lane," How to ruin a perfectly good movie
","Take a film with genuine suspense. Have just three people in a confined space. Is the threat real or are the people just tricked into staying in the bunker? It's all so beautifully crafted - the suspicion, claustrophobia, the paranoia. It's subtle and keeps you guessing.And then... suddenly... Aliens! Explosions! Spacecrafts! Subtlety be damned! I was genuinely angry when this film ended. The final 15 minutes just wrecks absolutely everything the rest of the movie built. I have never seen anything quite like it before.What a shame. I was ready to give this one an 8 or a 9, but the ending just soured everything.",6,1,2,25 August 2016
