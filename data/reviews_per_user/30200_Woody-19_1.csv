The Blair Witch Project," What is all the hype about?
","I kept hoping that this movie would get better.  I was sorely disappointed when it reached the end and never got to be the movie that everyone thought it was.  Cheesy dialog, faky fear, Heather deserved to die, especially after going into the house.  What, these kids had a DAT, 3 or 4 cameras and not one of them had a GPS?  Come on.  I heard reports of people being afraid to walk to their cars after this movie.  I was so very disappointed.",3,0,1,31 October 1999
