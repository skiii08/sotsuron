The Blair Witch Project," If you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - then this is the film for you.
","Like many, my first exposure to this film came on the internet.  Word of mouth in newsgroups and chatrooms.  'Can't wait for this film.'  'It was sooooo scary.'  'As soon as it's out in theatres, I'm going again.'  I made a mental note to myself - see this Blair Witch Project that everyone's talking about.And my chance came, as a special advanced midnight screening came to Toronto.  I was all set to hop on the subway and enjoy the show, but then Space happened to run 'Curse of the Blair Witch'.  An examination of the Blair Witch throughout history, told as a straight-faced documentary.  As I understand it, this mockumentary was originally intended to be part of the film - but the filmmakers separated the two, feeling that the footage alone was powerful enough to stand on its own.  Well, 'CotBW' was fairly powerful in its own right, as I decided to skip the midnight showing.  I'm an atheist with little fear of spooks and ghosts, and I'm a veteran horror film watcher.  It takes a fair bit to put the scare into me, but based on this one hour mockumentary, I had come to the conclusion that leaving this film in the dead of night and making my way home alone was a definite no-no.  I decided to forgo this viewing in favour of seeing it with a group of friends when it reached general release.A wise choice.The story is a simple one.  Three filmstudents enter the woods in 1994 to make a documentry on local boogey man, the Blair Witch.  They never returned.  One year later their film is found.  Edited together, it tells the story of their last days.The film may be disappointing for some.  Unlike the current hollywood trend of 'cgi monsters on parade', this film sticks with the 'less is more' school of filmmaking.  It doesn't spoonfeed answers to the audience - no confident scientist or brave police officer to explain bit by bit just how it all fits together.  No denouement to wrap it up in a nice and neat package.  There are no audio or visual cues to inform the viewer of impending danger.  Rather, the filmmakers have chosen a much more intimate approach.  We are forced to take in the information at the same pace the characters receive it.  We see what they see.  We know what they know.  Not all the questions are answered. Even the ending is open to multiple interpretations.This is a film devoid of effects or any form of Hollywood sparkle - as such, the entire film rests upon the strength of the actors.  Though I'm sure much of what we are seeing is the actors playing themselves, the performances are powerful.  That many are leaving the theatres convinced that what they just witnessed was an actual event is a testament to these actors' abilities.I would like to think that this film would act as a signal to Hollywood that we don't need multimillion dollar effects and actors to make a successful movie.  All that is needed are good actors and filmmakers who believe in the story they are telling. Alas, I fear the only thing they will take away is 'Hurray, we don't have to pay cameramen any more.'  Be prepared for a wave of really bad mockumentries nipping on the heels of the Blair Witch.If you like films that provokes thought and discussion, if you are a fan of scary stories, if you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - than this is the film for you.  Although you may wish to cancel that late summer camping trip.This film gets five out of five 'Moohoohaha's' on the scary movie scale. If I were to see this film again, I'd pay as much as $10.",10,1,3,12 August 1999
