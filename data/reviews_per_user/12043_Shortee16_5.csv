Casablanca," A classic romantic and political plot
","Casablanca is a monumental film in the history of Hollywood and film-making itself. As many of following films have borrowed a similar story line and people all over quote lines from it lacking the knowledge that Casablanca is the film form which it originated. This is a subtle blend of love and loss along with the underworld gang politics. It takes place in a town called Casablanca in Morrocco. This is the place known to be ht elast chance of reaching the dream of a ticket out to America, the land of freedom, this being specified by the fact it takes place during WWII. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make a beautiful on screen couple, who give off incredible chemistry not only romantically speaking but also acting wise. Bogart could't have added or taken away form his portrayal of a top man in the underground during those times. His natural charm shone through and there is such a mysteriousness to him that not only catches the audience but also captivates many women who surround him. Ingrid Bergman possess a flowing beauty that aided her performance of the only woman sane enough to break Bogart's heart. Casablanca is not only about a romance gained and then lost, but is deals with life back in WWII, when so much was kept as secrets and people lived in fear for their lives and future. Director Michael Curtiz and the writers definitely reflected their ingenious creativity by subtly placing a good amount of symbolism in Casablanca. Now aside from the shining stars Bogart and Bergamn it can not be left unsaid that what really made Casablanca spark was the presence of Sam's soothing piano playing. All in all the day Casablanca was introduced to its faithful fans was 'the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'",8,0,2,24 May 2004
Citizen Kane," Overflowing with symbolism
","Citizen Kane , though not the most entertaining film, it is a remarkable landmark in the film industry. All for its first time usage of more advanced camera angles and many other filming techniques. Though Citizen Kane lacked what is now by audiences perceived as entertainment, it actually overflowed with metaphors and symbolic meanings in every scene. On example is in the way the first scene begins, which is at the end of Kane's life (Orson Welles) the entire movie plot is centered on his last word `Rosebud' Thus commencing the search for the meaning of this word. Rosebud has an incredible meaning to Kane's life. The Audience later on discovers it is the name of his childhood sled. By making that word his last it set an enormous symbolic meaning of what his wished his life would not have become. Also during the same death scene Kane is holding a globe in his hand which drops and brakes as he dies, symbolizing the messy and scattered life style that was ending then. As far as film techniques go, Citizen Kane is also full of meaning behind the technique used for different and specific scenes. During some scenes in order to create a mindset on the audience Kane is placed by camera angles above the rest of the actors, immediately making him the scenes dominant subject. This is only one example of the very well thought out techniques used in this film. It is believed that Citizen Kane is a representation of William R. Hearst's life. For Kane (Hearst) buys a major newspaper and his life very well portrays Hearst's life. Kane is a person seen and described very differently by those around him. His ex-wife and his closest `friends' were interviewed to discover the meaning of his last word and about his rich and happy life. Even though that is what his life was thought out to be full of Kane was a poor and miserable man, who failed at two marriages and didn't own anything that brought full satisfaction to him. Citizen Kane possesses so many hidden things throughout the entire film that it is necessary to watch many times just to catch small and detailed symbolic events , and even objects. This film is sure to make one think and become an observer of what is very easily overlooked. A downward spiral of a miserable man's life is how Citizen Kane can be best described as.",8,0,2,17 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Comical way of portraying the present international bomb envy and its root
","Dr. Strangelove shows an interesting strategy to make a Â‘prophetic hypothesis' of the rate that intra-countries competitions could become. Its original purpose was hard to grasp, yet this same confusion backs up the purpose trying to be shown. That the subconscious or even conscious reason for the existence of the competition of creating bombs more powerful than someone else's, is lost in the midst of so much politics. A comical example of this is the delivered line which prohibits the fighting in the war room. The way in which politics and international relations were represented was comically put. During a conversation between the Russian and American president, had the audience been ignorant of the speakers identities, an assumption could have been made that it was a conversation between husband and wife feuding. Dr. Strangelove is known for its immense amount of froid content, all throughout the film many references to this subject are portrayed by the dialogue of the actors and even minor things like the smoking of varied sized cigars. The purpose and manner in which this film portrayed its message was both subtle and bold. Even though at times lengthy and seemingly pointless dialogues were present, along with an excessive amount of sexual references, it was understood that this excess was what was desired and necessary to bring across its comical message of `international bomb envy.'",6,2,7,12 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," Pityful
","Some like it Hot is a film that contains a blend of adjectives; humorous, seductive, ironic, pitiful, just to name a few. The plot of the film is rather funny as two men take on a journey in which they witness a crime which then shuttles them to an adventurous chase, (in which they are the ones chased). Marilyn Monroe's presence in this film makes every scene she is seductive, and as to Marilyn's talent; as an actress she is an amazing doctor.It is pitiful to watch this film reflect a view on women in the 50's, for the way in which they are all portrayed as gold diggers who lack the confidence in becoming anything else than a housewife. In this case Some like it Hot does a good job on demonstrating life back then. This film's popularity is solely due to Monroe's rising popularity as well. It is a bit ironic how Monroe's character has a weakness for men and turns to alcohol when her relationships tumble down. This is a very close portrayal to her real life, making the film all about Marilyn Monroe. Some Like it Hot should have been titled, Some Like Monroe, for the way in which she is made to show the typical blonde image  some people possess.",2,8,41,16 April 2004
Rear Window," Surprisingly captivating
","`Rear Window' is an incredible mix of things; mystery, life lessons as lived within the perimeters of various stages of life, and romance. James Stewart portrays Jeff, an ambitious photographer who is temporarily on a wheelchair due to a work related accident. He believes to have witnessed a crime as he watched his neighbors' lives through the rear window of his apartment. The cinematography of Hitchcock's film is deserving of recognition, because it was the largest inside set of the time. The film's setting is inside Jeff's apartment throughout the duration of it, with one exception. Yet every single apartment watched through the apartment's window is so incredibly detailed and thanks to the filming allows the audience to capture all that goes on inside the far off windows. Hitchcock does an amazing job at carefully choosing the stages of life in which every one of Jeff's neighbors is going through. One woman is your typical lone heart; he gives us an aspiring musician, a ballerina, a newlywed couple, as well as a look inside a troubled marriage's apartment. These don't just stand for their clearly stated definitions, but also in a certain way reflect what Jeff's life is like. As he gives marriage a serious thought. Grace Kelly is portraying Lisa Carol Fremont, the woman Jeff is seeing and who represents an opposite of Jeff's character. She is rich and holds a high social status, and also deeply desires a commitment to Jeff. The chemistry created between Lisa and Jeff is reflected very well by the actors. Jeff is almost blinded to see the perfect woman throwing herself at him. The pace Rear Window starts off with is steady, yet seems to drag at about the middle of the film, making it hard for the audience to follow, again towards the end its faster pace is picked up again. This is recovered by the choice of inspirational and dynamic music continually played in the background of the film. Hitchcock demonstrates his geniality and incredible talent by the making of Rear window",7,3,5,1 March 2004
