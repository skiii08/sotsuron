The Avengers," Best movie ever!
","This was quite literally a perfect movie. It combined humor, action, great acting, great orchestra, amazing VFX, and... Robert Downey Jr. 10/10 without a doubtI think that the best character in the movie was hulk (although my favorite was iron man). He really tied the movie together. Hulks personality shined during the end fight. It showed that he wasn't always angry and could hold the great place in History he deserves.The most fascinating hero IMO is haulkeye. I really think that we should see maybe a 'training session' in avengers 2 where he shows off his talents. All in all avengers is a fantastic movie. GO SEE IT! trust me, you wont regret it.",10,2,6,11 May 2012
