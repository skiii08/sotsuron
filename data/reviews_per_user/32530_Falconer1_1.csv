Skyfall," Bond has become a sad and boring second rate action 'hero'
","Bond is 'dead' as far as I am concerned (or at least temporarily put on ice) because Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, an absolute trainwreck as Bond, a sad second-rate main-stream action hero. The 'feel' of a James Bond is of a smooth, suave, confident, well-groomed and in control man and saving the world is somehow 'effortless'. Daniel Craig is not only unbelievably unattractive (looks like an accountant on a bender) but he acts like an insecure teenager with a 'oh yeah' - chip on his shoulder - attitude. Only...he's an adult. I would seriously NOT feel confident if my life were in his hands. A Bond is somehow...other worldly - he cruises effortlessly through his ordeals and there's a lightness and playfulness coupled with a devilish charm in his moves. Like any super hero Bond embodies all the super human characteristics that make men envy him and over which women drool. Well I'm certainly not drooling and if I saw a guy with this attitude at the local bar I would not spare him so much as a glance!",1,9,21,31 December 2012
