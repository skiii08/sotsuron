The Ring," Unexpectedly good....
","I love to watch horror movies but rarely do I see one that's really well done. It's extremely hard to produce a horror movie that shows intelligence, scares you, and is not cheesy.  I believe the Ring did as good of a job as possible.Possible Spoilers...The plot sounds stupid from the outside but it's actually pretty clever. You gradually see the importance of the video tape and the character's roles as the movie progresses. Naomi Watts was impressive and I think David Dorfman (Aidan) could have a bright future. At the beginning, I was afraid Aidan would be just like Haley Joel Osment from the Sixth Sense. Pleasantly, they didn't overuse Aidan's part and it worked well.The movie wasn't that scary, but the way the movie draws you in adds to the scare. The scene where Samara comes out of the t.v. was relatively disturbing. I can only name a handful of horror movies that really impressed me and The Ring is one of them.3.5 out of 4. Must see for horror movie fans.",9,0,0,12 December 2002
Fight Club," who we are and who we want to be
","This is personally one of the most unbelievable film experiences I've had. The impact was so great that the few flaws are meaningless.  Fincher is currently one of the top few directors to watch.  The movie starts with taking you through the gun barrel and shows you Norton and Pitt's ending confrontation. We find out that Norton is the narrator who takes us back in time to tell us the story which explains the final scene. You the viewer get to watch Norton's story and you unknowingly watch:  1. Norton play his usual passive self         2. Norton play his imagined self         3. Norton watching his imagined self (Pitt). Everything runs against short term expectations and for the first 100 minutes the camera shows a confusing yet so engaging story.Next, we have significant sub-plots that even intelligent people seem to forget: <ul><li>Society cannot function without low-middle class workers.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Everyone strives to have the nicest material possessions which mean nothing for our survival. </li></ul><ul><li>We have this obsession with climbing an institutional societal pole and its our way of comparing ourselves to others. It's a big reason for low self-confidence and stress. Fight Club shows how ridiculous that notion is.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Men naturally have an itch to fight (usually mentally). What a great setting for the story to move around. </li></ul><ul><li>Most humans are two beings, who they are and who they want to be: as we find out later, Tyler Durden has the rare courage to run with who he wants to be. </li></ul>Pitt, Carter, and especially Norton were unreal. Norton was truly multidimensional and Pitt was so cool he didn't even seem real. Fincher's translation transported me into his world and I love the lighting in his movies. I have never been hit so hard with a twist that I almost watched the movie twice in a row.4 out of 4. If you don't understand why, work on your film vocabulary.",10,0,1,19 November 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Must See Animated Movie...
","I believe that this movie ranks as possibly the best animated movie I have seen. The Toy Story movies and Shrek were great, but Monsters Inc. was better. Why?The animation was phenomenal, the story was unique and made for all ages, and valuable lessons can be learned. Adults can take away more from the movie than kids probably can. In a very creative way, the movie promoted laughter, not being greedy, love, etc. It was wonderful.If your a Disney fan or not, it's a well spent 90 minutes.",9,0,1,11 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," couldn't be better....
","The Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite books of all time. Tolkien is a genius and created this fantasy world beyond imagination. Peter Jackson steps to the plate and directs a movie that will be criticized regardless of how good it is.I was never more excited to see a movie than The Fellowship of the Ring. I was going to see one of my favorite books on the big screen. I was overjoyed but I still knew it couldn't match the personal vision I had in my head from the book. After viewing, I couldn't have been any happier. Peter Jackson well exceeded my expectations and needs to be commemorated. The scenes amazingly matched my personal vision from the book. Was it Tolkien's story on screen? Not completely. Could it have been better? No way in hell. I'm sorry it didn't have Tom Bombadil and singing hobbits that would negatively impact the movie.Critics and Tolkien fans who speak negatively towards the movie need to quiet down because Peter Jackson gave you a mighty treat that no one would probably dare. The Fellowhip of the Ring easily deserved the Best Picture award but it got screwed because it's a trilogy. The Academy should be slapped for giving it to 'A Beautiful Mind.' It wasn't that beautiful. Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Ian McKellan) belonged to the Fellowship. Maybe the Academy will be nice and give the LOTR's their respect after the third movie. In the meantime, I can't wait for the Two Towers. Tolkien fans, thank Peter Jackson.4 out of 4. No questions asked.",10,1,1,15 December 2002
