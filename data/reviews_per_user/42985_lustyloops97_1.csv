Requiem for a Dream," StonerMovieReeview; Requiem for a Dream
","Requiem for a Dream ~ Darren Aronofsky ~ 10 joints out of 10!!! ~ Holy sh!t, dude, all I can say is PHENOMENAL! Aronofsky is totally on some SH!T. 'Requiem' is thoroughly twisted, dark and scary as all hell! It is beautifully detailed and ingeniously shot, and slowly builds to a climax that eases you into a state of almost shock. As for the soundscore, think of the Chariots of Fire score tweaking on heroin! A year after the death of Kubrick, Aronofsky literally re-defines film as an art medium, yet 'Requiem' also consistently entertains, gradually pushing you to the edge of your seat as the imagery has a massive attack on your very senses... No joke, you may feel like pulling a Malcolm McDowell and fleeting from your bedroom via window! ~ Grab your bong and some bud, smokers, 'Requiem for a Dream' equals total buzz enhancement!!!",10,2,4,8 December 2007
