Raiders of the Lost Ark," A great movie!
","What can I say about Raiders of the Lost Ark other than I loved it? Harrison Ford played great, so did the others. But what I liked the most about the movie was the way they re-created all the nazistuff. I mean, all the uniforms and everything! It makes it look so much more authentic! I think of this movie as one of Spielberg's greatest EVER!",10,0,0,15 February 2000
