The Avengers," Possibly the best superhero movie ever!
","Whedon has done an excellent job directing this movie. Getting such popular superheros together in one movie, and giving them all equal screen time is a difficult task, and Whedon has perfected it. Highlight of the movie was fight between hulk and Thor. I was little disappointed when I heard that Edward Norton won't be playing role of hulk, but after seeing Ruffalo's performance I was quite surprised. Hulk and Iron man have great roles in this movie. There is absolutely no flaw in the movie. All the actors (Robert, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark, Scarlett, Samuel, Jeremy, etc) have done a fabulous job. This is a movie not to be missed. The last I really enjoyed watching superhero movie was Spiderman 1 (Toby Maguire). This movie completely blew me away. I went to watch this movie during the premier on Thursday night, and it was completely worth standing in big line at 12am in the night. Overall a fantastic movie. Do not miss it!",10,2,7,26 October 2013
