It," Stephen King's IT As A Generation X Period Piece
","(1.) Independent (If you had never seen the original): Acting: 15/20 Writing: 34/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 34/40Overall: 83/100 BReview: This movie is more of a period piece about what life was like for many kids in Generation X, rather than a 'horror story'. There is so much negativity and despair without the presence of IT, that IT really only serves as a cherry on top of an already deflated childhood experience. IT is more symbolic of how Generation X were left as 'latchkey children' while their Boomer parents were 'finding themselves' and otherwise not taking full responsibility for themselves and especially not as parents.Since the story is more focused on the kids, they are seen much more in this film than IT/Pennywise is. The kids do a decent acting job, they're not awful or 'unbelievable' but they definitely weren't trying to win any acting awards in their performances either - except for the kid who plays Eddie Kaspbrak, who does an outstanding job that goes above and beyond all of his peers in this film. While the other kids only did 'B' or 'C' grade level performances, this kid gave an 'A' level performance and in a lot of ways, 'stole the show'.From what was seen of IT/Pennywise, the performance was adequate - nothing particularly special in a positive nor negative way. Overall it was a decent performance that didn't really stand out. The performance of IT/Pennywise is usually underwhelming and not very frightening as this film leans more on clich√© 'jump scares' rather than building any kind of real suspense or dread about the character.*Spoiler Alert!*Overall, the film serves as a great representation of Generation X's childhood, as well as representing Boomers and Silent Generationers during this time. The Boomer parents are mostly absent, abusive, overbearing and/or blame the Gen. X kids for perceived problems in their eyes. The Silent Generationers are tough, wise and politically incorrect.The film has some comedic Gen. X references, such as the recurring theme of 'New Kids On The Block', which may very well go over the head of many Millennials.Unfortunately, part of the trouble of this film was it's goal to serve 2 Gods: Telling a story about Generation X as well as telling the story of Stephen King's IT. The result was that neither stories were able to reach their full potential and the intertwining added a bit of confusion/inconsistency.*End of Spoiler Alert!*(2.) Compared To Original TV Mini-Series: Acting: 12/20 Writing: 33/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 31/40Overall: 76/100 CReview: While it was very interesting to place this film in the 1980s and added something new and creative to the story, it also took quite a bit away from the original story and fear of IT, itself.*Spoiler Alert!*Part of the brilliance of the original IT, was the story about the 'loss of innocence', and this was best portrayed in a 1950s setting - as in the 1980s, the children didn't start with much innocence to begin with. This greatly affected the suspense and scariness of Pennywise's character overall, as well as took away from this film being a 'horror' film.As far as performances go, most of the kids in this film only did as good or lesser than their previous counterparts. This cast of kids didn't have the same chemistry in this film as those in the original and these kids were certainly less charismatic overall than their previous counterparts.Overall, some changes made were for the better, some for the worst, and some were neutralized by having both positives and negatives.Unsurprisingly though, the change that hurt this film the absolute most, was the change of Pennywise as Tim Curry is so irreplaceable. The thing about Tim Curry, is that he was a Broadway actor and the talent he had with his voice and acting ability is part of what made the character of Pennywise so iconic and memorable. Curry had captured the perfect essence of Pennywise when it came to look, voice and demeanor. His look and voice were perfect and consistent in their imitation of a clown and his behavior was frightening in the most subtle and suspenseful of manners. He was scary much like a crazy person is, the kind of crazy person that you never know what to expect from. In this remake however, Pennywise looked like an obsessed fan of KISS that wasn't enticing to any children at all and looked more like a 'loser' than a 'monster' or even a 'clown'. His voice was terribly inconsistent and a dead giveaway that something was wrong with him, logically serving as a HUGE clue for any kid to run away. His behavior can best be described as something between 'silly' and 'lame' - either way it was not frightening, compelling or memorable.Since this movie is such a Hollywood movie and not limited to TV production as the original was, this remake had much more consistent production work when it came to the special effects. However, this lacked a lot of the iconic and memorable scenes, shots and locations that the original had - including the 'house' that linked Pennywise to the swamps, as the remake version was much more generic and nowhere near as inherently creepy as in the original. (Go figure.)*End of Spoiler Alert!*Overall, this was an interesting take on IT if it took place in the 1980s as opposed to the 1950s - and worth seeing for that reason, but it clearly didn't reach it's full potential and therefore was more underwhelming than it was impressive.Independent & Remake Scores Combined: Acting: 13.5/20 Writing: 33.5/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 32.5/40Overall: 79.5/100 C+/B-Overall this film was an interesting take on incorporating Stephen King's IT with a Generation X childhood period piece.",8,3,5,23 September 2017
Passengers," Exceptional commentary piece paired with compelling performances!
","Acting: 20/20 Writing: 36/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 37/40Overall: 93/100 AReview: As with many space movies, there are quite a few unrealistic plot holes in the script but aside from those few, the movie is pretty accurate.All of the cast in this film delivered compelling performances, playing their roles perfectly.This film is not your typical pop film (nor a typical sci-fi film as it's more of a romantic-drama-sci-fi), every little nuance shows a deeper meaning and weaves together a great analogy of our roles in nature.*Spoiler Alert! *Michael Sheen does an exceptional job as the bartender, especially the part where he 'spazzes out' when presented with contradictory 'facts' as he knows them to be. The writing and concept behind this character, as an android bartender, is very well done. ('Jim, these are not robot questions.')There are a couple of cool allusions in this film, such as The Time Machine, The Shining, Facebook and Sleeping Beauty.This movie shows the value of human companionship as well as romance - even for a man.This movie had a lot of interesting choices and points regarding gender: When Aurora first gets a meal and sees what Jim has been stuck eating this whole time, this is an allusion to the way a bachelor eats before a woman comes into his life and starts to cook for him (traditionally), leading to better and healthier meals for him. Jim as a mechanic, represents men and the old world, and the desire to feel 'necessary'. With technology replacing workers and pushes for women replacing men in the workplace (to fulfill 50/50 gender quotas) - as well as the fact that men can't give birth - men in Western society are struggling to find their value/role in the world. Our modern Western society is very sexist against men and constantly putting them down as 'old-timey', unnecessary and overall 'not good enough'. Our society treats men very unjustly, constantly putting women's feelings and preferences first, while condemning men simply for being men (aka toxic masculinity). Men are people too and just like women, they like to feel valued in society. Love was enough for Jim to be content but not for Aurora, as she was still having a lot of anxiety about their situation after they became romantically involved. Just like humanity works best when men and women are cooperating instead of competing, the two passengers were able to save the ship and everyone on it (aside from the already deceased Chief) when they were cooperating and working together as a team.Aurora had everything she could've asked for, yet it wasn't good enough just because Jim woke her up instead of her accidentally waking up. She had romance and a reliable, loving, trustworthy mate and she still had her career as a writer for audiences of the future to read her once-in-a-lifetime story, even though it wasn't the exact one that she had originally planned for. She took what she had for granted, more focused on what could/should be, rather than what was. She couldn't see the forest for the trees.After all of the crap that Aurora gave Jim for waking her up early, she had the chance to 'erase this mistake' yet she chose not to. In the end, she chose the life that Jim had chosen for her as well. So she gave him hell for nothing. This is very representative of how if many modern women today would focus on everything they do have instead of what they don't have, they would realize that they have a lot to be grateful and happy for. Western women are the most spoiled women on Earth yet they often fail to see that. And one of the most important overall metaphors from this film revolved around nature:Nature will not be controlled forever.There was a point made several times in this film about the 'fact that the pods can't possibly defect', yet we know that's not a fact as somehow, someway, Jim's pod did defect - even though it was the 1st time 'ever'. This was very important because it was very symbolic of our modern society and the everyday things we take for granted - especially modern women who would choose 'modern society' over 'nature's society' almost every single time (since they benefit from this modern society even more than men do).To this point as well, nature always finds a way to create life; It's why human beings are here. No matter how many extinction periods have occurred here on Earth and wiped out entire species at a time, nature always finds a way to give new life a chance. This was represented by the planting of nature that Jim did all around the information room (especially at the end) but also by both of Jim and Aurora's urge to not be alone, as many human beings feel this way - not in just a romantic sense but in an overall sense (which is why we, humans, often try to create some kind of society).*End of Spoiler Alert!*Overall this film was an exceptional commentary piece paired with compelling performances; Absolutely worth watching!",9,5,8,3 October 2017
