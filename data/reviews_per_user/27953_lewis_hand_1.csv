It," Had potential but ruined by substandard modern Hollywood practices.
","This film had so much potential. All of the actors did a brilliant job, the cinematography is well done and the set pieces look fantastic. The problem with the film and why IT doesn't work is that any tension or scary atmosphere is ruined by obnoxious loud sound effects, cheap jump scares and terrible CGI. Go and watch IT if you want to watch a competently made film with decent actors and good set design, but if you are expecting a scary atmospheric film that genuinely frightens you with genuine tension rather than telling you when to be scared then you are in for a big disappointment. That is the problem with film audiences today. They like to be told how to feel, rather than feeling for themselves.",4,0,5,24 September 2017
