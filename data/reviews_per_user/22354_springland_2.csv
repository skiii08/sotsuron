Hereditary," New experience of horror
","Okay, I will begin with how i feel when i was watching the movie. I felt kinda bored. Though I already read the review on how the movie is a slow burn, I just couldn't believe how slow it was. The first thirty minutes made me wanted to walked out because of boredom. But afterwards the movie just making me uncomfortable.. I never felt this way anytime I watched horror. It was weird I don't know how to put it in words. Usually horror movie depends on jumpscare and loud music that makes me surprised. But Hereditary is different. I could barely heard the music, no jumpscare, it is just different. but the movie is haunting me after the movie ended! I am not the type who get scared with scary scenes but Hereditary made me scared with only one scene (a bit spoiler: the mother and the rope) I can't get that scene out of my head even until now. I didn't feel scare when watching.. I felt terrified when I stepped out from the cinema. I didn't feel comfortable. I felt weird. I felt like going to throw up after watching.
I can say this movie is not my cup of tea yet I would still recommend people to watch this. This movie is pure genius on how it scares people without that cliche horror movie plot. Thumbs up to the director, crew and cast.",7,0,1,7 December 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," I didn't know I would love this
","I just this movie a couple days ago. My bf insisted me to watched saying how he liked Pan's Labyrinth a lot. At first, I was skeptic toward to watch it because I thought it would be some kind of cliche fantasy movie. But I was totally wrong. Guillermo de Toro delivered a very beautiful yet tragic story. I said it is not cliche because first it is a dark fantasy with bloody scenes (I thought the movie was a happy-journey thing). And I love when the character is faced with danger there is not a suddenly-hero-come from nowhere to help him/ her. Mercedes is the character I favorite most. She is strong, brave and smart. I felt like clapping when she brutally attack the captain. Besides, I hate the main character most, Ofelia. Though it is still understandable because she is still a kid and innocent (or stupid? why do you eat the grape?!). Oh and the myth creatures are astonishing!
To sum up, this movie worth to watch. This is not a usual fantasy. This is rare.",7,2,2,29 December 2018
