Blade Runner 2049," Thank you for not screwing this up
","At the time this movie was made there was so much pressure to conform to appease the PC mob. However it was made with little regard to the politics of the time.with that out of the way. I am not going to gush with fancy words but cut to the chase of what i wanted for this film.I wanted to experience the cold and harsh reality of what it would be like to be a slave among the so called creators that were extremely prejudiced of how insignificant i was. Ryan Gosling played that part so well. He was made out to be the killer of slaves and yet was also dead himself. If you look at his character you will see the apathy to his situation and just a glimmer of hope, but not enough to convince himself that the outcome for himself would be any different to that of his victims.In the end he makes the ultimate sacrifice to save (Harrison Ford) Deckard who also sacrificed everything to save his hybrid daughter, of whom is also not cleared of this sad state of affairs not least of which also contributes to creating memories for those of her kind in order to give them some small comfort in their misery.If you look at her situation, she is woman in a bubble, one that will most likely die from disease if she is exposed to the outside world, let alone produce offspring that will propagate the replicant species. the whole exercise is that of tragedy of visiting human beings darkest desires on a creation that only wishes to have what their creators take for granted, which is life, regardless of how short it may be.In all, a great experience and an extension to the original film. To the director, you have my thanks, thank you for not screwing this up.",10,2,11,1 March 2019
Meet Joe Black," it is either for you or it is not
","For those that did not like the film i can only accept and respect your choice. For myself however, this movie didn't even need to be about death coming for a visit. The performances of the actors was just fantastic. The build up and slow pace made this film truly an amazing thing to watch. The slow but incredible build up from a slow and potentially boring start builds toward something that left me as one with a sense of appreciation for life and the moments within that can make it truly great.I have seen this film many times now and every time i watch it, i experience hesitation toward the end because i simply do not want it to end. I wonder why they dont make them like this anymore.All i can offer is 10/10, i hope you enjoy it too.",10,2,3,11 November 2018
