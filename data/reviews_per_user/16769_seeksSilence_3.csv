The Hangover," WOW - Oversold or What!
","When movies get billed as the comedy of the year, the blockbuster everybody is talking about. Well, I tend to walk to the other way and I wish had sticked to that plan before deciding to watch this complete crap.So here's the setup, Husband to be, two buddies and the brides brother get together for an overnight in Vegas.Friend One - School teacher and low-life, rips is class off to pay for Vegas trip. Not a good start.Friend Two - Hen-pecked Doctor (Dentist) lives in permanent denial of his girlfriends infidelity and unhappy relationship.Brides Brother - Dysfunctional family idiot, quite plausible.Groom - A Mother-in-laws wet dream, yawn..........So here we are four different but evidently three close friends and the idiot set off to Vegas in father-in-law to be prized Mercedes-Benz.What happens over the ensuing 24 hours is quite honestly woeful, predictable and not funny - at all.The problem I think is that the three characters that are supposed to carry the film just don't work. There not interesting or funny in any situation they find themselves in, not once - ever.At one point the idiot turns into 'rain-man' and wins big - oh no didn't see that coming....yawn again.Very formulaic, unfunny crap - and Hollywood thinks we need more of this. Be warned, stay away and spend your money more wisely.",2,61,113,20 July 2009
Nightcrawler," Jake G. Being Jake G. - Again
","Twenty minutes was enough for me, I couldn't take anymore. I don't care where it goes or how it ends.Yet another movie with JG employing the practice of 'method' acting, you almost feel like he's saying to himself: 'move here, say this, smirk, move head weirdly, repeat'.See Prisoners and you'll understand that this performance (like many others) is just an extension of an instantly dis-likable character being performed by an 'actor' hitting his marks.In any entertainment feature, there has to be some redeeming aspect of a character that draws you in. When you can empathise, connect with the situation and those within it; then your happier to move forward with them and their story. Not here, this was dire.No doubt some will applaud the eccentricities and mannerism's of this character and the films premise of viewer/participant/instigator. But JG's acting just got on my nerves and I couldn't get past the fact that this was performance by numbers.I really was looking forward to seeing this movie, what a disappointment.My vote is based on the twenty minutes I watched, it probably would be lower if I'd watched it all.",3,10,28,5 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Boring, over-long, slow and annoying.
","Firstly, I am neither a teenager nor a girl; so I don't fit the target demographic. Never-the-less, I was hoping to be entertained.Sequels tend be by nature an extension of the original and many fail to live up to expectations, and this film fails 'Big-Time'. If you've seen the trailer then you've seen everything except the boring bits.Sequels also tend to be a money-grabbing enterprise to repay those who took a chance on the first outing.Sadly this woeful, boring and extremely slow disaster will make money purely because it's the next instalment of what could be a great franchise.Unfortunately there is far too much crying, hugging and the amount of times the name 'Peter' is mentioned in almost every scene becomes excruciatingly annoying.As for the 'games' these last for all of 15 minutes of a 2hr movie, and is so undeniably dull. I started to hope they would all die, just so there wouldn't be the inevitable third part.As for the 'plot' it's the same as the original only shorter and less interesting.The only saving grace is Donald Sutherland who is deliciously 'evil' and steals every scene. This would be a complete train wreck without him, this is the only reason I have given a 2 star rating.btwThat noise you can hear whilst you're in the cinema, is the world going by while you're wasting your time on this drivel.You have been warned....",2,31,59,31 December 2013
