The Avengers," meanwhile
","film studios just found out that a lot of moviegoers rely on 'reviews' like internet buyers rely on customer reviews. It is known, that many big internet shops hire review-agencies those only job it is to fake authentic looking customer reviews because a lot of buyers trust the reviews of other customers more than any magazine reviews.That's what is happening here. 80% of the reviews here are written by professional review-agencies which got paid by the studios. If you look closer and compare the text of those 'best movie ever' reviews (or variations of that, such as 'i did not expect much, i am not a superhero fan, but this was greatest beyond belief' ) with reviews written at other moviegoer platforms, you will find a lot of equal phrases and text blocks.I guess that IMDb is aware of that cheating and they support it. This movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula. Superheros need super problems to solve, so that they can shine. Each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to his/her individual super powers. They only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team. But suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread, as you can guess, and only towards the end they find together again and etc., etc.. A story for retarded eight-year-old's, flavored with as much CGI as you little brain can swallow in the time.A stupid movie with a stupid story, stupid characters with stupid attitudes, stupid CGI and a stupid ending. If super stupid means blockbuster, then here you go.",1,482,998,11 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Be warned!
","When Lucas brings out a 'Smell-O-Vision' version of Star Wars approx. in 2024 everybody will realize that this movie stinks. Before than, you can watch this p.o.s in 3D, Wow! It's the same disaster as is was 1999 except it has more 'depth', at least concerning the pictures, not the plot of course. But if you show a really one-dimensional plot in 3D you don't give it more dimensions, you just multiply the misery three times.I wished they would have made a director's cut instead, done by a director who knows what he's doing, what rules out George Lucas automatically, and cut out the scenes which ruined Star Wars forever. For instance, any scene with 'lil Vader aka 'Annie' or any scene with the Medi-Clitorians, who make women pregnant without having any sex in the 'usual' way, but just by the 'force' (this is not meant as a rape joke!)Oh boy, will Lucas ever stop to prove what everyone already knows? His story telling skills are that of a 8 year old, without external help, like he had massively during the first 'more funny' movies, his stories are an incoherent mess of BS. Lucas, now, with the help of some dark forces, has become so rich and blinkered with a lot of imperial affectations, that nobody dares to tell him the truth (He is no Spielberg). Be warned! Watching The Phantom Menace or any other of the first episodes in 3D will burn this painfully experience even deeper into your brain. It took me almost 13 years to get over this movie and to be able to enjoy the real ones again.",1,1,5,19 March 2012
Sucker Punch," fetish girls with guns
","Ouch, this one was truly awful. This movie is a wild collage of bathetic 'cool movie' concepts, all put together with no sense of aesthetics, colors, emotions, logic. This movie must be the result of a totally untalented dude who is over challenged by the possibilities and the money he has at hand. You have seen it too many times, the cliché girl power with silicone belly top protagonists in stockings feeling no heat, no temperature, and don't get hurt by explosion splinters. No shot without choreographed movements or pose, regardless of whether its physical possible or meaningful at all. The girls actors do not act they are just posing as they were constantly in front of a mirror, just looking as 'cool and sexy' as possible. If one would have given the storyboard scrips to a chimpanzee to throw them in the air an put them randomly back to the board again wouldn't have made a difference at all. This mush garnished with a sauce mindless CGI and sound FX makes this movie an indigestible pile of crap, done by a guy with absolutely no creativity whatsoever. The dubbed version i watched is even worse...",1,6,13,15 April 2011
Gravity," Gravity for your eyelids
","Open Water in Space, i guess: A lame story which fits on a coaster stretched to the excess before people would get bored to death. All solely carried by visual effects. The problem here, to convey the infinity wideness of space to the audience, you need a reference point, otherwise, all you could show is a black background with little light dots on. Obviously, you have to show the only reference point available over and over again: the Earth from 400 km above, and what you see is more or less the same, for 90 min..And, honestly, Sandra Bullock in a space suit doesn't give me the slightest impression of what it would mean, to be in such a situation as an astronaut. Either you see a white space suit in front of the Earth, spinning around, or, you see a face from inside the helmet of a space suit.The 'drama'-plot could be easily translated to someone being captured in a small room anywhere, that the whole thing happens in Space does not make any difference, plot-wise.The possible ways to get rescued are crystal clear, either someone picks you up or you die. And if this wouldn't be boring enough for the viewer, there's only one possible way to die, no sharks, or whatever...and you can't die from being attracted by gravity! So even the title of the movie is a kind of stupid.1 extra point for the nice Earth view CGI.",2,90,178,5 October 2013
Star Trek," Laws of Gravity....
","...in Hollywood: when you fail, you fall upwards.Example: J.J. Abrams. I claim that J.J. is a rather untalented movie maker with no sense of cinematography whatsoever. He is a kind of Movie-DJ, putting together samples of ideas (mostly not his own ones...)from other sources, creating an easy to consume industry product. Surely, at first there is nothing wrong with that, as long as he can justify this way by making a lot of money. Star Trek over the decades has became a cultural phenomenon, a whole universe of its own ideas, moral standards and way of proclaiming a bright future of mankind. For Roddenberry, Star trek was a vision of a way of live.For J.J this vision is reduced to cool dudes and hot chicks on warp speed. The story of this movie is a patchwork of pieces. We have a psychopathic villain with a father complex who lives with only a dozen crew members or so, in a gigantic space-ship (this ship has an insane amount of just empty space in it), where you have artificial gravity and a lot of slippery gangways and platforms with no railing. If you slip, you will fall to death hundreds of meters towards the gravity generator.Anyway, the ship looks like a space incarnation of a Transylvania Vampire castle. The villain, how do we impersonate him... there he is, the Khan-villain, who does all the dirty work himself: putting little creatures into the body of hostages so that these poor fellows have to tell the truth. Never seen before, *cough*cough*, because this familiar looking species is NOT from Alpha Ceti V!We have ice-planets with hairy monsters, suddenly eaten by bigger monsters. For everyone who never heard or saw anything of Star Wars, all this might have been a real surprise. The bigger snow-monster though is naked, who knows what that means?!If you want to get on an ice-planet for free, just to have cool mindless adventures with those kind of creatures, p* off your commanding officer of the Enterprise. But p* him off at the very right time, otherwise the two snow-monsters wouldn't be there to chase you into a cave where Ol'Spock is already waiting for you and the plot could not go on then. I could bet, that J.J. was using some 'force' here to bring Kirk and Spock together so fatefully. The bridge, or should i say, the i-Bridge of the Enterprise looked like an Apple-Store in heaven or so, arrrgh those bright lights...! Probably this bridge was designed as a plug to entertain the crew and not to bother them with technical, how-to-fly-a-spacecraft-nonsense. The machine rooms were also very special: huge rooms, with a lot of empty and wasted space. Who cares, that the Enterprise could have been a third of its size without those machine rooms? (Yes, we know, that in future there will be no money and nobody has to pay for such design flaws). And we see a lot of huge as radioactive labeled oil-tanks with 20th century rotary valves. And there is some other cool stuff in the movie: lens flares! Woohoo! Yeah! Wow! Obviously this was J.J's. new toy! But for f* sake: You do not have to use them on every single screen shot, on every single light source! This is NO NOT cool anymore J.J! Thank God that J.J. already had his handshake-camera orgasm experience when he did Cloverfield. So this time, (yes we still have shaking cam here) it was quite moderate, for J.J.!Genuineness at it's top, J.J. gave us something really never seen before: red, yes, not dark, not black, red (!) matter. So, what to do with red matter? Red matter, used correctly, creates, strange enough, black holes(!) and not as expected, the much more dangerous red ones. Rule 1: red matter placed INSIDE an empty (drilled before)space of an object generates a black black hole. Rule 2: red matter placed OUTSIDE somewhere in empty space generates a portal for time traveling. Rule 3: red matter placed OUTSIDE somewhere in empty space generates SOMETIMES a black hole too (hopefully only at the end of the movie, when it is convenient to kill the villain with his space-ship)The character development and cast,... Power-Rangers in Space!with personalities of a spoiled 13 year old doing their thing, hey, f* team play, f* the star fleet, yo! Best scene to show how J.J. wants to draw these characters: cool dude Kirk smacking eating an apple while cheating the Kobayashi Maru test. Brilliant J.J! The drill scene: Sulu has NO phaser, Kirk has one BUT does not want to use it. So Sulu starts fighting with a sword, Kirk with his hands and feeds. Suddenly Kirk has the idea of using his phaser, but it got kicked immediately out of his hands. The third guy (probably with a phaser) got killed for the sake of convenience. ALL are wearing DIFFERENT colored suits, so that the stupidest retards can keep them apart. Now, that Kirk and Sucklu have NO phasers, they have to capture one from the enemies they have been fighting to make the drill kaput. Learning: You cannot destroy a gigantic drill with a sword! Aha!The crew is also cool and stupid as sh*t: Uhura, the hot chocolate Ranger, Sulu, the ninja Ranger, Chekov, the Rump...er Russian Ranger, Scotty, the mechanist Ranger, Bones, the funny doctor Ranger and Spock, the horny nerd Ranger. This is what i call a Franchise reboot! Power Rangers Transform!!!! Where are the action figures, J.J?Thanks Paramount, BTW, for betraying Gene's vision on the altar of commerce. Franchise fatigue is one thing for justifying a reboot of the Star Trek universe. But having done this by Jar Jar Abrams is complete insult to the non idiotic audience, if there is any.",1,16,22,1 October 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," Again: This is NOT Star Trek!
","First let me say that i expect a ridiculous high rating at IMDb (right now, higher than Gandhi, Ben-Hur, Rocky, etc., because all these movies only have a tiny fraction of the awesomeness THIS brilliant masterpiece of epic filmmaking has...*cough*) for this one as well because most of the 'awesome beyond believe' - reviews were done by payed rating agencies!J.J. Abrams' v(er)(i)sion of Star Trek has absolutely NOTHING in common with the ideas and visions of Gene Roddenberry. Abrams' abilities of story telling are based on two recipes: 1. luring the audience with questions but never giving the answer, 2. it stops after 40 min.. According to the motto, one fool can ask more questions than seven wise men can ever answer, Abrams' stories are therefore the pure exploitation of the curiosity of the audience, leaving you disappointed and empty, because all you got was a patchwork of 40 min pieces, connected by stunningly dumb and unrealistic cliffhangers without any satisfying end. I know that there are many Abrams fan boys out there who like Abrams' 'Lost'- style of storytelling, but folks, it's NOT always like it was for you at school: if you don't understand something, it doesn't mean automatically, that there's something meaningful going on! If there are plot holes, inconsistencies, stupid dialogs, too much pretty people doing too much stupid things and too much action & lens flares in your eyes, then, sometimes, the movie is just plain bad, and nobody understands what's going on, believe me! Into Darkness is visually (CGI) intriguing which might be the only reason for the targeted audience (8-16 y.o.m) to score that flick as awesome. BTW, Abrams' put some new lenses in his cameras, (almost) no flares anymore... The character development is reduced to action figures in space with every thinkable cliché (dudes can be categorized as cool, cute, nerdy, romantic, tough, chicks are hot, dudes outnumber the chicks which causes some rivalry anyway...) which looks like a cast for a boy/girl group thing. As you might expect then, all there is about equipment, wardrobe, technical details was not designed to be appropriate or functional, but rather to look good & cool somehow. Every story ever written for TNG, TOS is by far more ambitious than this crap from the 'wouldn't it be cool if'-department here.I do not understand why Paramount decided to reboot the franchise in that way. At least it must have been obvious to them that you can't make a TV series with this reboot and Jar Jar Abrams, which literally would have been 'Lost' in Space. Let's hope that this reboot thing will only last a couple of movies with 3-4 years intervals AND let's hope that someone at Paramount has enough brains to make another Star Trek series in the sense of Roddenberry and all the true Star Trek fans out there...",1,104,257,8 May 2013
Oblivion," Maybe it's premature...
","...but i would call this already a typical Kosinski: derivative, unoriginal, uninspired and dumb. Ironically, Oblivion locks more like an artificial reality than Tron:Legacy does. The visuals are technically intriguing but nothing can help to camouflage the incredible amount of derivative moments: electronic score by M83 (almost sounds like Tron) and a lot of concepts and ideas from A Space Odyssey,Blade Runner, Avatar, the Matrix, Tron (of course...), etc.. Even Tom Cruise copies himself by wearing modeling jumpsuits and sunglasses, racing on bike, running like Tom Cruise, stiff and measured like in Collateral, etc. Oblivion is like a copy of copies of good ideas from others and Kosinski seems to believe that a different packaging makes a different product. The problem is, if you superglue so many different ideas without any narrative talent, the whole thing get's really dumb and boring because you do not really know what or who and what's all about. And that is quite surprising because the story should be very simple to tell considering how unoriginal it is. Déjà vu, confused by the movie, confused why a production with that budget couldn't find a better writer and director, confused why Kosinski got this job after he messed up the Tron franchise so badly... let's obliviate this one.",1,17,33,27 April 2013
Man of Steel," Superstealers
","It was obvious, that the reboot of the reboot of the Superman franchise must include a lot more modern ingredients than before. Clark Kent is a guy from the 1930's, at least his costume seems to belong to that era.So putting the guy in new clothes is one thing, the other is transporting the movie visuals and action in a temporary style that can compete with the latest Marvel universe blockbusters. So what is more obviously and a safe bet than stealing from every movie that fits somehow into the genre: Alien Invasion, INDEPENDENCE DAY, destroying the city: TRANSFORMERS, flying dragons: AVATAR, emotional flashbacks: GLADIATOR. Finally, the whole thing written by Nolan, gives you a - typical Nolan like - confusing and bloated pseudo intellectual story, of a flying Batman - Spider-man bastard thing saving the world of Gotham City or so.Obviously the whole thing was planed with military precision to be a financial success with the result, that Superman has lost his identity and charm which was probably unavoidable when you try to catapult a 80 year old concept into something fresh.Snyder bombards the audience with short emotional vs. action pieces without giving you enough time to reflect what kind of feelings he wants to transport. Like in a video game, there are always hints whats coming next so that the gamer/viewer does not get to frustrated with the many - Nolan like - boring lengthily dialogues.BTW some hints are quite hidden: the fuel tankers from the 'LexCorp'...The cast is quite good except Michael Shannon as Zod, who seems to be somehow rather hysterical than cool and mean. The score by Zimmer is bombastic. Overall the flick just o.k. with some bad moments.",3,8,16,17 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Now people, it's getting ridiculous!
","Imagine you buy a 100 pages super hero comic book and all you read is some 'amazing' private facts about the life of Peter Parker, the guy who's going to become the amazing Spiderman. You will be really pi**ed off! The good thing with the comic book, you can stop reading and throw it in a corner where your dog can grab it later. The bad thing with the movie, you have to sit through it.The problem seems to be: What to do with a $230,000,000 budget? Make just an action movie? Ohhh no, that is not enough, you have to reach the broadest target audience as possible. So your are starting to construct a plot that has everything in it: romance, love, desires, fears ... some action, but not too much, to reconcile every ingredient which makes your movie an attraction for all the boys and girls, families, whoever. How to construct an emotionally deep plot that every twilight fan-girl loves around a nerd who get's bitten by a radioactive spider and then transform into something spider-like himself and who likes to wear mesh stockings and a mask since then? You have NO chance, it MUST be full of clichés, otherwise your audience would not understand what the hell you are going to tell them. And for a $230,000,000 budget, you do not dare to copy just some lines from The Love Boat or so, Shakespeare's romeo and Juliet might be a more appropriate template.The result is this ridiculous mess of a movie. If Hollywood goes on with those super super hero movies, the actors will make them self redundant. Computer animated figures are totally sufficient for portraying such one dimensional and stupid industry mainstream characters. And that could look far better than the pushover in a latex costume we have here.",1,5,19,31 July 2012

Jurassic World," Godzilla Begins
","this is a poor attempt of a franchise reboot by mimicking every ingredient which made the - at least first 2 movies - so great but without embedding it in a halfway decent or even new plot. Everything was made after the typical remake recipe in it's most blatant way: bigger, louder & more. And just as well you can't camouflage that stupid attempt of a pure cash in, the plot itself makes no bones of it either: they engineered new dinos with only one perspective in mind, to make them bigger, louder & more.Even with the walnut brain of a T-Rex you immediately get a glue, what the movie is all about. And you get what you expect: machine guns & rockets against accidentally made mutant dinos. Even more than that, in an absurd He-man-ish scenery, the hero and brain mutated battle raptors are going to meet the XXL-Rex for an epic final fight. Silver helmets for the raptors with antennas would have completed this B.S. perfectly. Where are the action figures?What's next in the franchise?

Super 8," Cloverfield meets E.T. meets The Goonies, for Hillbillies from the master of allusion
","I'm a true hater of Jar Jar Abrams way of film making and i tell you why:Everything Abrams writes is a patchwork of allusions clued together by some light weighted side plots, mainly of inter human structure, to distract the audience from the illogicality and sloppiness of the 'main' plot which typically fits on a coaster. Thereby Abrams pits on the superficiality of curiosity and laziness of the audience, which is a zeitgeist phenomena of modern multimedia times.Here, there's an alien guy, who was captured by the military years ago, after he crashed his ship somewhere, and then mistreated in cruel experiments by unscrupulous army scientists, he just want's to go 'home', but he can't for some reasons. During a railway crash, he/it could escape and is now chased by the army. Finally because some kind words of a kid, the frustrated and very angry alien guy gains his faith back and decides to fly away in his space ship which only consists of little magnetic cubes and which rebuilds out of them in minutes. WTF? You might ask yourself right now, well that's the main plot on the coaster.Your Questions are probably: Why did the railway crash? A.: one of the army scientists who was involved in the cruel experiments has become a partisan supporter of the alien and tries to cause the railway crash with his pickup truck. The train rammed the truck with full speed, the train goes to pieces, the truck with his driver survives the crash somehow. Q.: Why, How? A.: Because it's in the script, the guy is there to tell the audience later what happened to the alien before. Q.: Why is the army transporting that huge super dangerous alien in a container wagon without any high security equipment or delta force guards? A.: It's in the script, otherwise the alien guy couldn't escape.The alien guy escapes to a near small town, where our Goonie-kids live. There he hides under a cemetery where he builds himself a huge cave labyrinth in 4 months, without ever catching the attention of the village people, for instance by noise or the huge amount of soil he had to clear away. Q.: ??, A.: keep watching, idiot!To escape from Earth the alien guy needs his ship, or, equivalent, the cubes, which form the ship. Lucky wise, all the cubes he needs were also transported with the train, and lucky wise, were spread all over the place, and, lucky wise or so, he could collect them somehow before the army or anybody else could find them after the crash. Well, ONE cube was found by one of the Goonies. The alien guy, though, puts all his cubes in the water tower of the village meanwhile. Q.: ???, why cubes?, why the water tower? A.: A good place where everybody could see the final scene of the movie and why not cubes, maybe Abrams likes Rubik's cubes *cough*! Q.: But didn't he want to hide himself? Carrying tons of cubes to the best visible place in town, as a spider like huge 5000kg alien might be 'a bit' risky hiding-wise, even at night, above all, the army is chasing you non stop! A.: Yep! Maybe it's so crazy that nobody is expecting it, you know, and that's the alien guy tactics? I dunno!!One of the Goonies discovers the covert of the alien guy, climbs down in the caves and tells the alien guy to check himself finally to take his ship and go.Q.: WTF? Why did HE find the covert, why did he climb down?, His ship, what...? A.: 1. He's a Goonie, 2. His girlfriend Pauline was kidnapped by Donkey Kong before, so he tries to rescue her. 3. Even without an universal translator but some telepathy, the motivational words of the kid solved the whole movie. And well, yeah there'r some drama 'serious' plot things going on, the father of the girl is an addicted choleric, the boys mother had died, so these kids are kind of 'aliens' in their world too, other fat boys sister is a slut, bla, bla, all together a 'typical' social scenario of the average Spielberg Americans, we all can identify with (?). BTW, lens flare fanatics will be also very happy again.Q.: What do Abrams and Spielberg have in common? A.: Spielberg nuked the fridge, Abrams wrecked the train! The both jumped the shark long time ago!",1,3,5,25 August 2013
Thor," Thor's roid rage
","It seems to me that the studio tested who would be the right team for the upcoming future superhero movies with the Thor in it. Result so far: except Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins nobody who's work had to do something with this movie should work at another one.The casting was terrible, the Asgard-fellows ???, Portman as a scientist is so wrong as casting Schwarzenegger as Miss Marple, the rest of her film family-fellows ?, Kat Dennings, is she an actress? (she can't act, that's for sure).The CGI, O MG, colorful - more colorful - Asgard. Asgard looked like a LSD-trip of Henri Matisse, a convoluted mess of styles, with ornamented overloaded pseudo technology. The design was awful, ALL the action scene CGI's looked very unrealistic due to the obviously very untalented transformation of motion captures. The storm scenes where very poorly executed. Thankfully most of the Frost Giant stuff was kept in a dark blue, so one cannot see the bad CGI so clearly, and, it's cheaper to produce too.The plot?! Why Frost Giants? Why the epic war nonsense with the Frost Giants? The Result is a plain simple and stupid palace intrigue, one brother against the other, one (the good one) banned by the father whilst the other (the evil one) obtains by fraud the goodwill.How does Thor get his powers back? Because the hammer decided to fly back to him after he's proofed himself worthy? What did he do, he just got punched in the face by a robot. I do not get it.Conveniently, in Asgard they speak 21 century English, so there is no language barrier for Thor. He knows what jeans, cars and cell phones are but he's no glue that in a breakfast restaurant there are no body servants at your command. Well you can script a 'funny' scene around that BS, but every 8 year old could do that, and better! Everything was very predictable, i mean, how would such a intrigue end in every child's mind? The good one wins, the bad get's punished or dies. So here we only have one white hat and one black hat, nothing in between, very simple, very very stupid.Because of that, the movie quickly becomes very boring. It ends nowhere, who cares about the characters love interests, because there was no character development at all. The sound fx are mediocre, the score is terrible, badly timed and completely overblown.As the Selvig character said in one scene, Thor had just a roid rage. And now it's over and he's back home again, thank the goods.",1,8,17,5 May 2012

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Star Wars Myth busted...
","by George Lucas himself.That has been said often enough by 'older' star wars fans like me, that the 25 year old trilogy is by far better than the new one.I disliked that movie a lot. Watching the 'original' 25 year old trilogy it feels like you really dive into the story line. Every character was developed over the three parts so that the viewer was able to identify with the each character in a certain situation. I remember when we kids where talking about star wars at the schoolyard. Every one wanted to be certain character like the evil Darth Vader, the good and brave Luke or the handsome daredevil Han Solo.In the 'new' trilogy you do not identify with the Characters, you just watch them acting, from an emotional distance, surrounded by a world you do not understand: The Council, the Senat, the guild, the clone army, the droid army, the republic,even the scrolling intro text at the beginning makes you press a pause button and thinking WTF do they want to tell ?? Who does what, when and why ?? The story line is very weak and only the action scenes may catch your attention for what is going on or who is fighting against each other. The whole story seems to be something like 'Darth Vader- the early years' Obi Wan or Yoda are not developed at all, there seem to be not present. Go and asked the kids who do they want to be: Obi Wan ?, Padme ?, Master What was his name? No. The only Character with identity is Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader. And even this is poorly developed. Can the viewer comprehend the Characters mood or emotions? NO, Lucas has to 'explain' the emotions to the viewer: Look here, tears running over his face so he is sad, you see ?! His voice is going deep down and grumbling, so he is angry, you see !? This is soap opera level, but the lowest one! It seems like Lucas is trying some shoes which are out of his league. He tries to give his story more weight by making it somehow complex with connective plot lines: Yoda is a friend of Chewbacca,R2 is the droid of Anakin, Senator Organa is the stepfather of Leia, Jabba is the aunt of Han Solo, Chewbacca is the father of ... this is so wonderful surprising and involved, isn't it?NO,IT IS NOT! There is no tension at all! Whereas in the old trilogy, it was unexpected and exciting to realize how the things turn out. Here is just plain boring. Who didn't know from the very first beginning that Ian McDiarmid is the Emperor? Ah,... yes Yody is a friend of Chewbacca, you didn't know that, right ? Lucas ruined his legend as a story writer or tale-teller. Lucas ruined the Star Wars myth by degrading it to a soap opera. The old Star Wars was gold, the final trilogy turned it into plastic. You consume it and throw it away. If the old trilogy would have exist, the new trilogy would have been a major box office flop. R.I.P Star Wars",1,13,24,2 March 2008
Inception," an intellectual challenging movie for people, who can't speak in relative clauses.
","But not for me. The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a 'kick' that Nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot. The plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an 'intellectual' challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next:How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically, physically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their unconscious dreams and execute them there? Etc., Etc.I can't help it, but Nolan is one of the few directors in Hollywood who can direct any script as tedious as you can imagine. There are so many moments in that movie where i thought Wow, that could have been much more suspenseful if, for instance, Cameron or so had directed it.This movie is stupid. You can make a stupid plot 'intelligent' by nesting it multiple times, it just multiplies its stupidity. In this sense the next Nolan movie could be a even greater 'masterpiece' for meat heads: when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow, but this time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in the.....that's challenging isn't it?",1,49,92,5 December 2011

Even in the pilot's glass cabin, there is an earth like gravity field. Q: Why a glass cabin for a 2.5 year interplanetary space flight?? A: Because at the arrival some idiots can 'see' the target planet and than point to a landing zone which has some interesting 'lines'. The whole set design looks like a mixture of Space 1999 and 2001. There are red blinking alarm bars and pleather pads everywhere, oh and HAL, of course. Inside the ship are huge spaces just for the purpose to talk to the crew sitting on camp-chairs. Everyone of the crew would easily fit into a Goonies scheme, mostly mentally unstable and infantile. (like J.J.Abrams would mimic Spielberg). The equipment of the crew doesn't use any gravity tools at all, except some flying scanner 'balls'. Maybe they should have put some gravity generators in vehicles too, instead of driving them without any exploration or consistence test through an totally unknown rough terrain no men has been before??The whole trillion $ mission crew all together couldn't even win a pre-nursery school science contest. After they did some very very stupid things obviously with the purpose to screw the mission so badly<ul><li>so that you could tell an idiotic story about it - they are chased by some p*-off angry aliens.</li></ul>One of it, a squid or so, was 'born' by one crew member! Yeah, That's what you would expect in an 'Alien' movie, right? So, born as a little squid, this thing crows within hours into something 500 kg menacing big by eating ... what? Furniture?? Sucking at a socket, gaining mass by e = mc² or something??? All you can tell, it hadn't any crew member for lunch, so far!This alone is so epic moronic, that only ONE person in Hollywood could write such BS: Yes, you name it: Damon Laurence Lindelof! Ruining Star Trek is probably not enough for this hack.Then you shouldn't scratch your head any further, when you see two of the Goonie-scientists running away from a donut-shaped space ship falling down on them and guess what, yes, they're both (!) getting hit by it. Ohh, i should mention that the alien space ship got hit by the Prometheus before, which accelerated with it's ion-rocket engine. Yeeees, folks that's Lindelof science again. In the year 2092, we have gravity generators and ion-engines with gigantic propulsive forces. Maybe it's that technical advance that people got stupid as batsh*t meanwhile. You could continue with those Lost-like cliffhanger idiocy for every single minute in the movie or just stop it here an say: This crap doesn't deserve the big screen or any audience at all.Seems like Scott dropped the ball completely.",1,55,94,10 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Cheating Rises
","again.I won't comment on the movie as such in detail because i am not willing to compare to people who are paid for writing fake reviews just for marketing purpose. The IMDb rating has become a hoax over the time. In this case here, it's getting really ridiculous because too many cheated reviews were written in advance to compensate possible negative reviews. By implication this means, even the makers know that the movie is not that good, or, as a prospectively rule for IMDb-ratings:The higher the rating at the beginning, the more it was required.bottom line: This is still a superhero movie with a blown up pseudo deep dramatic plot around a, well, super hero in a latex costume. Contrary to a really emotional connection of the characters to the audience there are still the super powers and the silly latex costume. If you are trying to transform God or Jesus to an everybody with everybody problems you are always doing somethings silly or comedic.Therefore any super hero movie can't be a frigging 'masterpiece' and it shouldn't be rated as such.",1,35,66,29 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Long Time Ago . . .
","... but somehow it's unfortunately real in the present. I am completely shocked. My worst concerns came true. But to be honest to myself: what should i have expected from the master of empty and shallow mystery boxes, Jar Jar Abrams?? The talentless hack who gave us completely retarded movies like Super8 (train wreck) or Star Trek (Power Rangers on Warp speed)Remember the discussion about the childish stupid design of Kylo Ren's light saber? This was one of the first hints, how badly Jar Jar Abrams gonna screw this up .Everything that was halfway plausible in the original movies (no Midi-chlorians, of course)is now crippled to a chowder of references, obviously with the purpose to expand the range of the target audience from 5-95 y. (To be fair, yes Lucas did similar by including the Ewoks, but it made sense somehow). Here, everything comes from the 'wouldn't it be cool if' think tank. E.g. Han Solo is wearing exactly the same clothes he did 32 years ago. Yeah, how cool is that? Did i mention the stupid light saber design? The large Millennium Falcon escaping from much smaller Tie-Fighters by flying through narrow caverns where the Tie-Fighters crash but not the Falcon. BTW there is no reason, why the Falcon should fly into a Star Destroyer wreck to shake the Tie-Fighters whilst the Falcon can fly much faster than any Tie-Fighter, etc.... Well there's a lot more of it. Wait until you realize, what happened to Luke Skywalker, mysteryyy...not! This is not your father's Star Wars ... the last time they said this about the reboot of the beloved Star Trek franchise, it was the end of the franchise as we knew it.",1,106,204,16 December 2015
Contact," one of the dumbest movies ever
","O.K. so there is that capsule which makes a Einstein Twin Paradox kind of travel with a time dilatation effect. Hours for someone in the capsule appear as milliseconds for the rest. The whole movie and the whole arc of suspense is based on the fact, that nobody believes Mrs. Foster what she experienced during her voyage. Why?Because no one of the rocketheads never ever thought about of putting a simple f****** CLOCK in that capsule or any kind of chronometer !!! How stupid is that???They took a tedious time to find out finally that there is a video tape record which lasts for some hours. This is Hollywood for the (very retarded) masses. This Foster movie is in the same league of foolishness as Flightplan for instance.",1,34,78,7 July 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," tinnitus for your eyes
","Another pornographic abuse of the technical possibilities of modern film making from the master of eyegasm, Michael Bay. The whole purpose of that animated slide show is to feed up your senses with a surrealistic flood of non-stop stimulations for your eyes and ears and to paralyze your brain with a nonsense story so that you can sit out this war against niveau.Honestly, where would Michael Bay be without a decent CGI department with a decent budget? Could you imagine the same movie with the same plot and actors would have been made with low-grade FX: winner of the razzie award in all categories! Same with all Bay-movies for sure!I guess sooner or later, the audience will get Bay-fatigue. And a good script will always work without 3D glasses and THX-Sound. A few people can master a good script and up to date CGI, for instance James Cameron is one of them, whereas Michael Bay can not.",1,20,41,4 July 2011
The Martian," lame copy of very old ideas
","to name a few: Robinson Crusoe, Mission To Mars (2000), Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) whereas Andy Weir's novel is a blatant theft of those ideas as well as it is the script of The Martian, . . . etc.To give the very unoriginal story some gravity, the prominent cast obviously was the means of choice. This movie was solely developed as a typical Hollywood cash cow with pretty faces and implausibly characters. Scott's attempt of pseudo-realistic 'science' suffers from the same symptoms as it did Prometheus: stupidity on all levels.Scott said, The Martian is about people of all kind combining their sources and powers. Well, this is quite pathetic for a bunch of very unoriginal ideas glued together. Maybe Scott recently watched some Star Trek episodes or Apollo 13 (1995) to get 'some' inspirations . . .I guess it's time to avoid Ridley Scott movies from now on.",1,47,98,6 October 2015
