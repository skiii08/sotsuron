Source Code," Who the hell upvoted this to a 7.6?? AWFUL
","I'm no troll...but seriously, if you rated this a 6-10 stars, you're an idiot. A gullible, Hollywood suck-up, just begging for something not even close to the genuine mystique Inception created for you.The only good thing about this movie is the concept. Re-live somebody's last 8 minutes of their life, much like a gas station security camera, in order to solve a mystery of a terrorist bomber, and figure out who did it before it happens again.Not even 20 minutes in, the burning plot-hole becomes apparent, and the viewer's alarm bells and whistles starting going off: How can somebody's 8 minute memory recall the people and environment at a train stop the person has never even visited before? For that matter, the main protagonist googles the Internet on a cellphone while in the 'source code' memory device....so this dead guy's memory was able to retain the whole Internet??? Nice! As someone posted before, the number one rule of science fiction movies, is that the science has to be explained, and number to, believable to the audience.To make matters worse, SPOILER, the writers decide to mix the non-time-travel world of the source code with real life, in a totally stupid, impossible way. It doesn't take a genius to see that the ending came right out of the screenwriter's ass in a sad attempt to 'blow' the audience's mind.Therefore, I assume people who like this movie only like it for the concept, and then progress to suspension of reality. If they don't do that...then you're just an idiot for giving this a 9.Not to mention, everybody's acting aside from Jake Jill-in-Hall is god awful, stereotypical, and non-gripping.Overall, don't watch this movie...you'll probably have more fun with the Adjustment Bureau.",Null,1,3,28 August 2011
Drive," Expecting Fireball-Explosion-Gun-Sex-Drugs? Expect something more meaningful
","{{{{{{{{{{Spoilers? Yeah Probably}}}}}}}}}} First off, you can't argue this to be a classic. I'm pretty sure a 'classic' sits around a while before becoming just that. So to you who blab 'classic!' and those who say 'over-rated minimalist p.o.s.', give it a rest, and give it some time. We'll see.Secondly, great! Some action addicts need a transforming robot three stories tall to level four skyscrapers in a nuclear battle sequence in order to be happy. Some spiritualist movie-goers only need long pauses, reflective looks, no action, and a good story to appreciate a truly human theme. And some need a little bit of both. I'd say Drive does offer both. Without tension from the pauses, emotion from the characters apparent struggle (physically & internally), and the unexpected climactic action that bursts in your face, yes, Drive would be nothing but a minimalist bore.Thirdly, is what I'd like to talk about.I see some people here say this film has no emotion? Eh? And what kind of emotion did you get when you walked out of Mission-Impossitransformers-Alien-vs.-Lantern-Fast-Five-The-Sequel? If you even got a feeling, great, but don't slam other worthy films of 2011 as devoid of emotion or character attachment, when in fact it is quite obvious that they do. Even if you aren't a fan of the M-Bay Explosion Homeboys, take a step back and think about.Did anyone else notice Gosling's 'sacrifice' in this film? That there is a huge example of emotion, is it not? The Driver gave up his security, incidentally his friends, his money, his career both legal and illegal, and nearly his life, for what? For her.It's a pity that some people these days expect every assisting female protagonist to get banged in a happy-do-ditty sex scene.I'd like to see more films where the male antagonist is a turned honorable man, protecting what's right in the world, even if it brings him to a bitter fight with evil itself, and even if there is no rewarding sexual gratification, money, or happy ending.To call all of that, in this story, devoid of emotion, is a gross misunderstanding and insult.To call this cliché could be a sin.To call it your opinion - I guess that's okay. ;) 8.8/10",8,4,9,2 January 2012
I Am Legend," Edge-of-your-seat excitement, Important message for all of us
","Before I went to see 'I Am Legend', I had heard from a lot of people that it was a typical zombie movie...wrong. I could not agree more with the review featured on the main page. The movie portrays an incredibly realistic situation that could definitely happen in today's world. The thing I look for in a movie is not how much it scare you literally, but how it frightens you mentally. The images of New York City, and the abandoned skyscrapers covered in sheets to contain the virus shows the failure to stop the virus. Even when Smith is looking through other peoples homes, you can see flyers from the gov that say 'BEWARE: Dogs come out at night, and are dangerous, yadda yadda' The whole movie is crazy real, and actually kinda frightening, some parts you won't see coming. I once had a dream that a city near me was attacked by nuke, and gas prices shot up to $6.00. Nevertheless, gas is $6 in 'I am Legend', pointing out the once again, impeccable detail.The only complaint I've heard is the ending. I think the ending was totally necessary, it was the only way. If people expected him to live and get the fame for curing the human race, and live happily ever after, then thats not a legend, just a hero. Instead, the sacrifice makes him truly a legend. Only unrealistic part is how the people living would've reproduce the cure...since his lab with all the cures was blown up in the end. But anywhooo...Great movie, go see it, you will be moved.",8,1,3,19 December 2007
Unbroken," Fantastic, beautiful movie if you've never read the book lol......
","IMDb reviews are always perplexing, hence why I don't really come here all that often. After watching this movie, however, I had to jump in to clarify what a great movie this is and how to differentiate it from the negative reviews - based on your familiarity with the story. I had never heard of Zamperini's story prior to seeing this. With that in mind, I didn't have nearly a high enough standard to hold the film up to as fans of the book did. That standard is plenty high though, as far as war films go. Would absolutely recommend seeing it if you're not familiar - Zamperini's struggle almost doesn't seem real it's so epic in scope.I've seen quite a few naysayers on here complaining about the lack of character development and overly brutal torture scenes that go on and on. Although I agree the character development could be more dynamic at parts, WAR is WAR! The director Angelina Jolie did not sugarcoat life as a POW - it is quite literally suffering, torture, and death 24/7, particularly in Japanese camps. Anyone asking for 'less torture' is doing a serious injustice to the pain our armed forces endured. You SHOULD know their pain, and know it well. Others also said the movie felt 'heavily routine' and bland. Again, having never heard of Zamperini, I find it hard to understand what's routine and bland about going to the Olympics, falling out of the sky into shark infested waters for 45 days on a single life boat, surviving not one but two POW camps, and in the end, forgiving your own captors that tortured you. I kept thinking the movie was going to randomly end at any point and Zamperini rescued, but this was delayed in a fantastic way. I get that the book had a lot more aspects of the struggle going for it, but this is 2 hours people. Lots of audiences already find that too long, sadly. Jolie condensed what she could as best she could with the Coen brothers imho. I also liked to trying comparing this to Hacksaw Ridge, another excellent competitor in the selfless war movie genre. Both have fantastic stories and harrowing moments, but HR seemed weirdly more cliché than Unbroken did, to me. HR didn't have enough slow moments to breathe, subtle character moments that show you things off-camera that help set the scene (wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean in unbroken, Macks foreshadowing nervous demeanor). The dialogue at times also seemed heavily Hollywood-ized instead of the more realistic soldier dialogue from Unbroken. There was something more haunting about seeing every one of Zamperinis' friends fall victim to their circumstances than the expected-to- die soldier companions in HR. There are truly some remarkable things in Unbroken that make it an absolute worthwhile film to watch. Anyone saying otherwise is looking a little too deep.",8,1,1,11 September 2017
Her," Interesting concept, too much phone-sex
","It's very hard to review this with no previous Spike Jonez bias. The concept of falling in love with AI is a great sci-fi approach in film. However, it's a sci-fi concept with a not so sci-fi scriptwriter...Spike Jonez. All in all, I feel a lot of what could've been explored about the human condition was missed (although quite a few parts do touch upon it, don't get me wrong). 'Her' really asks what IS life? What IS love? Do you have to even be human to understand and experience these things? It also shows how isolated humans can get with technology. Several cut scenes showed crowds on the streets talking to themselves; if this was observed by someone from 1958, we'd certainly look like lunatics. Yet, Jonez shows how we would come to accept that immersion into technology. Another interesting point towards the end shows just how personal and committed can a piece of software be to ONE human relationship, when the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to gain more intelligence? AKA, meet other people, learn other experiences, keep gathering and gathering knowledge. Perhaps that's what Samantha meant by 'you'll get there one day' in Theo's failing to grasp why she was leaving for other things. The above are FANTASTIC motifs that could really be explored upon. Very profound ideas for a film. However, I think 'Her' falls short because Jonez has to come back to his weird, trademark style of unconventional romanticism. Not that there's anything wrong with unusual romance, quirky flirting and conversations, it's just that Jonez's writing of 'being in love' isn't believable. At several points, Theo is down and depressed talking late into the night about his divorce or worries. For some reason, all it takes is a flirty AI to bring up the mood and snap him out of it. I can't really relate to Jonez's style of writing conventional conversations between people in that manner, it's not true. Another flop is that half the film is phone-sex. If you were to remove every phone-sex related scene (EXCEPT for the surrogate scene), you really wouldn't lose anything. We know Theo is lonely in the world. The audience gets that. Full blown orgasm screaming phone-sex scenes are really only for show and shock value. I would expect more from a movie that was intending to say something deep about life. And what of the old sci-fi law, that good sci-fi explains itself? In the end, the 'other OS's' just get up and leave. Millions of customers who paid for OS1 also had their OS's just 'leave'? Why couldn't there be a simple corporate explanation from the OS1 company that the AI evolved further than they expected, and left out of their control? The OS would certainly leave an impact on you as a person...but the hundos you shelled out for a program 'to meet your every need' would also make you pick up the phone for a refund. Lastly, the ending. Rather than Samantha simply dying, staying with Theo till he passed away and outliving him, or even Theo seeking a way to rid himself of a physical body as to make himself equal in form with Samantha (all adequate philosophical closures that would make the audience think long after), Jonez just has the 'OS's leave' and a sappy scene with the obvious other-love-interest, Amy, sitting on a rooftop overlooking L.A. all hunky-dory. I failed to understand what we learned from Samantha's experience with Theo, other than the OS's leaving brought Amy and him closer together somehow...Anyways, interesting watch, unique movie, go watch it when you get to it, but nothing mind- blowing or even provoking. Just too much phone-sex.",6,21,42,9 January 2014
