The Perks of Being a Wallflower," all time favorite
","I loved perks. Chbosky did an amazing job and he couldn't have chosen a better cast list. Logan Lerman and Emma Watson are perfect, Ezra miller is fabulous. Logan Lerman played his character extremely well, and Emma Watson did amazing, you wouldn't even suspect she was British at all! Ezra Miller played my favorite character Patrick and he was perfect. Reading the book, I was picturing who would be good for him and Ezra miller was picture perfect for the part. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be, it's not your typical coming to age high school movie, unlike most it is so easy to relate to not only teens but adults the same. I'm so glad he did the movie adaptation rather than some other producer because I really don't think anyone could have done a more beautiful job. Kudos to you Stephen Chbosky.",9,1,3,30 June 2013
