Scarface," Great entertaining movie
","This movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable. The violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film. The ending is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever. Great movie and you will probably really enjoy it.",10,0,1,22 October 2003
The Italian Job," Great FLick
",This movie was soooooo good. I loved every minute of it. There wasn't a single boring scene in the whole movie and the whole thing was loads of fun. The action scenes were incredible and i loved how they didn't depend on cgi to make all the action scenes look cool. Great job by everyone on the film. THis is in my opinion the best movie of the summer so far.,10,0,3,7 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," awesome movie
","This movie is soooooo cool. It has a great story and keeps you intrigued through out the whole movie. The movie takes time to get exciting but I thought that was going to happen since this is the first part of the trilogy. The action is incredible and is audience pleasing, so be prepared to get excited.",10,1,1,13 January 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Great fun film
","This movie is tons of fun to watch. Caper movies are always fun to watch and this one does the job. Tons of humour, great cast and a heist which will blow your mind. I would have liked to see Julia Roberts more in the film but it's made up by the set up of the heist. Everyone is perfectly class and has some very funny scenes. Great job",10,0,0,7 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Entertaining and very exciting
","This movie was brought up as a Summer movie. That is what I think hurt this movie. If this movie was made to get an R rating I think it would have been much better, but it was made for the wrong audience which hurt its' significance. If a more historical aspect was put into it, it might have been a better film. That said, it was still very entertaining. The love triangle subplot was a good plot to set up the attack on pearl harbor, but the historical information should have had a bigger role for the set up for the attack. The acting is really great in the film and has very entertaining characters which make us care about them. When the action starts it's incredible. ALl the explosions, all the pump up lines, make any guy excited when watching this film. The recreation of the attack is perfectly set up but the whole pump up lines that the characters say when there about to fight back ruin the dramatic affect of the film because it makes it too much fun to watch. In my opinion Michael Bay should not have directed this picture. A more experienced director like Ridley Scott or James Cameron should have made this because they would have done more justice to the attack and it might have garnered some big time awards. Overall it was a good job by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, who tired their best in making a big time epic but failed unfortunately.",8,0,1,25 January 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," excellent film
","This movie is probably one of the best movies i've ever seen. Cutting this movie into two was a brilliant idea as seeing the whole thing at once would probably ruin the picture as their will be way too much action in it. It would be a complete andrenaline overload and this would have affected the movie. The action in the first part was awesome and very exciting to watch. The scenes in between with the story getting set in motion was intersting to watch and very cool. The story of lucy liu in the movie was very cool too but really violent. This movie isn't as violent as people say it is. Even though people get chopped up from limb to limb, it's comically done so that it isn't realistic and just silly. Definitely buy this movie on dvd cuase it is a classic.",10,0,1,13 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Great entertaining movie
",This movie is really cool and well done. The action is awesome to watch and the acting is great too. The gore and blood was a little to much but it was so stupid you just had to laugh at it. This is probably one of Tarantino's more entertaining films,10,0,1,13 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," pretty good
","This movie was very entertaining and had great acting. The movie deserved the best director and best supporting actress but did not deserve the best picture. With all the inaccuracies in this movie that i've been hearing about, it does not honor John Nash in this movie. Even though this is just a movie, it's in my opinion that a movie shoujld not be awarded for changing someone's life and making it entertaining. The Lord of the Rings should have gotten the best picture or even Black Hawk Down, which was unfortunately not nominated. Russel Crowe was very good in this movie and really brough John Nash to life.",7,0,1,25 March 2002
X2: X-Men United," excellent movie
","This is one of the better movies to come out this summer. It was a very entertaining film, showing how one person's act can categorise people into being all the same. Great action in the picture and has also great special affects. Very good story too",10,0,0,25 November 2003
