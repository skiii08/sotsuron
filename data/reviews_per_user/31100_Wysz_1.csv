Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was better than I expected.
","I heard from some friends that the movie wasn't that good and there was too much hype, so I walked into the theater already critical, but I still loved it. It was different enough from the others to be original, but there was no doubt that it was a part of the Star Wars saga with its style and numerous subtle connections to episodes 4, 5, and 6. I liked how some scenes were shot like they were in the other movies. The special effects mixed perfectly into the movie without taking away from the story.  If you are considering watching the film, see it.",10,0,0,23 May 1999
