The Ring," Great Movie!
","Great movie! Mainly for the fact the it was a north American horror that in fact wasn't stupid. it was scary but not in the north American scary (blood and gore everywhere) but in a real sense of the word. Excellent! It had a good story line and wasn't strait forward - you had to put the pieces of the puzzel together- i loved it. i would recommend this movie to anyone who can stand an actually good horror movie. THIS MOVIE IS A MUST BUY. Rent it first believe me you'll be buying it next. (I'd rate it my favorite horror movie EVER anyday!) And with the newly released sequel (The Ring Two) this series will go down in history I'm out,Schlik",10,1,1,25 June 2005
