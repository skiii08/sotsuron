The Sound of Music," One big happy... song!
","This is my all time favorite movie. I just love the story, the characters, the singing.. everything. And it makes it even better, that the story is true. It wasn't some rich Hollywood-fellow with a big cigar who invented this family. They are true! The songs are great, and after seeing the movie twice, you are able to sing along with most of them. I don't have a favorite song, because one song isn't a song without the others. Perhaps the love story is a bit phony, but that is how the romantics like it. It gives us a bit of hope, that love is out there, and we can get it too... even though we're only poor nuns, with a simple guitar ;)",9,3,10,25 May 2005
Troy," It hurts!
","The only reason I saw this film, was because my friend said: 'You just have to see this one, it is too bad to miss!' So I did. And I must say that I was very disappointed! The only thing that makes this film worth seeing is Brad Pitt in action and chicken-Orlando! It is a sad sad story, and it hurts when the people, you have just started to get to know, dies. The actors are great, but acting is not everything in a film. There simply is no substance in this film. And that also makes me sad, because the true story about Troy, is actually very interesting. I can only recommend it to the fans of Brad Pitt... and if you liked Orlando in the Lord of the rings, then don't watch this movie! You'll regret it.",4,4,20,25 May 2005
