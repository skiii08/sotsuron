It," Best King film adaptation ever.
","I'm a huge King fan. Read all but 2 or 3 of his novels and read It, The Stand and The Dark Tower series 3 times each at least. Everything written by Stephen King made into a movie or film usually bites. This movie was great. It doesn't wait teasingly showing just a little here and there. It gets right to the gore and the horror just and keeps going. It also adds some modern pieces that fit fantastically. Those that saw this and say they don't like King: why then, you went to a movie you knew you're not going to like. Go home. Be quite. ThanksThose saying it doesn't follow the book:
1. yeah, it's in the 90's instead of the 60's like the book. That's better for me because it speaks to the time I read the book the first time.2. Pay attention to cinematography ever? The graininess, style and colors of this movie are so 50's and 60's you're blind if you don't see it from the opening scene. Especially at the end with the bright greens and pastel blue sky.That's about it. Just my opinion. Like all the real-world Pennywise's that litter the internet for real now, most of whom spend their time on the internet thinking their tired un-asked jaded opinions even matter and whine about any and everything like a bunch of diaper rashed babies. See if it you want, or don't. Who cares.",10,0,2,24 February 2018
