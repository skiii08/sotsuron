The Blair Witch Project," One thing that irritated me
","I enjoyed this film immensely. It seems more intelligent than your average fright-flick with the most haunting image being that of Mike, facing the wall (see it again and you'll see what I mean. Neat image huh?)and how power and trust can be diffused and eventually destroyed within a group. Sometimes team work doesn't work at times of high stress.But one thing bugs me. With all this technology at hand, couldn't these idiots manage a mobile phone between them. I mean common sense would dictate that if you are going out in the middle-of-nowhere then at least one of you should have a mobile, just for safety's sake. Can anyone tell me why this was the case?",8,0,0,21 November 1999
Dawn of the Dead," Very good, but not iconic
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*I had low hopes for this film, considering that the original Dawn of the Dead is my favourite horror. I was rather pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying this.Where it differs for the original is that it lacks that movies political angle on consumerism and greed. In that movie the zombies go to the mall because it was something they used to do. In this version they go to the mall to eat people. And that's it. No political motivation or satire on American consumer culture. Let's call this re-make (or re-imagining) a zombie movie for the MTV generation.Thats not to say the re-make has its faults. With the exception of Michael or Kenneth there is really is no sympathetic character to latch onto - most seem to fall into one-dimensional stereotypes such Steve the selfish one or Andre the street punk who is finally wiseing up to responsibilities. I could not really handle Ana at all - what was the point of her character? I figure she was there to have someone the audience could identify with - the average person who is caught up with something way beyond their control. However her behaviour seems odd. She seems to figure out what's happening and then going all gooey and showing reluctance to use that knowledge for the benefit of the group? Huh? And what exactly was that ending about? Shades of Cannibal Holocaust here with the filming of the fate(?) of the final survivors. Personally I would have left a more enigmatic ending with the final fadeout of them going to a destination unknown.Still what's the point of carping about what is a very good and entertaining film. It may lack the human frailties of the original and the iconic zombie figure. I suppose that's the message - when we become a zombie no one stands out.8 out of 10.",8,0,0,28 March 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Home Movies
","Why do I feel cheated. I tend not to believe film critics and make up my own mind about how good or bad a movies is. This time they are right. This was unbelievably bad. Absolutely awful.Put it like this. When I go to a friends house, I would resent having to pay admission to watch their home movies made with their buddies swanning around some major European capitals looking cool and mugging at the camera whilst going through some makeshift plot.Yet this is what a major studio has given us. Steven Soderbergh has put together a two-hour snooze of a picture, filming some of his buddies obviously having a good time with some artsy camera shots and editing tricks designed to push along the caper movie. Instead this film never thrills and I ended up wishing I got the hell out of there at the two-thirds point.This was about the point at which Julia Roberts plays Tess plays Julia Roberts made you think that we were inside some Hollywood inside joke so inside that it made sense to those up on the screen. Add a completely pointless cameo by Bruce Willis then you kind of get the picture.Morally dubious, a waste of some good actors (Clooney, Damon, Gould), some more exposure for bad ones (why is Catherine Zeta-Jones famous? Try and count how many times her Welsh accent disappears and re-appears), this film is a total waste of time from start to finish.1 out of 10 (and I'm being generous)",1,0,1,5 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode 1 but
","that does not say that Episode II is that much of an improvement.It should have been.But it wasn't and how many reasons do you need to classify a film as bad?For a start let's take a look a Lucas' contribution to this whole mess of a movie. Namely his script and his direction.With regard to his script, Lucas ain't exactly Shakespeare. In fact he isn't even Ed Wood or Robin Moore. At least with Ed Wood, his bad scripts had the factor that they were done in complete sincerity. With this George Lucas script we don't even get the sincerity. Lucas seems to believe that he is writing a masterpiece for the ages.So we get some real clunker dialogue with the real zingers being delivered by our star-crossed lovers Amidala and Anakin, done with all the intensity of a read through rehearsal. Their romantic banter was embarrassing with their relationship being conducted with the white hot intensity of an arctic winter. Do we honestly believe that these are the two most essential characters who will shape the destiny of an entire galaxy?
Also, do alien beings really say 'Mom' and 'Dad'? For a galaxy far, far away, some of the characters seem to come from downtown.Then there's Lucas the director. What made Episodes 5 & 6 good was that the script and direction were farmed out to different writers and directors who brought their own vision of Lucas' universe to the screen. What we have here is Lucas' baby and this is his vision. And it does not feel real. The direction drags and the plot exposition seems to only exist to move the characters from one set-piece to another to show us how great and advanced the special FX are in this scene. Even the climatic battle scene feels truncated as though somebody got lost for ideas.Indifferent acting didn't help (though armed with that script, do you really wonder why?). The two young leads were wooden, Ewan McGregor posted in his performance, Ian McDiarmid had little interest in his dialogue and character, Pernilla August must have been on set for all of a day for all that she contributed to the plot and we found out that Stormtroopers have New Zealand accents.So what was to like. Christopher Lee, who seemed to realise how ridiculous the whole exercise was and outacted everybody, which wasn't difficult. Then there was the CGI and special FX. Very spectacular but I was too aware that it was special FX. I couldn't lost in the whole fantasy and the magic that should been there wasn't.Yoda could kick arse but his fight with the Count and Yoda's bouncing around felt like an out-take from Muppets in Space. One almost expected Miss Piggy to turn up with a light sabre and a well-placed karate chop.So I was disappointed. Lucas has got to go a long way in Episode 3 to tie up all the loose ends in his story. Perhaps this time, he will give it to a more talented writer and director.Stars: 3 out of 10 (begrudgingly)",3,0,1,18 May 2002
The Fast and the Furious," A perfect metaphor for L.A...
","In that this film can be described in three simple words: Big, Loud and above all, Pointless.The story was barely beyond one-dimensional (the ending was so so telegraphed, it defies description) as was the acting. Paul Walker find another profession or you will end in the roles that Wings Hauser would turn down.On the upside, there were the car stunts, which were stunning and my marks for this film is because of those stunts only.2 out of 10 for the stunts. A flat zero for everything else.",2,2,5,23 September 2001
Man on the Moon," What made the man tick?
","As one of the few Brits to have heard of Andy Kaufman before his death in 1984, I was intrigued at this biopic of him as played by Jim Carrey.To be sure it was a good movie, with a first-class performance by Carrey, but I felt a feeling of detachment from this film. I feel we never really ever got to see the real Kaufman in this biopic. Instead it relied on the old standby of the 'misguided genius' and that the world never really understood what made Kaufman tick. After this movie, which attempted to explain what made Kaufman tick, never got near to what I feel made Kaufman tick. The real story of Kaufman, has I feel, yet to be told.Marks **1/2 out of 5 (just for Carrey's performance).",6,0,0,8 May 2000
The Descent," Going underground
","This is the stuff nightmares are made of.Imagine being trapped underground with your closest friends and some not very nice creatures preying on you. Then see those who you thought were your friends splinter and the group dynamic fall apart in a welter of gore and primal survival.This is the basic premise of Neil Marshall's 'The Descent'. Its a very visceral film which meanders along for the first 60 minutes after the initial shocking car accident and then explodes into life with the appearance of the Crawlers (imagine Gollums nastier country cousins).From the outset Marshall makes us sympathise with the group especially Sarah (whose character grows throughout the film), who loses her husband and daughter in the first few minutes and even with Juno, the 'villain' who is weighed down by guilt of a big secret, whose recklessness gets the group into this mess in the first place. I personally found Beth's death the most upsetting. Her character was the most sympathetic. Marshall does a good job in setting up the group dynamic in such a way as to make us care about them. Its because of his good writing here and its not often that you find such characterisation in a gory horror film. What Marshall has given us here sets a new standard for visceral shocks. He does rely on one jump-shock too many and I personally do not want to see what a compound fracture looks like (or how to treat one. Ever seen an entire cinema audience pull a nauseous grimace.) Its worth commenting on the production design. Stunning. You would not think it was a film set at Pinewood. It was a character by itself, adding to Marshall observations about claustrophobia, fear of the dark and friendship.Of course, he could be asking: Do you know really 'know' your 'friends'? Bloody excellent. 10 out of 10.",10,6,15,9 July 2005
Final Destination," Gives us something to think about
","Normally, I'm not spooked by a film but this movie sure as hell gave me the chills. 'Final Destination' was a taut, sharp and intelligent piece of horror, not reliant on that many gore effects for shocks. Indeed the films horror was based on a good use of suspense rather than out-and-out gore. I've got to admit, some deaths came out of nowhere and those who did die, died in less obvious ways than you may have thought of.It gave us mere mortals something to think about too, in that (a)I'm not flying again for a long time and (b) death is not an accident but is planned so that when your time comes, you can do absolutely nothing about it. You can only cheat death temporarily. It'll get you in the end, by any means necessary no matter what plans you have made to avoid it. Morbid to be honest, but entirely true.The downside to this movie was the confusing explanation of how the pattern of 'Death' was explained. It lost me. Can someone explain. It seems as though the writers became stuck for an explanation as to how 'Death' moved from victim to victim and thought hey this'll do for now.This is only a minor quibble about a very good movie. I haven't seen an intelligent horror film like this since. Well, since. Good use of horror movie in-jokes too. I love the use of using surnames of horror directors and actors as character names. Some were obvious (Hitchcock, Lewton), some less so (Waggner, Schreck).Highly recommended but not a date movie.",8,8,12,21 May 2000
