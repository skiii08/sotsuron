The Blair Witch Project," Bad f*ing job
","I just f*ing watched this f*ing movie again last f*ing night because I was f*ing bored out of my f*ing mind. It does have it's interesting points. I liked the documentary style beginning, and the early trip into the woods, the story about Coffin Rock and the alleged Blair Witch herself. But the f*ing language was enough to make me f*ing sick. I mean, let's be f*ing real man. Is this how f*ing people talk to each other ALL the f*ing time? I can understand the language deteriorating as they are drawn down into deep fear and despair, but how can you care about three young people that are so f*ing short of a real vocabulary that every f*ing thing they say to each other has to have a f*ing adverb or adjective that f*ing starts with the 'f' word? That was f*ing enough for me to applaud the f*ing ending of this f*ing movie.",3,0,2,29 September 2006
