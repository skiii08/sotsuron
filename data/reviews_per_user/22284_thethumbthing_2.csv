The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk...Incredibly Bad!!
","I'm sorry to write a negative comment on a film which cost 130 million to make... I went into the cinema with an open mind as I'm definitely no Hulk fan, my son of 15 wanted to see this movie. When the film finished I had the feeling of being let down, the CGI of the Hulk is like looking at a CGI character, I never had the feeling that the Hulk was real in a movie sense, the Abomination was far better as a visual image, the Hulk doesn't even have the slightest resemblance to Edward Nortons facual characteristics. The special effects and camera work was sometimes extraordinary, but this was not maintained. I was very disappointed with the look of the Hulk, Edward Norton was fine as Banner, as he is in most films... I wonder what motivated him to take this role? obviously the money, but what about his reputation as a serious actor who takes roles that demand great talent. This film didn't ring my bells at all... Iron Man is a great film and with Robert Downey jn in the title role brought depth and emotion to the character which I didn't feel with Norton. Sorry to be so negative...",4,7,13,4 July 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," mixed feelings...
","I'm a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the cinematic quality was like a painting in every scene, it was a master piece to say the least and winning the Academy awards once all 3 films were screened was inevitable. I saw The Hobbit on 12.12.12 as a friend of mine was chewing at the bit to see it. The first thing i noticed was the cinematic values... some scenes were like looking at cheap video, this is due to the frame rate that was used, it looked too clean and as a result the cinematic quality of The Hobbit fell short of the LOTR films.Why did they choose to go 3D? I don't get it. OK, the 3D effect itself looks very 3D and gives that feeling of distance between the characters and foreground and background, but the frame rate seems to completely take away the cinematic quality we saw in LOTR. When we both came out of the cinema we both complained of head aches, my head ache lasted the entire day! I think this was due to all that was going on on the screen, my brain was trying to make sense of what i was seeing... i guess. I am not saying the film was crap, what i am saying is the choices made cinematically were perhaps not necessary, a bit like polishing firewood.",5,5,17,13 December 2012
