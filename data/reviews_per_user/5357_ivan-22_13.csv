Casablanca," Never could sit through it, Sam!
","I tried at least ten times, fifteen minutes at a time, but over the years, this movie has not been seen by me in one sitting. I must therefore conclude, that it belongs to a very special trilogy: the three most overrated movies this side of the Atlantic, together with 'Gone with the wind' and 'Citizen Kane'. On the other side of the Atlantic (where far fewer movies have been to my liking), the distinguished trilogy is (tentatively) composed of 'L'Avventura', 'Eight and a half' and any Ingmar Bergman opus of your choosing. Don't you believe that thing about the test of time. A thing isn't good just because many say so.",Null,2,5,12 May 2003
To Be or Not to Be," Sublime
","This movie proves that comedy can be sublime. At a time when the gods are crazy, this movie swims with the current, seeking to outdo their craziness. That's why it's also very touching. The outcome of the craziness was unknown at the time. That also makes this film daring. Whether intentionally or not, the film implies that Hitler himself was a Hitler-impersonator, that Hitler is a kind of unattainable ideal, a Platonic idea of pure evil. A similarly sublime and bold and touching film made during another craziness (not twenty years thereafter, as its more applauded cousins!) is 'THE GAY DECEIVERS' (1969). It too dances with the gods, and breaks your heart as it makes you laugh.",Null,27,59,4 October 2002
Citizen Kane," Sophomoric gargoyle
","I like Orson Welles as a person. He was warm, witty, intelligent, a great conversationalist. So, why do I have such an intense dislike for his entire body of work? I find his films nauseatingly morbid and draining. These very, very dark films make the darkest film noir look like a light comedy. My least favorite of his films is 'Citizen Kane', a veritable compendium of everything that should be avoided in films: time spans that are too long, villainous heroes, insufferable pretentiousness and gross overreaching. This film unintentionally glorifies Hearst. He did not merit such a hatchet job. It honors him by implying there is complexity in the man. One gets the feeling that Welles secretly admired Hearst, and that behind the critique is a bit of envy.",2,7,20,19 July 2000
12 Angry Men," Riveting but problematic
","I am writing this review before reading any of the others, so as not to be influenced by them. When I saw this film almost two decades ago I was absolutely riveted by the powerful, intense, unrelenting drama and suspense and the profound ethical content, not to mention the artistically uncompromising, sparse esthetics. The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie!  I fear it takes on more than it can handle. But what a worthy effort!",Null,7,11,21 September 2001
Dead Poets Society," Liked it in 1989
","My diary informs me that I liked this film in 1989, of which I remember nothing today: Very good movie. I feared it would be just a Robin Williams 'vehicle', another story about an unconventional young teacher clashing with the stuffy authorities. As I watched the movie I kept wondering whether it was upholding personality or principle. Was it just a paean to a wonderful teacher, something like 'To Sir with Love' or was it upholding some principle? There were moments when I was about to dismiss the movie as a pretentious version of 'Beach party bingo', Franky Avalon gone Ivy League. When one of the students, well, no spoilers, I feared the movie was degenerating into soap opera. Then I feared a sudden happy ending that would tilt the balance toward personality and narcissism and away from principle. But at the very end, it becomes clear that it is the other way around. Conventionality and conformity cannot be defeated. However, the ideals of Thoreau and other free-thinkers cannot be either.",Null,0,1,27 July 2003
The Best Years of Our Lives," Life Exalted
","One of the best movies. Despite its three hours I didn't push the fast forward button once. Very intelligent, compassionate drama about the hardships faced by war veterans. The subject wasn't glamorous, but the manner in which it was presented makes it memorable. I have never felt so sorry when a movie ended. I wanted it to go on and on.  There were hardly any flaws, no lapse in taste or judgment.  A beautiful woman abandons her husband because he cannot make enough money. The most poignant moment was when a former bomber pilot now working as a lowly salesman visits a junkyard in which hundreds of planes are being recycled. The contrast between his former glory and current ordinariness is heart-breaking. There was a good dose of preaching, but the film is so well-mannered one delights in it. (1989 diary entry).'Communist propaganda' was never so appealing. Ayn Rand branded it that, God knows why.",Null,2,3,12 August 2000
The Graduate," Where did he graduate???
","What college did he graduate from? Stalker College, or Spineless College? It strains credulity that someone as aimless, disturbed and confused would have managed to graduate from any college. This movie reminds me of 'Gone With The Wind': I only like the music. Where are the non-whites in this movie? Where are the sixties issues? Where is the zestful, intelligent dialogue? The good music is played too often, making it annoying. If you want to relive the sixties, watch something meatier, like 'The Strawberry Statement' or 'Maryjane' (some of the greatest cool jazz!). Neither 'The Graduate' nor 'M.A.S.H.' nor 'Easy Rider' seem substantive enough to be iconic. But circumstance rules. So many saw it and loved it, that it must be great. None of the characters seems appealing or even real.",Null,1,2,21 December 2001
Some Like It Hot," Sad
","This is nothing but warmed up vaudeville, a one-joke farce without any message. Far better movies on a similar subject are 'The Gay Deceivers' (1969) and 'La Cage Aux Folles II'. The fact that men dressed as women are thought to be so hilarious says something about our view of women. Why are women dressed as men not hilarious? Food for thought.",Null,0,7,29 December 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," Too much politics
","What bothers me about Capra is that seemingly all his movies have the same vague political message, vehemently delivered, a kind of New Deal digest: thin cats of the world unite! The fat cats are giving you a bad case of Great Depression. That's too simplistic! Think about it: if the powerful are invariably evil, maybe there's something wrong with the system. This movie could be seen as nothing but political allegory disguised as sentimentality. But it succeeds despite itself. The cinematography is stunning, the acting inspired, and it has one of the most wrenching scenes on film: when Stewart meets his wife in the street, a spinster who never met him and who runs away in horror. Overwrought? Perhaps. But also effective. At least two Capra films mention suicide, a most unusual topic in films. The unrealistic happy ending isn't really unwelcome. Who cares about realism? Movies tell us how things should be, not only how they are.",Null,1,6,29 December 2001
All Quiet on the Western Front," Effective
","The movie is great, with a devastating, quiet and simple ending. What makes it so effective is the lack of background music. I also liked the fact that the it doesn't try to make you puke. War is obviously more horrible than this. At times the movie looks less like an indictment of war, and more like an indictment of life itself. It seems to mourn not so much the evils of war, as the evils of sickness and death. Let us not forget that civilians die horrible deaths in peace time. The movie seems to realize this. Hence the prevalence of melancholy over anger and indignation.",Null,1,2,1 September 2000
To Kill a Mockingbird," Sorry to be so picky
","I'm sorry I don't really like this film, much as I approve of its goal. It has many good things: heavenly music, great black and white cinematography, likable young actors (who alas, did not have much of a career), noble purpose, pleasantly slow pacing. But all this does not coalesce into greatness. The drama is too overwrought, long-winded, and there is never any doubt who the good guy is. I especially disliked the courtroom scene with its histrionics revolving around a tawdry subject. It clashes with the film's overall dreamy lyricism. I tend to dislike films based on novels. Their dramatic shape is never quite right. Give me filmed plays anytime. I'm sad that John Megna died young and that there isn't more of him on screen. He had a poignancy.",Null,3,6,3 March 2002
The Producers," A GROOVY HITLER!
","This miraculously riotous farce is replete with comedic inspiration and EVERY character is mercilessly preposterous. Dick Shawn's hippy Hitler tickling the ivories and wailing the blues away is the very personification of the god of mirth, a howling absurdity that deserves a monument! And you should see Roger De Bris's wide eyes and gaping mouth at the audition! Shawn's tastelessness stuns even the greatest master of it. A sudden stage full of Hitlers maniacally saluting each other! If there's a message here, it's that Fuehrers are a dime a dozen. A politically incorrect author wearing a politically incorrect helmet, even when bandaged from head to toe! No one is spared. The two gay characters are as good as anything in the movie, with the obese one explicitly inviting cruel mockery on grounds that it will come his way anyway! There is even a backhanded compliment to the zaniness of producing anything. If you enjoy this one you may also enjoy 'The Gay Deceivers' and 'La Cage Aux Folles II'.",Null,0,0,1 April 2002
The Truman Show," Artificiality exposing artificiality artificially
","I should preface my comments by saying that I prefer old movies, that I am stuck in the past and hardly ever enjoy a movie made after 1975, one of the reasons being that recent movies seem to include their own rave reviews. So much money is at stake, that a movie becomes the equivalent of Columbus's voyage. This movie is flawed on several counts: There are at least three or four Twilight Zone episodes based on the concept of someone unknowingly living an artificial life. The Twilight Zone (TV show) has everything that this film lacks: artistry, conciseness, originality, bite, and that gorgeous black and white, with plenty of shadows. The Truman Show is a one-idea, one-gag movie. Moreover, the whole notion that artificiality is bad is flawed: we are all artificial, knowingly and unknowingly. We all play roles all the time. Thus, to deplore artificiality amounts to deploring life itself. If Truman doesn't know his life is artificial, that makes it non-artificial, doesn't it?",Null,0,1,21 October 2001
