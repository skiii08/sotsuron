The Blair Witch Project," no sleep
","Overall I thought it was a good movie, different of course, and a brilliant concept of taking the three actors and putting them in a situation that they would have to basically improv.  However, the thought was always in my mind that it was not real.  If I had thought it was a true story, I never would have slept again!  And I know I will think about this movie next time I am camping.  But as I watched this movie, I would try to put myself in the students' shoes for a second, and I was scared out of my mind, especially at the end.  I really enjoyed the beginning parts of the movie that lead up to the three kids going into the woods...not only were their funny parts but it seemed like it was real at the same time.  The original idea of this movie is what I like the most about it.  If you are a person that gets easily frightened whether it's a real story or not, expect to look over shoulder for a while after you see the Blair Witch Project.  If you don't get easily frightened, even this movie will make you think twice about going into the woods again.",Null,1,1,4 August 1999
