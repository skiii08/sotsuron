Insidious: Chapter 2," Retains the original's ambiance, a sturdy sequel.
","After being trapped in the afterlife a father must return to save his family from a serial killing entity or be lost forever.Opening with an exposition flashback and picking up where part one left off director James Wan delivers another afterlife visual treat. This sequel has its share of shrouded corpses, ghostly figures, an abandoned hospital and dilapidated houses to name a few.Thankfully this is not some cheap cash-in. What's engaging is that the original cast return including the solid Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne along with Elise Rainier and Barbara Hershey in their supporting roles. Worthy of note is The House of the Devil's (2009) Jocelin Donahue as Hershey's Lorraine younger self. To the casting directors credit the supporting actors who play the younger characters are successfully integrated. Of course for a bit of relief and grounding from Tucker (Angus Sampson)and Leigh Whannell's Specs who also return.It's stylised make-up of the ghostly faces and cross layering between and afterlife, flashbacks, spiritual time paradoxes are finely executed. While it has its fair share of creepy moments, notably a scene involving a tin can make shift telephone it's debatably not as tension filled as the first instalment. That said, with a few twists and interesting exposition it keeps you on your toes from start to finish.What makes Chapter 2 shine is that writer Leigh Whannell expands the story building on his and Wan's original concept without changing it too much, it really is a satisfying sequel and incorporates even some of the original's scenes. Both cinematographer John R. Leonetti (Sleepy Hollow) and composer Joseph Bishara also return which again is in keeping with the first, retaining its atmosphere and look.Granted it's packed with horror clichés but Wan's execution and style gives this an edge over similar types of horrors. Overall, while not reinventing the horror wheel, it's a satisfying follow-up.",Null,0,0,17 February 2014
The Avengers," The Marvel comic-book caper that delivers.
","Nick Fury of the organisation S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor and a few others to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from enslaving the world. Marvel's The Avengers (in the UK named Avengers Assemble possibly not to be confused with John Steed and Emma Peel, who knows why?) is a surprisingly satisfying superhero film. While the previously named characters film outings almost shamefully set this one up  writer and director Joss Whedon manages to pull the styles of the other directors together in this feature ensemble. While its not essential to see the other films it's does help to fill in some gaps. The music score isn't particularly memberable but heightens the on screen action accordingly. Where as spider-man reeked of quick cuts and a cgi replacement, Whedon and team manages to keep Avengers comic book action integrated, accessible and visually coherent.  Notably Mark Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton as Hulk/Banner and sits quite nicely with top cast that includes Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson. A few sub- character also return. The story isn't overly complicated and sticks to a bumper issue Marvel edition. The film doesn't try to overly deepen the characters and stays close to the comic book spirit and roots. Packed with one liners, top effects and great comic book characters The Avengers ticks all the boxes that arguably some of the stand alone prelude films didn't manage to do.",Null,0,5,7 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Connecting and visually arousing sequel. Warning skin job spoilers
","2049, a blade runner for the Los Angeles Police Department, unearths a secret that has the potential to plunge a company and department into chaos.Without drawing too many comparisons to Ridley Scott's 1982 classic, director Denis Villeneuve's neo-noir science fiction film is powerful, atmospheric and like its predecessor mostly likely not an instant classic but a slow burning grower. All the lights are out at the Tyrell building and the weather is more unpredictable than ever before with snow, dust storms on top of the usual expected rain. Even though Hampton Fancher and Michael Green screenplay follows the excellent Ryan Gosling's character officer K later Joe it's very much a film about Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard and Nexus 6 Rachael. Both the advancement in A.I. relationship element is focused upon here as well the expected replicants memories, relationships, life spans and more importantly reproductive system.Packed with excellent performances, notably limited screen-time from Jared Leto, Robin Wright and Dave Bautista in brief but impressive subtle and violent appearance. Edward James Olmos also reprises his role as Gaff and with ease gives Gosling a run for his his money in the few minutes he appears on screen. Sean Young's Rachel is also prevalent throughout, whether it be in dialogue, photos, voice recordings, skull and bones or a better than Rogue One's Tarkin appearance with some jaw dropping, impressive computer generated wizardry film magic.While Harrison's screen presence sizzles Golsing carries the film well in amongst the mesmerising effects and earthly sets that are captured by veteran Roger Deakins' cinematography. Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's music is fitting and has all the Vangelis staples and expected moving horns and beats. To Villeneuve's credit he achieves the almost impossible and that is to conjure up a sequel that doesn't simply rehash, but builds on the first film as Golsing's Joe goes about finding out what or who he really is and his purpose. As well as subtly answering questions about its predecessor, namely the fate of various characters, life spans and so forth it also leaves many fittingly unanswered. Up for speculation, interestingly not a plot point, without specifically saying so it hints that rule-abiding 'Skinner', 'Skinjob' K, KD3:6-7, is possibly a younger version of retired Deckard B-263-54.A must see, but expect a futuristic breadcrumb detective story with slight of hand memory tricks and a few twists rather the Gosling's Joe hunting down and simply disposing/retiring Replicants.",Null,5,17,5 October 2017
Alien 3," This is rumour control...
","After a fire on the Sulaco an escape pod crash-lands on a refinery/prison planet killing everyone aboard except Lieutenant Ellen Ripley. As Ripley recovers she realises that fire was no accident and an Alien begins a killing spree that she must stop.The idea of coming away from Cameron's Aliens (a fantastic mix of action, suspense and special effects) and go back to the gritty atmosphere basics of the first film was debatably a good idea. Moving the setting from space and jarring the audience by killing off Hicks and Newt it emotionally puts the viewer at unease from the outset into uncharted territory. Producers, though misunderstood what director David Fincher was trying to achieve back in 1992 and it was plagued with creative differences, production issues, script problems and the film released seemed very disjointed.After watching the new assembled version of Alien 3 I was pleasantly surprised. With the new version what you get is expanded and alternative scenes, more character development and a new subplot making it a more enjoyable Alien movie.Like the previous version the Alien effects are still the same and not very well executed. That said, this version without a doubt is an improvement on the 1992 version coupled with a nice score, great performances, especially from Charles Dance and the sadly missed Brian Glover. Sigourney Weaver plays a very troubled shaven head Ellen Ripley convincingly. This time around with expanded scenes the supporting cast get to show off their acting skills within the fantastic sets. Explained in the new cut is where and why some of the characters disappeared.Overall with these adjustments the film finally sits nicely in the series. It's dark, eerie and atmospheric.",Null,1,5,30 April 2004
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Law and Jr. ooze charisma
","Dr. Watson's Stag night, Wedding and Honeymoon go awry as he and Sherlock Holmes join forces with a gypsy to outwit and bring down adversary Professor Moriarty.Guy Ritchie explores the time period further and creates a detailed and richer world. Cobbled and dirt streets, sweeping landscapes and skylines all add to the atmosphere of old London and Paris. The effects and costumes are amazing, the sets fantastic - secret passageways, opera houses and trains. The music with the familiar theme of the first fittingly returns. Many of the pacing issues of the first film have been corrected, but arguably there is less subtle humour and more all out gags. That said, the essence of Sherlock remains intact. The story is less convoluted than it's predecessor and despite some stifled lines the two leads are Law and Jr. are on fine form oozing charisma. With their unmatched rapport they can do no wrong as they are so well cast and have so much chemistry between them. Although there is a little too much crash and bang in Ritchie's set pieces,there's enough wordplay courteous of writers Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney to keep it becoming just another action. Both Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes and Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty are both perfectly cast giving fitting and wonderful performances. Familiar faces of the first outing make appearances and it feels like a true an equal sequel. Overall it's more of the same and Guy Ritchie delivers a great continuation of the adventures of Holmes and Watson.",Null,1,2,30 December 2011
Sucker Punch," An acquired taste fantasy-action that requires patience's
","After the death of her mother and sister Babydoll enters an institution, where she is to be lobotomised - prompted by her Stepfather. However, she takes note of four items that are integral to attempt an escape with the fifth being the most important. An intrusive soundtrack, a lobotomy, dreamlike Cinderella/Alice-esque story as we follow Babydoll's 'escape'-  Part Showgirls, Cabaret, Burlesque-like fantasy with Gothic sets, gloomy lighting worthy of Tim Burton. Sucker Punch looks great with wonderful sets and sleek costumes but lacks a compelling story, all is seemingly an excuse to show some average looking teen fighting girls, spectacular effects, breathtaking action accompanied by a loud score and pumping tracks. There's words, guns,tight trousers, skirts and shoes and no acting required just an emotional and physical presence which is apparent. However, the strong ominous opening setup leads to nothing more than an excuse to string the above together. Zack Snyder's fantasy-action looks similar at times to Kurt Wimmer's work that also borrows from comic and gaming sources. Even though director Snyder has delivered such excellent work including the well presented Dawn of the Dead remake, visually exciting Watchmen and 300 - Punch just isn't that captivating requiring an acquired taste of style over a simple story masked by a complex delivery. Sucker Punch requires a lot of patience's for such little reward. While sub-par D.O.A. was inferior and no where near as expertly crafted, it arguably was more more fun.",Null,0,1,5 August 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," Clever tight entertainment
","After getting in a car accident, a woman is held in a shelter with two men. Director Dan Trachtenberg offers a well directed solid suspense thriller, that borrows from Stephen King's Misery, War of the Worlds and of course Cloverfield in the closing. 10 Cloverfield Lane's minimal main cast are on fantastic form, notable are Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. but it's John Goodman who steals the show and is given more depth than the other characters.What starts out as a seemingly typical torture kidnap thriller turns into something quite different. With the claustrophobic location of an underground bunker complete with air shafts, which Winstead has to worm her way through, it does have it tense moments. Loyality and trust themes builds the tension throughout thanks to Goodman's questionable character Howard. He gives a stellar performance with Bear McCreary's score adding to the edgy proceedings. With fine effects and some tight writing from Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken and Damien Chazelle it works as a stand alone film as well as a 'side-quel' to J.J Abrams earlier 2008 outing. Clearly the small cast and few locations transparently function to warrant and somewhat set up a big budget third instalment. But don't expect any alien action until the latter half.It's fast pace, unconventional story telling holds interest and makes it worth while viewing alone. Cloverfield fans will be pleased but those who aren't aware of the Cloverfield link may get more satisfaction from the alien twist ending and Howard's real intentions.",Null,2,5,7 May 2016
The Equalizer," It's no Equalizer but worth watching for Csokas performance alone
","Helpful gentleman Robert McCall is a retired black ops government operative who after befriending a young woman goes head to head with the Russian Mafia.Antoine Fuqua's The Equalizer is stylishly violent with both Denzel Washington as Robert McCall and Marton Csokas putting in tense and excellent performances. Harry Gregson-Williams score complements the dreary mood but lacks Stewart Copeland's signature theme Busy Equalizing.Mirroring the recent Sherlock Holmes (2009) in terms of fighting logic this offering is more reminiscent of the Get Cater (2000) than The Equalizer 80s TV series. Writer Richard Wenk and Fuqua's drop nods to Woodward's McCall a silhouette, his ingenuity and stone cold shootings but it's comparable to Ridley Scotts Robin Hood (2010) being an almost The Equalizer prequel, in terms of how/why he becomes The Equalizer.Overall, put against Fuqua's own Training Day (2001) written by David Ayer or in terms of being a film based on 1985-89 The Equalizer it falls short. That said, as an atmospheric revenge action it's wonderfully filmed highly entertaining and worth watching for Csokas performance alone.",Null,0,2,4 November 2014
Source Code," Poignant moments in a contemporary Sci-fi
","After an explosion kills a train full of people an Air force pilot is tasked with reliving the last 8 minutes of a man's life on the ill-fated train to discover who planted the bomb and prevent further attacks thanks to a project called the Source Code. However, in doing so he discovers a truth about himself is more astonishing than the source code programme itself. Source Code plays out as a long Twilight Zone episode, but that's not a bad thing, it's theme is that of worm holes, parallel universes, reality consciousness and debatably time travel. There are three amusing nods to the TV series Quantum Leap two of them subtle.Jake Gyllenhaal is on top form here as Colter Stevens (a play on Colt Seavers possibly) and adds scope and emotion to his character as he's forced to relive the last eight minutes of life over and over again to find the bomber. Michelle Monaghan is fine with what she's been given but is really a story pawn as Stevens gets to know here better after each time the 8 minutes are rest. The most interesting character Colleen Goodwin is played superbly by Vera Farmiga who is torn between duty and Stevens' wellbeing. Jeffrey Wright (of James Bond Felix Leiter fame) gives a fitting performance as source code creator Dr. Rutledge.While Duncan Jones wonderfully crafts the film with limited but successful use of effects mainly the train explosions, he manages to keep the repetitiveness fresh showing different angles revealing different parts of the train throughout. Thanks to writer Ben Ripley the story allows other settings to be used in the limited repeated 8 minutes. That said, there are few surprises, also some stereotype anti-prejudice which has now become a cliché in the bombers identity and those suspected is included. This sets it below the sharpness of Duncan Jones 2009 film Moon. Thanks to the intriguing closing scene you don't feel cheated and it's a satisfying piece of constructive science fiction within a contemporary setting. Like Jones' début the poignant moments manage to tug at heart strings which for a popcorn flick is sparse these days. Recommended.",Null,1,1,2 August 2011
Skyfall," 'Stop touching your ear.' Overrated, yet outstanding Bond
","007 must dust himself down and return to duty when a face from M's past beings to terrorise MI5.Having had time to digest it for the third time - Skyfall, is overrated, there is said it, yet it's an amazing Bond outing but it's overrated. The problem with it is that it returns to the old Bond that I fell in love with, but in doing so treads on Casino Royale re-imagined and Quantum's departure of the older instalments and the new foundation they laid out.Another issue is that Bond was fresh learning and honing his skills, but writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan present an experienced, washed up spy, that seems four films too soon. Anyone certainly in the UK will be underwhelmed by the setting of the latter half but it's easy to see why an overseas audience my get a kick from the atmospheric closure but it's home from home and not very exotic for many of us.These gripes aside Skyfall is a solid addition to the franchise, Javier Bardem as baddie Silva is outstanding. Naomie Harris (28 Days Later) is perfect as Eve, Judi Dench returns as M (Olivia Mansfield) in an expanded central role and the supporting cast include the likes of heavy weight actors Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney (in a role which may have been fitting for the sadly retired Sean Connery). Once again Daniel Craig is Mr. Bond, what he lacks in dialogue through no fault of his own he makes up for in screen presence, once again delivering the physicality and emotion that one would expect from todays James Bond. Sam Mendes delivers some old school framing, while some stunts are underwhelming other are purely breathtaking. Mendes with Roger Deakins' cinematography presents a traditional style film with many modern touches you'd expect from filmmakers of their calibre. What's nice about Skyfall is that it captures London as London, dark and damp as oppose the makeover seen in The World is not Enough or Die Another Day. Mendes' eye mixed with Thomas Newman's exceptional score really cements this as one of the better more gritty Bonds.However, oddly Skyfall takes you out of the moment at times with superfluous questions - how have these criminals got the same super-spy abilities as 007, did they go to a motorbike riding on a roof academy? Why is there a Hannibal Lecture style cell in the new MI5 HQ? Silva's impeccable underground timing and it's purpose? Underwater hideouts I bought, flying cars, hook armed and metal teeth henchmen, even Bond going into outer-space and all the outrageousness of the old Bonds but when something is this well made these little things are magnified and seem more distracting.As previously mentioned and without giving much away there are plenty of surprises and nods to previous Bonds but in an emphasising encompassing fashion. There's a nice touch in the ensemble script which refers to a line in Craig's first outing and there is plenty of depth in the story and characters. There are many highlights, notably Adele's Oscar winning 'wobbly' yet powerful theme song belting out over the wonderfully done opening credits and the above par acting. All in all its a great outing but shoehorns Daniel's Bond character skipping what was so skilfully established in Craig's previous outings.",Null,0,3,25 February 2013
Iron Man 3," Interesting subtext and a rounded Iron outing
","Haunted by the events of Avengers Assemble, Iron Man has to get himself together to thwart terrorist The Mandarin who is aided by an old acquaintance. A faster paced instalment to the series, Shane Black effortlessly takes over the directing reigns, it has the right dose of action, humour and emotion. Even though the few surprises and twists are heavy handed- namely the The Mandarin and Pepper Potts thread Robert Downey Jr. gets to portray Tony Stark once again and develop the character a little further. Although Guy Pearce is given an unconvincing make up and hair introduction once he returns clean cut he excels and steals the show as bad guy Aldrich Killian. Rebecca Hall is form in a smaller role and Ben Kingsley is entertaining with his Captain Jack-like swagger as The Mandarin. A few of the Iron Man's series previous characters show up and never out stay their welcome.Black impressively handles the big budget spectacles and action scene sequences with precision, the special effects are outstanding. However, Stark losing his suit so often become a tad tiresome. Like its predecessor this has an interesting subtext with regards to terrorists, the Middle East and Starks relationship with the suit. There's also a novel brave closure ending, nevertheless it's a good outing with a humorous post credit sequence.Debatably Iron Man's most rounded outing for the masses.",Null,1,2,12 August 2013

Resident Evil: Afterlife," Style over substance
","Alice is stripped of her T-virus enhancing powers continues on her journey to find survivors and lead them to Arcadia, however, with more zombies, T-virus mutants and Umbrella Corporation personnel it's not going to be easy.Boasting being the first live-action movie based on a video game to be in 3-D The intriguing set up of Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) for a clone orientated sequel is dolefully all wrapped up in the opening minutes of Afterlife. The originals director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson thankfully returns the reigns and puts the series on track, especially by making our heroine more human and like the character of Resident Evil (2002).Milla is made for the role of Alice and looks particularly in shape and focused in this action orientated continuation of the Capcom game adaptation, as too is Ali Larter as Claire Redfield, although she is underutilised.Gamer fans will be pleased with appearance of game baddies and Chris Redfield played by Wentworth Miller. Boris Kodjoe is has a lot of screen presence, however, his and many of the other characters are not fleshed out or have enough dialogue nor time to make an impact. Afterlife lacks the depth and foreboding atmosphere of the first film but is more fun than Apocalypse and Extinction despite the hammy acting and overuse of slow-mo.The Redfield bother sister relationship is left unexplored and there appears to be a lot of missed opportunities. That said, these threads may turn up in future squeals, however, you can't help feel a little short changed as the plot feels to just scratch the surface.There's still a lot to like, zombies, guns, sword-play and explosions. Fantastic stunts, great sets, costumes, special effects and a pumping score. Sienna Gilroy's cameo sets it up for another tantalising sequel, however, every instalment in the series has done the same, let's just hope RE5 delivers in all departments.Overall, Resident Evil: Afterlife is immense sci-fi fun, but alas chooses style over substance.",Null,2,3,25 February 2013
Deja Vu," Compulsive time travel entertainment.
","A man attempts to prevent a terrorist attack and save a woman with whom he has falling in love with.Satisfying science fiction that handles time travel more subtle than most. Tony Scott's Déjà Vu is a very rounded well constructed piece of entertainment. Although the closing ties things up a little too nicely in terms of Doug Carlin's 'duplicate' it still manages to inject some ambiguity into the end.Déjà Vu has plenty of heart and is more thriller than scifi, it's not too gadget/techie driven and Scott's realistic style of filming and the New Orleans setting draws you in from the off, it's quite compulsive viewing right up to the conclusion. With a great supporting cast actor Denzel Washington is on his usual fine form, Paula Patton is convincing and Val Kilmer gives a great performance (even with his limited screen time).Scott slightly drops the ball with the chase scene and a few plot points don't appear air tight. Even though much of the time travel dialogue may have your eyes rolling the acting is great.

It," Top notch casting, great scares, good adaptation.
","Seven young outcasts face their worst nightmare when an ancient, shape-shifting evil emerges from the sewer to prey on the town's children. Director Andy Muschietti's story beats are perfect the casting is top notch. Bill Skarsgård is fitting as IT/Pennywise the Dancing Clown, a trans-dimensional evil that awakens every twenty-seven years. Skarsgård's and Tim Curry's IT is like Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero's Joker, both equally great but a different take on the same character, so there's no need for comparisons. Incidentally there's a fitting nod to Curry's TV Pennywise in a room of clowns. For the main cast there's the one reminiscent of Kevin Bacon, the Rob Lowe looking one, the Molly Ringwald (amusingly self referenced within the film) the River Phenix one and so on. Echoing The Breakfast Club, Goonies and Stand By Me to name a few.Muschietti and writers Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman even cram in a creepy gnarled tree and a dilapidated haunted looking house. Starsguard moves eerily slow and contorted at times and uneasy fast at others. There's much more gore in this adaptation. As a horror it offers enough creepy moments but where it gives today's horrors a run for their money is the friendship, outcast and bully themes which come directly from Stephen King's source material. A major departure from King's 1986 novel and 1990 miniseries is the 80s setting for the child part, even with the Airwolf T-shirt, New Kids on the Block songs, Casio watch, Gremlins posters and Nightmare of Elm Street 5, Batman and Lethal Weapon 2 showing in Derry's cinema, some of the period feels a little off but the recreation for the most part works.Again its strengthen comes from the casting which emotionally affects the story at its core. Frights, whether a cellar, sewer, bathroom or the alley or simple a dark office, the music, sound design thanks to Muschietti's staging amplifies the chills while wearing its heart on its sleeve with the young performers.It's tight and pacey, with enough time for the characters to breath. Muschietti injects plenty of jump scares and creepy moments, and with a larger budget and omitting the adult segments (saving them for an IT sequel/chapter 2 and possibly flashbacks to 1989) it actually, surprisingly is better than its predecessor adaptation. Packed with terrifying, hallucinatory and nightmare imagery coupled with a near on perfect cast IT is highly recommend.",Null,5,12,8 September 2017
In Bruges," Wonderfully crafted film in all respects.
","Some films you can watch over and over again but just because you wouldn't watch a film twice doesn't mean its rubbish. This is the case with in Bruges.For a film that uses the word 'f*ck' and its derivatives 126 times that's an average of 1.18 'f*cks' per minute. You really wouldn't notice, as they are lost in the fantastic dialogue.In Bruges is a wonderfully crafted film in all respects. Martin McDonagh wrote and directed the film and brings out the best in the two Irish leads Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken. Ken and Ray are two hit men sent to Bruge by their boss play by Ralph Fiennes after a job goes wrong all of which are amusingly characterised and portrayed realistically.The film oozes atmosphere and I wouldn't want to spoil the story but it is both touching and funny. As with any kind of successful dark comedy there is an array of quirky characters including a dwarf, a one-eyed boyfriend, pregnant hotel lady, gun seller and a drug trafficker. All the actors' performances are a joy and overall it is a piece of excellent executed movie making with some great moments.I'd recommend this film to anyone that wants to see something original.",Null,2,5,27 October 2008

Amongst the abundance of them comes John Wick with its on location feel and slick action sequences. Wonderfully directed by Chad Stahelski & David Leitch's with great action scenes and Derek Kolstad's solid dialogue Wick goes from one scene to the next exacting revenge on those who have wronged him. Its a fine straightforward affair without the quirkiness or humour of the likes director Guy Ritchie or Paul McGuigan. Stahelski delivers a straight up action thriller with hard hitting violence, blood baths through a hotel, church, cars and blood spattered clubs. Unashamedly from the shootouts to knife fights it oozes cool, complemented by the lighting, sound design, music tracks and score from Tyler Bates.The cast are unprecedentedly on form with Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki and memorable Willem Dafoe. Bridget Moynahan and Ian McShane cameo with John Leguizamo small part effortlessly stealing the cameo show. Keane Reeves is perfectly cast with his minimal dialogue and screen presence. Even with its dark tone it's more fun than the comparable excellent Equalizer.

Sandra Bullock is above her usual form as Stone, while Matt Kowalski's cock sure character played by George Clooney's is as exceptional as the first rate special effects on display. Considering the small cast the pace is fast with never a dull moment as it moves from one spacewalk to the next.The film feels very much based in reality, the first person perspective shots are used sparingly and effectively, they add to the claustrophobic feeling in contrast to sweeping views and emptiness of space which adds to the tension. Orbit and space has never felt or looked so real thanks to the benchmark effects.While the story doesn't break any new ground, it's a basic yarn, visually it excels all expectations, Alfonso and Jonás Cuarón's screenplay has some interesting touches and dialogue one of which notably features Clooney's character and overall it comes full circle to a satisfying conclusion.

","A group of terrified passengers fight their way through a viral outbreak while trapped on a bullet train ride to Busan.Train to Busan is a blood-drenched South Korean zombie/virus horror, director Yeon Sang-ho and writer Park Joo-suk offer a serious zombie apocalypse yarn. Interestingly most of the bloody, milky eyed and black vein thrilled story is set in the daytime. Joo-suk offers a novel take on the infected, which cannot see in the dark, this makes for some interesting viewing during the more tense scenes especially as the train travels through darkened tunnels.Sang-ho's twitchy infected are a fast moving reminiscent of 28 Days Later and WWZ at one point there are piles of clambering dead hanging from the locomotive. In addition, this is a decent looking film, not a straight to video, DTV offering, the production values are high and the special effects are impressive. The locations are grounded which adds to the tension and you buy into the characters plight along with the punchy surprise deaths synonymous with the genre. With mistrust between the players there's a social commentary about the division of class and its pecking order, its only apt it's set on a train. There are some action packed segments in stations and some subtler moments in tunnels and the city as the survivors encounter the army and contaminated. Surprisingly there's plenty of emotion especially between workaholic Seok-woo played by Gong Yoo and his young daughter, Soo- an, delightfully played by Kim Su-an who wants to see her mother. Notable is Ma Dong-seok who plays Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man. Dong-seok delivers some memorable zombie head bashing moments. Sang-ho balances the intense infected action and drama perfectly. Highly recommended virus film.",Null,1,2,28 February 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Great film, excellent Star Wars movie.
","An unlikely group of freedom fighters team up to steal the Death Star schematics.An interesting mix of exciting heroic and tragic characters. Director Gareth Edwards Monsters, Godzilla) and team are careful not to take anything away from the iconic 1977 classic Star Wars and successfully add to it, i.e the Death Star here doesn't blow up planets in this instalment not to take any impact away from its destructive powers in A New Hope. Still it shows it's immense firepower as Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso goes about finding her father in a sea of defectors, rebels and insurgents including Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). With great Star Wars action setups and battle scenes, that one could only have dreamed of recreating with toys as child this Star Wars story has plenty of thrills.Loaded with nods to the series and standing on its on two feet. The costumes effects and sets are fantastic and it captures the feel of the originals and bridges the prequels, Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) adds to this. Michael Giacchino's music complements John Williams' previous scores. Edwards creates a sense of urgency here which helps reinforce Episode IV stakes including the famous first '77 on screen appearance of Darth Vader. It's also co-written by John Knoll, who joined Lucas Industrial Light & Magic 30 years ago and worked on Willow (1988). J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens captured the original trilogy's spirit holistically, but Edwards manages to conjurer up the feel of the 1977 Star Wars Magic.The CGI characters of dead and favourites while not technically perfect are executed well enough too excite fans, namely the appearance of Tarkin (a resurrection of the great Peter Cushing's character) and a pivotal female favourite who appears in the closing. Some X- Wing pilots, Red and Gold Leader have clever cameos. As well as an array of droids, littered throughout are the likes of the Cantina's Ponda Babba and Dr. Evazan, R2D2 and C3PO. Extended purposeful meatier character appearances included General Dodonna, Mon Mothma, Vader himself (in three important scenes) who does not disappoint.Director Edwards doesn't get hung up on on these cameos of sorts and keeps his eye on creating a wonderfully crafted grittier Star Wars film. The acting arguably surpasses its predecessors with too many actors to mention. Hardened rebel Andor played by Diego Luna cements a place in Star Wars history but Donnie Yen's Chirrut Îmwe steals scenes as a blind warrior. There's plenty of heart courteous of Mads Mikkelsen and lead Jones' Erso. Notable is Alan Tudyk's K-2SO who provides some great one liners as well as a memorable emotional moment. The star though is debatably Ben Mendelsohn as villain Orson Krennic, with the bureaucratic gravitas and emotional depth to leave a lasting impression.What it comes down to is that Edwards like Lucas manages to put on screen a Shakespeare-like tragedy mixed with Flash Gordon wonder that has all the familiar simple themes which makes stories great.Solid Star Wars entertainment all the way.",Null,3,7,17 December 2016
Captain Marvel," One of the better instalments to marvel at
","Captain Marvel, finds herself caught in the middle of an intergalactic battle which takes her to Earth in 1995 and opens her mind to her past.As fan of classic Marvel comics, I must be honest and say (Thor Ragnarok aside) I haven't been a great admirer of the arguably padded out borderline pretentious film outings. Thankfully, directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's Captain Marvel is one of the better more enjoyable instalments introducing shapeshifting aliens Skrulls and the Kree, powerful humanoid warriors.With great acting, smouldering likeable blonde Brie Larson is fantastic as Captain Marvel which expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ties into a past story thread, namely the Tesseract cube and future threads, including Fury's pager. There's a great performance with plenty of screen time from Samuel L Jackson as de-aged Nick Fury, oozing screen presence Jude Law and mostly prosthetic makeup Ben Mendelsohn are particularly note worthy with their characters offering some story twists. There's fantastic action, effects and music throughout - it's one of the better stories of any MCU with an interesting 90s setting and top pacing as Fury and Marvel team up.As expected there's some end credit scenes The first will connects to Avengers: Endgame and the humorous second bookends the film.Overall, a solid superhero actioner, you can't go wrong.",Null,3,8,25 April 2019
Dawn of the Dead," The dead just get better
","A group of strangers take refuge in shopping mall, in a desperate attempt to survive a zombie outbreak.You know Michael Cain once said, to paraphrase, 'why do they always bloody remake good films, they should remake the bad ones'. Of course I agree with this, but Michael went on to star in the remake of Get Carter and Sleuth. So to follow in Michael's foot steps and do a u turn, I'd like to state the re-imagining/remake of Dawn of the dead is a blast.Although I love George's original Dawn of the dead, with his traditional slow moving dead, the zombies in this remake Directed by Zack Snyder (who went on to direct 300 & Watchmen) move fast. The fast moving are like the virus infected people in 28 days/weeks later. They are just plain menacing and bloodcurdling.Zack Snyder directs a solid cast of relatively unknowns, Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber. The body of the story is the same as the original only this time a nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman, and other survivors arrive at a shopping mall for protection from the hordes of zombies that await outside.The effects are excellent and the first 15 minutes of the film is crafted and executed to a standard that I'm sure Hitchcock would have been proud of - it's pure tension, scares and horror.In retrospect Dawn of the dead 2004 is probably the most underrated re-imagining/remake ever. Grab a raw steak and watch it if you don't believe me.",Null,0,0,15 October 2008
Iron Man 2," Captures the spirit of Marvel in cast Iron
","Tony Stark reveals his superhero alter ego identity and while resisting calls by the government to hand over the Iron Man technology he finds himself threatened by a new enemy. I'm happy to say there's not much to dislike about Actor/Director Jon Favreau's excellent follow up to 2008's blend of comic book action, humour and effects.Iron Man 2 picks up where the first one left off, as billionaire Tony Stark must contend with the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies played by the wonderful Sam Rockwell and the perfectly cast Mickey Rourke.Thankfully Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt and looks great as the Black Widow, although the costumes cuffs looked a little out of place. Don Cheadle unnecessarily replaces Terence Howard as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes but is just as good, phew!The leads; Gwyneth Paltrow surprisingly cast in this role returns and is the grounded back bone of the film. Robert Downey Jr. once again is fantastic as the witty extrovert Stark. There's lot of emotion as you see Stark's father and a glimpse of their relationship. Downey's acting captures Stark's battles with his mortality and his alter ego fittingly.The effects are well executed and don't detract from the action or story in anyway. Fans will enjoy nods and references including The Avengers, Captain America and Samuel L. Jackson's second Nick Fury cameo, to name a few. Again there's a great script and storyline that zips along at a nice pace backed by a fitting music score and rock tracks. Personally, I feel it's better than Iron Man due to it's sharper editing and sleeker look. Stick around until after the end credits as there is a nice teaser of another superhero. Like the Fantastic 4's films all in all Iron Man 2 is the perfect comic book flick that captures the spirit of Marvel, it's just a shame Sam Raimi's Spiderman didn't have the same perfect blend of drama, action and adventure that Iron Man has...",Null,8,17,3 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Some good scenes and effects
","200 years after her death Ellen Ripley is cloned and an Alien queen is surgically removed from her body. The United Systems Military breed the Aliens which escape and an alien enhanced Ripley with group of mercenaries must stop them.I viewed the directors cut of Alien: Resurrection, it includes a few added bits - Lt. Ellen Ripley Clone #8 refers to Newt a few times, an alternate title sequence, a landing on earth and a few extra seconds here and there add to the mood making all the difference. The down side though - some of the acting is too hammy, the Alien effects are computerised in parts which is just as distracting as they were back in 1997. They should have stuck to practical effects until CGI effects were perfected as the physical special effects are outstanding.The New born is great and still gets my sympathy vote. The whole film isn't a gritty as the previous but the sets are fantastic. Some characters do get developed,there are some memorable moments which usually include Perlman or Weavers characters.The film including the extra bits bridge the earlier films making Resurrection a more enjoyable ride for Alien fans but to date, despite some good scenes it is debatably the weakest of the series. Watch and witness the resurrection.",Null,1,1,29 April 2004
World War Z," Sweepingly epic but a little too late.
","A mysterious virus like infection spreads rapidly throughout the world and a man in order to guarantee his family safety is tasked to locate the origin of the outbreak and assist in finding a cure.Without drawing comparison to Max Brooks' novel, World War Z's impact has been slightly numbed but the influx and saturation of zombie/virus films churned out over recent years. Nevertheless, under Marc Forster's direction WWZ is epic in scale with its sweeping scope and impressive special effects. Forster wisely focuses on Brad Pitt who is superb as ex UN official and family man Gerry Lane. Although the film may have benefited from an unknown actor for impact to Pitts credit he adds gravitas to the role as he journeys from one continent to another encountering perils and avoiding hordes of the twitching contaminated. The supporting cast give a solid backbone although no one stands out as being particularly memorable.The reanimated are wonderfully well done, menacing and for the most part scary - especially in numbers. The limited makeup design on show is excellently crafted, although there's explosions, fire fights the gore is limited and the film is not necessarily blatantly horrific as one would expect - this works both for and against depending on your expectations. That said, there's enough action and tension to keep the causal viewer happy. For the harden zombie fans there's atmosphere, finely executed visuals, memorably the immense birds eye views of the swarming population like ants and a calibre of realism not found in the majority of films this genre.With a genuine on location feel and despite being reminiscent of 28 Days/Weeks later with fast infected Forster delivers a globe trotting disaster flick with less deliberate rough edges. The communication between the infected is interesting, including their dormant state. What also works at times is an old school horror approach, there's lots of moments where the sound design leaves it to the viewers imagination. Notably though the editing and screenplay does pander to the masses, offering paint by numbers solutions and outcomes. For example the Israel segment (filmed in Malta) takes a little too long for Gerry to hone in on the noise leaving the viewer too much time to digest and anticipate what's going to happen next which robs the scene of much of its intended impact and tension. Nevertheless, the Moscow heroic like ending was infamously re-shot for a more quieter, personal closing and Gerry wife's fidelity left intact, which in my mind works better, more true to Gerry's every man personality and the set up that came before.All in all the apocalyptic vision is a solid, realistic and heartfelt entry if somewhat too late (in a saturated genre) to achieve greatness. Let's hope for a sequel that surpasses this with Pitt on board again.",Null,16,31,27 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Trek-commened, another entertaining adventure
","After a terrorist attack the crew of the Enterprise set out on unorthodox assassination mission.The time travel-alternate reality concept used in first film allows an old adversary to be awoken early allowing the writers to come up with an intriguing story. Although Kirk is played excellently once again by Chris Pine the writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof frustratingly portray him as indecisive, nevertheless, it gives Kirk a chance to walk some unfamiliar territory allowing him time to develop which gives fans something new. The closing act suffers from a predictable MacGuffin for Kirk's return, this hiccup aside the showdown with Spock is staged brilliantly as with the action setups throughout. The action coupled with the fantastic special-effects, music score by Michael Giacchino and J.J. Abrams slick direction delivers on expectations and entertainment value.There's a star studded cast including Bruce Greenwood and Peter Weller who is excellently cast as Marcus. Anton Yelchin's Chekov is given more to do while Karl Urban (Bones), John Cho (Sulu) and the exquisite Zoe Saldana as Uhura are given less to do in this outing. Nevertheless, it is still a real pleasure to watch them in character. Alice Eve is a notable addition especially for old school trek fans as Carol. Funny man Simon Pegg is Scotty once again and has some of the best moments with his silent alien sidekick returning as a welcomed addition. Without drawing comparisons with other incarnation's outings Benedict Cumberbatch is perfectly cast as the intellectual, superior, genetically enhanced foe of Kirk.Like it predecessor if you've never seen Star Trek it doesn't matter as the story can be viewed as a stand alone sci-fi adventure film. However, die-hard fans should love the references to earlier Star Trek stories and characters. Highly Trek-commened.",Null,1,2,25 August 2013
The Babadook," Metaphoric symbolism chiller when good pop up books go bad
","A mother, after the death of her husband has to deal with her son's fear of a monster that she finds in a mysterious pop-up book.With a mix of modern horror effects, genuine tension writer/ director Jennifer Kent offers old school thrills and chills in Babadook. The small core cast are exceptional. Its grey palette naturalistic setting captured by Radek Ladczuk's cinematography coupled with music by Jed Kurzel, eerie sound and special effects add to the mix of creepiness. It's pacing are like the classic horror films, taking a leaf from The Shining as well as Nosferatu to name a few. It's also reminiscent of the more recent Saint Ange/House of Voices, The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh, Let The Right One In, Innkeepers and Woman in Black with Mister Badadook being kept in the shadows for the first third of the film. The closing act is not a grounded as the psychological horror that come prior, mirroring the short comings of Deliver Us from Evil with its arguably over blown closing act. That said, this modest budget Australian horror delivers chills down the spine and at times disturbing scenes of borderline physical and mental abuse. Actress Essie Davis is exceptional as Amelia and her difficult son Samuel played by Noah Wiseman is wonderfully cast. To his credit he is one of the few non annoying child actors to grace a horror drama.It's not just about the hidden monsters that lurk in the dark and in your mind. There's many metaphors and symbolism lurking beneath. It's themes are hard hitting and touching; prescription drug abuse, school intervention, grieving, the plight of single parenting, breaking children bonds and help from family and professionals.As evil takes a foothold and the lines of reality are blurred, Kent delivers the the tension and nightmares you'd expect, its well acted, refreshingly without a cliché teen in sight.

Borrowing from Disney's own Aladdin and key visuals from the game, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is entertaining enough. What's notable is John Seale's cinematography, sweeping deserts and fantastic skylines and a great score by Harry Gregson-Williams.Gemma Arterton is great as Tamina, however, Ben Kingsley gives another average performance and Alfred Molina appears to have been handed a Mummy squeal script. The brothers of the Prince of Persia, 'Rock n Roller' star Toby Kebbell is on top form but does not get enough screen-time and Jeff from 'Coupling', Richard Coyle, is surprisingly superb. Jake Gyllenhaal looks comfortable in the lead, nevertheless, he lacks hero charisma.There's swordplay and special effects galore, but the big budgeter only amounts to average fun.",Null,4,8,19 October 2010

Its long run time has perfect pace, but don't go expecting the roller coaster ride of Goodfellas or Casino, this echoes classics like The Godfather's and Once Upon A Time in America's pacing with the feel of JFK to name a few.It's poignant, funny and the violence boldly plays second fiddle to the characters and their relationships. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are on fine form along with Harvey Keitel (whose screentime is limited) with their ageing special effects holding up for the most part (Pacino looks a little off at times).

Alexander," Third time lucky, Stone delivers an epic
","Oliver Stone's latest version of Alexander follows the King of Macedonia from childhood to adulthood, leading his men against the Persian Empire. He then pushes his army across the world further than any Westerner, but has he gone too far?Stone revisits this historical epic, without the interference of the studio executives, critics and such gives him the opportunity to deliver his third and 'final cut' of Alexander. It's 213 minutes of bad road which isn't a negative,this only means it's a tougher journey but in an all terrain vehicle.  This is a longer, intense, more deeply explored version of the story and characters.  It still contains the alleged faults of the previous versions, accents, wigs, casting etc. But these are easy targets for the casual viewer or critic. There are admittedly some larger than life performances, but there is also some great subtle and fine cameos from both Christopher Plumber and Anthony Hopkins. Leads and supporting cast include Jolie, Farrell, Dawson and Leto, to name a few who are all exceptional.What you have is an epic film with a multitude of characters and story layers. Despite the supposed historical inaccuracies it is a well constructed and entertaining movie that has an understated score, great effects, sets, fantastic locations, make-up and costumes. Stone proves he is still at the top of his game, with every shot capturing a perfect moment in time. While less commercially glossy than Troy (2004), it is more in the tone of Ridley Scott's also criticised Kingdom of Heaven (2005).All in all Alexander Revisited the Final Cut is a solid film of epic grandeur like the story of the man himself.",Null,0,2,7 January 2011
Terminator Salvation," Terminator-tastic a franchise salvaged
","A man put to death wakes ups in the future where machines rule the world and makes a choice to save himself or the future of mankind. This is what Terminator should be like. It is reminiscent of the grittiness of the first film, from the computer like credits, to the title introducing 2018 - a real terminator fans dream.Christian Bale is John Connor and without a doubt adds weight to the film with his acting ability. Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright is the future; he will become a great star. Both he and Bale are the glue to this instalment. Moon Bloodgood's brief but pivotal appearance is very good and Helena Bonham Carter gives heartfelt cameo. My hat goes off to newcomer Anton Yelchin as he does a great job of 'becoming' Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese. The only negative remark I have is that Bryce as Kate doesn't get enough to do and because of this is very detached from the character Claire Danes portrayed in the third film.MCG & the writers have constructed and crafted the film well and the music score by ever reliable Elfman compliments it nicely. A welcomed voice from the past show up to add icing to the cake. The effects are great throughout apart from the showcase skin covered T800 at the end. It was nice to see 'Arnie' and I hope there's more of him digitally in the future. It did look a little rushed but nothing could spoil this original and welcomed spin on this new Terminator movie that welcomely sticks close to the original subject matter.This should please true Terminator fans and satisfy new comers.",Null,4,7,4 June 2009
Thor: Ragnarok," Good-vibe superhero entertainment
","Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe and finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop the ruthless God Hela.Director Taika Waititi offers more fun than the overlong, padded majority of Marvel films than it should, Thor Ragnarok has plenty of humour (maybe a little too much). From the special effects to costume design and colourful characters including actors Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor goes through a few changes certainly looks wise right up until the end. There's a welcomed on form return of Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston's sly Loki, Mark Ruffalo, who gets plenty to do with his dazed Banner and there's more Hulk action, with Anthony Hopkins' nonchalant Odin and Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange who both cameo.New comers to the series evil Cate Blanchett, who is not just a 'end level baddie', Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster and Karl Urban give more than the stereotype unsavoury characters, there's also a few twists and turns. Tessa Thompson is also noteworthy and excellent Clancy Brown voices Surtur. Waititi also voices the memorable Korg.There's the obligatory end credit scene, here two of them. Interestingly where as the Led Zeppelin 'Immigrant Song' is overused Mark Mothersbaugh's music and the score is fitting to the 80s vibe throughout, sadly Magic Sword's epic tune 'In The Face of Evil' appears to be omitted from the feature, only appearing in the trailer. Still Mothersbaugh's music has a similar feel.Overall, Ragnarok's strength lay in its entertainment value, thanks to some relaxed writing, likeable characters and story beats.

I'm not a fan of 'super' zombie's, however, I enjoyed this one more than the second.It was good to see zombies in a desert wasteland setting but the film has a cheap look to it in parts. Oded Fehr, Iain Glen and Mike Epps return, Ali Larter is a welcomed new addition as Claire, but the rest of the acting from the supporting cast isn't too wonderful.Milla Jovovich (despite a odd hair-cut) once again is just what the doctor ordered as Alice who develops her 'powers' throughout. There are plenty of tussles, zombie action, killer birds and it has some great ideas, themes and a surprise electrifying closing.Under Russell Mulcahy direction it has it's moments.

","The Terminator, a cyborg assassin is sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to alter the future. However, a solider is also sent back to stop the assassin. The Terminator remains one of the most enjoyable Science fiction films of all time. Bradfield's pulse pumping score and nostalgic music from an array of obscure bands all adds to the lure of this timeless classic. James Cameron's direction is excellent, giving the visuals scope and depth. His above average story and screenplay stop it falling into B-movie hell. The time travel is logical; in as much as if Sarah had never met Kyle, John would have been the off spring of one of her dates. Either way it's highly satisfying science fiction and not science fact.The films cast include Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen who play it natural and straight, Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson briefly turn up. The leads Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor give flawless performances and keep you routing for their survival from the now infamous Arnold Schwarzenegger, as the Terminator.

The Hateful Eight," Great character play.
","A blizzard forces a group of four to take shelter at Minnie's Haberdashery where they encounter four more strangers. With betrayal and deception, the eight strangers realise they may not make it to destination, Red Rock, after all.The Hateful Eight offers impeccable framing, mountain landscapes, opening with a snow covered statue of Jesus. This film is all about justice and executions. The film is broken up with synonymous Quentin Tarantino chapter title cards. With Outlaw Josey Wales and Spaghetti Western coolness mixed with Tarantino seemingly nonchalant, yet, diligent story telling The Hateful Eight partly plays out like a heavyweight Cluedo mystery. Escaping an impeding blizzard menacing Russell known as the Hangman and bounty hunter outlaw Samuel Jackson ooze charisma and the whole cast clearly enjoy the wordplay. With its few locations (Reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs), as the group are isolated at a stagecoach passover (incidentally including Dogs' actor Tim Roth) it's mostly reliant on the actors talents and script. There's notably interesting flashbacks and a midway 4th wall voice over which brakes the confinement of the film up. Thankfully, the planets are aligned and all the elements like a jigsaw puzzle fit together in Tarantino's favour.Ennio Morricone score is perfect, but Tarantino also slips in a track and later a song performance (by an almost unrecognisable excellent Jennifer Jason Leigh) which surprisingly work considering its a winter set Western. There's a fanboy moment in a snowstorm where they stake guide rods and Ennio's score pulses harking back to the remote beats and paranoia of The Thing. It has a small cast ensemble. As the opening credits run anyone with an appreciation of film will have a inclination it's a Tarantino film simply by its tight casting, from classic to cult actors. Many he has already worked with and some he's prompted a deserving career revival. Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding with his Sherlock-like prowess. Walton Goggins is particularly notable. The supporting cast are great and include the likes of Zoe Bell, (surprisingly seriously good) Channing Tatum, Michael Madsen (also of Reservoir Dogs) to name a few.It's a fine production, packed with seemingly period authenticity, excellent costumes, props, right down to the mutton chops and facial hair. There's plenty of historical social commentary, modern mirroring subtext and choice language that intentional or not will no doubt cause ears to prick up as the array of characters interact. Cinematographer Robert Richardson, who has worked with Tarantino on various film along with the naturalist lighting and setting gives the proceedings visual weight.Lincoln letters, horse carriages, shootouts, it's gritty, violent, hard hitting packed with punchy dialogue driven scenes. It's edgy, naturalistic with poisoning, double crosses, twists and turns synonymous with Tarantino's back catalogue. There's also a memorable gross out scene with sick and blood, also severed limbs courteous of make-up veteran Greg Nicotero. There's exploding heads and when the tension builds and shoot outs happen they have a brutal impact.There are great character arcs and development but debatably Russell and Roth steal the show. It's undeniably talkie but with plot surprises, fine performances and sharp writing, if you like Tarantino's trademark style and Westerns in general it's doesn't get much better than this.",Null,9,41,20 December 2015
The Adventures of Tintin," Good but there is something missing
","Courageous reporter Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock set off on a treasure hunt for three scrolls hidden within a model ships while fending off the villainous Sakharine.There's something delightfully wonderful about the visual experience that Steven Spielberg's Tintin offers yet it is still a stilted adventure. Based on Hergé's comic book series Tintin is a celebrated European character (much like Asterix the Gaul which would be amazing if produced in the same medium). John Williams gives a solid yet Indiana Jones sounding score. The characters are wonderfully faithful and the detailed CGI cast really capture their spirit successfully. There is an array of famous actors Jamie Bell(Tintin), Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig to name a few and their voices and movement really bring the characters to life.It's an immense first outing for Tintin, although like Spielberg's use of the motion capture technology, it feels like it's trying to find its feet. You can't but help feel that the first instalment may have fared better under Jackson's direction (given his experience with the technology) overlooked by Steven's watchful eye. Then have Spielberg direct the next one. However, it wasn't meant to be. With all the focus on the action there is little mystery that Tintin is renowned for and while the action is wonderful along with the slapstick comedy there's something missing that writers Moffat, Wright and Cornish exclude and that is a true sense of mystery.Although it has some awe-inspiring set ups it is just not as fun or as intriguing as you'd possibly expect given Hergé's source material.",Null,0,0,2 April 2012

Here Parker is not a reporter yet, he's still really a Spider-boy. Thankfully it's not another direct origin story but Spidey is coming used to his new powers. In this Marvel film universe Parker has an intelligent computer Iron Man-like suit, Karen, voice by Jennifer Connelly. The computer and Parker's relationship makes for some genuine laughs. But it's never clearly defined what Spidey's powers actually are without Karen the A.I. suit, aside from strength and practical web-shooters. It's great that his mask has visors, providing more expressiveness to his appearance like in the comics/cartoons, but we need more Spidey sense.Watts has a lot of practical and causal suited up Spiderman but there's still too much obvious CGI as appose to just wire replacement. The on location feel helps sell the environment and you buy into Parker's world. Holland has the 70's live action TV show likability of Nicholas Hammond and captures the spirit of Spiderman in the dialogue and action set ups but also the teen angst. Without drawing too many comparisons, yes, it's another actor, another Spiderman, under Sony while Tobey Maguire was a good actor, arguably Sam Raimi's offerings struggled to capture the comic or cartoon feel. Although Andrew Garfield was perfectly cast and Marc Webb's films were closer to the Parker we love, it wasn't fresh enough coming in the shadow of the previous three. All suffered from a reliance on a CGI Spiderman and overlong paint by numbers story. What Watts and writers do get right is the bad guy, Michael Keaton does a great job as grounded villain Vulture that offers a curve ball revelation in the last quarter. His character isn't black and white, with bags of motivation and purpose. As a nod to fans they also subtly introduce MJ and Flash is updated fittingly. There's some Avengers jokes and the comedy in general hits the mark. Especially with Holland's Michael .J .Fox toned quips and Parker's Teenwolf-like high school insecurities and Superman identity crisis work. His sidekick friend Jacob Batalon's Ned who offers some good comic relief. Uncle Ben is omitted. Stan Lee has an obligatory cameo.Jon Favreau's Hogan and Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark/Iron Man do turn up a little too much and feel forced fan service in there extended cameos. Gwyneth Paltrow Pepper Potts briefly appears along with Tyne Daly. Bokeem Woodbine has notable screen presence as Tom Holland's Shockers replacement. Also stick around for Keaton's telling mid-end credits segment.

","Once again the cast reunite to bring the ultimate ending to the Star Wars saga. This time rebels must rescue Han Solo and bring to an end the Emperor second Death Star to free the galaxy once and for all. However, will Luke (Mark Hamill) chose to join Darth Vader and become one with the dark side.With more laser guns, light sabres and spaceships Return of the Jedi has a mixed tone of both Star Wars and Empire Strikes back, which leaves the final instalment less balanced than its predecessors. Cardiff born director Richard Marquand does a good job at handling so many locations, effects, characters and so on. However, and I'm not sure why some effects are not executed well compared to aforementioned instalments. That said, there are multiple setups action scenes, the attack on the Death Star, the battle on Endor and showdown between Vader and Luke. The scenes involving Mark Hamill and Vader (David Prowse) give weight and emotion to ROTJ but are few and far between. Also the moments on Dagobar with Yoda, faultless Alec Guinness (as Ben 'Obi-Wan' Kenobi) and a revealing scene between Luke and Leia feel hurried. The make-up is excellent and the score once again is stirring. Both Anthony Daniels C-3PO and Peter Mayhew Chewbacca are given the chance to shine a little more. The supporting cast are solid, Ian McDiarmid is outstanding as the The Emperor and the puppeteers do a fantastic job of bringing the droid and alien-like characters to life.There are stand out moments notably the speeder chase, and there's atmosphere created especially in Jabba's palace segments and in the stark Death Star scenes. There are humorous one liners within Lawrence Kasdan's dialogue and some family friendly fun courteous of the Ewoks, pint size bear like creatures.Nevertheless, there's contrast in look and nature to Return of the Jedi that at times makes it feel disjointed, crammed and rushed, as if George Lucas is trying to hastily tie his story up.Overall, it's great entertainment and everything you'd expect from a sci-fi including laser guns, light sabres and spaceships.",Null,0,1,9 May 2011
The Expendables," Nostalgic harking back to action heydays
","The Expendables is an old-school, kick-ass action movie, but for 2010. The fighting is rougher, the use of knives and shooting are bloodier and the explosions are bigger. What hasn't changed though is the awful dialogue, and true to 80's tradition the female characters are not given much to do.Old Sly Stallone is never given enough credit, he's a nominated director, writer and actor. Compared to his other 80's counter parts you'd expect him to still be a huge bankable star, but that just hasn't been the case and he's seen career ups and downs. Following up the surprisingly great Rambo, Stallone is on slightly lesser form here, with an almost homage to the action flicks he starred in or went head to head with himself in the 80's.There's lot to like about The Expendables, naturally there's lot of action set ups and some nice 'buddy' chemistry between Jason, Jet and Sly. Eric Roberts put's in a good performance and it's great to see him in a blockbuster. There's welcomed cameo's from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. This action has an array of old and new action stars including Dolph Lundgren and Steve Austin. The car Barney Ross (Stallone) drives is similar to the one in Cobra (1986) and there are some other nods in there.For me Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) stands out the most, and while Mickey Rourke is given some meaty dialogue it seems too heavy for the theatrics of the rest of the film.Don't watch expecting anything spectacular or special, The Expendables is just R rated fun with a nostalgic cast that will leave you with a grin on your face.",Null,2,6,6 September 2010
Alien," A perfect blend of tension to breaking point
","The commercial towing spaceship Nostromo is on a return trip to Earth, after receiving a transmission it picks an Alien that terrorises the crew of seven and they must fight for survival. Space, spaceships, androids and aliens, and no it's not Starwars or Startrek...Alien is a perfect blend of characterisation, visual effects, sound and score. What separates this from the two franchises above is the gritty realism, a brooding atmospheric and claustrophobic feel that has given the film both cult and classic status. So much so it spawned its own franchise.The acting is provided by a perfect heavy-weight cast that includes John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Tom Skerritt. Dan O'Bannon's screen-play, coupled with Ridley Scott's visuals stop this becoming just another monster alien movie or space film. The subject matter is delivered completely seriously and you become immersed in the dread, fear and uncertainty as even the main characters get killed off (which has become common place these days). Who will be the hero or the heroine?H.R.Giger creature designs of the face huger and Alien is the ace in the hole and Jerry Goldsmith score mixed with the sound effects gives the film a nightmarish feel that build up the tension to breaking point. Scott's direction is outstanding, creating the most fantastic and memorable moments in film history which push your fear threshold.Compulsive viewing for Sci-fi fans who want story over action or in this case a steak to digest instead of fast food.

Black Mass," Engrossing gangster film
","The True Story of an alliance Between the FBI and the Boston Irish Mob.Director Scott Cooper offers an intermittently ultra violent, well acted and staged film, the Black Mass is strong gangster film with a large scope. While not reaching the heights of the Godfather parts, Goodfellas or Once Upon a time in America, it's certainly up there if not surpasses the comparable Donnie Brasco and Casino.There's a strong supporting cast of actors, lead Johnny Depp is steely and downright intimidating as 'Whitey' Bulger. His brother Bill, a politician is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and (even though top billed) has limited screen time. Joel Edgerton is FBI agent John Connolly and steals the show. Notable is Kevin Bacon.Depp is fantastic right down to his shoddy teeth, the aged makeup as it flips between time periods, not just on Depp, but the other cast members is terrific. The set design, locations and music captures the period back drop flawlessly.While some of the accents may not be perfect, Cooper and writers Jez Butterworth Mark Mallouk based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill offer a deeply engrossing shocking gangster tale.",Null,0,1,4 November 2015
The Town," Hats and masks off to Affleck.
","A lifetime Charlestown, Boston crook falls in love with the bank teller of his last 'job' only to find himself forced to carry out one last heist to ensure her safety.In the vein of Heat (1995), Ben Affleck directs and stars in this gritty, stripped back heist movie. Smartly limiting the gimmicky use of the Point Break (1991) robber mask idea The Town delivers a realistic yarn with its on location look.The cast give good performances although it may have befitted from Affleck being totally behind the camera. The late great Pete Postlewaite briefly appears, Jeremy Renner is edgy as Coughlin and plays against typecast, while love interest Rebecca Hall gives a weighty performance both Blake Lively and Jon Hamm as Special Agent Adam Frawley are notable.Thankfully this has very little Hollywood gloss and tries to avoid clichés wherever possible. It's more drama than action with some tension driven shootout scenes littered thought. The Town may not define the genre, but certainly it proves that Affleck can direct and deliver a solid piece of entertainment. Surprisingly recommended.",Null,0,2,8 July 2013
Underworld Awakening," Grittier, fast paced but tunnelled.
","Vampire warrioress Selene, escapes imprisonment to find herself in a world where humans have discovered the existence of both Vampire and Lycans. Soon she uncovers a secret that shakes her world and the future of the clans. With a sleek stylish opening that summarises the previous films it quickly moves on to set up the new story. From the outset there feels like there's more blood, action, bullets, tight outfits and (Kate) makeup. Underworld retains its dark look - here directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein gives it a look even more ominous, grounded and overall grittier feel than the other instalments, certainly than the third. However, there's less scope than the previous outings limited by the story. The Lycan design has changed due to the creatures going 'underground' some of the CGI effects miss the mark but for the most part are executed well. The supporting cast are all on form right down to Eve play by the young actress India Eisley.  Kate Beckinsale as usual is mesmerising ensuring a solid backbone to the film reinforced by strong performances from (underused) Charles Dance and Stephen Rea. Wes Bentley cameos which is a short-lived shame. Awaking is just that; a shake up of the franchise it feels like a filler until part 5, with high octane heavy action excitement including Über Werewolves. With the character of Michael Corvin and Speedman's 'Terminator Salvation' styled appearance a fifth instalment even though somewhat forced is still welcomed.",Null,0,2,13 May 2012
Suicide Squad," Smith, Kinnaman, Robbie and Co. shine but are let down by the plotting
","U.S. intelligence officer decides to assemble a team of dangerous, incarcerated super villains who are held to ransom for a top-secret mission.David Ayer's dark comic book film Suicide Squad offers plenty of solid acting, but the film feel like a series of abridged clips in a paper thin story, which is a shame given Will Smith's fine performance as Dead Shot and Joel Kinnaman's first-rate Rick Flag. Actually the cast save this suicide run including the likes of Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez who has an horrific back story as Diablo and gets a memorable show down with an Incubus. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is notable with plenty of presence as Killer Croc. Ben Affleck's Batman's cameo and The Jokers failed attempts to reunite with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is at times more interesting than David Ayer's popcorn servicing plot. Ayer's bid to frame all the squad Magnificent Seven/Reservoir Dogs style arguably feels staged and overtly over done. Steven Price's music helps the action and poses with some techno Rambo-like motifs. The all-villain fighting team spend too much time fighting faceless hordes of monster entities. That's not to say that Ayer doesn't deliver of the directing duties or aesthetics, the look of Suicide Squad oozes an edgy ominous atmosphere and a quantity of dialogue and cutting humour hit the mark. Its just all undermined by paint by numbers plotting and a collection of convenient coincidences as the team log heads with intelligence operative Amanda Waller and/or is attacked by the Enchantress, her brother and their minions.With the team forced to carry out the governments wishes or have their heads blown off to Ayer credit there's poignant moments with a sense of camaraderie and heart much of which come from Smith, Kinnaman and Robbie. Jai Courtney redeems himself as Boomerang after his stint as Kyle Reese. Sadly, at times confined to flashbacks Jared Leto's admirable maniacal uncomfortable take on The Joker is left to just pop up now and again like a whirlwind Silver tooth evil Cesar Romero. Robbie's Quinn and Leto's Joker tortured Stockholm syndrome-like relationship is scarily realised. Their switch-blade romance reminiscent of Natural Born Killers and the like would have made an interesting dark original film in its own right. Nigglingly Ayer on occasion debatably reduces Robbie to eye candy (by default) and Harley could have been played by anyone with the equal amount of nihilistic sassiness which under serves both the character and the actor, thankfully the flashbacks flesh her out but Robbie is spread quip thin in the main story. The editing and pacing doesn't seem to help things either, Suicide Squad possibly could have benefited with the back-stories being extended and playing out chronologically, even over two films - as it rushes to get to a place and that somewhere never quite pays off which is a crying shame giving the effort put in. Cara Delevingne puts in a good dual role innings as June Moone/Enchantress but the otherworldly unstoppable CGI villain while well realised feels out of place, the CGI versus the gritty underdogs doesn't seem to hold up in the closing. There's also a tagged on ending with an unnecessary (Marvel style) scene that sets up the Justice League movie instead of a Suicide Squad sequel, which leaves the Squad characters hanging.Warner Bros' Suicide Squad is entertaining but frustrating, it's worth watching for the actor's efforts if you can over look its short comings. Will Smith and company require another fairer crack of the whip.",Null,0,1,25 August 2016
Shutter Island," Scorese perfectly recreates the 1954
","U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniel's and his partner investigating the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane and is apparently hiding on the remote Shutter Island.Martin Scorsese again demonstrates why he is one of the worlds best directors. The CGI is unnoticeable and only used to create the imagery of Shutter Island. A WW2 concentration camp, Dachau, is recreated for a disturbing and key scene. Scorsese perfectly recreates the 1954, bring the best of location, sets, lighting and sound together to deliver a fantastic psychological thriller.The cast is a fine line-up that includes Leonardo DiCaprio who manages to get away with the complexity of the characters situation; Swede Max von Sydow is on usual perfect form. Zodiac (2007) and Collateral's (2004) Mark Ruffalo is excellent, although a little under used as Daniel's partner. Thankfully Ben Kingsley has taken on a role worthy of his abilities as the empathetic Dr. John Cawley. In addition, Ted Levine and Elias Koteas show up in almost cameo appearances.There's plenty to like about Shutter Island, it exudes atmosphere, and it's foreboding and eerie. The story tackles alcoholism, mental health and asks the viewer to question what should be perceived as a dream and what should perceives as real. It's an intriguing mystery that not since Angel Heart (1987) have I seen such a well constructed psychological period film. Credit must go to the Laeta Kalogridis' screen-play and Dennis Lehane's novel.Possibly one of Martin Scorsese best films.",Null,0,1,4 August 2010
Interstellar," A lengthy mix of visuals and sentiment
","The Earth is quickly becoming uninhabitable and a group of explorers embark on an interstellar voyage into the unknown via a wormhole in search of a planet that can sustain life. Directed by Christopher Nolan Interstellar is stunning, thoughtful and magnificently written with an edge of intellect. Where as the comparable visual Gravity (2013) was lite on plot Nolan's latest manages a good mix of both.There's a great supporting cast including the likes of John Lithgow and Ellen Burstyn, both Matt Damon and Topher Grace are notable. There is a fantastic performance from Matthew McConaughey who plays Coop a pilot that has the future of human race in his hands and is desperate to see his children again. Michael Caine plays professor Brand a NASA physicist tasked with saving mankind. Caine is perfectly cast, emotionally excelling in the role. Jessica Chastain is fantastic as Coop's daughter who he leaves behind.Flipping between the drama on Earth and the Endurance's mission beyond our solar system, amongst the excellent special effects there's an abundance of emotion between the characters. Written by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan the narrative on paper may sound kitschy but it's executed with believability and for the majority feels very grounded in reality which is reinforced by the great sets and on the location feel. There are some great set-ups, the dangerous docking, the tsunami water planet and harsh ice planet segments are particularly memorable.It's unnecessary lengthy but well paced, moments are reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Contact (1997), Moon (2009) and Silent Running (1972) including an intriguingly designed robot (voiced here by Bill Irwin). The sound design is outstanding and you listen to what the characters hear in their helmets at times and there's the silence of space while explosions grace the screen. Much of the film is complemented by Hans Zimmer's great score.With a twist and surprise ending like Nolan's underrated Insomnia it is sentimental, tugging at the heart strings. All the sci-fi elements space exploration and seemingly an extraterrestrial beings aside at its core is a father and daughter relationship. Highly recommend.",Null,1,4,9 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Abraham's delivers an impossible feat, that Star Wars magic.
","Finn, Poe Dameron and the Resistance commence a final battle against new and old enemies of the First Order. As Rey finds out who her parents really were.In terms of what a Star Wars film should be, director J. J. Abraham delivers a brilliant return form layered with Lucas magic.Rian Johnson 's Last Jedi as much as it tried to be different was too subtle in its script, and lacked execution. That said, whether by accident or design with the events of Rise it makes the dialouge of Last Jedi more pertinent, for example Luke says 'he Kylo would bring destruction and pain and death, and the end of everything I love.' So in retrospect he already saw the death of Han and Leia. Last Jedi actually works better now in since Rise of Skywalker and the lines especially between Rey and Ben have more relevance. Rise of Skywalker doesn't pretend to be anything more or less than a Star Wars film. Adam Driver is impressive, thankfully, many of the characters get room to breathe, John Boyega's Finn, Daisy Ridley's Rey and especially Oscar Isaac's likeable Poe. Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) no pun intended gets to shine.It's packed with homages, throwbacks and treads new ground. Chewie gets his medal, Lando (Billy D. Williams) returns, finally we see a flashback of Leia (Carrie Fisher) training, Harrison Ford's Han Solo cameos and the voices of many our favourite saga series main characters are heard. Denis Lawson even briefly appears as Wedge Antilles.As much as harden fans would have liked all the force ghosts to appear it makes sense that Rey only saw those known to her, not just those who the audience knew. Leia, Kylo and Rey also get a fitting resolve. Even Hux gets closure. Mark Hamill's Luke fittingly appears along with Ewoks, Jawas and Tatooine.With excellent special effects, sets and music score it may not have the old school feel of Rogue One or Solo but it's packed with action of the Madalorian, Force Awakens and emotional energy of Last Jedi. It's a great closure with fan satisfaction.As a Star Wars film (while you could argue that no films should have been made since Return of the Jedi) it's great, as a sequel to Last Jedi it excels.Overall, Abraham's delivers an almost impossible feat, some Star Wars magic.",Null,11,26,19 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Anything it lacks is made up for in scope.
","When Earth is periodically attacked by gigantic monster-like creatures (Kaijus) that emerge from the Pacific Rim, immense Robots (Jaegers) are created and controlled by human pilots to prevent our extinction.This is more linear than director Guillermo Del Toro's other films and productions, it's a popcorn summer flick which delivers on entrainment. Del Toro and writer Travis Beacham's concept is steeped in Asian mythology and pop culture, not seen since B-film Robot Jox (1989) and more recently the panned Skyline (2010). While it lacks the complexly of Del Toro's other offerings it delivers on wonderful spectacular visuals and impressive special effects. It's dark, it's oily - reminiscent of Godzilla (1998) and Del Toro's own Mimic (1997) and Hellboy (2004) in atmosphere it's still Del Toro but he makes every 12 year old dream come true in content. Comparably where Transformers (2007) felt over long and 'promised' to deliver, crammed with unnecessary padded dialogue, Rim actually delivers and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.It has a memorable score by Ramin Djawadi and a powerful sound design to match. The lead actors are functional and effective enough although no one matches Idris Elba's calibre. Ron Perlman is limited to a humours extended cameo. There's the obligatory comic release characters, a character out for revenge, the doubting jock, and a guy haunted by the events from his past to name a few clichés - yes it has its Independence Day (1996) moments too but that limited cheese is addressed with the other players mocking and bringing the pretentious speeches back down to earth like a Jaeger's crashing on a Kaiju.There's no smoke and mirrors it's a B-film concept with a big budget, Pacific Rim is a basic fun move with the ILM visuals being more impressive than they need to be.",Null,0,3,29 July 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," The period feel is captured wonderfully but there's not enough of Weaving.
","Regular Joe, Steve Rogers is a bit on the weak side but a medical experiment makes him taller, stronger and faster. At the height of WWII Rogers is shipped to Europe to raise morale and he ends up going head-to-head with the 'Hydra' Nazis.Director Joe Johnston handles the period piece well, the American and European locations with a mixture of great set design and effects to fill in the background are fantastic. With artistic licence the time and feel is captured wonderfully, however, the modernistic look of certain weaponry is an unnecessary distraction which takes you out of the moment. It possibly should have been used sparingly for the bombs that are integral to the plot.  Nevertheless, the special effects used to make Chris Evans thinner and of smaller stature are outstanding, a real achievement. That said, some of CGI action scenes fair-less well under scrutiny. In the first third of the film Johnston manages with the aid of the screenplay to tease out a few questions about war, individual hopes and moral issues. The majority of the film is set at the peak of World War 2, which oozes patriotism but fans or anyone familiar with Marvels Captain America maybe disappointed with the lack the hero coming to terms with a modern environment or any present day plot or contemporary showdown with The Red Skull.The First Avenger: Captain America is at its most interesting when Chris Evans is Steve Rogers humble self, going through his army training then later finding his purpose.  There's some well written humour, the segment of the promotion tour of America to rally financial support of the war is complete with a dance number and showgirls which is highly entertaining. Writers Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to names a few contributors give some great lines and setups. Hugo Weaving is superbly cast as the Red Skull. Finely tuned Skeletor-like make up with an odd eeriness of Michael Jackson captures The Red Skull perfectly. Sadly, Hugo's talents are underutilised and he is given few dialogue scenes or interaction with his nemesis, leaving him pretty much your stereotype villain. Notable is Capote star Toby Jones as Dr Zola, the Skull's sidekick.  Tommy Lee Jones steals every scene as Col. Chester Phillips but Dominic Cooper is a welcomed surprise as Howard Hughes-alike, Howard Stark, who is of course father of Tony Stark a.k.a Iron-Man. Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter is first rate perfectly fitting to the time period with her looks. Dry, subtle and warming is Stanley Tucci as Dr. Abraham Erskine who underplays the character excellently but is sadly missed for the most part of the film. And of course no marvel film these days would be complete without a cameo from Stan Lee. Even more so than Iron Man, Hulk or Thor the closing really pushes S.H.I.E.L.D and the scene, plus preview after the credits reaffirms the need to push speedily to The Avengers rather than integrate it coming together slowly through sequels. Which is a missed opportunity. Chris Evans is adequate as Captian America, and thanks to a grounded, even performance he oddly fits. Disappointingly we never get to see a modern 'traditional' Captain America costume in this, again another annoying draw to see The Avengers, when a Captian 2 would have been more desirable in the first instance.The First Avenger is more fun during it's first half, with a good mix of action and drama. But the second half stumbles becoming a borderline predictable sci-fi rather than comic superhero as the script is thrown out for all out action.",Null,4,10,12 August 2011

Although Brian Cox as protagonist Ward Abbott is sorely, but rightly missing, there's enough unscrupulous officials played by seasoned actors Scott Glenn, Kramer, and David Strathairn who excellently portrays Noah Vosen to fill the gap.

","A 12-year-old girl is taken in by a hit man after her family is murdered by corrupt DEA agents. She wants to revenge but the killer is not only reluctant but against the idea being a perfectionist, a Professional.Considering this project was carried out to fill in the time due to delays with the Fifth Element it is debatably Luc Besson's finest moment as a director and writer.Jean Reno, plays the reserved and emotionally repressed hit man Léon who is unwittingly thrown into a relationship with a vulnerable young girl Mathilda (Portman). Both play their parts perfectly thanks to Besson's grounded script which gives weight and sentiment to the scenes. Occasionally the subject matter plays out like an opera or Greek tragedy, possibly one of Besson's most charming, emotional and at times tense films to date, not only did introduce the world to Natalie Portman, it showcases Garry at his best as Stansfield a disturbing psychotic. What's refreshing about Leon is the leads are shades of grey adding realism to the proceedings and avoiding formulaic characters. Supporting cast are first rate and give the film a backbone, (looking like a greasy spoon cook) Danny Aiello's mafioso boss Tony is notable.The outbursts of violence are we staged and hit man Leon is given some nice nuances avoiding clichés and stereo-type killer trappings, the love of Gene Kelly, nurturing a houseplant and the rules of a hit to name a few – possibly paving the way for the slower paced and similar styled assassin in The American (2010) and many copy-cat films since 1994.Luc Besson's Leon is a crafted work of art which surprisingly at times tugs at the heart strings, there's also great action scenes, wonderful old city locations and a fantastic music score by Éric Serra.

When a generator is sabotaged the 'Tech' drone engineer, Commander Jack Harper, begins to believe that there is a conspiracy at work.Credit to director Joseph Kosinski it's a fantastic looking film, the special effects are wonderfully finished, it is a visual treat from the decimated moon to the wastelands of New York City, Oblivion feels and looks real with the few action scenes a finely executed. The futuristic Apple-like props and set designs with slick costumes ooze cool even if reminiscent of opening of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes re-imagining.Despite a handful of writers, even with its generic script thanks to the high concept coupled with Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko's performances it has its emotional core. Andrea Riseborough is notable as Victoria and is the most effective of the cast while the talents of Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are limited to expository bit parts. Even Kurylenko really isn't given much to do.The score by Anthony Gonzalez's French electronic band M83 is outstanding, this coupled with the old soundtrack tunes add to the atmosphere and nostalgic themes running through Oblivion.The few Lucas-like chase scenes albeit breathtaking are nothing we haven't seen before and the whole film hinges on another film's concept. That said, if you've not seen Duncan Jones subtler 2009 science fiction offering Oblivion may deliver more surprises. Sci-fi ideas are often recycled - here concepts from the original Planet of the Apes, Solaris and Logan's Run to name a few, to be honest it would be an extensive list to name everything Oblivion borrows. As a sci-fi homage it works, for new comers to the genre it should be a blast. Nevertheless, for an A-list film with so much talent involved you expect something more original, even definitive or less derivative.Still it is great to see Cruise in another sci-fi and with a great score Kosinski's offers a grand looking, solid piece of entertainment.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent fantasy film
","The One Ring, crafted by Sauron must be destroyed in the place it was forged, the volcanic Mount Doom of Mordor.Thankfully, to his credit, director Peter Jackson delivers an adaptation in the heart and spirit of Tolkien's fantasy and the extended version offers even more of a bold, cinematic take as the Fellowship's heroes struggle to save Middle-earth. The Fellowship of the Ring is packed with danger and evil forces including haunting reaper-like Ring wraiths, pointy Orcs, a octopus- like creature, the Balrog a giant fierce demon and more. Jackon offers adventure, heartache and conflict as a group of Hobbits leave the safety of the Shire. Unlikely hero Frodo (Elijah Wood), a Hobbit that commits himself to the task of destroying a ring is helped by Sam (Sean Astin) his loyal friend and acquaintances Pippin Took (Billy Boyd) and Merry Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan). The characters are wonderfully brought to life by the acting talents on board. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is an endearing hero venerable too, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) an Elf and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a head strong dwarf aren't just standard warrior characters as they slowly develop an unlikely bonding. Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) is a wise guide and an insightful companion. Notable is Sean Bean as Boromir who gets a memorable story arc. As well as the main players there's notable actors Christopher Lee as the evil Saruman, Hugo Weaving as the powerful Elf Elron, otherworldly Liv Tyler an Elf who save Frodo from the scary Ring wraiths in a spectacularly filmed horse chase and there's also ethereal Cate Blanchett to name a few. Along with Howard Shore's mystical power score, as well as some Elven language, character development and breath-taking set-ups that already existed notably the chase through mines of Moria with its Cave Troll and demon. In the final act The Fellowship go hand to hand with the strong skilled imposing Uruk-hai.Jackson's extended version of The Fellowship of the Ring, reinserts scenes and shots that expand upon the characters and themes. It includes Isildur's death, more glimpses into Bilbo and Frodo Baggins relationship, Wood Elves leaving for Grey Havens, Aragorn singing, Galadriel offering gifts to the Fellowship which enrich the tone making them more powerful than the theatrical cut.It's a swords-n-sorcery epic with warfare which ends of a cliff hanger. In retrospect it was frustrating waiting for the next part but since you can now watch the whole three-part journey without the wait coupled with the extended scenes, all is forgiven. The production values are high. Weta's special effects for the most part are excellent, this coupled with the fantastic make costumes, props etc. and sweeping beautiful locations create a breathtaking masterpiece. Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring as well as being an admirable fantasy film sets the scene for the first-rate saga to come.",Null,0,0,25 July 2016
Man of Steel," Faster than a speeding bullet, faster than a locomotive train
","A baby is sent to Earth to escape the destruction of his own planet, as an adult his super powers have become stuff of legend but when humanity is threatened he must make a choice that will change his and our fate forever.What's clear from the outset is that Henry Cavill is a perfect Superman, also a fine actor, probably to the benefit of the viewer and like the late Reeves he is a little over qualified to play a comic book character. The oddity about Cavill's and David S. Goyer's Clark Kent is that he's far more interesting when he hasn't got the suit on, Superman while looking the part really hasn't much to say.Goyer and Christopher Nolan's story smartly avoids rehashing (within limit and where possible) previous incarnations, the alter ego mystery and relationship build up with Louise Lane and the working for the Daily Planet is mainly omitted here with interesting fleetingly dynamics in their place.The grim atmosphere and serious tone is welcomed, fitting the themes within the story. Gone is the glossy Marvel style pallet of the previous film incarnations and it is debatably more true to the tone of the later DC comics, sitting in the Dark Knight 'universe' possibly thanks to Nolan's writing/producing input.While Zack Snyder's fight scenes are a little too frantic comparable to the Spiderman trilogy (corrected in The Amazing Spiderman (2012)) they are wonderfully and superiorly put together even if somewhat repetitive. It's a shame Snyder's own Watchmen (2009) slow-motion effect wasn't used. Thankfully, this is counter balanced by some visual and interesting additions notably those featuring Jor-El perfectly played by Russell Crowe. That said, Laurence Fishburne is sorely underused. Both Diane Lane and Kevin Costner give weight and emotion to the proceedings. Michael Shannon while lacking the simmering subtlety of Terence Stamp's Zod is more fittingly menacing and physically imposing as the General.Amy Adams is solid as Lois Lane but while not underused like Fishburne is not given much substantial dialogue. Surprisingly it's not Cavill with his acting and physic who steals every scene, it's Antje Traue as Faora-Ul with her screen presence, piercing eyes, steely looks and accent to match. Credit needs to go to both Russell Crowe and the writers with bringing Jor-El to life, and the characters clever utilisation throughout.There's lot of new aspects to Man of Steel. While the opening is reminiscent of Star Wars (1977), John Carter (2012) and later The Thing (2011), AVP (2004) to name a few it is finely realised and is successful in expanding the alien races history, the planet Krypton's topography and outpost ship aspect. Sadly the third act is less satisfying containing so much obliteration and destruction that becomes numbing - possibly less would have be more.The first half is certainly when Man of Steel is at its strongest, with Snyder exceeding the character drama of Dawn of the Dead (2004) and this Superman outing works best when the alien invasion aspect of the antagonists are not focal.With great costumes, amazing effects and a powerful score from Han Zimmer, overall a great foundation even if a lacking a little meat and rushing the other main players introduction - namely Lois Lane.",Null,1,2,17 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," A Worthy sequel, with one of the greatest openings ever

However, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo successful takes over the reins from Danny Boyle.In 28 weeks the US Army secure a small area of London for the survivors to repopulate and start again. The story is told from Don's (Robert Carlyle) and his children point of view, exceptionally acted by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton giving the film a grounded personal feel and Catherine McCormack is great a part of the supporting cast.Fresnadillo builds up the tension splendidly and keeps you on the edge to the final as the soldier played exceptionally by Jeremy Renner who tries to get the children to safety.

The Thing," You gotta be Carpenter kidding me...
","After being freed from its ancient crash site an extraterrestrial life form infiltrates an Antarctic research station, imitating taking the appearance of the researchers that it kills.An atmospheric understated sci-fi at it best. I'll never understand how Carpenter lost the lustre in some of the other film he made, nevertheless, his Thing is one of his best movies and also once of the best sci-fi movies ever. Despite being based on the same source material (before remakes were popular) the thing has a look and feel of it's own and is very different from its 50's counterpart.The isolated setting, the astounding cinematography and scenery creates intrigue; drawing you in from the very beginning. It's a perfect horror/sci-fi cocktail of Ennio Morricone's haunting foreboding score, Rob Bottin and Stan Winston's benchmark practical effects (which are to-date arguably unsurpassed) Carpenters claustrophobic set ups and Bill Lancaster screenplay. It's rare that every single actor is exceptional and supplied with effective dialogue. All the cast from Kurt Russell to Wilford Brimley as Blair are all captivating, great casting by Anita Dann. The characters have their own issues and as the paranoia sets in relationships are forged and other broken, building to a bold and satisfying conclusion.This is more than just a cult film with a 'monster' hiding in warm places surrounded by snow, it's a finely tuned science fiction horror masterpiece.",Null,1,2,24 February 2010
The Revenant," Brilliant crisp story telling
","Thought to be a burden an injured man, Huge Glass, is left for dead. After his son is murderer he then begins a journey of recovery and revenge.Set in 1823, like the comparable Outlaw of Josey Wales, the characters feel real and are motivated, they all have shades of grey. However, director Alejandro G. Iñárritu excels the aforementioned in scope thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, natural lighting and advancements in film making. The Revenant is beautifully shot and really captures the cold outdoors authentically. It's realistic, harsh and uncompromising, showing the best and the worst of man. It captures the bitter coldness that survival films, the likes of Alive, The Edge and Deadly Pursuit a.k.a Shoot to Kill only touched on. The relentless breathtaking bear attack is as intense as Leonardo DiCaprio's committed performance as he fights to survive and avenge his son's death. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald cements the absorbing drama, his character like the natives and French offer justified, cold, punishing brute force from each others perspectives in contrast to the silence and beauty of nature. Thanks to the excellent performances, props, costumes and locations it's easy to buy into the story.The Revenant is a tour de force ultimate endurance tale and has heart and soul. The sober moments and relationship scenes with the indigenous characters are interesting, the history feels well researched. Gleeson as with Star Wars Force Awakens is average but engaging, DiCaprio and Hardy are outstanding along with the supporting cast. Will Poulter's involvement is particularly notable.It's very serious and justly is void of humour, but has irony woven throughout. From a horse falling from cliff, to wolves attacking bison, eating raw meat, avalanches and waterfalls, log cabins, outposts and tepees. It's a great frontier revenge survival thriller with multi layers. Recommend.",Null,0,4,12 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Tense humorous cat-and-mouse game
","The bar association asks insurance lawyer James B. Donovan to defend a suspected Russian spy arrested on American soil. When an American spy is captured Donovan becomes a negotiator for two of the world powers to agree the prisoners release.With the film based on real-life events writers Matt Charman, Joel and Ethan Coen turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often humorous cat-and-mouse game. Suffering with a cold, quick thinking breifcase touting Tom Hanks' law-abiding lead character Donovan is gripping as he is used as a go between by his own government with German and Russian officials. Hanks brings an everyday man vulnerability, akin to Michael Caines' Harry Palmer to the role. Steven Spielberg offers a finely crafted Cold War espionage thriller, wonderfully recreating the Cold War era thanks to clever special effects. The stakes are high, you witness the Berlin Wall being built, it's an appealing diplomatic film. There are tense moments littered throughout, notably when Donovan is tasked in defending a Russian spy in a court of law, the backlash from his community and the danger he puts his family carries an impact.Its a fine production. Bridge of Spies is interesting throughout and it surprisingly captures some old fashion Hollywood magic.",Null,1,1,3 June 2016
Split," Interesting thriller McAvoy and Buckley are outstanding
","Three girls are kidnapped by a man and must try and escape before a frightful personality The Beast comes to get them. With hints Red Dragon (2002) and echoes of Sybil (1976/2007) with a touch of 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) director, writer M. Night Shyamalan offers an interesting thriller. James McAvoy delivers a performance of a life time as Kevin who has 23 distinct personalities and one additional one, that all play off against each other, even imitating each other at one point. After kidnapping three girls and keeping them locked up in a cellar, surprisingly it is the edgy visits to his therapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher, wonderfully played by Betty Buckley that provide the most tension as you never know when he is going to snap. The slow undercurrent build up is Split's strength as the girls attempt to escape and we get to know many of Kevin's personas, Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / The Beast / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade. While McAvoy's 9 year old doesn't ring as true as the other characters he encompasses, the distinction between each is impressive. Especially the 24th personality which builds up like a High Noon (1952) showdown. Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey Cooke has a developed character and poignant story arc but always feel second to McAvoy.The worn on location feel works, a cellar, long corridors, city apartments and a zoo, Shyamalan's realistic setting has become a staple of his work, which helps draw you into the story. Two of the kidnapped girls feel under developed but possibly Shyamalan purposely does this for the viewer to focus on the third and in bid for you to sympathise with her and Kevin.With a Bruce Willis cameo, the post story twist of sorts will be lost on anyone who hasn't seen one particular film of Shyamalan. And to be honest unless you love this particular film or have a great memory, it will probably annoy rather than entice. That said, all that comes before draws the viewer in. Right down to Dr. Fletcher's assessment of what advantage split personalities can have and its application. Fletcher concludes that 'they' may something more.Although a mash-up of other films, thanks to McAvoy and Buckley it stands out from most in the genre. Shyamalan's atmosphere and attention to detail gives it some gravitas. Overall, worth watching for McAvoy's performance(s) alone.",Null,2,11,13 February 2017

It may not have the brooding atmosphere of the first film but considering creator James Cameron didn't write or direct, it turns out very watchable.T3 is close to the original concept and a nicely thought out sequel. It does disregard the notion of the T2 about the future not being set and sticks close to the first, in that, the future is set and things have to run their course.Despite Arnold Schwarzenegger has aged, he's again excellent as the Terminator. Newcomer Kristanna Loken as the silent and deadly T-X is fantastic and the rest of cast are sufficient. The effects and action scenes are impressive but the original music score is forgettable and the original theme turns up late at the end.There maybe a touch too much humour in this instalment but the brooding brave ending finishes the film on a fitting serious note.This film is certainly worth the watch.",Null,17,27,17 April 2007

Veteran and voice of Hong Kong Phooey, Scatman Crothers is superb and the array of actors small but memorable parts including, Bladerunners Joe Turkel as Lloyd the Bartender and Barry Nelson as Manger, Stuart Ullman.It's not the novel, Kubrick's the Shining one of the most impressive horror films ever made and on so many levels.",Null,0,2,20 February 2010

I was blown away on its first release, however, over the years I have found it to be less personal due to its grander scale.The score and stunts are outstanding, Robert Patrick is well cast at state of the art T1000, Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor but she is far removed from her innocent character as a result of the first film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator but is now the protector, whistle he is perfect as the 'character' in retrospect the edginess has gone that was set up in the first film.The film is without a doubt a spectacular defining moment in movie history, notably the CGI effects and make up.

Spider-Man," Lacks the wittiness of the comics.
","I've left reviewing Spider-Man for a long while, digesting, hoping it would grow on me. I loved Spider-Man, Stan Lee's great creation as a child, he was my favourite character.It was great to have such diverse director, I thought it would be the perfect comic book film with Sam Raimi at the helm to bring the character to life. However, I was let down by it's gloomy nuance. It lacked the entertaining, wittiness of the comics, cartoons that even the dated 70's films captured.Strangely, Fantastic Four (2005) and Iron Man (2008) successfully managed to capture the tone, feel and essence of Marvel and it's characters. Tobey Maguire is fine as Parker but it's a shame that the producers took the web-crawler in this drama batman-esquire direction and I'm not just talking Uncle Ben here, I mean the whole drawn-out heavy mood of the film.The villain Green Goblin / Norman Osborn is played perfectly by Willem Dafoe, and James Franco as Harry Osborn is great, but the rest are mediocre. The special effects are impressive for the most part and the music score is powerful with a hero feel to it. however, every effect moves at such a fast pace you never really get to see spidey he's a blur for the most part.After all is said and done Spider-Man and it's sequels are simply too much drama and not enough Spidey fun.",Null,0,0,16 March 2010

Ruffalo's performance is noteworthy and there's nice cameo's from Jason Statham and Peter W. Berg. Smith proves she's not just beautiful but is also a fantastic actress. As a side note, how an aged Cruise wasn't nominated for an Oscar I'll never know. His portrayal of the hit-man Vincent is outstanding.Director Michael Mann with a Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera (first such use in a major motion picture) captures the cool Californian night. The city suburbs, Los Angeles skylines and landscapes are used as the perfect the back drop of this thriller written by Stuart Beattie.

The Amazing Spider-Man," Good old Spidey returns.
","A boy is bitten by a spider and is given arachnid-like powers that allow him to become a vigilante crime fighter. Meanwhile, he unwittingly assists a Doctor to achieve his goal of regenerating limbs but its side effects jeopardises him and the inhabitants of his city.Director Marc Webb's Amazing Spider-man is essentially a satisfactory superhero film which captures the character of the Spider-man who appears in the comics and cartoons. While like its recent counterparts there's lots of computer generated imagery. However, this version benefits and looks much better for its practical segments that ground Spider-man making him that little bit more amazing.Rhys Ifans is excellent as the troubled, empathetic Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard. Again the special effects are well put together and The Lizard is wonderfully realised. Andrew Garfield balances his transition into a superhero coupled with the collage kid successfully and makes a great Peter Parker with his enjoyable wit, sincerity and charm. The supporting cast are first rate including the likes of Sally Field, Dennis Leary and Emma Stone as gifted love interest Gwen Stacy. Notably, Martin Sheen captures the sense of humour and gravity required for Uncle Ben. The pacing is spot on and the film never out stays it welcome, accompanied by a top James Horner score that really comes to life during the action scenes.While James Vanderbilt's screenplay with input from Steve Kloves and Alvin Sargent is full of subtleness, one liners and repartee, Vanderbilt's story is all too familiar reminiscent of X-Men (2000) our Lizard, like Magneto wants to make everyone like him. There's also the regurgitated plot elements.That's the main stumbling block for this incarnation of Spider-Man, familiarity. It hampers what essential is a good foundation. There were 25 years between the made for TV The Amazing Spider-man (1977) and Spider-man (2002) and in that time there were advancements in filmmaking and more money put into the first true film. With this Spidey there's less of a gap - with Sam Raimi's last surprisingly heavy and drawn out outing being 2007. Webb and cinematographer John Schwartzman can't get away from it being the same setting, period and time so the look here is inevitably similar. It's not that comic, film, cartoon Web slinger fans don't know origin story already but it's the fact it feels we've just seen the same thing, in the same medium only a moment ago.For anyone alien to the superhero this will be a great version of Spider-man. It's an improvement on its predecessor - certainly in its spirit and tone but by default it's not fresh.

Aliens," Aliens menacing and agile.
","The planet from Alien (1979) has been colonised, but contact is lost and a rescue team is dispatched. This 1986 sequel is action packed, bigger, louder, very gung-ho with Vietnam parallels.I'm torn I must say that at the time Aliens was the best action sci-fi films ever and probably still is, but overtime, I have grown less fond of Aliens and prefer the first Alien and re-edit of the 3rd.What is superior about Aliens is that it builds on what Ridley Scott created in first film, (even though some of Aliens ideas are based on cut scenes) surprise killings, misdirection and so on. The design and movement of the Alien is greatly improved, making the Alien far more menacing and agile than before. Space is stark, dark and cold and James Cameron captures the isolation and ominous atmosphere perfectly, with an effective use of lighting, shadow and set design.There's no doubt that Cameron is an exceptional director and writer. All the characters are built up slowly, Lance Henriksen as the synthetic Bishop and Paul Reiser as Burke give subtle performances. Michael Biehn as Hicks and Sigourney Weaver are terrific. Ripley as a character is fleshed out further and the effects and sound are amazing (winning Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects). Aliens is an unsurpassed solid sci-fi horror sequel packed with action and suspense but in retrospect it really is Alien pumped with more Ripley, testosterone and guns.",Null,1,1,10 March 2010
The Exorcist," An old hat and mix bag?
","A young teenager is possessed by a mysterious evil entity and her mother asks two priests for help in the hope they can save her daughter.From many of the comments placed, you could argue the film is almost over-rated. From the start the film still retains a creepy atmosphere but over the years it seems to have lost it's scare factor. That said, some scenes are still disturbing and the some foul language still amazes to be shocking.The score, sound and editing can sometimes be a mix bag but the acting and direction by William Friedkin is exceptional. Max von Sydows limited screen time leaves an impression and Jason Miller as Father Damien Karras plays the troubled priest, however the star is rightly Linda Blair as Regan, the actress is great especially for someone so young. There probably hasn't been a more intelligent horror film since 1973 or a better film on demonic possession. A must see for new horror fans.",Null,1,3,17 April 2007
The Conjuring 2," Wan's touch is hard to beat. Excellent horror entertainment.
","Lorraine wanting to retire from the spiritual field and Ed Warren tired of justifying what they do travel to north London to help a family plagued by a malicious spirit.Opening with a chilling medium session at the notorious Amityville home, where Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) has an encounter with the dead Lutz family and a demon nun, director James Wan hits the horror road running. The creepy nun from Ed's (Patrick Wilson) painting an omen of death later turns up at Ed and Lorraine's home and we're introduced to their teenage daughter. Meanwhile, a single mother raising four children are harassed by the previous deceased occupant. With a fistful of writers and the sharp editor, Wan creates a good build up, fleeting between the US and UK and although it takes its time getting Ed and Lorraine to the English house, it works giving the film scope.The cast particularly the child actors are great and Farmiga shines. Wilson delivers another great performance as the matter of fact Ed. Incidentally as well as being a handy man, he also does a good acoustic rendition of Elvis' 'Can't Help Falling in Love'. The notable German actress Franka Potente also appears as a sceptic but gets very little screen time. Simon McBurney is solid and almost equals Timothy Spall's performance as Maurice Grosse. Like its predecessor it shares much with other haunting films but it stands on its own due to Wan's execution, he knows horror, the eeriness, atmosphere, timing of visuals and sound to get hairs standing on end effortlessly. Something which the rushed Annabelle (2014) arguably lacked in his absence as director.With a pause for thought, like true crime murders, it gets under your skin and you can't help feel that someone is profiting from someone else's misery. Conscious aside, true or not, Wan stays close to the Enfield Haunting's beats with plenty of artistic licence to inject enough practical and CGI effects without it losing its grounded feel too much in the first three quarters.From wall posters to wallpapers, clothes and cars the 1977 is recreated almost perfectly. There is a set up with a remote control, although I don't recall there being remotes like that in Great Britain, or at least the family surely wouldn't have been able to afford that TV, in any case, the set up is still effectively creepy with a great jump scare when the young girl encounters an old man in both a reflection and face to face. As well as a scary zoetrope toy and fire engine, there's a horrific moment where the girls young brother is tricked into thinking a ghoul is a dog wanting to go out by ringing a bell next to the door.The UK terraced neighbour setting sets it apart, but naturally its reminiscent of the three part The Enfield Haunting (2015) and When the Lights Went Out (2012) which told the 1974 Black Monk of Pontefract story. Nevertheless, Wan to his credit recreates the Brit 70s injecting some nostalgia for the viewer, with the location, The Jam, TV clips of the day and so on. Wan packs the Conjuring 2 with energy, jumps scares and handles the emotional scenes delicately. In the closing act there's a twist as it tries to hone The Exorcist. While it may not have the grit and weight of the aforementioned, it has an entertaining mix of drama and horror to set it apart from many others. As Ed and Lorraine do battle at the end, Ed stops the young girl falling to her death as Lorraine word duels with the demon (akin to the design of 2005's The Nun/La Monja), yes there's an unnecessary wash of practical and computer imagery in the finale but it comes back to earth with an eerie text epilogue, then the couple add the zoetrope toy to their collection which is followed by the leads bursting with chesmisty dancing happily together.With Ouija boards, spooky nuns, spectres, toys, moving furniture, ghosts, demonic voices and so on you can't go wrong. Excellent mainstream horror entertainment.",Null,1,3,14 June 2016

Geek, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) must defeat his new girlfriend's (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of Die Hard 4.0) seven evil exes in order to win her heart.Packed with famous faces, game references, kung-fu action, Street Fighter-like stand offs and a pumping soundtrack, Brit' director Edgar Wright pushes the visual envelope while keeping it mostly reality based with everyday locations. It's heroic enjoyment that is difficult to categorise, a hybrid of mix of Super Mario Bros.(1993), DOA: Dead or Alive coupled (2006), Mortal Kombat (1995) with The Matrix's (1999) fight scene excitement and American Pie's (1999), Road Trip (2000) humour. This with the teenage coming of age theme, first love etc running through it. It's also reminiscent of Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) and Disturbia (2007).Pilgrim is developed popcorn fun that gamers and teenagers will eat up, but it's also witty and slick enough to be enjoyed by all.Michael Bacall's screenplay & director/ writer Wright's latest offering will become a re-watchable, quoted guilty pleasure for many.",Null,1,6,10 January 2011

Whiles the story isn't the most engaging, it is well directed by Saul Dibb and is an entertaining piece that reflects the social works and aristocracy of the time.There are other distinguished films set in the same time period, and while this isn't the best example, it's worth 110 minutes of your time, if only to see Ralph Fiennes performance as the bigoted sexist Duke.",Null,1,2,19 April 2010

Renny Harlin follows John McTiernan's original with the same action packed spirit.Willis is again on witty top form and the story quite meaty for an action, wisely based on Walter Wager's novel '58 Minutes' giving it a back bone. A team of terrorists is holding the entire airport hostage, as they plan to liberate a drug lord. Its an adventure with a a nice little twist. And it good fun watching McClane tries to outwit the terrorists. There are some great action scenes and admittedly it has some comedy, but what makes Die hard 2 interesting is the snowy night setting, Wilis' desperation, it's dark, it's edgy, there's a lot of atmosphere, more characters and its not a rehash heist film of the first. In addition, there are some parts where the lead fails, making it a less predictable ride.Willis is again on top form as the character that made him a film star. Both William Atherton, sleazy paparazzi and Bonnie Bedelia, as McClane's wife return for a second stint. William Sadler who is in profound physical shape is the prefect bad guy. He really brings weight to the role. John Amos deserves a mention and the rest of the supporting cast are clearly dedicated, the acting is of a high standard. There's also cameo from Twinkie eater Reginald VelJohnson (it a shame they couldn't have fit him in the other sequels). Robert Patrick shows up very briefly prior to 'T2' fame. Once again Michael Kamen provides an excellent and fitting score, Director Harlin delivers as solid well constructed squeal regardless of some dated effects and far-fetched moments.

Whle I can't draw comparisons of the adaptation into the film Paul Anderson does a great job of creating an empty eerie atmosphere. While some of the CGI effects are an unnecessary distraction the make up and costume design is first-rate. There's an intelligent story and great script.

There's some interesting ideas - a washed up Thor, a vengeful Hawkeye, Gamora's 'return', Hulk's Bannerisms, fighting duplicates, revisiting past films, forgotten characters and much more.Russo's instalment is no doubt entertaining but after the credits roll and tears are shed for two of your favourite characters (many more, if you like root for the bad guys) 'fridge logic' creeps in.Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and other writers grapple with time travel concept and shrug it off, wiping their hands of their responsibilities seemingly walking away by throwing in some one-liners and diagrams. Maybe they threw the time kitchen sink in by design so that fans will debate for many years. And that's the major issue with End Game, it doesn't work within its own logic with the writers moving their own goal posts. Sadly, even Doctors Strange's 1 in 14 million outcome is flawed. It's difficult enough to do films based solely on time travel, like Back to the Future, Timecrimes, Predestination to name a few and End Game just doesn't wrap it up neatly. You really do have to leave you brain at the door to buy into it.Overall, a great film, with hard hitting emotional closure moments but unfortunately they've left it to 14 million fan theories to tie up the lose ends and as just you make sense of it - annoyingly it throws up another paradox issue or question.",Null,0,3,29 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," Daniel Craig is Bond, harder, bloodier and faster. Perfect.
","Although it lacks a catchy title name or theme tune Quantum of Solace from it's opening breath taking car chase is a fine addition to the restarted Bond franchise, all the Bonds had their quirks, Roger had his eye brow and Daniel Craig has his pout.Gone is the shadow of Bourne, Craig had already proved himself in Casino Royale and I mention his first outing as this is a direct sequel. The excellent collaborated script lets Bond develop and grow as a character and under the direction of Marc Forster Daniel Craig portrays Bond, harder, bloodier, faster and perfectly as he seeks revenge for the death of Vesper aided by some familiar characters including M, Felix and Mathis.St. Trinian's, RocknRolla and up and coming Prince of Persia actress Gemma Arterton shows up as Fields and mirrors an icon Bond moment, while Camille played by the lovely Olga Kurylenko is Bonds Bolivian equivalent both do the 22nd official Bond outing justice. The realistic looking action and the on location feel coupled with the subtle but compulsory music by David Arnold assists Quantum become a most memorable outing for the secret Agent.While Quantums critics moan that this is Un-Bond it's because they hark back to the Seans heavy handed Bond or Rogers lighter gadgeted Bond, I should advise them to move on - this is more Flemings Bond but for a new age.If Casino Royale was Craigs Dr. No, Quantum of Solace is his From Russia with Love, a classic, strong, yet underrated Bond outing. The ending relights the fuel with a final iconic shot, that for a moment you may have thought the creators missed...

","A team assembled by a billionaire investigate a heat signal that reveals a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station in Antarctic. However, the pyramid is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a rite of passage and the team find themselves caught in the middle of their hunt.It shouldn't have been mixed, Paul W.S. Anderson's AVP: Alien vs. Predator was more so unjustly panned by critics and fans due to the hype and anticipation. It has the feeling of an Alien film, a great premise, good cinematography, some amazing effects and a fine score.Paul W.S. Anderson is successful in bringing the franchises together, respecting ideas from both Alien and Predator movies. I haven't seen a bad film that he's made and I'm not sure why there is such a geek gang hatred against the mans work. The ever-improving Uwe Boll he is not! The strong leads include Sanaa Lathan as the heroine and Raoul Bova. However, unfortunately actors Carsten Norgaard as Rusten Quinn and Tommy Flanagan as Mark Verheiden disappear far too early. Overall the acting is good, Lance Henrikson shows up as the 'real' Bishop but some of the characters lack development and the editing feels choppy in places.The Predators and Aliens look great apart from some badly executed CGI. It not Ridley Scott or John McTiernan, but Paul Anderson pulls off the almost impossible task of putting these to aliens together on screen.If there was not an Alien or Predator film prior to this it may have been haled as a science fiction adventure classic, but alas that's not the case.",Null,80,93,9 March 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," An improvement on the first outing
","Bilbo Baggins, along with a group of dwarfs and Gandalf the Grey, continue their quest to reclaim the dwarf gold from a dragon.Without making comparisons Tolkien's book this follow-up to the smouldering Hobbit is faster paced and is much more of a spectacle with some great set ups putting the adventure back on track even with its lengthy running time. It goes without saying the sets, costumes and music are fantastic and Jackson keeps quality consistent as the actors give it their all. The introduction of more Lord of the Rings characters takes the adventure into uncharted territory and director Peter Jackson offers more excitement and here the Middle Earth hijinks has all the mysterious and strange elements you'd expect from a fantasy saga.Notable is the creepy oppressive forest segment where the company are ensnared by giant spiders and Bilbo must come to the rescue, the barrel escape sequence has plenty of action. Later Gandalf investigats the tombs of the Nazgûl and faces off with the Orcs. But act three finishes it off nicely where Bilbo faces Smaug and the Dwarfs try to retake mountain.Jackson effortlessly offers incredible visuals and quality action. While not all the special effects are good as Smaug, the dragon, it ends on a cliff hanger leaving you eager for the final chapter in the trilogy.",Null,0,2,15 July 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Glossier but still perfect entertainment.
","Reluctantly a hobbit named Bilbo leaves the comfort of his own home to go on adventure with a band of dwarfs to reclaim their territory.Without drawing any comparisons to the books, Jackson's latest venture visually captures the imagination, even though heavily reliant on CGI naturally to tell the story some shots are unnecessary and on occasion distracting for example the rendering of the hares. The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey works best when it's displaying the wonderful landscapes, sets and focusing on the characters interactions.As a prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy it's notably visually glossier loosing that filmatic like feel. Nevertheless, it is a fine film with fantastic costumes, great writing and a wonderful cast, too many to name, Martin Freeman captures the essence of Ian Holmes Bilbo, notably with the line 'I'm going on an adventure!' Once again Andy Serkis steals the show as a superior computer generated version of Gollum.As a standalone film you have to have patience as I can see why a new comer to the series would find the opening plodding, with flashbacks and meetings of off the wall dwarfs. However if you've seen The Lord of the Rings it works better as you are already invested in two of the main characters from the off.Naturally and unavoidably the narrative is slightly lighter and less grim in tone given the danger and what is at stake compared to the previous trilogy. This aside the journey is certainly worth your time.",Null,1,2,11 April 2013
Non-Stop," Passenger 57 meets a cellular Agatha Christie
","On a non-stop flight from New York to London an Air Marshal receives a text message informing him that someone on the plane will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred into a specific bank account.In this Die Hard, Passenger 57 mixed with a cellular technology Agatha Christie murder mystery Liam Neeson delivers the gravitas and action prowess required even though he can probably do these roles in his sleep. Julianne Moore's role sadly gives her little to do, a part which may have been suited to an unknown but it's good to see an A grade actor bringing some credibility to such a mediocre part. There's solid performances from the array of passengers that makeup the supporting cast. However, talented actor Scoot McNairy feels slightly miscast.Director Jaume Collet-Serra offers some great special effects, action setups and creates in the first half of the film genuine tension and intrigue. Despite the character development and a conscious effect to avoid stereotypes Non-Stop feels to run out of jet fuel before the end. Illogical points aside, hidden within the John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle's screenplay are some intriguing nuances about alcoholism, security and government cover ups although it never fully explores these interesting points.Overall an entertaining film but not as compelling as you'd like it to be.",Null,1,2,7 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Follows nicely on from the third.
","Ethan Hunt a member of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF)and his team race against time to stop a nuclear war before they are arrested for a terrorist attack on the Kremlin.Ghost Protocol is packed with plenty of spy espionage, double crossings, drama, disguises and action (pretty much what the original series renowned for). While the plot is a pretty standard affair it's the leading cast that make Protocol so appetizing, the dialogue is witty, the characters have great interaction and the set ups are less than predicable with lots of things not going as smooth as the character would like.Stunning Paula Patton is a strong actor and handles the action wonderfully. Tom Cruise's stunt work is breathtaking. The character of Hunt is much more accessible as you watch him stew over the events of MI3. Simon Pegg provides some balanced humour. Notable is Jeremy Renner who shows he's not just a action star but a great actor. Also Léa Seydoux as Sabine Moreau and Josh Holloway as Trevor Hanaway both leave an impact in their small roles.Director Brad Bird delivers some fantastic visuals, the film is a well executed production and surpasses first two instalments and equals the third in entertainment value and style. The special effects are wonderfully integrated, this coupled with a great score, polished script and great locations allow Mission Impossible 4 to stand out.Overall, while lighter than the previous instalment and not as enthralling as the likes of Bourne - Protocol is a impressive piece of entertainment.",Null,1,3,9 May 2012

Without detriment to the story there's lots of gore and bloodshed. However, there's also a lot of psychological terror happening and subtle character touches that make you feel for these people.Outstanding writing by Alex Garland and a pulsating chilling score John Murphy adds to 28's perfect tension, atmosphere and tone. The casting by Gail Stevens is faultless, it includes Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston in their best roles to-date.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Welcomingly Darker in Tone but Inconsistent
","Four years after the disaster at Jurassic Park on a nearby island (site B) dinosaurs roam free but InGen a plan to capture and bring the dinosaurs to the mainland.Steven Spielberg's follow up to Jurassic Park bears little resemblance to the novel and is more reminiscent of King Kong. Missing an opportunity to include Dodgson from Crichton's novel and the first film, both Joseph Mazzello as Tim and Ariana Richards as Lex briefly return. Like Richard Attenborough's John Hammond they are welcomed, although simply throw away cameos. There's far too many unnecessary characters in The Lost World, that said, hunter Pete Postlethwaite and Vince Vaughn are notable. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm, but paranoid after the events of the first film and must rescue his partner Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore).It's welcomingly darker and pacier than Jurassic Park but unfortunately it's less consistent in tone and feels rushed which is surprising for Steven Spielberg. Nevertheless, the sound and John Williams score is on the money, the practical and visual effects are superb there are some stand out scenes, including the capturing of the dinosaurs, the raptor attack in the long-grass and the T-Rex cliff assault. Aside from the jarring and disjointed closing act set in San Diego, the set pieces flow making it as satisfying as its predecessor.Overall, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is packed full of dinosaurs but is also full of peaks and troughs.",Null,0,2,4 May 2011

","In a personal bid to help his father's medical condition a man's experiments for a genetic engineering company leads to the dangerous development of an intelligence in apes.Although it departs in many ways from the original films, it is a fantastic piece of entertainment in its own right. Rise of the Planet of The Apes mixes the right amount of character development with story, effects and performances capturing the imagination of a new generation.Despite a good cast with great performances notably from John Lithgow and James Franco, it's the apes themselves and Andy Serkis coupled with some state of the art special effects that steal the show. Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa's writing keeps the action and emotion somewhat believable, that Franco handles particularly well. The contemporary setting of San Francisco gives the film a familiar believable feel and it is a good contrast to the dark caged scenes and sterile lab sets. Patrick Doyle's score compliments the action and stirs feelings during the poignant moments. Rupert Wyatt's direction ensures there's enough surprises and action setups to give Rise momentum. Wyatt's handling of Caesar manages to demand attention throughout with a welcomed display of edginess, danger and intelligence. There's also an added odd eeriness due to the ape actions and glancing looks. In addition, the writers and Wyatt thoughtfully give enough nods to the original to humble fans and hints at possible sequels throughout to tease further interest.   Overall, Rise manages to be an emotional ride, successfully grounding the concept of the originals while eradicating Burton's 2001 missed opportunity.

Thanos is surprisingly likeable in parts and adds some emotional weight making the story more dynamic. Viewers to make sense of chaos on the backdrop of outstanding effects, fantastic sets and outlandish costumes may want to watch Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok to name a few essentials to make sense of the sacrifice and devastation on display.Directors Anthony and Joe Russo offer an enjoyable film with surprise deaths of beloved characters (Loki in the first few minutes) scattered over its well paced lengthy running time, which whizzes by. While older comic book readers may not be able to work out why these on screen character don't have that secret je ne sais quoi of their paper counterparts, ultra geeks and readers of more recent comic series will no doubt find it a movie Marvel blast. Unlikely characters are paired together, creating some enjoyable comedy, tension and action moments as the story gets bleaker and bleaker for our heroes.With some sharp editing and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely leave Infinity War on a cliffhanger not seen since The Empire Strikes Back*.

Excellent effects, staging and songs etc the whole production is magical, exceeding expectations.All the cast are on form, the casting is exceptional. Will Smith gives an enjoyable energetic and restrained performance as the Genie. The trailer didn't do him justice. With a great singing voice and screen presence Mena Massoud takes all the best cues from his cartoon feature counterpart and offers a likeable and memorable Aladdin. Tweaked for the better by August and Ritchie actor Naomi Scott lifts the Princess Jasmine character even more, while also giving her a social and political subtext.Although a good performance, Marwan Kenzari's Jafar has been reworked. August gives him and Aladdin a commonality but unfortunately it doesn't work as well as the cartoon stereotype villain did and sadly Alan Tudyk Iago suffers too. There's not much chemistry. This aside, Abu the monkey and the Magic Carpet are finely brought to life and are just as much fun as their animated incarnations. The dance numbers are fun and wonderful choreographed.Children and adults of all ages can enjoy.

However, talented Wan manges to infuses life into a well trodden subject leaving other haunted movies behind as he crafts his own modern version that pays tribute instead of trying to reinvent it. The set design and locations are what you'd expect with the first third of the film set in an old house, complete with a dusty attic and creaky stairs but then the setting moves to a suburban house placing the viewer in a safer environment and false state of security, reminiscent of Poltergeist and Paranomal Activity (2007).Patrick Wilson is adequate as the trouble father and Rose Byrne is excellent as wife Renai. The film looses it's edge in the second half as Wilson takes the helm, Byrne is the stronger of the two but is left with little to do or say and the weight of the film suffers as a result. The small cast works well and credit should go to both Lin Shaye as the medium Elise Rainier and Barbara Hershey in their supporting roles.Joseph Bishara's music score is exceptionally creepy and the lighting, make-up of the ghostly faces is enough to give some nightmares. What works well is that while there are CGI shots they are well designed and hardly a distracting.There's few story surprises but lots of well built up jumps and from start to finish Insidious should send shivers down your spine, making the hairs on your neck stand.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Tops the previous instalment
","The Fellowship has gone their separate ways. Some shed of their mortal coil, others to recover captured friends, while two Hobbits venture towards Mordor to destroy the ring.The skillful Kiwi director Peter Jackson along with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens top the previous instalment not just in scale, notably the battle scenes and attack on Helm's Deep, but in character development. The Two Towers is a near on perfect a fantasy epic with more digestible dialogue, which builds tension and momentum that complements the action with its chases and lengthy and difficult conflicts. Again Howard Shore's score is outstanding and heightens the emotional scenes and battles. The groundbreaking practical and digital visual effects, sets, costumes, props and locations are commendable. We have more weird and wonderful inhabitants of Middle- Earth as well as the introduction of new characters King Théoden (Bernard Hill), Miranda Otto is delightful as Eowyn and Gollum (CGI performed and voiced tremendously by Andy Serkis), is revealed fully. David Wenham is Faramir (brother of Boromir), worming calculating Wormtongue played by Brad Dourif and warrior Eomer is played by Karl Urban.Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas becomes closer. With a telling flashback of his Balrog fight Gandalf the Grey returns as more serious Gandalf the White. There's sagacious interplay between Sam, Frodo and Gollum as their journey to destroy the ring is met with obstacles. Aragorn's love for Arwen is tested. With the drama of Théoden being under a draining mind control spell there's also plenty of action, Rohan's soldiers slicing and dicing Orcs and Uruk-hai, and a showdown with Warg riders where Aragorn seemingly dies. There's also two great battles, an army of Tree Ents taking on Saruman, while Rohan's army along with warrior Elves go head to head with a countless Orc and Uruk-hai armies at Helms Deep.The extended version of The Two Towers like its predecessor improves on Jackson's theatrical cut, Sam uses his Elvish rope (which ties in with an extended scene in The Fellowship of the Ring), Merry, Pippin and Treebeard have more screen time and we find out how old Aragon actually is. Flashbacks reveal more of Faramir's family dynamics as well as more backstory to the sadly missed Boromir.

","Based on a short story by Stephen King comes The Mist A mist envelops a small Maine town and dozens are trapped inside a supermarket knowing that in the mist are horrible creatures and being stranded soon takes its psychological toll If you like the sound of this you're in for a treat.The Shawshank Redemption director Frank Darabont and acclaimed writer/producer (The Green Mile) seems unsure at times whether to use the documentary styled film shooting or stick to a traditional style of movement, but that aside he is a master of creating apprehension and unease. Also Frank Darabont treats Kings work with the respect it deserves with high production values. Thankfully it's not another dire TV movie.The effects are good but suffer at times due to the over use of CGI, luckily the solid actors including Thomas Jane (Stander), Laurie Holden (Silent Hill) are there to compensate for this as the film is mainly character driven. Although melodramatic at times The Mist highlights the silliness of fanatical, cult religions as the trapped shoppers split into two camps: those who believe it is an act of a vengeful god and those don't.I love brave bleak endings. The Descent, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Elephant Man, The Thing, They Live, to name a few but Mists ending whilst not as preachy as the recent film The Happening is let down by a needless, emotionless ending, that extinguishes all that came before.The tag lines read 'Fear Changes Everything' and 'Stephen King's Legendary Tale of Terror', but The Mist while not a bad film falls short of becoming a 'Shining' classic.",Null,1,3,7 November 2008

With a smudge of James Belushi and intensity and execution of Daniel Craig's 007 Renner handles the drama and fight scenes of the former soldier, now super operative superbly with ease. The opening scene carry much of the tension and suspense as Cross meets up with his counterpart and tries to escape wolves and a bombing drone. There's breathtaking action, notably a bike chase, which is fast paced and wonderfully shot by director/writer Tony Gilroy.Continuing the series tradition with a cast of heavy weights, Edward Norton and the marvellous Stacy Keach put in first-rate appearances. Rachel Weisz is on form as Marta Shearing and carries the emotion during the events of Legacy, her arc feels genuine especially as her and Cross' friendship develops. While former cast members including Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and Joan Allen are reduced to cameos, video footage and photos which link the series. These connections are significant as the story runs parallel to Bourne's conclusion.Nevertheless, Legacy follows The Bourne Identity's format a little much to the letter, scenes are reminiscent of the first outing. It lacks the intrigue of the others and is less than subtle in referencing Damon's outings. The ending feels abrupt but welcoming as it sets up an inevitable sequel that hopefully won't follow the retread the same ground as The Bourne Supremacy.There's less espionage, more action with enough surprises to keep the legacy alive although it does tread some same stones.",Null,5,13,10 August 2012

That said, the overall production is not as well paced as Taken (2008) to which is being consistently compared to.As the mystery unfolds it keeps you wanting more with the help of a cast of familiar faces including Diane Kruger as Gina (simuliar to Michelle in Frantic) and the excellent Adian Quinn, who's screen time like veteran actor Frank Langella is limited. Bruno Ganz is notable as Ernst Jürgen a former Agent now turned Private detective.The ending is overblown but the few action set ups are well presented and edited this coupled with the European locations add an air of realism to the proceedings.

There's an excellent 80s soundtrack and wide ranging score by Elmer Bernstein. Not only does Ghostbusters work as a piece of entertainment it captures New York during the political and social Reagan-era, a different time. The ghost wrangling cast are excellent, Bill Murray gives a hilarious deadpan performance as the team come together. Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson offer great comic turns. The supporting cast are also strong, Sigourney Weaver is on fine form as Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully and William Atherton as bureaucrat Walter Peck are particularly notably. Annie Potts is humorous as crabby but likable Janine Melnitz. Tully's crush on Barrett is humorously played out. Weaver gets to give a full range of emotion, right down to playing possessed. As well as eggs cooking on worktops and ghouls in fridges there's also a horrific scene where Barrett is gagged and dragged by evil hands across a room on a chair. Many of the effects still hold up and the optical ghosts remain eerie.There's a perfect a blend of special effects and comedy, too many moments to mention, notable is the scene at the hotel where armed with their proton weapons the team go to capture a greedy ghost and Venkman gets slimed. Packed with quotable lines, Reitman offers paranormal and supernatural hi-jinks including demon dogs, skeletons, spectres as well as chuckles. Together Aykroyd and Ramis along with Reitman and crew not only deliver a great film but they forge some pop-culture equipment, the iconic Ecto-1 that the Ghostbusters use to travel, proton packs, the P.K.E.

Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg offer an enjoyable Pirates adventure which almost briefly reunites the original cast including Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom. With impressive, locations sets and setups packed with effects and stunts, it's a more than satisfying instalment. Granted it loses some wind in its sails in the latter half but it holds enough water to remain charming and well staged throughout. With quality props, makeup and costumes the cast are on sea worthy form. There's a wave of returning crew members of the series. The new cast additions are likable, Kaya Scodelario as strong female Smyth is refreshing and Brenton Thwaites captures Turner's spirit. David Wenham is his usual reliable self and Paul McCartney cameos humorously as Jack's uncle. Sadly, with a great backstory (where we see a de-age Johnny Depp), as good as Javier Bardem is as the menacing Captain Salazar he's not actually given much to do. Depp thankfully holds screen presence as usual as Sparrow and it's nice to see Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann incorporated at arms length into the secondary plot. Geoffrey Rush deservedly steals the show as Captain Hector Barbossa offering some weight to the fantastical on screen antics that are accompanied by a swashbuckling score. Writer Jeff Nathanson offers a few little twists and turns here and there and the comedy mostly hits the mark. If only Barbossa had popped up at the end and returned Jacks hat!Overall, a shipshape return to form with a strong revival feeling that heightens this instalment and points to more promising things to come.",Null,1,3,14 June 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Solid entertainment in a sea of other superhero films
","1983, an ancient mutant awakes to reclaim the Earth. Only a handful of inexperienced mutants can stop him and his newest recruit - the powerful Magneto. Director Bryan Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse has the synonymous superhero city-level destruction with amazing effects, yes it feels a worn but the focus remains on the popular characters and their relationships. It magnifies all the best of the genre, serving up a solid story that remains pin sharp clear throughout. The Valley of the Nile opening is the most interesting of the film, Singer conjures up a Stargate, Gods of Egypt hybrid where we're introduced to the excellent Oscar Isaac in almost unrecognisable make up as the mutant Apocalypse. Notable is Death played memorably by Monique Ganderton, one of The Horsemen who saves Apocalypse allowing him to recruit some familiar mutants later. These include Angel (Ben Hardy channelling the late Heath Ledger) and a young Storm, Alexandra Shipp. Olivia Munn's Psylocke has an edge and a costume in which she steals every scene.The series time resetting and continuity malarkey aside there are many anachronisms littered throughout - t-shirts, glasses and locations etc. that were not around in 1983. Also there are 'fridge logic' instances, for example Magneto should be about 50. Between First Class and Apocalypse, 20 years have gone by but many of the characters remain youthful, Magneto should be about 50 having being around 10 in 1944, Rose Byrne's Moira MacTaggert appear to not have aged a day and so on.There are several films crammed into one and it works thanks to the central friendship story-line that's heart to the film. After the visually fantastic opening the first hour establishes what the characters have been up to, the latter half is then a face off between the players. World-destroying, operatic mutant, Isaac (who is somewhat a Tom Hardy acting chameleon) makes Apocalypse menacing. Simon Kinberg's script keeps Apocalypse engaging retaining a comic feel even though it is nihilistic at times. Debatably indifferent, Singer and Kinberg never allow Apocalypse reach Nolan & Synder's bleakness or the polish of recent Avengers and it's Marvel movie counterpart outings. There's fun to be had, Quicksilver (American Horror Story) Evan Peters gives X-Men: Apocalypse one of the most memorable scenes where he uses his super-speed to save students and a dog from an exploding mansion to the The Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'. For die-hard X-Men fans Hugh Jackman's Wolverine cameo restarts his original story with a gruesome killing rampage. The acting is what you'd expect for a cast boasting such well known faces. Grappling with the dark side of her abilities Sophie Turner's Jean Grey even though given little to do until the action packed closing is a good addition. Mystique played again by popular actress Jennifer Lawrence never quite matches her older counterpart, Romijn. Likewise Cyclops, Tye Sheridan doesn't meet Marsden's presence. James McAvoy as good actor as he is still can't shrug off Patrick Stewart's Xavier shadow. Whereas Michael Fassbender gives Magneto's story-line the emotional depth it requires especially after his family are murdered. Finally Nightcrawler - Kodi Smit-McPhee learns to hone his powers and is a great addition. The characters are all interesting but Psylocke and Storm embody the way this entire series has changed its female characters; giving them emotional integrity, swagger and complexity as much as possible in a sea of other characters. In all the special effects, sound design, costumes and amazing sets X-Men: Apocalypse gets close to evoking the friendship nature of the comics. It also reflects a morally grey rather than black and white view of the world without endless rain and gloomy lighting. Yes, there's a Stan Lee cameo and of course there's a anti climatic post credit scene which follows on from Wolverine's aftermath. Overall, Singer's back to basics story and fast pace in a wash of other recent superhero films offers (by the skin of its teeth) enough new thrills to pass the time with. Worth watching for Issac's troubled Apocalypse and Ganderton's small pivotal role alone.",Null,5,12,27 May 2016
Ex Machina," More subtle and polished than the comparable Machine
","A 26 year old coding expert wins an opportunity to spend time with a bearded, tetchy, technology genius and his latest experiment, a humanoid robot.Opening with an environment of modern architecture, mod cons and technology in contrast to natures wonderfully filmed mountains and forests Ex Machina is a crisp looking film. Mirroring much of The Machine's (2013) elements (turing test, similar score, robot conspiracy even the same main characters name) it's a much different delivered film. Ex Machina is more grounded and a less action orientated Frankenstein tale but like the great low budget aforementioned and the recent Automata (2014) it tackles the relationship between humans and machine.There's a small ensemble cast with good supporting actors, lead Oscar Isaac is excellent as the dislikable intelligent alcohol fuelled scientist Nathan, Domhnall Gleeson's Caleb, a student questioning his love for a robot is interesting but the star here is Alicia Vikander as Ava the world's first artificial intelligent beautiful female robot.Writer/director Alex Garland's offering is intriguing, with its atmosphere enhanced by a fitting futuristic pulse percussion score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow which complements its modest, near enough photo real effects. With the facility nestled in the wilderness, a fantastic picturesque location, there's impressive designed rooms, with great lighting and colour shemes to match.With no outside contact permitted it's claustrophobic at times as Caleb builds his relationship with Ava and Nathan in the compact mirrored rooms and narrow frosted glass corridors of the mini facility. It's thought provoking, with tension and some surreal moments. In the closing it becomes a cat and mouse mind game duel with a nice fulfilling twist.Ex Machina has great production values, it's finely filmed, nicely paced and while not as punchy, conventional or mainstream satisfying as The Machine it has a subtler more stylised polished take on the same theme.",Null,1,5,16 May 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Lacks the atmosphere and finesse of the first.
","After a zombie outbreak, the corporation Umbrella beings a cover up by releasing the deadly creature Nemesis.I enjoyed its predecessor and was glad that the unjustly criticised Paul W.S. Anderson was writing the sequel. However it was just a shame that he didn't direct the flow up. Either there was budget cut or Alexander Witt wasn't capable of delivering the cashing-in follow-on.Mike Epps is funny, but unnecessary comic relief and Iain Glen as the 'evil scientist' Dr. Isaacs gives a good performance. There is amazing stunt work, Milla again plays heroine Alice superbly and Oded Fehr is on top-form, however, there are lots of problems The film is let down by its TV feel, the zombies are ruined by blurry manipulated camera work. Sienna Guillory is handed a dreadful script and costume. The effects and music are a mixed bag, sometimes great and at other times sadly distracting.It's a sci-fi with plenty of action, but Apocalypse lacks the suspense, atmosphere and finesse of the first instalment.",Null,1,2,17 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Good but not great, loses the Star Wars magic along the way
","The Resistance prepares to do battle with the First Order. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker is unsettled by the strength of Rey's powers and connection to Kylo Ren.Filmmaker Rian Johnson plays against expectations and bravely tries not rehash what's has been done before. Star Wars: Episode VIII Last Jedi has heaps of dramatic moments, heightened by John Williams' score, the emotional impact most of which oozes from the late Carrie Fisher as Leia is poignant. Oscar Isaac's Poe and Mark Hamill's Luke steal the show but both Adam Driver (Kylo) and the perfectly cast Daisy Ridley (Rey) give the original trilogy actors a good run for their money. Less of a comedy side kick here John Boyega's Finn is more focused and has a new love interest in Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico.Although Rey is present throughout she not as centre piece as she was previously, getting lost in amongst all the other story threads and characters. Both Driver and Daisy, when they are connected during new force power moments and later when they take on Snoke's guards in an interestingly choreographed fight scenes do get a chance to excel.Director, writer Johnson offers a good, but not brilliant Star Wars episode, unfortunately there's a lot of jokes thrown in which feel off with the usual galactic humour of its predecessors. Jarringly there's misplaced dialogue about God and souls. Moreover, many of the effects are arguably not as good as Episode VII or Rogue One, surprising for a Star Wars film, many CGI shots (feel less model lifelike), rendering and movements stick out for example, a herd of fathiers (space horses) are freed and ridden across Canto Blight, or when BB-8 steals an AT-ST (Scout Walker) with Finn and Rose, moreover the back drop of AT-M6s, (the next generatiom of Walkers) frame Luke and Kylo. To Johnson's credit, there's a stand out scene with Luke and R2-D2 where they view 1977's Star Wars Leia hologram message, moreover is a huge spoiler moment that includes Luke's impressive moving story closure (with a Obi-Wan, Yoda cloak twist) this is a high point not only of this episode but of all the episodes. Yoda returns (thankfully a puppet mastered by Frank OZ) appearing as a force ghost. However, some of the characters feel a little fleeting and wasted including Andy Serkis Snoke's brief and anticlimactic demise and Benicio del Toro's DJ is excellent but also has limited screen time. With relief Maz shows up as a hologram in the midst of a firefight.With already an abundance of species for Johnson's to chose from there's many new monsters/alien/animals crammed in and new space ships unnecessary added to the saga. Specifically during the messy Casio messy segment. That said, the cute puffin-like Porgs are surprisingly a good addition. Also favourites return including Chewie, R2-D2, C3-PO and there's plenty newcomer BB-8 moments as the action moves from one planet, hopping from spaceship to another. With Kenny Baker's passing RD-D2 is performed now by Jimmy Vee. Joonas Suotamo reprises the Chewbacca role in which he doubled for Peter Mayhew respectively in Force Awakens but here takes over completely. Actress Billie Lourd (Fisher's realife daughter) welcomingly gets more lines and to do as Lieutenant Connix. But even with more Phasma to enjoy her moments feel rushed like some of the special effects. In addition, the reveal of Rey's parents leaves sour taste and Snoke's origins is left bitter sweet in an abrupt end not seen since Dooku was disposed of in Revenge of the Sith. Also we're still left with the unanswered question of how did Kylo get the blue lightsaber, and how did it get to Maz's castle in Force Awakens, even if it is one and the same, and where are the Knights of Ren and the handful of Jedi in training that were not killed who left with Kylo?It has its fair share of story beats and character high points notably, Fisher and Johnson's handling of Leia as she evades the First Order in a number of set pieces which offers genuine story surprises. Memorable is Leia's resurrection 'Force' moment, Laura Dern's character sacrifice and Yoda's return to name a few. But there are niggling wasted opportunities and shoehorned on the nose social commentary.Overall, debatably Johnson's offering doesn't feel as Star Warzy as it should, nevertheless, it's Star Wars nonetheless, but don't expect Empire Strikes Back or the Star Wars je ne sais quoi magic.",Null,0,3,17 December 2017

James Gunn offers solid entertainment that links to the current Marvel film universe (one of the infinity stones appear). Although very CGI heavy (which will date quickly) it is compensated its likable characters, humour and fast pace action. Tonally its mash up of Star Wars, Thor and Iron Man 1-3 to name a few.The lead cast are on fine form, there's cheek Chris Pratt but more notable are Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket. Vin Diesel given his not existent lines seems a waste however the Groot as character and his interactions are great.

Evil Dead," We're (not) gonna get you.
","A group of youngster visit a cabin to help their friend detox, however, they so find them themselves pawns in a prophesy to raise an abomination.Evil Dead 're-imagining' was overseen by Sam Raimi himself, there's a few tweaks and a couple of beloved things are missing (mostly comedy setups), it follows Evil Dead's highs and lows story blueprint wisely hitting all the right notes, loss, sacrifice, possession, supernatural high-jinks, the book of the dead, a cellar, cabin and so on.However, gone is the mix of wackiness with horror and what we're left with is just horror. Packed with jump scares there's blood - more blood than you can possibly imagine coupled with gratuitous and graphic violence, a nail gun, chainsaw and claw hammer action.It's dark, ominous, gritty and wonderfully shot by Fede Alvarez. The special effect and music score a worthy of note. The opening is reminiscent of a million torture-porn films and adds little to the proceedings, although the series is known for irregular continuities, if anything the setup robs Evil Dead of being a sequel to the original. In addition, there's a odd homage after the credits that takes Evil Dead 2013 stand alone stature. It's as if Raimi and Co. couldn't cut the umbilical cord to the original video nasty, or avoid backlash from fans.The cast are a group of good looking kids and on the whole the acting is pretty good, lead Jane Levy is exceptional. But the group of twenty something Americans has been done to death and steals any novelty away from Dead by default. Nevertheless, there's a welcomed gender change and duel role that allows Levy to really excel.All in all as someone who avoids horror-comedy I thought a serious remake would be a good idea, that said, The Evil Dead 1981 was a basic concept and it was its style that made it. It goes to show that you should be careful what you wish for.To Alvarez's credit as horror film it is skilfully made, and if you've not seen its 1981 counterpart it excels. Nevertheless, if you're familiar with the Evil Dead, its novelty, choppy charm, resourcefulness and it's mix of scares humour, you may feel that this in some peculiar uncanny way falls short. There's a reason archetypal books don't get rewritten - the same could possibly be applied to cult films.Ultimately, even with it's 'Evil Dead' shortcomings it's an entertaining piece of horror and still a must for horror fans.",Null,3,6,8 August 2013
Clash of the Titans," New sandals, old hat...
","New sandals, old hat, Clash of the Titans is an enjoyable remake, but the original only made in 1981 doesn't seem that long ago. The 2010 version strength is that you don't see sandals, Gods and monster adventure films much these days(unless they are made for TV). However, you cant help but think why remake Clash of the Titans when Jason and the Argonauts would have been more advantageous. Sadly the score is pretty forgettable but the effects are great, minus a disappointing CGI Medusa. The old world feel is captured perfectly credit to director of photography Peter Menzies Jr. the locations are breathtaking, Sam Worthington is a reliable as the an action hero but his character is underdeveloped. There are some great performances by Mads Mikkelsen and heavy weights Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. The rest are a mixed bag, yet Gemma Arterton is startling first-class as to is the almost unrecognisable Jason Flemyng as Calibos. However, if you've seen the original, Calibos like Perseus lacks characterisation. Apart from a few tweaks, director Louis Leterrier's version retreads the first. While it exceeds it predecessor in some parts, thankfully there's no owl, it includes the Sheikh Sulieman; Lo; scorpions; Pegaus and flying monsters; in places it fall short of the original -The Medusa scene;the training of Perseus and Calibos role.Nevertheless, it's a fun adventure film and I'd happily watch an inevitable sequel.",Null,3,4,28 July 2010
Jurassic World," Undeniably entertaining but fast pass entertainment
","22 years after the Isla Nublar incident, brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell go to Jurassic World, a fully functional dinosaur theme park to visit their aunt but things go awry and she enlists the help from an old flame to save her nephews. Do you want to see Spielberg's Jurassic Park overgrown and in ruins, the original T-Rex, Mr DNA, Dr Wu, Ian's mug on the front of yet another novel, Richard Hammond's statute and a fully functional Jurassic World (park)? Then you've come to the right place. Director Colin Trevorrow offers CGI is state-of-the-art, however, less is more and as visually impressive as it is it looses it's organic feel. The background CGI of the park it's self is more awe inspiring than much of the dinosaur set ups. Even with the amazing giant water dinosaur it can't match the original for impact, but it works in its own right as a good ride and piece of entertainment with some notable stand out moments, including an aviary escape, a velociraptor chase and aquarium killing to name a few. To Trevorrow's credit it flows from scene to scene rather than in the originals set up to set up, yet due to its pace it's never spends enough time with its characters for you to really feel for them deep down. Michael Giacchino's score and sound design are great complementing the visual effects, especially the climactic fight scene. The film takes a swipe at American commercialism and the like, however, even with four writers including Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Connolly and Trevorrow the dialogue is not as credible as the previous instalments. There's plenty of nods to the other films, even a throw away line about why the Jurassic Park and World dinosaurs may not look like the dinosaurs that roamed the earth 65 million years ago cleverly batting off any criticism of the creature designs and any factual inconsistencies. Thankfully there's no part III annoying screaming and Chris Pratt's and Bryce Dallas Howard (as Claire Dearing) performances are great. The cast are enjoyable, funny even if a little ridiculous at times. The exploitation military subplot feels a little unnecessary and the dinosaurs are humanised a tad too much robbing World of its fear factor. Louder and bigger doesn't mean better and it lacks any subtly, but it undeniably entertains. It's Westworld with dinosaurs with a few moments that even encompass the Jurassic Park novel, a reminder as to why you fell in love with dinosaurs all over again in the first place.",Null,7,21,12 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Another P.O.V camera movie
","A couple becomes increasingly disturbed by Paranormal Activity in their home, wow sounds great? The films strong points is that it contains some quality direction by Oren Pel, fantastic plausible natural acting, some skilfully thought out camera work and effective sound effects.However, it's simply another story told through the eyes of a character, in this case Micah's camera lens. In a nutshell builds up to a big scare at the end (depending on which version you see of the film).It's over ten years since the 'The Blair Witch Project' used the camera point of view and while Paranormal Activity looks good, is well executed and constructed, it goes over the same old formula. If you enjoyed and were scared by Blair Witch you'll love Paranormal Activity.That said, if you thought Blair Witch was hyped and shock-less on it's release and you have a preference for REC or Cloverfield, you'll be disappointed.If you're a big fan of these point of view camera films, and you have to see another this probably isn't it but if you like TV's Most Haunted, Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures and the like this may do the trick.",Null,0,1,24 March 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Unscrupulous advertising
","An affair between a politician and a dancer causes a time ripple that must be put back on track by fate-like angels of the Bureau.Miss-sold by a misleading trailer and a quote 'Bourne meets Inception', The Adjustment Bureau shares more with Two of a Kind (1983) starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton- John with a smudging of Dark City (1998) and the look of the 'Rat Pack'.Directed by George Nolfi it has some small but well executed effects, doorways that open onto other streets when wearing a hat, time frozen moments and so on. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are on form but ultimately it's a great concept wasted on a cringe worthy love story. Because of this Terence Stamp and the rest of the cast appear wasted as much as the intriguing premise. If modern romance is your thing and you like science fiction there's enjoyment to be found. However, considering this is based on a Philip K. Dick story don't expect something in the vain of previous film incarnations of his work or you'll be disappointed.Sadly even as a romantic yarn it's very average and The Tourist (2010), Serendipity (2001) or While you were Sleeping (1995) it is not. The first and last segments are the most interesting and it's great to see Damon give another solid performance but it's been sold as something it's not by advertisers who are as shady as the The Adjustment Bureau.",Null,0,1,24 July 2011
Avengers: Age of Ultron," More pacier and punchier than the first
","After a knock back by a self made foe, Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor and other superheroes team up to stop the new threat with the help of gifted twins to save the Earth from a global catastrophe.The Age of Ultron a sequel to Avengers Assemble and linked to the other recent Marvel film outings is a more satisfying superhero film than its predecessor thanks to some further character development, genuine emotion and the introduction of Ultron, perfectly executed by James Spader. Both Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Wanda and Pietro Maximoff are great in their roles. Director Joss Whedon manages to tap into the style of Iron Man 3 and Winter Solider giving this addition more of a human edge. There is a clear gap between the two outings and no exposition is required to see where the characters are at. Paul Bettany with some great makeup design is a fine addition as Vision and the closing assemble of the new Avengers crew including the likes of Falcon and War Machine is interesting.Danny Elfman's music score is memorable and heightens the on screen robot action setups accordingly as the team look for Loki's weapon, then later take on Ultron and his minions. Whedon and team like the first inning manages to integrate the comic book action with the drama and visual effects effortlessly. Here Jeremy Renne's Hawkeye gets much more screen time and storyline, Mark Ruffalo returns as Hulk/Banner alongside Robert Downey, Jr. (who again steals the show as Tony Stark even when looking for secret passages), Chris Evans, Don Cheadle, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson. A few sub- characters including S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter also appear. While not perfect, the story feels more heartfelt and its biggest strength is its pacing, for such a long film it never lags and it remains pretty close to the early comic book spirit and roots. Packed with more hit and miss one liners, outstanding effects (although I still feel Hulk is a little off) and great comic book characters it sets it up nicely for the next instalment with its tag on Thanos teaser ending.",Null,1,5,25 April 2015

There's sharp humour and the character play is superb with surprisingly plenty of depth. Humpy and Puss are given flashback scenes with entertaining back stories. Both lovable rouge come, hero and outlaw Puss is again wonderfully voiced by Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek gives Kitty Softpaws the perfect Latino sound. Including the likes of Guillermo del Toro, Billy Bob Thornton to name a few the other voice actors are also on fine form and the computer characters are wonderfully animated and brought to life.Like many of these computer animated features it feels 10 minutes too long, but for characterisation, feats, dance off's and double crosses its pure entertainment with plenty for the adults to enjoy as much as the children.",Null,0,1,15 May 2012
Elysium," Finely executed science fiction
","Set in the year 2154, a man-made space station with wealthy residents comes under threat when one of the inhabitants of the now ruined Earth threatens to bring equality to their polarised worlds.Elysium has an earthy realism like director Neill Blomkamp's own District 9 (2009), the special effects are outstanding, the on location feel, costumes, sets and music score gives it a gritty atmosphere. On display is a realistic overpopulated future Earth in contrast to the spatial Elysium both of which are wonderfully realised.Matt Damon proved his worth as an action star with intelligence and stealth in The Bourne Identity (2002) but he appears slightly miscast here - that said he does a good enough job and brings some needed emotion and likability to his characters unsavoury past. Jodie Foster is simply outstanding as Delacourt, a steely no-nonsense executive although her screen time is limited. Villain Kruger played by District 9's Sharlto Copley - and like Foster - freshly plays against the stereo-type Hollywood antagonists. There's also a strong supporting cast including the likes of William Fichtner and Alice Braga with each of the supporting characters right down to Kruger's sidekicks being developed and given attention by writer, director Blomkamp.As with Blomkamp's previous outing there plenty of subtext in the screenplay and amongst the great action setups and visual spectacles there's also a straight forward story for all to enjoy. As with any film and especially in science fiction it's difficult to come up with entirely original ideas and Elysium is no exception but everything is packaged arguably better and more authentic than in other recent sci-fi movies. It's not Blomkamp's masterpiece but it's still a finely executed science fiction with shrewdness which certainly raises the bar in terms visual effects.

This causes a hostility between the locals, the science devision and armed forces as they have a conflict of interest.Zoe Saldana (Star Trek)as Neytiri is fantastic, as usual Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation) is well cast in a strong lead role. Giovanni Ribisi, Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez's brief appearances are welcomed. Also Stephen Lang, as the tough Colonel Miles Quaritch gives a great performance. It is a visual spectacular with great acting and effects. It's a moralistic tale, of following orders or protecting an alien world. However, the story is lazy, reminiscent Cameron's own Aliens, Dances with Wolves, Apocalypto and Pocahontas to name a few. It mirrors Custers last stand, Vietnam and many other conflicts throughout history. While the effects in creating the moon Pandora are mind-blowing, the lack of originality leaves you disappointed. I'm sure teenagers will love it, it's the perfect money maker. James Cameron is a fantastic director and is instrumental in pushing industry movie techniques forward.

","After an accident in which their father dies two young girls become feral, when they are rescued they are looked after by their uncle and his girlfriend, soon it becomes apparent that their survival was due to a spirit who won't let them go and the terror begins.Thankfully the child actors are impressive, actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is excellent in the dual role of the uncle and his twin although his screen time is sporadic. Lead roles include an almost unrecognisable Jessica Chastain as Annabel along with Daniel Kash as the doctor. There's also a strong supporting cast of worn faces, for a horror film the acting is far above average.As supernatural thriller the first half is finely crafted by director Andrés Muschietti and packed with tension and chills. The sound design and music by Fernando Velázquez complement the scares and eeriness. However, the second half chooses to reveal the ghost too often and steals the fright factor of what Muschietti had created earlier, especially in the closing. What starts as an intriguing mystery with genuine creepiness unravels becoming a special effects fest by the end (more finely tuned but reminiscent of The Nun (2005) effects). Mama is a solid ghost story with an interesting premise that revolves around the two girls and the back story of Mama. There's a cabin in the wood, a large house with a disgruntled spirit, creepy kids, the clichés are there but they are delivered efficiently. Nevertheless, Andrés & Barbara Muschietti's story leaves a few niggling questions unanswered, not around the antagonistic 'Mama' but some of the other characters.Overall Mama is special effects laden which is a shame considering the added intricacies and strong retelling of a classic-esque ghost story. Still it's a strong well made addition to the genre.",Null,0,1,12 August 2013
Super 8," Fuzzy nostalgic, inescapable homage.
","A group of children filming their own Super 8 movie as train derails find the army descending on their town as the crash has released a dangerous presence.Even though Steven Spielberg produced  Poltergeist and Goonies, they oozed his early hallmarks and Super 8 is no exception. The portrayal of family life, some happy, some dysfunctional, children's seemingly off the cuff dialogue and so on. Director/writer J.J. Abrams encompasses and emulates Spielberg. But it doesn't stop there, like E.T or more so Jaws we only get glimpses of the main creature and then a reveal late in the film. J.J Abrams is no stranger to mystery, intrigue, tension and fear as was seen with Cloverfield and it's promotion. But what Abrams manages to capture; that few can, is the fuzzy nostalgia of a different time, in this case the 1970's. Excellent  props, interiors, the locations and music take you back or place you in the past. These settings are cemented thanks to some first rate child performances including Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney who's emotional performances heighten the film giving it more credibility. Kyle Chandler plays the father/Deputy out of his depth and dealing with the sudden and tragic lost of his wife perfectly and the supporting cast are perfect.The otherworldly story is not the main focus as such and similar to E.T it's the plights and friendships that are important. Abrams intentionally or unintentionally dilutes his own talent with an inescapable homage.  Nevertheless, Abrams manages to give Super 8 the edginess and the magic of Steven Spielberg's earlier films in one nice neat package but with todays effects. The only negative is that given the aforementioned Super 8 hasn't it's own identity, but with the warmth and wonder it generates that can't be a bad thing. Recommend.",Null,0,0,13 August 2011
Sinister," A Defining Horror - Hawke is Outstanding
","Eager for another bestseller a writer moves his family to another town where a series of murders has taken place to research his next book. However, he uncovers something more terrifying than he can put to paper, namely Mr. Boogieman.With a family hanging from a tree in the opening shot you know that Sinister is not pulling any punches. Rather than focusing on other worldly phantoms like Insidious (2010) (by the same producer Jason Blum), Sinister is more grounded even if still essentially a supernatural thriller. Thankfully, the now common place in horror found footage aspect is not focal in the traditional sense and is a product to move the intriguing premise forward.Director Scott Derrickson along with writers Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill deliver an absorbing slow build up with the main flawed, borderline alcoholic character Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke). Derrickson with director of photography Chris Norr give the film a innovative look, it's dark - very dark, with inky blacks, depth and shadows always on display. In all its boldly minimally lit going against convention creating some real ominous atmosphere. The production is tight and sharply edited by Frédéric Thoraval.With all you'd want there's haunting moving images and figures, creepy super 8 footage, spooky photos, a series of snuff films, local snooping cops and a concerned wife to name few. Although part murder mystery, Sinister is full of horror. Clever directing and lighting allows the viewer to make discoveries at the same time as Hawke and the sound design and visuals present several effective jump scares.Sinister's bonus is that it's well acted for the genre. Both Professor Jonas Vincent D'Onofrio and Fred Thompson as the Sheriff are natural and to Cargill and Derrickson's credit certainly character wise tries to go against predicable. The eerie Mr. Boogieman's appearance is limited and part of a larger mythology avoiding the need for a typical showdown which has been done to death in many horror films. There's not an annoying child actor in sight. I can't put my finger on it but Juliet Rylance while a good actress playing the down to earth wife and mother Tracy feels slightly out of place, possibly miscast. Notable is James Ransone as quirky concerned cop Deputy So-And-So. Hawke is on fine form - in what could have been stereotype writer going mad but plays it perfectly balanced and convincingly from the outset. He becomes desperate as the film becomes increasingly paranormal and the ancient demon reverence becomes prevalent. Debatably not since The Shining (1980) and Stir of Echoes (1999) has a male horror lead character been as interesting. You warm the guy despite his faults and you care about his fate.As it unfolds clichés rear their heads, a child's drawings on a wall, ghosts and so on but it all done in a naturalistic fashion with outstanding special visual effects. Again the special effects are not just for effects sake and fit within the scenes. There's an especially creepy scene when Oswalt investigates the noises in his house armed with a baseball bat but cannot see the sounds origins.It has a tight story and although the downbeat ending while well done leaves you a little empty. You feel there is going to be an inevitable sequel but you really wish they'd leave it neatly wrapped up. While Sinister's elements may not be entirely original it encompasses, combines and defines satisfyingly ideas that other horrors of it's kind have failed to do.",Null,1,3,6 March 2013

There is a wonderful otherworldly score by Jerry Goldsmith and some great costumes and spacesuits designed by Erica Edell Phillips.RoboCop (1987) director Paul Verhoeven once again uses Ronny Cox as the menacing protagonist in this Phillip K Dick inspired story. In it's day it was hailed for its special effects and make-up effects and while these have dated slightly, it still holds its own as an entertaining science fiction.If the director reins and main role were given to anyone other than Arnold this may have been a sci-fi thriller, but with Arnie's larger than life screen presence and Verhoeven highly-flavoured visuals Total Recall is not given a noir look that would usual accompany such subject matter becoming a vivid futuristic action flick.While the acting is a little overboard with a cast that include Sharon Stone, Michael Ironside and Marshall Bell it's saved by the intriguing story that moves along at a fast pace and Schwarzenegger performance. The rest of the cast are hired bad guys, mutants and an array of quirky characters.Overall Total Recall is a great piece of captivating entertainment so 'for the memory of a lifetime Rekall, Rekall, Rekall.'",Null,0,1,23 September 2010
Limitless," Drug enhanced excitement
","A writer samples a new nootropic drug, NZT-48, which gets him over his writers block allowing him to complete his book. However, it also gives him 100% of his the brain's power which opens up limitless opportunities.Surprisingly Limitless is a finely constructed piece of film, not only in it's intriguing fast paced scripting by Leslie Dixon but in Neil Burger's refreshing style and use of camera movement to progress the story. In certain scenes it's slightly reminiscent of Sherlock Homes and Revolver with its narration and delivery but for the most part it oozes originality.The sets and locations act as a superb backdrop showing the extravagant contemporary slick interiors of New York in contrast to the down trodden streets and apartments. The music score complements the city skylines, atmosphere and on screen feats and drama.Andrew Howard is notable as Gennady a Mafia thug and the subplot involving borrowing capital from mafia gives Limitless an edginess throughout. A-Team and Hangover's Bradly Cooper is first rate as 'Eddie' Morra playing the average everyday man come stock market genius perfectly; his display of desperation, physical altercations and cold turkey is excellent. Robert De Niro's small but pivotal role is wonderful, playing the heavyweight business man Van Loon effortlessly. The film arguably has only two short comings which are Abbie Cornish's uneven performance as girlfriend Lindy and Anna Friel's makeup that simply has trouble making her look rough and frail.It's a refreshing film that has all the Hollywood polish without all the Hollywood trappings, possible due to the source material of Alan Glynn's novel (The Dark Fields). If Russian mafia, mergers, murder and drug enhancement excites you Limitless comes highly recommended.",Null,0,0,9 August 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," More than hidden messages and occult meanings
","A man is drawn into an underground sexual group which puts his family in danger.Based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story) as a mystery thriller Stanley Kubrick's Eye Wide Shut at first glance doesn't deliver, with only a few taught scenes littered throughout as an elite secret society is discovered by the film's main doctor character played by Tom Cruise. However, as a visual and atmospheric piece of cinema it excels. Interestingly, it's not the famous masonic segment or Bill (Cruise) and Alison (Nicole Kidman) relationship woes nor the basic thriller premise that ignite interest it's the plot's undercurrent, what is not said but implied and insinuated through looks, background items and actions that makes Eye Wide Shut so interesting. It can been seen to have many layers and can be inter-played and interpreted in different ways similar to, but more subtle than the likes of Revolver (2005) or Mulholland Drive. Just touching the surface, did Bill and Alison handover their daughter to the secret society at the end? Was Alison already a member? Was Bill's friend killed? Are the characters all lying to Bill? Kubrick presents endless questions, which answers only throws out more questions. The camera work, lighting, sets, music and costumes are great. Supporting actors Sydney Pollack, Vinessa Shaw, Leelee Sobieski and Rade Serbedzija really shine. Oddly Kidman feels subdued throughout and Cruise (possibly cast too young) while reaching some emotional heights never seems moved by the bizarre nightmare he finds himself in, again this could be interpreted in different ways depending on your thoughts if you believe that there is more going on beneath the exposition or if it's taken at face value. Eyes Wide Shut arguably only really works if you deem more is going on than there actually is.Overall, excellent atmosphere with a story that allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions. If you expect a conventional thriller you may be left disappointed but if you enjoy daydreams about chance and missed opportunities this may float your boat.",Null,2,4,14 October 2016
Sicario," Great performances.
","A task force is assembled to prevent the expansion of a Mexican drug cartel but their methods may not be sanctioned or orthodox. Sicario is a well paced unravelling film. The acting and Denis Villeneuve's direction is exceptional. Written by Taylor Sheridan Sicario tackles complex drug policy issues and there impact but makes a digestible story.Sheridan gives Benicio Del Toro's wonderfully played Alejandro just enough lines to keep intrigue in the character, in the vain of Training Day's Detective Alonzo Harris or Lamb's Hannibal Lecter to name a few. While Emily Blunt is excellent as the reserved Kate Macer her character feels simply functional as the viewers moral point of view. Josh Brolin gives a fine performance as the laid back spook Matt Graver. Still, Benicio Del Toro steals the show with great screen presence in his dark themed scenes.There's an edgy explosive opening as a SWAT team discover dozens of corpses, the realistic setting adds to the tension as jurisdiction wrangling and corruption is discovered. Sicario is a solid murky, hard- edged thriller and worth watching for Del Toro and Brolin's performances alone. Overall a great film but doesn't do enough to elevate it into a classic.",Null,0,0,4 April 2016
Thor," Excellent casting with a great Comicbook tone.
","A god, Thor is exiled from Asgard to Earth. However, he must find a way of returning to stop his brother Loki becoming the new king of Asgard.Chris Hemsworth as Thor is very good portraying his arrogance and later insecurity perfectly. Tom Hiddleston is notable as Loki and plays it less maniacal with range. Hopkins picks up his pay cheque but in his defence there's not much he can do with Odin's dialogue and costume. Both Stellan Skarsgård and Natalie Portman are sadly wasted but actors playing the Warriors Three; Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun are endearingly fun.Despite being directed by successful thespian Kenneth Branagh Thor at times feels like souped up CGI Supergirl (1984) and Superman 2 (1980). It's not as much fun as Iron Man but despite some alterations captures the Thor comic book spirit arguably more successfully than the last 3 Spiderman movies.Naturally Thor is effects driven and the story has a little more depth than most recent comic book adaptations but the earth bound periods are rather uninspiring while the enjoyment comes from the action on Asgard.It's good entertainment especially if you are a fan of Thor, but all the special effects add up to something very forgettable and feels like a vehicle simply for The Avengers film.Overall, it ultimately depends on what your idea of what a comic-book superhero movie should be.",Null,0,1,1 August 2011
The Godfather: Part III," 1950's remnants in the 70's
","Misjudged due to its truthfulness, filmed in 1991, this Godfather is a fitting third film.It's now the 70's and times have changed since the 1950's hay days of the first two films. Pacino portrays an aged, mellower, ill and haunted man, gone is the steeliness of his youth. Michael Corleone's hair changes colour after his stroke, and there are plenty of character touches added to the older Don, as well as to Talia Shire's Connie Corleone.Many of the original cast appear which adds to the continuity, a great touch for die hard fans. You can argue that Sofia Coppola was miscast but it may just be because she's not authentically beautiful, sorry, you can't pick your family. Missing is Tom Hagan and George Hamilton as B.J. Harrison fills the gap tolerably. Andy Garcia is excellent as Vincent Mancini, Sonny's illegitimate son.Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo take the rounded characters on journey of self realisation. It's a pleasant character study that reflects how we change as we get older. The film gains momentum, building great tension and shock in the third act. However, don't watch expecting the atmosphere, vitality or vigour first two.These are 1950's remnants in the 70's and all the power on earth can't change destiny.",Null,0,1,19 March 2010

Woody Harrelson is ideal as Tallahassee, the crazy twinkie zombie killer and Jesse Eisenberg plays the goofy teen Columbus effortlessly.There's really not much to dislike about the film, however, if you like your zombie films serious and menacing avoid at all costs, but if you like large budget horror comedies, Zombieland is for you.",Null,0,0,1 April 2010

It's the sleeper hit that made Bruce Willis a star and remains sinisterly great fun to this day.It captures that Christmas feeling perfectly with a distinguished score from the late Michael Kamen and some fine cinematography by the then unknown Jan de Bont (Speed Director).The supporting cast are all first rate and include William Atherton, the late Paul Gleason, Bonnie Bedelia and the excellent Reginald VelJohnson as the typical cop Sgt. Al Powell. Alan Rickman, probably in his finest performance, is the heist leader Hans Gruber.

The Wayne/Batman connections are weighty and dramatic enough not to induce eye-rolling. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher delivers the atmospheric grit of the late 70s into an early 1980s set Joker.The psychological aspect is reminiscent of American Psycho with a play on what is real and what is not. Its intriguing throughout watching Fleck's metamorphosis into something quite edgy and creepy during the briskly paced running time.Phillips expertly injects violence that is hard hitting, that emulates the simmering and brutal kills of The Godfather, Goodfellas and the like with a tragic character and dark comedy at its core.It's a must see, if anything, it's arguably too well made to be a comic book movie.",Null,1,3,30 October 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Bruce still dies hard
","John McClane and a store owner must play a bomber's deadly game. With Live free or Die Hards release I thought I'd review the 1995's Die Hard: With a Vengeance. I missed the Christmas feeling of the first two instalments in this summer set blockbuster and some of the characters of the first two films.However, on reviewing the first thing that hit me was the sad echoes of real life 9/11 and one wonders if the film would ever have been given the green light now.That aside the film is very enjoyable as hungover John McClane and Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus, play witty duo, as they run around New York undertaking tasks set out by Simon played by heister Jeremy Irons.Die hard fans will find the icing on the cake is the direct link to the first film and for everyone else there's the banter between the leads and action scenes.

American Gangster," Ridley Scott creates the 1970's
","Consistent Ridley Scott recreates 1970s America in the true life story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a heroin kingpin from Manhattan. Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, an incorruptible detective, who works to bring down Lucas's drug empire.An interesting and contrasting character study on many levels, Russell Crowe performance is excellent, his personal life is in turmoil, yet he is totally focused on his work. Where as Washington's character is in control of both his personal and 'work' life. Washington is on top form, equalling if not surpassing his Oscar winning performance in Training day (2001). The costumes and makeup are excellent. The supporting actors give weight to the production and there are some memorable performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin and Ted Levine to name few.I've seen both the theatrical version the 175 min extended version that includes approx. 19 minutes of additional footage. While the extra footage doesn't jump out at you, the ending is notably different but just as captivating. For a lengthy film America Gangster zips along at a fast pace, accompanied by a great music soundtrack and a enhancing score by Marc Streitenfeld. The 1970's is painstakingly created with amazing realistic set design. Scott's direction coupled with Harris Savides cinematography captures the feel and tone of the time. Scott not only recreates Manhattan but also Vietnam and the war is at it's height. Credit deservedly should g to Steven Zaillian's writing and Mark Jacobson's tale that show working of a drug empire, from the high level corruption and to the impact on the street.A perfectly crafted film and gratifying cinema.",Null,0,1,5 May 2010
Jaws," Go back in the water...
","The inhabitants of a small fishing and summer resort town are terrorised by a shark and a group of men set off to catch it and kill it.When Steven Spielberg first saw the script for Jaws laying on a desk the thought it was a sign to make the film, as Duel his hit TV movie had the same amount of letters in the title.Jaws created what has become the film clichés you see today, a sleepy town, greedy town officials, the doubted hero and the older wise guru. It was all there in Peter Benchley's novel, however, Spielberg made a few changes for the better and what you end up with is a thrilling suspense movie.Peter Benchley has mentioned that if he had known about the actual behaviour of sharks, he would have never written the book. Also maybe Steven Spielberg may not have made the film as the shark (named 'Bruce' after Spielberg's lawyer) was never tested in salt water and caused a troubled and prolonged production. Fortunately this added to the films tense atmosphere and in the sharks case, less is more, as the actors get to show their stuff as the film builds up to a gripping finale.John Williams most memorable score gels the movie together. The acting is fantastic and also from the supporting cast including Murray Hamilton's Mayor, to Quints silent partner. The leading trio are on top form - Roy Scheider proves his performance in the French connection was no fluke, Richard Dreyfuss career was saved with his performance as Hooper and set up his future film work and finally Robert Shaw steered his performance away from a Captain Ahab rehash, to a sailor with a haunted past, Quint's tale of the USS Indianapolis will forever be one of the best speeches in movie history.Watch this movie and experience for yourself why the tagline read 'don't go in the water'",Null,0,2,17 April 2007
Kong: Skull Island," Teenagers will love this but it's tonally disjointed. Goodman and Kebbell are underused.
","A team of scientists are chaperoned by a war veteran to an uncharted island in the Pacific, however, things go awry and they must fight to escape the primal island. The effects are impressive and director Jordan Vogt-Roberts skilfully creates a great sense of scale. What's refreshing is that the handful of writers don't rehash the King Kong story of a screaming female, the giant ape falling in love and being taken to civilisation only to die. This take on the 1933 landmark film is reminiscent of Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1960), Jurassic Park: The Lost World (1997) and the 'monster verses' moments of Kong films to name a few. The period Platoon-like (1986) soundtrack sells the 70's setting along with Henry Jackman's score complimenting the action setups. The cast are adequate including the likes of Tom Hiddleston and John C. Reilly. Samuel L. Jackson looks really infuriated throughout, and rightly so as Kong wipes out the majorly of his team. But to be honest it's a good thing as I'd pay good money to see Jackson's badassery (is that a word?) over CGI monsters any day. Hiddleston is surprising as tracker Conrad especially in his fight driven introduction. Brie Larson as photographer Weaver is sadly given very little to do. There's a little confrontation dynamic between the parties when they find out that Kong is essential in keeping the equilibrium of the Island. Along with Conrad's followers, Hank Marlow (Reilly) who has been stranded on the island since 1944, go against Jackson's hardened vet' Preston Packard who wants Kong dead.Notable are underused John Goodman and Toby Kebbell as solider Jack. Kebbell no stranger to motion capture (Koba, Planet of the Apes) advises Terry Notary who is excellent as Kong. Regardless of how much is actually Notary's performance, the completed monster design is impressive especially when Kong battles giant ancient creatures. The humour is largely hit and miss due to the dark tone and post Vietnam War backdrop. With hints of Apocalypse Now (1979) it's more visually striking than Godzilla (2014), but it's not as tonally consistent. Skull Island feels one-dimensional in comparison. Vogt-Roberts offers some stage interesting napalm moments, reflecting on sunglasses and exploding silhouette giant beasts. Stay for the after the credits as it teases a showdown with another aforementioned giant monster.Stripped of effects it's B movie stuff with a A list cast and budget. Most teenagers will no doubt love it, but Kong:Skull Island's mishmash tone may leave others feeling underwhelmed.",Null,4,10,15 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Capably links the two trilogies
","Bilbo is forced to be a mediator in a war with an array of opponents as Gandalf and his fellow sorcery friends push back against a rising evil.Again without comparing it to J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy novel Peter Jackson brings the Hobbit trilogy to a satisfying conclusion. The returning cast are once again on form, Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen,Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace, Ken Stott and James Nesbitt to name a few. It also features The Lord of the Rings actors Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Orlando Bloom.Surprisingly Benedict Cumberbatch's excellent Smaug is killed off early in the first act bringing the dragon's story-line abruptly to a close. Also Luke Evans' Bard while great in the action scenes feels like a sidekick to the Elves and Dwarfs and is given little to do. That aside, it's an engrossing dark episode that stirs emotion with some surprise deaths. Bilbo forges friendships and is torn between duty and the greater good. There's more Legolas and Tauriel, giant bats, magic spells and sword fights. Jackson's offers epic battle scenes (where Billy Connolly show up as dwarf Ironfoot) and stand offs along with a tense romance and friendship climax. As with the previous outing the special effects are at times a little iffy but it's still colossal technical achievement. Again the production values are high, the costumes, props and sets are outstanding topped off by a magical Howard Shore score. In amongst the visually stunning set ups Peter Jackson agreeably connects it to the second (filmed first) Middle-earth trilogy.",Null,0,3,15 July 2016

Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy are superb in pivotal supporting roles. Leonardo DiCaprio is more than adequate, although their are distracting similarities reminiscent of his troubled character Teddy Daniels in Shutter Island (2010), this aside he gives a fine performance.

That said, Timothy Olyphant's voice steels the show in a fleeting The Man with No Name cameo.Adults may get plenty of nostalgic enjoyment and the visuals may keep the young and old entertained with the script mostly going over the children's heads but it's not the family movie you maybe expecting- Tangled or Cats and Dogs it is not. It's a part Eastwood homage oozing spaghetti Western, but it's dark and even with the slick script it lacks that fun feeling. Think ILM effects meets 9 (2009) and Chinatown (1974), mixed with Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).",Null,0,1,30 July 2011

It has an excellent diverse cast ensemble, including Olga Kurylenko, Imogene Poots, David Morrissey and the great Liam Cunningham. With excellent make-up design, costumes and fantastic breathtaking settings, it's only hankered by some strained dialogue which lacks the conviction of that in the Black Death (2010).Centurion is modest constructed period piece, there's Etain (Kurylenko) and Michael Fassbender's excellent performance as Quintus, violence, blood and decapitations. Supporting actors are the backbone with the likes of Axelle Carolyn and Dave Legeno to name a few but they are not given enough to do or say. You can forgive at times Ilan Eshkeri great, yet, at times intrusive theatrical score, as Marshall delivers some great set ups, action, the wolf hunt and ambush to name a few and Centurion grips you and creates tension like his unsurpassed earlier work.There's lots of atmosphere created by the location shoot and visually Marshall delivers.

The Conjuring," When haunted house possession goes right
","A family move into an American country house haunted by its original owner. So after a paranormal investigative couple are called in to debunk the disturbances only to find they may have bitten off more than they can chew.After a strong 1960s opening involving a creepy demonic doll it flashes-forward to the 70s with a family moving into their new house. From then on The Conjuring pretty much doesn't let up on the scares. While derivative, director James Wan wastes no time building on and defining what we've seen in other horrors but offering a complete package.Based on a true story, writers Chad and Carey Hayes offer basements, pianos, priests, dolls and clocks. Their natural dialogue is well delivered by the cast, here the child actors are on form (arguably faultless) with Wan's regular Watchmen and Insidious actor Patrick Wilson delivering a good performance, his calibre adds to the proceedings. Vera Farmiga gives a subtle performance and gets the bulk of the character development. Their sub-plot sets this apart from other horrors of its kind. In addition, with some academic demonology information the lecture segments pay off once the couple being their investigation giving some scope to the proceedings. After the half hour mark the scares come thick and fast.The 1970s is recreated perfectly, the camera work and lighting add to the ominous feel in conjunction with Joseph Bishara's score with its piano and horns that add to the creepier moments. As it develops every horror cliché is put on screen, dead animals, apparitions, mirrors, bruises, sleepwalking, recordings everything apart from the horror kitchen sink is thrown in. But Wan delivers the shocks and scares exceptionally as well as subtly leaving much to the viewers imagination.With a debunking element from the Red Lights (2012), underrated Innkeepers (2011) and with moments reminiscent of The Exorcist (1973) The Amityville Horror and its remake, it shares much with these other films but still stands on its own. The Conjuring is debatably more grounded than Wan's other work probably due to the true story aspect. The special effects are outstanding and although the closing act is slightly overblown, it finishes on a fitting, tense and ominous low key moment..It may not be as nerve-racking as the recent Sinister, but if you like haunted house and possession films this isn't one to miss.",Null,0,1,6 August 2013
Prometheus," Scott's intriguing LV-223 Sci-fi
","The near future 2089 Earths historical artifact's and ancient paintings prompt an expedition into space to find our makers but puts the crew of the Prometheus in grave danger when they land on LV-223 in 2093.Veteran director Ridley Scott gives Prometheus its own unique look and rightly so as the action, suspense takes place on LV-223 not LV- 426 as in Alien(s). Without getting bogged down with Alien (2122A.D) comparisons, this is a science expedition not a mining vessel. This change in location allows Prometheus to sit as a stand alone film.Questioning our origins in a reasonable intelligent way the story written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof is intriguing and makes this film stand above your average sci-fi. That said, Prometheus does raise more questions than it answers yet it's ambiguity is what makes this film special and allows for the set-up of future instalments. It's excellently cast and includes international actors Guy Pearce (who is sorely underused) Idris Elba as everyday man Janek and Logan Marshall-Green to name a few. Charlize Theron is astounding as Meredith Vickers, a hard nosed corporate mission director. Notably is Michael Fassbender as David who is every bit as interesting as Bishop and Ash with added a quirky 'fondness' for Peter O'Tool. Main protagonist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace is not your typical Ripley clone and carries much of the emotion for the film. The effects are first rate, with the Space Jockeys, scenery, ships and Aliens wonderfully realised and rendered. Some of the effects are practical and look organic for the most part. The location and environment feels real and makes everything more palatable. A nod should go to Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and Pietro Scalia's editing.Scott delivers a few standout creepy scenes some particularly gut turning, notably the arm breaking, infection and decontamination scenes-  it captures some xenomorph magic. Marc Streitenfeld's music score is an effective mixed bag although is a little over used. Both writers and Scott ensure to include a few character twists and wisely incorporate some elements from the Aliens series (in keeping with that world) whether it be a vehicle, a line or setup to possibly appease die-hard fans but for the most part it feels fresh. That said, some character motivations need to be teased out by the viewer for clarification, not all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted.The film took the Alien series in a direction I was not expecting. As a long-time fan of the Alien series, and with this new Prometheus course I can say I'm satisfied, it's edge of your seat, gory-suspense - director Ridley Scott is on pretty good form.Prometheus tackles themes of origin, mortality and biological warfare to name a few and although it feels a little rushed it's a grower just like the spores themselves.",Null,7,18,2 June 2012

Perfect leads include, heavy weight Donald Pleasence as Doctor Loomis and ever reliable Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) as they try to out wit an escaped psychotic murderer.Halloween is a well produced basic, yet essential horror that contains very little nudity or blood for this type of genre.

Wonder Woman," One of the better most rounded super hero movies
","Diana leaves her paradise Island magically hidden from the rest of the world to fight alongside men in a war to end all wars.Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman is a pleasing film in a sea of other superhero flicks. What it gets right is a good mix of action and narrative helped by the back drop of The Great War/World War I. While arguably it lags in the final act, mainly due to the seeming obligatory big boss final battle showdown it for the most part swiftly moves along. Part new origin story on the island of Themyscira, home to the Amazons, you see the character honing her powers and becoming Wonder Woman. Later when she helps a spy (Chris Pine) and they journey to Europe circa 1913, she's finds that she is a fish out of water in her new surroundings in searching for the god of war. Allan Heinberg's screenplay has a few twists and plays with the sexiest elements of the period. Nevertheless, it slightly sells itself out at times with all the tropes of a love story with at times Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman playing second fiddle to Pine's American spy pilot. Thankfully these are few and far between, but it's still an unnecessary dynamic.There's a top cast full of familiar faces including David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright with the sets and costumes being Oscar worthy. This incarnation supersedes Wonder Woman 1967 pilot, Lynda Carter's TV pop icon version complete with memorable theme and Adrianne Palicki's failed pilot. Gadot may not be everyone's idea of what Diana Prince/Wonder Woman should look like, however, she is great in the role carrying the naive innocence having been on a hidden island almost all of her life with the power and presence that we saw glimpses of in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). There's also some present day scenes that fit nicely with Zack Snyder's outing and Justice League (2017). With plenty fight scenes the new Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL Wonder Woman theme kicks in fittingly and Rupert Gregson-Williams' score captures the atmosphere of the respective settings.Overall, Wonder Woman is probably one of the most rounded entertaining super hero movies out there with its war themes ironically just as relevant today.",Null,10,21,8 June 2017
The Woman in Black," Lamp lit sets, rolling fog, graveyards - old school horror.
","Mr. Kipp is assigned to handle the estate of Alice Drablow who owned Eel Marsh. The longer he stays on at Drablow estate the more horror he witnesses which pushes him on to uncover what is taking the lives of the local children.Not to be confused with 1989's competent made for TV film, Hammer films production boasts a terrific cast, looks and sounds great with real locations assisting the gravity. Set in early 1920's, the period is wonderfully recreated - a time where séance and superstition is rife. Opening with a creepy melodic score and an eerie children's party which ends mysteriously tragic you know your on somber solid ground and in good horror hands. There are plenty of scares, spine chilling moments and jump scares which have the quality to make hairs stand-up on the back of necks thanks to the fantastic sound design and visuals.Lamp lit sets, odd grim town folk, rolling fog, graveyards, ghosts, creepy dolls and photos, this version of Woman in Blank oozes atmosphere. James Watkins delivers a slow burning chiller which allows the tragic character of widower Kipp time to breathe.Based on Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black's excellent writer Jane Goldman includes the old horror clichés in the screenplay but injects realism along side. It all comes together thanks to the great casting. A mature Daniel Radcliffe as defiant Mr Kipps is surprising effective, veteran Ciarán Hinds is on top form as wealthy land owner Daily and Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey, and Liz White are all wonderful. The supporting cast even down to the child actors are effective. Nevertheless, Radcliffe is very much the focus.It's refreshing like the recent Innkeepers (2011) with it's back to basics approach of little blood and simple chills. Arguably surpassing the Haunted (1995), The Others (2001) and reminiscent of the Haunting (1963) Woman in Black harks back to the days of old school horror and scares with a modern slick execution.The icing on the cake is its horrible, yet, brave heart wrenching downbeat or debatably upbeat ending which will stay with you long after the credits roll.",Null,4,8,17 February 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Well hello Oscar.
","In Silence of the Lambs, just like Manhunter's plot (also based on a Thomas Harris novel) an FBI agent seeks help from the notorious serial killer Hannibal Lector to capture a psychopathic killer holding a girl captive.Director Jonathan Demme's 1991 award winner was a smash hit that almost catapulted Hopkins into typecast hell. Ted Tally screenplay is excellent and the dialogue superb, however, surprisingly both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins picked up best actor roles for their melodramatic performances.Nevertheless, Hopkins commands every scene he's in but really isn't that creepy. Unexplainably, Ted Levine was not nominated for his role as Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb, which is simply psychotic and chilling. Scott Glenn given an understated performance and the supporting cast are familiar faces which include Anthony Heald as Dr. Frederick Chilton and Charles Napier. There's walk-ons by Roger Corman, George A. Romero and singer Chris Isaak! Demme won best picture for this solid thriller, the scenes lighting and sets are fantastic, including Lectors cell, temporary holding and Bill's House. The locations are distinct and some credit must go to Tak Fujimoto's photography for this. The final reel is amazing thanks to Craig McKay's slick editing coupled with tension of Howard Shore's score.To Silence's credit it sets the foundation for Hannibal and Red Dragon. It is indeed a solid crime yarn but is overrated and lacks the sophistication of it's sequel and prequel.",Null,0,0,30 September 2010
X-Men: First Class," Fist class origin story
","A prequel to the X-Men trilogy set mainly during the Cuban Missile Crisis Charles Xavier and Magneto  form the first Brotherhood of Mutants to stop a former Nazi mutant Shaw and his Mutant gang. But Magneto wants to settle a score with Shaw that dates back to WWII.First class is directed skilfully by Matthew Vaughn with a perfect mix of emotion, humour and comic-book action to the backdrop of semi-real events and the swinging 1960s. The team of writers and Singer deserve credit for the idea and dialogue. Naturally it's a well produced film with amazing locations, makeup, effects and score, but it's the attention to detail especially in the now retro set design and props that gives it a great look and feel.James McAvoy pre-professor X has all the hallmarks of his older self, but he is more virile, McAvoy brings the character to life effortlessly. Michael Fassbender's ever changing accent aside he's perfect as Erik/Magneto hell bent on revenge, from the opening of this instalment this is very much his story. In supporting roles are Jennifer Lawrence as a young Mystique, Rose Byrne a CIA agent and Jason Flemyng as Azazel to name a few. Main villain Shaw is played by Kevin Bacon who is both menacing and charismatic. However, it's relatively unknown actress January Jones who steals the show as Emma Frost. There are a few surprise cameos from the previous films cast which all amounts to a wonderful cast ensemble. Vaughn ensures that the focus is on the characters, their relationships and there abilities rather than the fantastic effects but while their is depth he is careful not to over dramatise or make the proceedings too melodramatic retaining the comic book spirit and serious theme sits in it's own respected world.First Class is well written, lots of fun much and very enjoyable - arguably more than the previous X-Men outings. That said, it's also a great prequel but can stand on it's own. I'm sure fan boys would like to see Ian McKellen's Magneto versus his younger Fassbender self - the opportunity for sequels are endless. Recommend first class entertainment.",Null,0,2,7 August 2011
The Wolverine," Wolverine versus ninjas and Yakuza
","A man on his death bed beckons Logan to Japan to see him for one last time. After his passing Logan/Wolverine finds himself caught up in a family and corporate power struggle and must survive as a normal man when is his power of regeneration is taken away.Hugh Jackman returns in the lead role, thankfully the change of setting injects some much needed freshness and dynamics into the genre. Although you can spot that final twist a mile off Mark Bomback and Scott Frank's screenplay rolls out an interesting action packed bodyguard yarn for the first half. (For fans) Famke Janssen reprises her Jean Grey role which is a nice touch and connects it to the previous X-Men outings, it also gives room for some emotional scenes with Jackman.Director James Mangold's delivers some great action sequences from the start including ninjas, yes ninjas and Yakuza going head to head with the Wolverine. There's guns, sword play and stabbings with some finely executed martial arts on display. However, the second half puts Wolverine back in familiar superhero hero territory with a giant robotic samurai warrior and a toxic spitting woman Viper played menacingly by Svetlana Khodchenkova.Notable actors Hiroyuki Sanada and Will Yun Lee appear. Actress Tao Okamoto is Logan's love interest Mariko and Rila Fukushima appears as Yukio, Logan's 'bodyguard' both are on fine form. There's some good chemistry between Jackman, Okamoto and Fukushima which gives some sentimental weight and comedy to this instalment.The excellent Marco Beltrami offers another great score which adds to the events highs and lows, the effects are what you'd expect from this big budget but The Wolverine is more impressively fulfilling with it's physical action scene setups.Overall it's an entertaining ride, with a strong opening which - love it or hate it falls - into formulaic territory especially in the last act.",Null,0,3,12 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman the Dark Knight Begins to Return Forever
","After a peaceful period in Gotham City, the citizens need The Batman when the city is thrown into chaos by an organised killer Bane.Those who bought into director Christopher Nolan's darker more thriller less comic Batman will most likely welcome the fitting closure of The Dark Knight Rises. This fast paced third film successfully links the first two instalments and ties up some loose ends, with the tone being that of the second for the most part.It is a fine production, from the sets/locations, to the effects, costumes, cast and score. It's even emotionally stirring at times. The character arcs and serious tone are less forced than many other comic adaptations/productions that turn grim for the sake of being dramatic. Dark Knight Rises fits the spirit it's delivered in. It feels tighter, more balanced with very few lulls in drama or action than its predecessors. There are a few twists and cameos some more surprising than others. Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Fox are sorely underused, that said they underpin the overall story and themes. Tom Hardy is almost unrecognisable and is excellent as Bane. Gary Oldman gives another fitting performance as Commissioner Gordon but with even more conviction. Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Blake)and Anne Hathaway (Selina) have some good chemistry, holding their own alongside Christian Bale's convincing Wayne.Overall, although playing out for the most part as a violent, taught thriller there is some comic book light that occasionally shines through. But if you've seen Nolan's first two offerings you should know what to expect as this is of the same calibre.",Null,2,6,27 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Surpringly works thanks to the great casting but a poor third act.
","Criminal mastermind Lex Luthor, obsessed with defeating Superman, manipulates Batman into preemptively battling him.Despite its short comings director Zack Snyder (Man of Steel and The Dawn of the Dead remake) offers a brooding thoughtful take on the seminal figures of our 20th century pop culture. Ben Affleck is surprising perfect as the aged Batman and Henry Cavill once again proves he is rightly another generations Superman. While slightly out of place Jesse Eisenberg does his best at putting a new spin on Lex Luthor. Diane Lane, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Costner return and Amy's Lois Lane gets more to do in this installment.Jeremy Irons' limited screen time is welcomed but with its excessive running time both Holly Hunter and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman are underused. DC fans will be pleased as Snyder and writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer slip in live-action portrayals of Aquaman, Cyborg and the Flash. The film's plot twists are interesting and include the killing off of some main characters, the plot also includes Man of Steels' Zod. However, disappointingly once again the hero's face off with the typical effects-driven, end level bad guy in the closing act, smothering a potentially powerful story. Its also crammed with overt man versus god references.Snyder thankfully though offers a fittingly dark toned grim whirlwind with a visual grandeur thanks to Larry Fong's cinematography. Notable are a few edgy jarring dream sequences. Wonder Woman's untold story with a Belgium 1918 photograph peaks interest. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice pays tribute to the characters' roots, offering great modern incarnations of them but Dawn of Justice loses momentum by the end with a clichéd effects driven Doomsday battle.",Null,1,3,29 March 2016
Blade Runner," Edgy hi-tech art-house whichever version you prefer
","I must admit I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott's and Blade Runner is one of his finest moments, panned by critics and by most on its release, it was ahead of its time on every level.Whichever version of Blade Runner you prefer, it has atmosphere, great costumes and a mood of gritty realism about it. The neo-cityscapes, the dark street life and polluted air; all paint a grim futuristic picture complimented by a Vangelis score; which is touching and haunting. The lines are memorable and there are fantastic performances from Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Edward James Olmos. Harrison Ford is perfect as the moody ex- Blade Runner and Joe Turkel should have won an award as the Frankenstein -like creator.Blade Runner is quite a simplistic tale that is complicated by the fantastic visuals and effects. Lying beneath the plot that many writers contributed to, there's heart and soul, questions of what it means to be human and even delves into our own mortality.Its edgy hi-tech art-house that brings science fiction to life and while it's not the most fulfilling sci-fi film it certainly is a fantastic visual experience.",Null,0,1,26 February 2010
Casino Royale," One of the best, compliments all that is Bond
","Set in the present day, in a time-line of Bond's early years, after receiving his 00 status he must stop banker villain Le Chiffre from winning a poker tournament at Casino Royale that is funding terrorism.Director Martin Campbell after an old-school approach to Goldeneye delivers a thrilling and grounded vision of Bond. There's a great modern use of angles and camera movement techniques. Casino Royale is a must see for all Bond fans, old and new. It is simply, Bondtastic! With less gadgets and more realistic tech tools, Bond relies more on his training and wits. Everything is there on screen, exquisite locations, guns, cars, action and there are many nods to the books too. Although some of the characters from the series are missing, they're surprisingly not missed and the spirit feels they may appear in future films.With Neal Purvis & Robert Wade excellent screenplay coupled with a fantastic score, stunts and drama this movie is far more gritty. The character Felix Leiter makes an appearance this time played by Jeffrey Wright. Judi Dench returns as 'M' and there are notable performances from the excellent and subtle Giancarlo Giannini as Mathis. In addition, the villain is less than stereotype with Mads Mikkelsen in the role of Le Chiffre.Daniel Craig is mesmerising as Ian Fleming's British spy, James Bond. Less humour, harder, infused with emotion, Bond is lean and dangerous. It's a great entry and hopefully a sign of things to come.",Null,2,5,19 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Don't expect too much and you'll enjoy.
","John McClane after being tasked with escorting a young suspect becomes entangled with a team of cyber terrorists who are holding his daughter as collateral.Underworld director Len Wiseman directs the fourth instalment of the Die Hard film series. With a story line that over focuses on today's technology reliant world we live in, 4 is still an entertaining ride.Almost everything is there, witty one-liners, great action scenes, however, like the third it lacks the 'connection' to the first two films, even though it includes a picture of Holly Gennaro.Marco Beltrami score is fine and despite Willis getting on in years he puts plenty of life into John McClane. Cliff Curtis is excellent as FBI Deputy Director, action starlet Maggie Q is magnificent and the supporting cast include Kevin Smith and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Justin Long however appears out of place and possibly miscast.Redeemably Timothy Olyphant's bad guy Thomas Gabriel is perfect. He's calm and less animated than some stereotypes. I feel that without Olyphant's performance and Willis efforts the film would have been less fun. There's some 'free running' action and the effects are great, but the jet scene was an unnecessary piece of superciliousness. In addition, it feels preachy, McClane's son is nowhere to be seen and the end feels very rushed.Yeap, it's a mixed review, certainly watch for Olyphant's performance, Wiseman's slick direction and Wilis as his best character. Don't expect too much and no doubt you'll enjoy.",Null,1,3,23 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Retains the Star Wars magic, the force is strong with this one
","Thirty years after the second Death Star's destruction, Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has vanished. An unlikely group get drawn into search for the Jedi before the First Order, a successor to the fallen Galactic Empire find him first. J.J. Abrams flourishingly takes over the reins from George Lucas for Disney. The production values, effects and music are outstanding with writers Lawrence Kasdan, Abrams and Michael Arndt successfully handing over the baton to the new characters without leaving the beloved ones behind. John Boyega's Finn has depth and is very likable, as too is Daisy Ridley who is simply outstanding and steals the show as Rey. Oscar Isaac's X Wing pilot Poe Dameron is memorable and somehow manages to encapsulate the look, swagger and feel of the original Star Wars spirit. If I were to nit-pick the CGI Supreme Leader Snoke hologram and the monsters hiding and attacking the Millennium Falcon as it hums back to life is not without its problems. That said, it's doesn't distract from the overall great quality of the effects throughout, from the impressive practical and visual effects right down to jolting storms troopers, desert creatures, spaceship base interiors and beyond. Yes, it's partly a rehash of the first film with a few welcomed twists and surprises but it's a really visual and emotional treat, with great sets, costumes, make-up and locations. The action set ups, shoot outs, spaceship dogfights and sabre duels are fantastically staged. The mix of new and old characters returning works and there's array of familiar faces and quality actors including Max von Sydow and hidden Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma. Well loved characters not just the likes of R2-D2, Han, Leia, Chewie and C-3PO but less known ones like Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb also return. As the rebels face another threat, bigger than the Deathstar it manages to remain engrossing and gritty.There's the emotional loss of a main character and Mark Hamill's screen time is fittingly limited which allows Ridley to shine throughout along with droid BB-8. Adam Driver's misguided Vader obsessed Kylo Ren is interesting. Overall, the young cast carry the beats you wanted and expected from a sequel to the original trilogy but it also excels as Abrams manages to fashion an atmosphere of his own while retaining the Star Wars feel and magic. The force is strong with this one. Highly recommended.",Null,8,42,17 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," More of the same with an emotional conclusion
","Legloas, Gimli, Gandalf, Aragorn and an army try to save humankind while Sam and Frodo move on to destroy the ring to stop the root of evil. Peter Jackson and company offer the same excellent standard of storytelling on screen. With the moving Howard Shore music score, high production values, real life locations and special effects to help bring Middle Earth to life. Gollum's treachery comes to pass. Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship continue fighting against immeasurable odds. There's more love and loss, tension and urgency in this final part. Jackson handles both the action and emotional drama with ease, in amongst the effects including the giant spider Shelob, dragon like creatures, spirits, trolls and orcs.With the extended The Return of the King we see how Sauroman dies and how Wormtongue meets his demise, there's extended battles and lots of little additions that like its predecessor enhance the journey rather than take anything away.Jackson offers many great moments in the third instalment even if it somewhat rehashes in terms of visuals the some of the Two Towers only with larger battles. We see how Deagol and subsequently Smeagol/Gollum gets the ring. There's the creepy cave of the dead where Aragorn and company face the ghosts of disgraced warriors. Frodo tangled in Shelob web is spine-chilling as the two Hobbits are assaulted by spider legs and fangs, there's also a disturbing encounter with various Orcs and Uruk-hai in Mordor reminiscent of Mary and Pippin's experience in Two Towers.The saga of 'The Lord of the Rings' is a perfect mix of action, adventure, with a slight hint of romance. And Return of the Kings brings it to a very emotional close.",Null,0,0,25 July 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Quintessential and defining horror
","Murdered serial killer Freddy Krueger appears in the teenagers of Elm Street dreams to exact revenge for their parents unlawful actions.Made in 1984, it's inevitably dated slightly - only loosing it's edge due to imitations and sequels, nevertheless, it still retains much of its eerie factor and many of the effects still hold up today. (That said, Freddy's long arms segment are just as tacky and odd as they were back then.) Heather Langenkamp's Nancy goes against the stereotype and look of usual damsels in distress lead and to director/writer Wes Craven's credit he's uses the Psycho (1963) casting ploy with Amanda Wyss as Tina. An unknown (at the time) Johnny Depp appears and veteran John Saxon give some weight to the film in an extended cameo, the rest of cast are above par for the stigmatized genre. Notable is Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson Nancy's alcoholic mother.There are many standout moments - the hand between Nancy's legs in the bath scene, the body bag in the corridor, the bloody ceiling and bed deaths, the shock ending and more, actually too many to mention. This coupled with Charles Bernstein's excellent and memorable score, sound design and creepy makeup effects is enough to deliver chills.A Nightmare on Elm Street is a quintessential and defining horror that made a star of Robert England sowed the seeds for Freddy's pop icon status.

There are some fantastic visuals on show,the special effects are exceptional and the music and sound design are excellent. Director Gareth Edwards creates some tension and atmosphere and successfully gives the much needed scope and scale to battle scared Godzilla when he is finally revealed midway through.The MUTO designs appear to unavoidably borrow elements from Starship Troopers; Star Wars Episode 2; Pacific Rim to name a few and the influx of creature films over the years slightly takes the edge off the spectacle. In addition, Godzilla's emotional functional storyline borrows a pivotal plot point from Gareth Edwards' own film Monsters (2010), which is odd considering Dave Callaham wrote this offering.All the actors are on fine form, Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston are notable. Effects aside the everyday detail is unprecedented, the Las Vegas, tsunami and battleship helm segments to name a few are meticulously created, the film feels very real at times in terms of look and background activity aided by the excellent sets and locations. The designed sequences of movements between the MUTOs and Godzilla in the showdown fights are choreographed and executed finely giving mass and character to the unidentified terrestrial organisms.Overall, a visual treat and apt Godzilla entertainment.",Null,2,5,22 May 2014

It was great to see my son watch it for the first time and no doubt his children will enjoy it too.The story is that dreamer Luke Skywalker must try to save Princess Leia from the evil clutches of Darth Vader. It could have been an awful b-movie but its strength is a great bold script, memorial characters, fantastic effects, costumes and John Williams timeless orchestral score. It has a princess, lasers, alien creatures, spaceships, and more. It's a good old fashioned tale of good versus evil and there really isn't much not to like.It has inspired filmmakers and has been parodied, imitated in numerous films, books and games.

The handful for writers inject something reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino with its sharp dialogue and flashy twist story telling. That said, everything political in Lee's 'Bloods is covered in depth in Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's 18-hour documentary series The Vietnam War (2017) or in bite size Platoon (1986).The cast are outstanding, with too many great performances to mention them all. Chadwick Boseman is subtle and pivotal Delroy Lindo is memorable and Jean Reno cameos.

Da 5 Bloods explores the consequences of the Vietnam War.

The Shimmer has the potential to swallow the entire planet.The cast are great, the special effects, the environment and animals which inhabit The Shimmer are impressive, however, Annihilation is pretty uneventful and feels padded out. 2001 (which it has been compared too) it certainly is not. Garland, a writer/director with a solid track record: 28 Days Later, Dredd and Ex Machina to name a few offers high production values, interesting visuals but subjectively speaking with only a 115 minutes run-time it feels ten times that and it's not a deep or as intellectual as mainstream reviews would make you believe. Three highs spring to mind after viewing Annihilation, two of these involve animal/creature attacks and thirdly it's female cast, we know they are female, yet they still unnecessary had to acknowledge their gender in the film's dialogue. The final sequence offers some thought provoking alternatives if you don't believe Kerans' account of the film's events. However, taken at face value it's all tied up neatly, that Karan has become something more and her husband is an alien. Either way Annihilation is one of those slow films that the mass audience is meant to like because they're told too.

Han Solo is still on the run from Bounty Hunters and him and Luke's friends are captured in order for Lord Vader to have his revenge.Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is faster paced, the special effects are further developed and it's more dramatic and dynamic. George Lucas was wise to hand over the directing reins to Irvin Kershner for the sequel to his hit Star Wars. Rather than copy Lucas - fewer cuts and wide old fashion, sweeping compositions, Kershner delivers a sharper edited more captivating film.Robot duo R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are back accompanied by the mighty Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew).

New face Billy Dee Williams is great as Lando Calrissian, Han's sleazy old friend.There's more aliens, monsters, planets and fantastic special effects. John Williams theme and unforgettable score flawlessly enhances the emotion of the film. Lucas' story has further strands and character development. There's a glimpse of the Emperor, the man behind Vader and Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) leaves an impact (unsurprisingly becoming a cult Star Wars character).Cleverly producers leave you with one, if not the best cliff hanger endings of all time which keeps you on tender hooks in anticipation for Return of the Jedi.A fantastic darker follow up which surpasses the original in emotion and technique.",Null,0,1,7 October 2010

","With the 00 initiative under threat and a MI5 and MI6 merge imminent infamous spy James Bond uncompromisingly goes out of his way to bring down a sinister organization which links to his past.Fittingly with the infamous gun barrel piece Daniel Craig is back as James Bond and finally criminal organization Spectre (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, S.P.E.C.T.R.E the acronym now gone) returns to the franchise. Opening with excellent tracking shots of the Mexican Día de Muertos festival and amazing stunt-work Sam Mendes' second Bond directing effort looks absolutely remarkable. Locations include Tangiers, Morocco, London and Austria to name a few which are captured beautifully, compliments to Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography. There's countless nods to previous instalments, during an intense train fight Craig's Bond tries a familiar Sean Connery/Roger Moore kick which is amusingly foiled by Mr. Hinx notably played by Dave Bautista. All the trademarks and tropes of Bond are present. There's a twist on the ejector seat, here Bond himself is ejected from an Aston Martin. M, Moneypenny, Q, locations, women, shoot outs and chases. There also a good scene where Q is out in the field echoing A Licence to Kill and CIA agent Felix Leiter is given a passing mention. At times Craig retains the steely licence to kill (or not to kill as pointed out) with precision, but these are fleeting. Even when demonstrating he is a hardened assassin and lover, picking up machines guns, flying planes and getting the ladies - here Craig at times looks bored rather than nonchalant cool.This Bond has one of the more interesting stories which connects all of Craig's previous 007 outings with past prominent characters being featured in the opening credits, later on posters and computer screens. Jesper Christensen returns as Mr. White (now thallium poisoned) and Judy Denche's M also makes an appearance from the grave. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris do a great job bringing the iconic supporting characters to life and Ben Whishaw simply shines as Q. Christoph Waltz is fantastic as Oberhauser a.k.a Ernst Stavro Blofeld but is sorely underused with limited screen time. We're also treated to a re-imagining of how Blofeld gets his scar and leg injuries. Possibly due to the script or Lee Smith's editing lead Léa Seydoux's Madeleine Swann is a little uneven (notably during the argument with Bond in the snow) but you can't fail to warm to her by the closing act. Although a long-time in coming Italian actress Monica Bellucci makes a limited appearance as a Bond Girl, better late than never. Bellucci is memorable in her limited role. Andrew Scott has good screen presence as C but from the outset anyone familiar with Scott's work will have a good inclination of one of the twist to come. Moreover so does Bond who gives a throwaway line that he knew of C's intentions all along, which makes the experience quite redundant. There's unorthodox quandaries littered throughout. During the synonymous pre-credit sequence there's a lapse in logic as Bond relentlessly and unnecessarily attacks a helicopter pilot while exchanging blows with the passenger. The soap opera Blofeld connection to Bond twist is bitter sweet. Mendes seems focused on creating Casablanca artistry rather than pace and inexplicably tries to shoehorn David Lean and Merchant & Ivory- like aesthetics into a franchise that's by default visually jam- packed. Also the fistful of writers lose some of the humanity, its inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its story potential. Lacking are character nuances that date as far back as Dr. No, basic spy techniques. Also here he's super-Bond.Herein lies the issue with SPECTRE, while the Bourne-like plot is exceedingly intriguing (it has one of the best Bond narratives) and every frame looks unnecessary breathtaking, the dialogue and repressive action doesn't really flow, for whatever reason SPECTRE is arguably pretentious at times and comes across stilted. In terms of breaking free from the much loved Moore, Brosnan formulaic Bond, Spectre successfully continues the appealing new wave thriller style while paying homage to its predecessors but adjusted for a contemporary audience Mendes' latest 007 addition slightly backslides when compared to Skyfall. Even with Craig's carte blanche co- producer control, as a movie going experience, this debatably maybe his weakest jaunt as Bond, James Bond but is still entertaining.",Null,2,8,12 November 2015
Moon," Bowie should be over the 'Moon'
","David Bowie's son directs his debut film. Duncan Jones comes out of his fathers' shadow and into his own in this low-key sci-fi which is destined to become a classic.The style is without a doubt influenced by Silent Running and 2001: A Space Odyssey. You could argue that there is also a hint of Gattaca in there, but this does not detract from the strong emotional story line. Sam Rockwell's subtle and edgy performance is Oscar worthy, as to are the effects. As Duncan Jones first film it certainly doesn't show, it screams traditional in the modern sense of film-making. Kevin Spacey voices the robot GERTY, his smooth tones and look are reminiscent of 2001's HAL and his monotone voice adds tension.The film is not an action; Moon is a well-rounded package, almost pure sci-fi, and thought provoking playing out a believable premise. It's a tighter 2001 for a 2009 audience, compulsive viewing.",Null,1,3,10 December 2009
The Nice Guys," Plenty of adult action and fun
","Fate turns Holland March, a down-on-his-luck private eye and Jackson Healy, a hired enforcer into unlikely partners when a woman mysteriously disappears.Filmmaker Shane Black - writer of Lethal Weapon, Predator and director of Iron Man 3 offers a dark comedy with a Chinatown-like detective story. The Nice Guys is set in 1977 on an LA sleazy vibe back drop which is convincingly recreated, topped off with the music of the time.With their own reasons for getting involved the duo team up to achieve one shared goal both reliant on each other's different skills. It's a different era of wild celebrity disco parties, cigarette smoking and lenient police involvement, allowing unlikely partnership of drunkard PI Holland (Ryan Gosling) and Jackson (Russell Crowe) paid hard man to go about their business. What's interesting and surprisingly works is Holland's young teen daughter (Angourie Rice) who helps her dad and dicey new partner as they investigate the murder of a porn star, Misty Mountains and its mysterious link to environmentalist wild-child Amelia (Margaret Qualley) and politically connected mother, Judith (Kim Basinger). It feels likes it's all shot on location, the period setting is at times the star of show, injecting plenty of atmosphere and mood, the cars, the fashion etc. The supporting cast a great, notable are the excellent Matt Bomer (White Collar, American Horror Story Hotel) who plays a professional hit man and thug Keith David (The Thing, They Live) who want Amelia dead. Black offers corruption, some surprise deaths and twists but it's a comedy at heart. Gosling and Crowe are kind of 70s version of Laurel and Hardy, yelping and mumbling through scenes. Their chemistry is great, it's an interesting and brilliant casting with the leads displaying a naturally comedic zaniness along with Crowe adding a believability that he can bust heads.Thankfully Black and writer Anthony Bagarozzi create enough back- story for Holland and Jackson to ensure your buy into the characters' plights as they work through clues looking like Starsky and Hutch in Boogie Nights. Both Gosling and Crowe somehow feel they belong to the period. Rice equals Leon's Natalie Portman in terms of a young girl being in an improbable adult world. Gosling is disinclined to being a good dad, in contrast to Crowe's deadpan character wanting to be liked and you find yourself rooting for the at times unsavoury characters. With its period setting, some hard hitting action and taboo comedy there's plenty of entertainment to be had, recommended.",Null,3,7,13 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," More than just another action film
","Set in a future desert wasteland a woman is hunted down after smuggling out five wives of a cult leader who have been specially selected for breeding aided by a caged slave who is being used as a blood donor.Without drawing comparisons to Gibson and George Miller's previous three Mad Max outings and the countless cash-in Italian films it spawned what's clear from the get go is that with some great camera work Miller knows how to give a film a contemporary look and feel while retaining a Mad Max vibe.Mad Max Fury Road looks absolutely gorgeous, with sweeping shots of deserts, fitting costumes, great make up, sets and vehicle designs. The sub character are likable and the unlikely alliances formed are interesting. Even though the dialogue is limited there is never a dull moment with some fresh, original, dare I say unique action setups. With people leaping from one car to another using poles reminiscent of giant dune buggy aerials to name just one. It's one long road trip in a strange, post-apocalyptic world from start to finish with branding, skin tattoos, siren like females and a combination flamethrower/guitarist on a bungee to name a few. Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris' basic screenplay has plenty of surprises and it tries to move away from the paint by numbers actioner that have flooded the screens for an age. The acting is solid, Charlize Theron has fantastic presence as the one armed Furiosa, lacking any levity which gives credence to the character who is trying to help a group of women (including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) escape for a better life.Tom Hardy is on fine form as the dream and nightmare vision afflicted Max but is on a equal footing with Theron in terms of screen time as they face danger together throughout against rival nomads and the memorable cult leader Joe played menacingly by Keays-Byrne. Nicholas Hoult Nux leaves an impression and characters develop and refreshingly change alliances. Even the eccentric characters and over the top stunts, gun-play and explosions feel grounded because you buy into the world where gasoline and water are scarce.Its not glossy like the Jurassic World nor Terminator Genesys, Fury Road is dusty, gritty, surreal in places, visually impressive entertainment, perfectly executed and more than just another action movie.",Null,3,8,22 May 2015
Warcraft," It's like your mate put the magic back into fantasy
","Azeroth stands on the brink of war, the leader of the humans and the leader of the orcs are then sent on a collision course that will decide the fate of their people.There is a honesty and truthfulness that comes with a Duncan Jones film, from having a famous father (a true legend) Jones broke convention not becoming one of those superficial celebs making a living in the shadow of a parent. I know very little if any thing about Warcraft, I know it's big and I know it's a fantasy role playing game so I'm not going to pretend I know more than that.Warcraft with all the whizz bang jiggery pokery, beneath the sweeping shots and special effects there is a heart felt tale about parenting and loss. What Jones' offering has is that Moon, Source Code humanity which Jones effortlessly brings to the table, that roundness and grounded feel that he stamps on his films. The script has an honesty that it's not just some money making studio movie but an indie-spirited film finely crafted on a large scale. You feel your mate made this great spectacle, there's an underlying apprehensive innocence in contrast to a sense of wonder and adventure. Warcraft seemingly feels that he isn't in it for the money, but for the story telling and artistic craft of it all.Unusually the subtitle 'The Beginning' was absent on the title screen in the cinema version, it simply says 'Warcraft' possibly linked to the rating. While available for all to see with an adult, the battles are intense, stabbings etc. it not just the scary demon and skeletal faces that will scare the young kids but the emotional impact of orc Durotan (CGI capture Tony Kebbell) wife and child storyline. As Orc clan honour is tested, there are duelling wizards, a giant golem and griffin. Jones also briefly throws in a few elves, dwarfs and huge wolves for good measure. There's betrayal, double-crossing and retribution, the powerful magical Orc, Gul'dan (the excellent Daniel Wu) literary sucks the life of humans akin to The Dark Crystal.The casting is not mainstream, Ben Foster's wizard Medivh avoids stereotype and is a young incarnation of a wizard, as is Llane (Dominic Cooper) a younger than expected King. Battle hard human Lothar Travis Fimmel (of Amazon's Vikings) as well as some grand action scenes, emotional set ups (one echoing the Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan showdown) he also gets comedic moments, many alongside wizard/mage apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) who again is not what you'd expect for someone so powerful. This casting works in Warcraft's favour, if you had a thing for blue women Smurfette, Neytiri and Mystique, Stark Trek olive and She-Hulk green is the new in colour with Garona Halforcen. Fittingly cast is memorable underrated Clancy Brown (of Highlander fame) as the principled conflicted Blackhand, Gul'dan's right-hand orc.The daytime colour is bright and vivid in contrast to the pin sharp night time and darker scenes, Warcraft has a unique look and feel. The execution is near on perfect in the confines of the budget and today's capabilities with brutal sword play and battles. The director is wise to keep the focus on the interesting characters and themes of conflict, family and loyalty with Ramin Djawadi ominous score adding to the proceedings. Warriors, Kings, magicians and creatures, the human cast and the CGI performers melt together and you invest in the characters and their secret meetings and campsite confessions. The computer imagery, textured layers of animation and 3D modeling fuse with the mix of practical stunts and sets. Fimmel and Kebbell are notable but Paula Patton as hardened Garona steals the show as a go between peace keeper and will no doubt set geek hearts aflame. Writers Jones, Charles Leavitt and Chris Metzen juggle the many major characters successfully and the cast deliver the fantasy dialogue with ease.Jones and crew give us the Matrix of fantasy, lots of things will be familiar not just reminiscent because of Lord of the Rings, Dungeon and Dragons, Fire and Ice, Planet of the Apes, John Carter to name a few. But because of an inherent subconscious of the genre that's in the ether and part of our pop culture. But like the stylised Matrix did for sci-fi (as much as I hate to admit it) after the dust settled it stood on its own feet and was a milestone in film. As a 70'd kid Warcraft for me puts magic back in the mix instead of it languishing in low budget TV shows, a soulless blockbusters or sub-par cash-ins, here Jones takes it to a fitting level where it should be and cleverly sets up a follow up.There's unavoidable rooted fantasy tropes littered throughout and Jones injects a little nuance or twist wherever possible. As a sci-fi fantasy, medieval-ish action saga Warcraft is highly recommend.",Null,4,6,14 June 2016
Gladiator," Gladiatorial coup de grace - moving and exciting
","Despite it's historical inaccuracies Gladiator without a doubt deserves it's 5 Oscars. The story follows Maximus, a Roman general who's family is murdered after he is betrayed and left for dead. While the story echoes The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Gladiator's revenge theme is far more ambitious and poignant.Meticulous portraying the social and political issues of the time, proved director Ridley Scott, utilising David Franzoni story and screenplay, single handily brings back the sword and sandal epic that prompted a flurry of copycat films. The opening scene is astounding, the fights are incredibly choreographed, however, Gladiator is far from perfect, let down by a variety of CGI shots, the lack of grandeur that other epics have and several hollow palace scenes. That said, Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer score is exciting, emotionally moving as much as the actor's performances.Thankfully, Mel Gibson turned down the part of Maximus that Russell Crowe portrays with such conviction and energy. Even though it was Oliver Reed's last great performance and one of Richard Harris finest, as Marcus Aurelius, the new comers hold their own and are just as effective. Juaquin Phoenix. Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi and supporting actors are perfectly cast. Aside from the magnificent sets and locations to the cast credit it's the ability to render the viewers concern for these characters is what separates Gladiator from being an run of the mill flick.It's no masterpiece but far from a gladiatorial coup de grace. Scott's compelling Gladiator is impressive, moving and exciting.",Null,1,3,5 August 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transforming in the right direction
","A mysterious event from Earth's past at the time of the moon-race is kept from the Autobots.  It's a secret that now threatens to bring a war to Earth and the Transformers may not be able to save us.The special effects have certainly been honed in this third instalment, it appears that with the right amount of money and talent you can achieve anything on screen. The action and locations are visually fantastic with great sound effects and music to match. The storyline is engaging especially for a film based on a Saturday morning cartoon made to push toys. John Malkovich has a great time in a lengthy strange cameo (that didn't need an actor of his calibre) as Sam's boss but he's enjoyable in every scene and a welcome surprise. Megan Fox's replacement model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a fine addition, with a natural striking, quirky look. And while not a veteran actress she's more than adequate as the love interest. Josh Duhamel, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson return. Both Patrick Dempsey and Shia LaBeouf are on form with the Witwicky character given a little more development and purpose. Sam's toilet encounter aside there's less forced humour in this instalment and at times some of the robot attacks are violent, possibly be fitting of a Terminator movie.  Most notable robot characters are present. Key voice Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is back, and oddly the leader against his traits remorselessly goes 'postal' in the closing act. Leonard Nimoy voices Sentinel Prime who gets much of the dialogue and is the most interesting of the robot characters development wise. It's a pity that like the previous two films this one also lacks the rapport between the robot characters that the cartoon captured so well. It's a missed opportunity, there's little interaction between Starscream and Megatron (Hugo Weaving who is given little to do) and the Autobot's shenanigans, bouncing off each-other and camaraderie is missing.It must be a blast for the new generation but for those who grew up with Transformers it still fails to capture or match the original magic. That said, it moves one step closer in the right direction. Michael Bay puts every buck on the screen with great compositions and flair. It's loud, it's spectacular and debatably the most satisfying, balanced and rounded of the three.Considering its origin (based on a series of cartoon and toys) it's solid entertainment which is being overly analysed and unfairly panned.",Null,0,4,9 July 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Globe trotting adventure classic
","Dumping the set-like feel of Temple of Doom and going for location shoot of Raiders Steven Spielberg's vision looks fantastic. There's no denying that some of the effects have dated and Jeffrey Boam's script a little heavy on the comedy, but George Lucas and Menno Meyjes story is exciting and intricate. In this quest Indiana Jones must rescue his kidnapped father and stop the Nazis that are in search of the Holy Grail.Although a little forced the cute flash back opening has exciting gusto as you see the influences on young Indy (played by River Phoenix) that turned him into Indiana the man.The casting is note worthy, Alison Doody as Dr. Elsa Schneider is wonderful, playing the perfect Austrian (even though she's Irish). Harrison Ford is once again flawless in the title role, a part that he was made for. Sean Connery is exceptional as Indy's father and familiar faces return including John Rhys-Davies' Sallah and Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody. My only complaint is that Brody's character is far more comical than he comes across in the first adventure.With John Williams familiar fantastic score, coupled with globe trotting adventure and action set pieces galore, Last Crusade is an exciting must see classic.",Null,3,5,6 October 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne again - the perfect sequel.
","In this action packed follow up Bourne is framed and is forced to take up his former life as an assassin to survive. The Bourne Supremacy is a gutsy squeal to The Bourne Identity (2002) using the character based on an adaptation of Robert Ludlum's best selling novelPaul Greengrass takes over the directing reins for Supremacy, while previous director Doug Liman's takes a producer credit. Greengrass maybe a little over zealous with the hand-held camera work, but continues the series more than effectively, successfully injecting some more energy into proceedings. In some ways the story is more interesting and complex than the first, again Tony Gilroy 's amazing screenplay avoids the clichés, dishing-out plenty of surprises and a major plot turning in the first minutes.Brian Cox reprises his role as Ward Abbott and his character goes though some changes as the predicament and pressure he's under increases. Like Identity there's some fantastic fight choreography notably when Bourne, again played fittingly by Matt Damon, goes head to head with Jarda played by the understated excellent actor Marton Csokas. Julia Stiles returns as Nicky and new comer to the Bourne series Joan Allen as Pamela Landy is convincing. The cast are all first-rate including, Karl Urban of Star Trek and The Two Towers fame, as the Russian killer Kirill.The ending leaves an upbeat intrigue that few films of this genre manage to stir. The Bourne Supremacy has a great look and again benefits from the real on location feel coupled with a complimenting score by John Powell, which leaves you wanting more of the same.It's intelligent and captivating, packed with car chases, assassins and political conspiracy. Damon again is Bourne this time deeper and more dangerous. The perfect sequel.",Null,1,2,16 August 2010
Jurassic Park," A benchmark but I prefer the third.
","Genetically engineered dinosaurs run amok in their own theme park when the power to their enclosures is sabotaged allowing them to escape.In 1993 after queueing forever I watched the much hyped film and left the cinema unfulfilled, I still feel the same way. The effects still hold up well, although the seams between C.G.I, animatronics and puppets are even more apparent it was a mile stone.  Although Michael Crichton's book wasn't fully realised Steven Spielberg's film adaptation has some fantastic set pieces, notably the T-Rex attack, raptor kitchen action and closing finale. Sadly, even though superior in scope it's not as balanced as West World,the in between segments feel like gap fillers and the characters are given little, albeit some witty dialogue, usually from the most developed character Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum others are are wasted. Laura Dern is good but the script let's her down at times making her unnecessary dated feminist fodder. Sam Neill is on form but is given some cringe-worthy dialogue usually involving the kids.  The supporting cast are fine, even the child actors are likable and superb. Samuel L. Jackson Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck are solid and Wayne Knight as crook Dennis Nerdy is memorable. Nevertheless, characters fleet in and out, either killed or never seen again. There are a too many cliffhangers and throw away gags. Events appear as just that, events and it doesn't flow as well as it should. In addition, the editing doesn't compliment the earlier action or the dialogue scenes as much as in the later half. Too much happens off screen and I don't just mean the dinosaur shenanigans.    John Williams score is simply wonderful, and the location feel gives it a unique atmosphere. Even with a lack of blood and an archetype hero to root for Jurassic Park still manages to thrill but these magic moments are few and far between compared to Spielberg's other works. An entertaining benchmark in effects history but as a dino-bite of cinema but I prefer the flow of Joe Johnson's third instalment.",Null,0,2,1 May 2011
Alien: Covenant," Flawed with some excellent special effects
","On the far side of the galaxy the colony spaceship USCSS Covenant takes a detour and discovers horrors on an uncharted planet.Opening with a flashback of David being activated by Peter Weyland we are treated to an Alien-style title sequence. After a shocking neutrino burst opening we are then introduced to the characters brought abruptly out of hyper-sleep by Walter a synthetic model. Soon the crew land on a planet and after a series of hostile events meet David, a survivor of the Prometheus mission. David and Walter (Michael Fassbender in dual roles) are put centre stage. To Ridley Scott's special effects team credit the androids are exceptional and you never question the illusion of the two characters being on screen at once. Whereas Prometheus felt somewhat innovative and charted a different direction to the Alien series if you are a fan be warned, Covenant takes a step back with the Engineers and Shaw's story thread ending abruptly. Aside from Guy Pearce's Weyland's cameo, ties from Prometheus are broken and even Noomi Rapace's Shaw who appeared in Covenant's promotions is substantially cut in the final film. This is in place of a standard three act Alien affair, without the suspense of Alien but all the brashness of Aliens, still director Scott's moody, thoughtful style shines here. Naturally the aesthetics, cinematography, production design are of Scott's high standards and Covenant moves at breakneck speed, from ship, to planet, back to ship à la Alien format borrowing also from Aliens and his own Prometheus and even a line from Blade Runner. In addition, Jed Kurzel's soundtrack takes all the best cues from Jerry Goldsmith's 1979 Alien score and hones a reminiscent hybrid of sorts.Lead Katherine Waterston's Daniels (terrible hair cut aside), does her best with what she's given. James Franco appears briefly and like Rapace his part aside from body and video footage is left promo material hell. Waterston offers enough emotion to keep Franco's Branson spirit alive throughout and you buy into her loss. Logical straight talking Callie Hernandez's Upworth is notable along with Billy Crudup's to the book Oram and Demián Bichir's tough solider Lope is memorable. Fassbender's dual performance is excellent. However, he unjustly steals the show and his position of prominence takes away what made (certainly David) so interesting as a secondary character in Covenant's predecessor.The various looking aliens on display are highly aggressive from the outset. The Alien effects are first rate and the introduction to a H. R. Giger style creepy white Neomorph alien (born from spores that grow inside you into a Neomorph Bloodburster) gives Pan's Labyrinth chills. Nevertheless, there's not enough suspense or stalking from the aliens, but plenty of running around. It felt like too many CGI beast shots and not enough practical effects. However, when the Neomorph stood upright in front of David it was quite impressive. When the traditional albeit upgraded version of the Alien turns up it's a joy. There's a missed opportunity to face off the old Xenomorphs Alien with the new Neomorph. Or even solely focus on the Neomorph as there is some interesting communication between David and the Aliens that is never fully explored. There's also the thread that David may or may not have gone stir crazy due to his humanistic characterisations. (Incidentally, the novelisation through various passages and additional dialogue fill in the blanks, e.g. why they leave the landing ship without helmets, what happens to the other Neomorph, Shaw's cross necklace and many more, it's a shame these moments were either not filmed or cut.) When things go pear shaped there's plenty of blood and gore, the alien eggs, Chestburster and Facehuggers are finely tuned for screen, Scott also throws in fighting androids and Aliens-like shoot outs - there's plenty to like about Covenant. Waterston along with Danny McBride's pilot Tennessee look comfortable going head to head with the pesky Alien, even if it all feels somewhat rehashed and rushed. However, die-hard Alien fan's will have to buy into facehugger embryos (?!), David creating eggs and incubation times. Your suspension of disbelief is stretched notably when Daniel's hangs from a line on top of a ship which is flying erraticly. This is topped of by handful of writers who offer a frustrating ending which teases another follow up.Overall, Scott plays it safe and delivers a sci-fi horror with a typical series of action setups that is basically there to appease action fans rather than create suspense which was the originals finest quality.",Null,12,22,23 May 2017
The Martian," Tense, humorous and visually rich
","Thought to be dead an astronaut botanist has to live in the dangerous conditions of Mars, relying on his ingenuity to survive until the next mission arrives.Matt Damon doesn't understand why he was reduced to only saying his name in Team America, maybe it's because the makers were being ironic, never more so in The Martian is this highlighted. Under director Ridley Scott's auteur eye Damon shines here as Watney in Drew Goddard's adaptation of Andy Weir's novel. It's tense, humorous and visually rich including planets, Martian landscapes, space crafts and NASA control rooms. It's also smart and thrillingly realistic as they plan rescue attempts and Damon hones Robinson Crusoe on Mars, Grativy, Apollo 13 and the like. The sets, props, costumes and special effects CGI for the most part are excellent the locations both on Earth and the red planet really sell it.The acting is aided by Goddard's credible script. Both Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig are notable here in serious roles. Memorable are Sean Bean as Mitch - a mission director, Benedict Wong plays Bruce Ng an engineer of the rockets for the rescue mission and Chiwetel Ejiofor is Vincent, a director and the first person to establish contact with Watney. There plenty of disco tracks as that's all Watney has to listen to, but Harry Gregson-Williams' Martian score is solid. Watney's uses all his skills an intellect, stapling a wound, he rations food and grows his own in seemingly impossible conditions and uses different NASA equipment to aid him. Damon's Watney at times is very witty and you warm to dryness and invest in his survival, rooting for him in his highs and lows. Back on Earth Scott offers digestible politics and PR but there's a positive aspect with countries, individuals and departments working together with each other.Goddard and Weir's offering doesn't contain any sci-fi metaphysical and/or horror tropes with The Martians realism and by default Scott remains focused on a humane elements and visual effects never delving into what made him a household name. It's about human beings tackling problems and the exploration of Mars' barren environment and like similar space disaster movies there's plenty of emotion, even with its long running time it moves along at pace.Overall, if red planet sandstorms, potato growing and space travel is your thing, it's a must.",Null,2,3,31 July 2016

","The team return to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes. Meanwhile, a rogue special forces assassin swears to avenge his comatose younger brother.To the series credit since Fast & Furious (2009) the instalments have been very entertaining and more accommodating to the general film goer, Furious 7 is no exception. With a fairly coherent story, plenty of emotions and fantastic stunts this one excels in entertainments value department. Unnecessary gratuitous bikini and butt shots aside James Wan's offering knows what it is (like Jurassic World and Max Mad: Fury Road) and is finely tuned and stays true to its characters and previous outings (unlike the recent Terminator Genisys).The cast are great, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw, a rogue special forces assassin and Dwayne Johnson are on form. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez look somewhat exhausted possibly in keeping with their character plight or age catching up with them. That said, they all deliver solid performances especially Vin Diesel. Kurt Russell is a first-class addition as the leader of a covert ops team.With Brian Tyler's underpinning score the action scenes especially the fight scenes are fantastically choreographed and the car chases are finely executed, despite a CGI drone chase which becomes a little repetitive. The on location shoot delivers plenty of visual treats notably the breath taking Abu Dhabi segment. The closing scenes really pull at the heart strings given Paul Walker's tragic death. Those involved should be proud ensuring his last performance was complete with a combination of CGI, clever camera angles, lighting and using Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody to simulate his appearance.Packed with fresh over-the-top thrills it's a highly recommended action film.",Null,1,16,2 September 2015

The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see.",Null,3,4,19 March 2010
