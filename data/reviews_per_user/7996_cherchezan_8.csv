Blade Runner 2049," Loved it, a pleasant surprise
","I feel the bar has been set so low these days, I find most of the action movies coming out to be complete garbage. I'm thinking here about all the heroes movies, transformers and the likes who are just bland and pointless with stories that are getting more and more ridiculous. I am also a huge Star Wars fan and I think what they are doing now with the two new movies is taking a huge dump all over the Star Wars universe and everything about it and while watching Blade Runner I couldn't help but wonder why did Star Wars get stuck with the village idiots and while other movies can have this amazing of a sequel so many years later.The movie is wonderful visually, making a seamless transition from the 80's movie to the new one, they blend perfectly. The story is good and it has a lot of little details and cool things if you are careful to look for them. I was actually looking at the snow flakes towards the end and I was wondering if they were going to be fake looking like they always to din movies and I had the pleasant surprise to see that the ones that landed on Gosling were melting after a second or two. But there are a lot of fun little things like that, I might rewatch it just to catch more of them. The love scene with the AI is one of the coolest things I've seen in a long time and there are other thought provoking ideas.The main character is a little dry and you don't quite bond with him like you should which is the only main flaw of this movie, however, because of what the character represents, making him more humane would have probably lost some of the feel of the movie.Overall I am impressed, haven't liked a movie this much in a while, I've been constantly disappointed, especially by the two pieces of garbage that are the new Star Wars movies but this one proved to be a winner.",10,0,3,16 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," They killed Star Wars
","The way this new trilogy butchers Star Wars is something that amazed me more and more as I watched each new piece of garbage that came out. The force awakens was bad, it ruined Han Solo and it just seemed to be heading the wrong way, however, there was still some hope left, It didn't kill Star Wars. The second piece of garbage, the last jedi, pretty much was unwatchable. First time it was fine because of all the special effects but the more time passed the more the plot hits you with every little piece of crap detail and idiotic story, characters that are not the same as in the old movies and just the whole mess that movie is... By the end it seemed like there was nothing that could be worse that could follow, or that could fix it. Well, I guess it was a 'challenge accepted'moment because oh, it got worse. This last one is just a mess, totally incoherent and all over the place and completely takes a massive crap on the old trilogy. The emperor is now back (are u f'n kiddin me?), nothing matters anymore, the whole action of episode 6 is worthless, as is Darth Vaders' sacrifice and redemption. The whole thing is just stupid, it's idiotic, oh my God, why did they have to do this to the greatest movie of our childhood? why did they set out to ruin it? why? how does this movie have more than a 5 as a rating? ok, I get it, if you don't know the old story and you are all into special effects and would watch anything just to waste some time, sure, this is great, good special effects, fun to watch, although dumb and incoherent, but as a star wars fan you should be appalled... I will never consider this new crap to be Star Wars, it just seems like a bad dream. Do not buy their merchandise and do not go see anymore of the movies, they deserve to be boycotted. Money is the only thing they understand.",3,9,16,4 February 2020
Bird Box," they are sure running out of ideas at Hollywood
","First of all, is it just me or is Sandra Bullock looking more and more like Michael Jackson as she ages?Ok, now to the movie, this movie just felt like a similarly (although a little more) stupid yet somewhat different version of the movie where people never farted for a couple of years or whatever - A Quiet Place.I am a huge end of the world movie fan, make a movie about the apocalypse and I'll watch it, but lately these movies are just getting stupider and stupider. I don't wanna get into spoilers but the whole premise is just silly, even for a science fiction fan that will watch just about anything sci-fi this felt stupid.I would skip this one...",3,2,3,5 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Liked it, pretty good, keeps you tense, however, doesn't anyone fart in this world?
","I was wondering the whole movie, seriously, doesn't anyone fart? doesn't anyone snore? wtf, there is no way you can be that quiet. It was fun to watch but doesn't make that much sense, however decent, they did a great job with what they had, if you like end of the world movies this is pretty good.",7,0,1,16 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," So I watched this movie a second time and it gets worse every time
","I am literally amazed at all the idiotic things I discover in this movie. Oh my God this movie is stupid and makes no sense. Why has this movie series been cursed like this? They took a massive dump on Luke Skywalker's character but oh my god.... oh my god... just horrendous.... I am seriously consider not watching any of the new movies anymore... The force awakens took Leia and Han's story and threw it in the toilet, then took Han Solo and threw him in the toilet, from the commander of the rebellion transforming him into a lowlife... now this movie finishes the job by taking Luke's character and completely destroying him... they even take Yoda and take a massive dump on him as well... this movie is just.... Christ allmighty....",2,28,39,26 May 2018
The Shape of Water," A beautiful movie visually that is full of plot holes
","The movie is a pleasure to look at. The artwork and sound is gorgeous for the most part. It starts off great but then it just... I don't know... seems to become a little silly. It's riddled with plot wholes which, granted, can be overlooked since it's basically about the beauty of it and the fantasy but still, the part where she waited for the rain to fill the canal before she released him... seriously? you couldn't just dump him straight in the ocean? or the wooden bathroom door holding a room full of water... and all kinds of little things like that, which look decent but could have been done way better... couldn't they have had a water tank on the roof or maybe a pool in the basement or something where they could sneak in? I mean... you filled up the bathroom with water from the faucet? that is just lazy writing... Overall a good watch, maybe to watch with you special other but those little mistakes take away from it...",6,5,10,10 March 2018
It Chapter Two," Really boring with little to no plot
","I have not wanted to walk out of a movie so badly in a long time. For the first half I was waiting for the movie to get good, or scary. It never did either. For the second half I pretty much figured that it won't improve much and I was just bored out of my mind waiting for it to end.Half the movie is about how they evolved and their personal fears and whatnot, you barely see Pennywise throughout the movie. You mostly see him at the end and somehow, even though he's humongous he manages to be outrun, he never follows them for a very long time, just a very dumb villain, he was not scary at all. He had a couple of great moments but they were way too few and far between.The cast was actually pretty good, they did some great casting decision, the older version of the characters actually look like they are those kids grown up for the most part. A few of them I think were amazing choices and the acting was solid. the special effects looked great to the point where the CGI was close to perfection in my opinion, except for a few moments, but overall it didn't feel obvious and forced (except for the old woman part).So a massive fain in my opinion, very bland, unexciting and plain boring. Ok to watch on your computer 10-15 minutes at a time, in the background while eating breakfast or something. Definitely not worth the money to go see it in a cinema.",3,2,3,16 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Very disappointed
","This movie is a mix of a lot of things. It's probably a lot of fun if you are watching it without having watched the old movies or without being an actual fan of the Star Wars universe. The special effects I found to be very good, having watched it in IMAX 3d I gotta say it was an awesome viewing experience. That's about all that's good about it. It is entertaining. On the other hand there is so much that's bad with it, oh my God. To begin with, it doesn't feel like Star Wars. It's action scenes feel very different, like it's a totally different movie. The locations, everything just feels like a different sci-fi movie... The character development is just awful, or rather, nonexistent. Fin is just a coward basically who is ridiculously friendly judging by the fact that everyone he meets becomes his best friend right away. He just doesn't feel like he belongs there in any way and really is placed there just for diversity purposes. Han Solo and Chewbacca enter the scene out of nowhere, makes absolutely 0 sense that they would just happen to pass by, and then the gangsters they owe money to just happen to show up, making it clear that even though he was a general in the old movies he is now just a loser and a scoundrel again.... and then the way he is killed off, I mean, Han Solo was one of the main characters that made the originals amazing and I fell like they just completely disrespected the character. The chemistry between him and Leia is gone, he is just this eager to please old fella who instantly makes friends with everyone, it's just stupid. Everyone is making friends. The bad guy is a teenager with anger issues and a crap personality, the son of two of the most beloved characters in the trilogy is a spoiled brat who can barely kill a guy that just picked up a lightsaber and has no force powers or training whatsoever and gets his ass handed to him by a girl who also never picked up a lightsaber before, I mean, how much of a loser is this guy? The new emperor is CGI and looks like Golum... what else, the new empire is a ripoff of North Korea, with the winter scene and 'supreme leader'... The story is the exact remake of episode IV, it even has a new Death Star... it's just altogether bad. The script is filled with lines that are supposed to make you nostalgic but they just feel forced.... The jokes are not funny at all... it's just bad... bad... bad... Entertaining to watch but that's about it, bad story, unoriginal, bad script and also does away with a lot of the books and games that happen in the expanded universe, basically making all of them non canon and ruining them... a movie made to sell toys....",2,14,20,23 December 2015
