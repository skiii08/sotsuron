Deepwater Horizon," Edge of the seat !!
","I watch Deep Water Horizon the other night ! Wow!!!!! Let me tell you as a wife of a man that works in the oil field but has worked off shore on those off shore rigs too many times back when he first started! Ugh.. OMG.. let me just say this movie had me on the edge of my seat, my stomach in knots, and literally sick to my stomach and in tears at times, because I knew one it was a true story and secondly I knew that could've been my hubby or one of my family members whom had been out there many times in the past! The actor's did an amazing jobs. The action was too real it was scary too real. The movie is worth watching graphics seem so amazing and real like you're almost there with the crew!",8,0,0,3 November 2016
