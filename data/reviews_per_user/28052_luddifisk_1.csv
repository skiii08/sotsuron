The Ring," Did I watch the same movie?
","The reviews I read said that this was the most frightening movies ever made, that people couldn't sleep without the lights on. After watching this I wondered if I had rented the same movie. The scary parts never appeared. The makeup by Rick Baker was good, from what little was shown,and the girl coming from the TV was good. But scary, I think not. If you want to really be scared watch The Exorcist alone in the dark.",Null,0,1,9 March 2003
