The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Worst Film I have ever seen!
","I really could not wait to see this film,as I had previously enjoyed the others. I cannot believe the film was so boring and pathetic.It was totally unlike the others and I couldn't wait for it to end!Would not advise you waste your time! I kept on hoping it would get better, but unfortunately it was on a downhill spiral.It had just started to peak ever so slightly towards the end when there was minor action, then it came to a very abrupt end! typical! I'm not sure I will see the others now. if I do ever bother to, I hope that they are not like this one!",1,5,7,23 December 2012
