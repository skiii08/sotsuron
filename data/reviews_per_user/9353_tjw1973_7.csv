Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better after multiple viewings
","I have to say that the movie has gotten much better after seeing it multiple times in the theater and now on Widescreen VHS (Though it really deserves DVD treatment).  Many of the things that initially annoyed me such as the voice of the the ViceRoy, The Speech of all Gungans (not just Jar Jar), and the slightly slow start to the movie have become more tolerable with time allowing me to sit back and for the first time say that this movie is just as good as Men In Black and Independence Day.  It may have its flaws, but the force is present in it thanks to the pod race, Darth Sideous/Senator Palpatine, The jedi, and the best light saber battle ever.  It sets up things for the next two prequels and many of the plot holes will probably be filled in by the next movie.  I have a feeling that this movie will grow on people by the time the last prequel is finished and that people will see that it really was necessary to set up the events of the next two prequels. Just imagine HOW GREAT the next VILLIAN in Lucas' mind must be if he had the guts to kill off such a Super Villian as Darth Maul.  Also, Though the midi-chlorians are difficult to swallow now, imagine how easy it will be to accept their explination in the Phantom Menace if they are used as a way to hunt down the Jedi. Seeing Yoda alive again and knowing in the next movie or the third he'll finally show his power in battle. If we had not seen how poorly droids fight, then we would not know why living being still fight battles when they could have robots do it with no casulties. Jar Jar is annoying, but by the third movie he'll be in hiding or (gasp)in that great gungan city in the sky since there is no mention of him in the Original Triligoy. The explanation of these things will give the phantom menace that much more meaning as the future prequels unfold.There are a couple of sore points that will never be any easier to take such as Anakin being Sooooo Young and also Destroying the Droid ship at the end of the movie.  The stiffness of the acting of some of the actors is also still difficult to take during the slow moments.So go ahead and stop succombing to the dark side.  Watch the phantom menace again and discover how good it really is.",9,9,12,16 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A New Breed of Star Wars
","This is a solid new addition to the Star Wars Saga and will create even more new fans (especially young recruits) of the Star Wars Universe. The Special effects are truly a sight to behold more than once as there are many hidden sights to view. Watch closely during the Scene in the Senate chamber and you'll finally know where E.T. was phoning home to or was he calling a Wookie. The special effects and hidden sights are worth the price of admission alone. The story is familiar and yet new. It also has some political intrigue to it. Indeed this story is more about setting up the events of the next two movies than it is about telling a story for the moment. There is a level of political intrigue as Senator Palpatine begins his path to becoming Emporer, and we are introduced to Darth Sidious, who has suspicious similarities to the senator. We are introduced to the characters of Amidala, Obi Wan, Anakin, Yoda and legions of others who will likely play a role in unfolding of the saga that will lead us back to A New Hope where it all began. I was quite pleased to be able to see R2, C3PO, Jabba, and others from the orginal trilogy on the big screen again and I must say that I found the new aliens to be less distracting than some of the early reviews would have led one to believe. However, There are a few disturbing elements of the dark side in this 1st installment of the Star Wars Saga that I hope George Lucas will allow the force to correct in Episode II. Many of the key aliens have voices that are inaudible or just simply distracting from the action that was occurring on screen. I wish there had been less of dialogue like 'Mesa Hata Thisa Waya yousa Talkin.' There were times when I was begging for captioning so I could understand what they were saying. Speaking of Dialogue, if only Darth Maul had been given some. Instead he gets the Boba Fett Treatmen. The human actors were slightly cardboard at times but acceptable and I love the hints of Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan in the Obi Wan of Ewan McGregor. The movie is more like Jedi in its pace as opposed to ANH or ESB. At times it could have used a Han Solo adrenalin rush. Still it is star wars at its heart and if you are patient and do not fear change the dark side will lose out and you'll find yourself loving this movie as I do. Of the four movies so far I rate them out of five stars: Star Wars: ANH ****1/2 Empire Strikes Back ***** Phantom Menace ***1/2 (slightly beats Jedi- Yoda's alive and there are no Ewoks) Return of the Jedi ***1/2",9,0,0,19 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The force is strong with you, but you are not a jedi yet
","Much like Luke Skywalker trying to fight Darth Vader in ESB there is much to be admired about in this movie, but it is not quite to the level of ANH or ESB.  It is very good star wars and does not deserve the critisism it has recieved from some of the harshest mainstream critics of star wars.  Indeed some of the critics most in tune with the dark side would almost make you believe this movie was in the league of 'Plan 9 from outer space'.  Don't take the quicker and more seductive route that they did, for This is a very good movie striving to make the prequel trilogy reach the same level of greatness that the original trilogy attained.  It didn't quite achieve that for me but I can see the effort and the promise for Episode III.  I greatly look forward to the final chapter, and in the meantime will watch this want multiple times in the theater and on DVD.  I love the performances of Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman.  The love story did not detract at all and there was humor to be found in it.  I would like to have seen more of the Obi-wan detective story, but Lucas has said that the trilogy must focus on the Skywalkers, so I was not suprised that the novel went into more detail on obi-wan and Jango/Boba Fett.My only real criticism for this movie is the horrendous sound editing. There were multiple times when I had to strain to understand what was being said because unneeded sound effects were louder than both the dialogue from the actors and the music.  With all the money at Lucas' disposal and his insistance on Digital Sound in theaters that play this movie I would have thought he could hire better people to edit the sound in his movies.This is still a must see picture for anyone who loves star wars and with a little more training this prequel trilogy will attain the status of Jedi.8/10",9,0,0,16 May 2002
Armageddon," Don't expect anything other than special effects
","The story for this movies is one of the worst movie screenplays ever written.  The characters evoked too much humor for the situation they were in and if not for the special effects this movie would be one of the worst ever.  Its story made Godzilla look like Titanic or Gone With The Wind.  I can not, for the life of me figure out why this movie made as much money as it did.  If you need special effects and disasters watch Independence Day or even Godzilla for that matter.  If you want an asteroid movie then watch Deep Impact or the made for TV 'Asteroids'.",6,0,1,11 March 1999
Spider-Man," Spider-Man is the best super hero ever
","I can't say enough great things about this movie.  Spider-Man is the greatest of all the Super hero movies.  It is a very human picture with many of the characters in a grey zone where they have great redeeming qualities and as well as inner demons.   The only character's immune are Peter's Aunt and Uncle, because they are the first glimpse of the super heroes conscience.  It is a much lighter picture than the Batman movies in that Peter Parker/Spiderman is not nearly as conflicted as Bruce Wayne and has had a family.  There is much genuine humor in the film that anyone can relate to because it is based on real human situations even if we are witnessing a superhero deal with them on screen in a fantasy world.  I'd say this is the movie of the summer (well almost..read further), and I'd give Toby McGuire an Oscar for his ability to carry this film on his shoulder. He is SPIDERMAN. I hope that the producers keep him through the sequels a la superman because after seeing this film, no one else could be spiderman. This film is my choice for 2nd best of the summer.  I can't give it first place because I'm a Star Wars fanatic, but if this was  a non Star Wars year it would be #1. 9 out of 10",9,0,0,3 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," very moving having watched it post 9/11
","I have to say that I did not get caught in the hype and watch this movie in the theater.  It was Memorial day weekend, and I knew what Michael Bay movies can be like, overly patriotic and melodramatic to the point of cheeziness at times.  I was a fan of the more historical though sometimes dry adaption known as Tora, Tora, Tora and was afraid of what kind of abuses might be committed against the memory of one the the most tragic events in United States history. Skip to 9/11/2001 our new date to live in infamy.  The Historical event of Pearl Harbor is now sadly joined/surpassed by the Attacks in New York, Washington, and the Anthrax scare. Thousands of innocent Americans lay dead in a tomb that still smokes 80 days later and like our fellow Americans entombed at Pearl Harbor, many will probably never be recovered. 
Now the release of Pearl Harbor on DVD and VHS is upon us as well as the 60th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor.  The few veterans who are alive from that day, have lived to see yet another surprise attack on America. Their story as told in books, documentaries, and even Pearl Harbor the Movie can now inspire new generations of Americans who have been connected together as one nation, a sleeping giant yet again awakened.  
This movie is very patriotic and I was moved in many parts.  The battle scenes are intense.  John Voight's portrayal of FDR is stunning.  The whole movie including Dewey's raid, that many said was unnecessary, has new meaning, post 9/11, showing America's true spirit of refusing to give up under impossible odds and the possibility of death. This is the spirit of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces past and present, This is the spirit of the Firefighters, Police, and Civilians caught up in 9/11, This is spirit of all Americans.  Remember Pearl Harbor, Remember September 11th so that their sacrifices will not have been in vain.",8,1,2,30 November 2001
The Matrix," ground breaking
","Though this movie will undoubtably be shunned for best picture at the Oscars since it has a bit of SCI/FI, it is one of the most ground breaking and historic movies of all time.  Though I was too young to see Star Wars when it came out I have heard that audiences were in awe at the future of cinema that stared them in the eyes.  That is the experience I had watching the Matrix.  Not only does this movie boast one of the best plots out of hollywood this decade, but this movie also shows us a new future of filming movies.  Lucas may want the future to be about Jar Jar Binks and digital non-human characters, but the rest of the world will want the future of movies to take the rout that the Wachowski brothers have placed before the world in the form of the Matrix. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.",10,0,0,23 September 1999
