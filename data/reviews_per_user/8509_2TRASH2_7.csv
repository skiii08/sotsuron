Vertigo," Well,
","Love Kim Novak. And WHO made the eyebrow?! :/ She is a sprite actually, and the eyebrow cut the way of it.Hitchcock, he's just some worker to me in this industry, at the beginning time of movies yeh? He relies on the stories i think, but i actually just have seen Psycho besides this one. Yeah, and he blamed on James Stewart for too old?? And Kim Novak's miscast??? God, he IS a worker, and just for this mysterious type that a good storyline can be the soul of such movies. Maybe he just started to put '?' into movies, that's why he is famous or what. ('or what' is with 'famous or what'.)The green light with dark, and Novak's beautiful left face in it. The dream. The poster! The beautiful CITY.The nun at last, reminds me of the thriller yeh? hhhhhh. I thought it was the husband at the moment. And later i remember CHURCH(which got and get ur brain) & Novak's SIN for money(completely forgot it cuz i just love herself and the way she acted), ok then i thought the arrangement is ok and good luck to James Stewart's character!! :D",9,1,2,23 September 2019
