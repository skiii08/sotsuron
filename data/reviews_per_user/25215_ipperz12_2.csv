Insidious: Chapter 2," Refreshingly Good Horror Sequel
","We all know the score, a brand new original horror idea is a big hit and they capitalize on this with a shoddy poorly-written badly-acted remake with a only marginal relation to the first film... Or so we thought! Insidious: Chapter 2 completely breaks this trend, making it without doubt one of the best horror sequels in recent memory - especially for one which was unplanned! So lets focus on the good: for many the only real problem with the first was the predictable ending that left us wanting more. Whereas, although leaving us with the possibility of a third instalment, was somewhat more conclusive. Secondly, which is very unique for a horror sequel, is that it is acted by all of the original cast, which is a huge bonus for many! Added to that, the colour imagery (red lighting on the baby's crib, blackened setting for the world of the dead) and old-school horror soundtrack all added to the overall feel. Furthermore, what Insidious does well is integrate moments of suspense and full on horror into what is a detailed and well-thought-out creepy story, instead of just having someone shout out 'boo!' every 5 minutes to make up for a lack of story. Now the few small gripes that I had: First off the child-acting can be pretty poor at times, but hey that's usually the case in most films. Secondly, a well-known theme of the Insidious franchise is that when a dead soul enters a living body, the body becomes weak and begins to die. However, without spoiling anything, there are a few scenes where one of these dying bodies manages to fight off several fully-grown men and take various blows to the head with weaponry, without so much as falling down. But hey, again it's just a small detail and certainly not the first film to exaggerate the capabilities of the human body. So yeah, overall a very good horror film in its own right, but it acts even better as a sequel to an already well-established horror film. Definitely worth a watch.",8,1,3,15 September 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Rhino was in it for 2 seconds...
","I thought the first 'Amazing' Spider-Man film was extremely tepid, but then again much of that was just re-telling the whole story of Peter's origin all over again, so I thought this one had to be a step up, but boy was I wrong... For starters they cram in three underdeveloped villains, none more so than the Rhino, who literally appears there for about 2 seconds. No seriously, they just cram him into the final five minutes of the film with about 2 seconds of actual combat and as soon as Spider-Man is actually about to land a punch the film immediately ends. I honestly think it should be illegal for them to even include the Rhino in the adverts and poster if he is given this much screen time, under false advertising. Similarly, the Green Goblin is often ranked as the number one villain for Spider-Man in many polls and again was given just one short 3 minute fight with Spidey before being defeated. Electro actually had some development but it actually undermined the characters motives: basically he was a huge Spider-Man fan met him, saw that Spider-Man was on a big TV and decided to try and kill him (no seriously, this is exactly what happened) It was also cringe worthily cheesy during any actual slight sniff of combat: including Spider-Man pulling down a robbers underwear and wearing a firefighter's helmet when stealing a hose to spray Electro There are so many other plot holes and flaws it's best to just list the main ones here or I'll be here all day, so: 1. Electro looks and acts nothing like in the comics (particularly the fact he's a black guy in a hoodie) 2. The Rhino is a robot that appears for 5 seconds 3. Spider-Man has an infinite supply of his webbing 4. Oscorp is literally the most ridiculous company of all time, they almost killed everyone in the city on countless occasions and even mention how they had to get rid of all animal experiments only for Electro to be turned into what he was by some fish (another animal) 6. Harry has no understanding of any medical science whatsoever and is completely oblivious of any possible problems with just injecting himself with a random blood/chemical sample. 7. Gwen acts as if she's already secured a place at uni when all she is doing is being interviewed and then the second the interview is over they send her on a jet to England 8. A mother decides to send her kid to watch a terrorist shoot at police and destroy the city just because he likes to dress up as Spider-Man. Overall, a horrible mess of a very cheesy movie compounded by the 2 seconds of action involving the Rhino. AWFUL!!!",1,45,106,17 April 2014
