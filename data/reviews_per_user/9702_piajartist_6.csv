Alien 3," It should've never entered the triology status.
","Alien took my breath away, and was the defining movie that reeled me into Sci-Fi.  Aliens had even more aliens and then came the queen.  Alien 3 didn't need to be told, the story wasn't convincing.  Perhaps the fatal flaw was setting it in a space prison.  It's hard to care for characters who are murderers and rapists.  I wouldn't waist the time to watch this but you should definitely watch the first two.",6,402,429,12 January 2003
Ali," Not the greatest in the world!
","Ali was TOO LONG.  I found myself looking at the time, wondering when it would be over.  I was waiting for the plot to get me somewhat excited to focused.  Unfortunately I never sat up during the whole movie.  Will Smith had a decent acting appearance and shouldn't be too proud about the movie, since it was a once and a lifetime opportunity to depict the greatest boxer of all time, and it didn't clome close to the potential.  Maybe this is a lesson that these 'true story' flicks have run there course, and can only be successful if you truly have a good script and cast. Rating: 3",5,0,0,3 January 2003
Alien: Resurrection," Oh how it got so ugly.
","This entire Alien story was originally a very horrifying sci-fi expererience.  As we past the first movie, they seemed to be filled with too much Hollywood action and attitude.  The characters have too much of the macho attitude towards the aliens.  The acting went downhil in this movie, and Weaver isn't fooling anyone with her attempt to be a dark evil human with thoughts of an alien within.  This movie did have a lot of nice close-ups of the aliens and the queen, so if you respect the anatomy of the Alien you should check it out mainly for the effects not the plot, its one of those kind of movies.",6,0,0,12 January 2003
Alien," Drama, Suspense, Sci-Fi, Thriller, Visual, whats better than an A L I E N.
","This movie is rightfully a classic.  Many critics think it may be a unoriginal or the same old horror flick.  There was a lot more in the movie to deem it better than that.  First of all it wasnt exaggerated or blown into a scream fest.  It was more scary because there was silence.  It was in space, and they had no possible way for protection other than to face it or detonate the entire mission. The lifecycle of this Alien which was truly original and fascinating brought a lot suspense as well.  The egg, too the facehugger to the chestburster to the ALIEN, shows a very elaborate growth to make such a beautiful creature.  H.R. Giger is an awesome artist, and being a huge fan of his work, I loved his set design as well as his ALIEN.  The absence of eyes in the ALIEN makes it all the more terrifying.  I watch it today and am still in awe of the ALIEN design and the set of the movie.  Its a movie to appreciate in many aspects. Rating:9",10,0,1,3 January 2003
Aliens," From horror to action
","This movie appealed to a lot more people than the original Alien for some reason.  Personally, I love the first one the most.  The second seems to attract more people because the number of aliens is quite large, not to mention the queen and her lair is introduced.  Weaver plays the story right, but the marines really seem to dumb-down the movie.  This would be a good movie to watch in the dark and turn up the stereo.  It's very intense, but lacks a true horrifying reality.",7,0,2,12 January 2003
Aladdin," Movie that expires after the age of 11.
","This movie was good and fun the first time I saw it in my elementary days. It is one of Disney's actual shining moments, and definitely worth a $2 for a rental.  The story is pretty predictable, but for the timing of the movie it was pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend the movie for anyone who didn't like Lion King, or any Disney movie.  The 2D animation very nice, and brought a very suspense filled viewing in the action scenes. Rating: 5",5,1,12,3 January 2003
