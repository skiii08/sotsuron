Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Fantastic bit of Film!
","What a wonderful piece of entertainment.  Not only from the technical imagination that went into this movie, but it has a great plot.  Borrowing much from the old film noir genre of private eye flicks.  Tell me Bogart wouldn't have been perfect for Valiant.  The movie allows our imagination and enjoyment to take us on a ride, all while marveling at how much time it took these people to get the animation to match the live action.",10,0,0,7 September 2000
