The Blair Witch Project," a very spooky flick
","at last someone figured out that you do not need to have gory, bloody monsters and special effects to scare someone. All you need is fear and this movie truly uses it to its potential. Without giving away too much, I don't think I will be going camping anytime soon.",9,1,1,3 August 1999
