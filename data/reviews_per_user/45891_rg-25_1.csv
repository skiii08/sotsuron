Miracle," Do YOU believe in Miracles?
","Just saw 'MIRACLE'  the true story of the 1980 US Hockey team starring Kurt Russell...Most os us around here (ahem) are old enough to remember the 1980 Olympics. What I liked about this movie was though the world experienced the thrill of the US v. USSR victory, we never understood what those 'kids' (median age of the team...21), went through...how they trained, and fought through injury, adversity, doubt, heartache and heartbreak.  They went from being stars of their college hometeams, to being one team...unified, and learned how to become a family.  With that, they carried the weight of a country's belief on their backs.  The Iranian hostage crisis, the gas shortages, the sting of Viet Nam still lingering, they found a way to bring hope back into the human spirit.There is a small, albeit quiet moment in the film that shows the beautiful NYC skyline, in its full 1980 glory.  The moment passes, but we see those towers again, standing tall and proud, and I was reminded again about the belief and hope we have always had as a nation...that through adveristy, we will continue building and believing in miracles.Go see it....",9,0,0,7 February 2004
