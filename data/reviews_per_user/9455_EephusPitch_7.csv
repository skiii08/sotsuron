Moneyball," A pleasant surprise
","I used to love going to the Oakland Coliseum. Maybe it was only in comparison to Candlestick, but the Coliseum was a pleasant place to watch a ballgame. Then the Haas family sold the team, Al Davis moved the Raiders back from L.A., the Coliseum was enclosed and became an airless mausoleum with the ambient of a toiletbowl; since then, I have been to about half a dozen games in Oakland. Since being swept by Detroit in the 2006 ALCS, the A's have been caught up in a swirl of ineptitude. The current ownership, saddled with an inadequate facility and no clear prospect of finding a new home, have (unlike the Giants' management of the '80's, who brilliantly promoted a substandard product) spent the past few years actively discouraging people from supporting the team.Billy Beane is part and parcel of the A's malaise. Beane was a scout's dream, a blue-chip high-school prospect, who was drafted in the first round of the amateur draft by the New York Mets (who used the first pick in the draft on another SoCal high-schooler, Daryl Strawberry); he might have gone higher in the draft, but teams were leery that Beane might accept a baseball/football scholarship to Stanford, where he would have had a chance to succeed John Elway at quarterback. The players chosen around Beane, Terry Francona and John Gibbons, would go on to become successful Major League managers, a class of people for whom Beane reserves his greatest contempt. Beane has increasingly made moves which have left the team in a constant rebuilding cycle, haphazardly dealing game-ready, club-controlled players for prospects, with the glee of a ten year old swapping baseball cards, or my coke-addled former roommate rearranging her bedroom. How acquiring Milton Bradley and Matt Holliday for Andre Ethier and Carlos Gonzalez fits in with the precepts of 'moneyball' quite escapes me.The scene in this movie which most adequately captures this 'I'm more clever than anyone else' aspect of Beane is the four-way phone conversation between Beane, Ed Wade, Dave Dombrowski, and Brian Sabean (actually, a five-way conversation, counting hapless owner, Steve Schott, who is left on hold), during which Beane snags Ricardo Rincon. This is a high point. The somewhat more questionable trade which netted the A's Ted Lilly, and for whom they gave up Carlos Pena and Jeremy Bonderman, is glossed over. Brad Pitt does a very commendable job showing both Beane's arrogance, and his insecurities. Jonah Hill is sterling as the Paul DePodesta-based assistant, hiding from the realities of the game behind his glasses and his lap-top. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a surprisingly nuanced turn as beleaguered and out-of-his-depth manager Art Howe. While looking nothing like Howe, he ably suggests Howe's befuddlement, humor and basic decency. And the narrative peak of the movie, the wildly improbable 20 game winning streak, was very deftly constructed. As a side note, a 20 game winning streak is almost the antithesis of 'moneyball', and it's strange that it was spearheaded by non-'moneyball' players such as Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, the year after the A's lost the ultimate 'moneyball' player, Jason Giambi,to the Yankees. Also, hearing the late Bill King's voice over the reconstructed game footage brought tears to my eyes.",8,1,3,12 October 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Nice cast, shame about the movie
","I do my best to support my neighborhood, single-screen movie theaters, theaters such as the Vogue: they charge reduced admission for mid-week screenings, they don't run commercials, and they usually only make you sit through a couple of coming attractions. So when I saw the cast for this movie, I figured 'what the heck, why not?'. I suppose maybe I need to see more movies; this one seemed curiously under-baked to me. As I waited for the laughs to start, I found myself pondering random thoughts: cinematically, are noses as incompatible as Julianne Moore's as Steve Carrell's indicative of doomed relationships?; is there only the one bar in all of Los Angeles?; would the Giants line-up work better with Orlando Cabrera batting lead-off?; and is there a chance of my actually picking up Prince Fielder on a waiver claim in my fantasy baseball league? It's that kind of movie; the pace is somewhat leisurely. There are subtle rewards: the high school girl saying 'my lips are *seal clapping*', which provided the only laugh for me (and made me want to listen to the Go-Go's), and seeing John Carroll Lynch (who I always think of as Norm Son-of-a Gunderson) in a movie is always rewarding. But for the most part, I fear that I'll remember this movie as a squandering of some very estimable acting talent; it's the only movie I can think of that has ever made Marisa Tomei seem ridiculous.",6,1,3,11 August 2011
Baby Driver," Brilliant, but ho-hum.
","Okay, so I watched Series One of Spaced last week. I watched Hot Fuzz last night. I pretty much have Shaun of the Dead memorized, word for word, camera angle to camera angle. I got myself fully into the Edgar Wright Zone. Tonight, I saw this film on the big screen, my first Edgar Wright big screen experience since seeing World's End for the second time. And it was fun. Lots of chases, lots of gunplay., lots and lots of Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Hamm chewing up the scenery (although, it must be said, not enough of Flea with his prosthetic nose). The soundtrack was brilliant, and warranted by the plot. So why do I feel let down?The problem, I think, is that on some level I expected Edgar Wright to do something more with the form. All of the actors do very well performing their roles, but all of them are playing basic stock characters: the Innocent Kid who has been coerced into a life of crime, his crippled Foster-father trying to keep him on the straight-and-narrow, his naive, wholesome Love Interest, the sinister Mastermind, the psychopathic street wise Gangsta, the sociopathic Whiteboy thrill seeker with his sultry Moll, etc, etc. All well and good, but all something we've seen before.With Baby Driver, Edgar Wright proves that he can make a heist/car chase/shoot 'em up movie as well or better than any other director. No one doubted that he could. I just wanted him to do something subversive with the form.",7,5,11,6 July 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," Good movies have been made about mental illness; this isn't one of them.
","David O. Russell has always appeared to me to be the fourth member of a quartet of directors, roughly contemporaneous, who include Paul T. Anderson, Wes Anderson, and Alexander Payne. I would say that, of the four, he has always been the weakest. The only one of his films I truly enjoyed was 'Three Kings'. With this effort, I think he may have slid a little bit farther down in my estimation. He did manage to get good performances out of his cast, but when that cast includes Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Jennifer Lawrence, that should be a given. As for the film itself, it was kind of a mess, really. It just seemed interminable, with a whole cast of irritating people acting in dramatically implausible ways. The most sympathetic character, for me, was Tiffany, but I suspect that had more to do with Jennifer Lawrence's performance than anything that was written into the part. I hope she gets the Oscar that she earned for 'Winter's Bone', and I hope a worthier role comes her way in the near future.",5,7,12,21 February 2013
To Rome With Love," When in Rome...
","A slight, fitfully amusing collection of thematically linked but otherwise unconnected vignettes, all taking place in Rome. The highlights were the casting of Judy Davis, the perfect Woody actress; the story of the mortician who would rival Domingo, if allowed to sing in the shower; and the city of Rome itself, which is pretty damned gorgeous. Most of the segments are intermittently amusing, but more than anything else this reads like a collection of Woody's prose, brought to screen, which he accomplished with much greater success in DECONSTRUCTING HARRY. Altogether, a good reason to avoid 4th of July lunacy, but certainly not a great film.",6,1,3,4 July 2012
The Artist," Wiz Plaizair
","Of course I resisted seeing this movie for an unreasonable, an unconscionable amount of time: popular, critical smashes, particularly those redolent of 'feel-goodiness', have that effect on me. It took a rare rainy San Francisco night (and the fact that there appears to be f***-all else watchable playing in movie theaters at the moment) to get me in to see this. And of course it was just what the doctor ordered.I'm not entirely sure that I was watching the same film as the gentleman seated two rows behind me, who spent the entire movie laughing like a hyena. To me, the laughter was of a more subtle and restrained order, and manifested itself in minor, off-key touches, such as Valentin's 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' clock (in fact, all of his furniture was quite fairly risible), and Peppy's 'I want to be alone' moment of Garbo-ism. I am fairly certain that I was grinning throughout at the sheer cleverness of the camera work and production, and the staging of Valentin's dreams and delirium tremens. And of course it goes without saying that Uggy the Dog deserves a Canine Oscar.",8,0,1,12 February 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," This is why I go to movies
","Wes Anderson creates spectacular quotidian worlds. Every detail in every one of his frames is meticulously realized; like Dickens, he leaves no loose ends. The shot that still has me dizzy is the view we get of the Bishop's living room, all violently clashing plaids, set off by the incredibly garish slacks being sported by the bare-chested Mr. Bishop (Bill Murray) on his way to 'find a tree and chop it down'. What other directors, seeking to emulate Anderson's whimsy and tweeness, don't understand is the sheer amount of bloody diligence which goes into creating these immaculate universes. Where Anderson's hermetically ordered worlds are allowed breathing space is in the latitude he gives his actors to bring their characters to life, and in this film the adult actors relax nicely into their roles. Where Anderson really gives free reign is to his juvenile actors, the Khaki Scout troop as well as the two leads, and they reward him with energetic, fully inhabited performances. The sole sour note on the evening was having to see this wonderful movie at The Sundance Kabuki, where the 'amenity fee' brought the price of my ticket to $13.50. In no way do I regard having to choose my seat before seeing the house an amenity; in fact, it is quite the reverse. This website won't let me publish my true, 'Deadwood'-ian opinion of Mr. Redford, so I will just state that it will hopefully be a long time before I have to patronize his theater again.",9,3,8,6 June 2012
