Hereditary," More drama than horror
","A very depressing film from start to finish, the buzzing supposedly eerie music does nothing but annoy the ears throughout.
I could go on about the negatives (there are many) but just don't expect 'the conjuring' imo the best horror film ever.",4,0,1,27 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Thank god it's over now
","To quote Edmund Blackadder'Well it started badly, it tailed off a little in the middle & the less said about the end the better! But apart from that, excellent!'That could sum up this dreadful film or the trilogy.",3,8,14,9 February 2020
Bird Box," Decidedly average
","Really don't understand the hype, 'scariest film ever' 'haven't slept since watching it'Now everyone is entitled to an opinion........ But come on! Seriously! Have you ever watched a horror/thriller before.
As I wasted 2 hours of my life on this film I'll keep this short, driving a car blindly using sat nav alone, tackling river rapids blindfolded for 30+ hours! That's all you need to know about this mess of a film.",5,0,1,6 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Infinity war far superior
","Wanted to love this movie like I did infinity war, but unfortunately endgame is like Amanda Holden's face, smooth but no emotion.",5,5,7,31 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Don't believe the hype
","Think I've watched a different film to most reviewers!
It's too jokey too cheesy and too long, infinity war was brilliant this is well below that level.",5,7,13,27 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Amazingly terrible
","Anyone who enjoys this film over the age of 13 is obviously just a huge fan of the original trilogy and is not giving an honest review of this appalling mess of a movie. The part with Leia 'force Mary Poppins' back to the ship got a WTF reaction from me (out loud) and everyone in the theatre laughed.
This is not star wars this is appalling feminazi garbage, if I could give zero stars I would.",1,13,25,2 January 2020
The Conjuring," Terrifying and brilliant
","This film is not perfect but I have yet to see anything that has stayed with me as long as this did.
The acting is top notch as is the eerie musical score, if you love horror at it's very best and you haven't seen this film yet watch it and see how great horrors can be.",9,0,1,27 August 2018
