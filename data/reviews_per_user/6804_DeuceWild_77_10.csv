The Expendables 2," Produced to please the Generation X, but in fact aimed to the Millennials...
","Well, the meaning of 'The Expendables' franchise is like a sort of a wet dream from the Generation X, which during the peak of the action movies in the fabulous 80's decade, were devoted fans in the line to the theater or to the near videostore to watch / rent the latest effort from this bunch of guys. 80's action films symbolized the freedom of speech in an Era who wasn't politically correct to the use of violence on-screen, an Era of true action heroes with attitude always delivering sarcastic & witty on-liners when facing the danger. After the global success of the first movie, Stallone this time just a co-writer, called Simon West ('Con Air', 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider') to the director's seat to concentrate only in leading this all-star cast and perhaps, minimizing and controlling the major egos involved. 'The Expendables 2' truly delivers over-the-top action non-stop, well- staged fight scenes with less shaky cam (an improvement over the original), flashy editing, a frenetic pace and cool props. The plot is basic & clich√©, but at least, it's self-indulgent and goes forward straight to the business. The bad thing is, even more than the first, this movie lacks heart and soul. It's too much focused on the action sequences: shootings and killings all around (like an out of control video game), things blow up and are destroyed to the ground every 5 minutes and the actors involved act more like mere walking caricatures than fleshed-out characters. In a matter of fact, this sequel looks like it was all directed by the 2nd Unit and the majority of the exteriors, shot somewhere in Eastern Europe, and the extensive use of CGI to emulate the gunshots, the blood and the explosions, gave a sense of cheap with unpolished visuals to the whole, almost entering in the DTV territory. Most of the on-liners and references to the popular culture of the 80's action movies, immortalized by this guys in their peak, simply doesn't worked here, it was forced and intrusive, like if they tried too much to be self-aware and cool, turning it in almost a spoof movie. Some of the delivering is even awkward and the jokes' cringeworthy.Despite this, Sly once again did a good job as the Team's Leader, Barney Ross with Jason Statham as the second-in-command, Lee Christmas, who was even more annoying and full of himself than in the first film; Randy Couture as Toll Road, with a limited number of spoken lines to accommodate his acting 'skills'; Terry Crews as Hale Caeser, which at least was funnier than the rest; Jet Li as Yin Yang, only in an extended cameo at the beginning and we must thank his scheduling conflicts for that and the last, but not the least, 'Swedish Strangler' Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, who almost stole the first movie and maybe because of that (he must have irritated the attention seeker, Jason Statham), he was given less to do this time around. Charisma Carpenter reprises her role as Christmas' girlfriend in a tiny part that if you blink, you'll miss her on-screen and Nan Yu is OK as Maggie, in a good casting decision on opting for her instead of the terrible Gina Carano.It's nice to watch Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis doing more than a talkative cameo and this time shooting up bad guys, but their hearts aren't there. Arnold besides being lame with his tongue 'n' cheek remarks at least he tried, Bruce was just there for the quick paycheck, in a 'send me a couple of millions and i'll sleepwalk through the movie' mode.Chuck Norris, who fares better than Arnold and Bruce, came out of retirement to play John Booker nicknamed 'Lone Wolf', a homage to his characters in 'Good Guys Wear Black' ('78) & 'Lone Wolf McQuade' ('83), but even with his entrance song, the production messed around, 'Ecstasy of Gold' by Maestro Ennio Morricone is an iconic orchestration for Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name, not for Chuck Norris and the King Cobra joke was taken directly from the 'Chuck Norris' Facts' on internet, so nothing new or imaginative here. Liam Hemsworth, a fill-in character for Mickey Rourke who refused to comeback for this sequel, is nicely presented, but the minute he talks that he wants to leave the team, is a token for 'i will be dead very soon'. The casting of Hemsworth had a double function: to call 'The Hunger Games' fanboys to the theaters and to give 'The Expendables 2' a feel of 'The Avengers Assemble' co-starred by Liam's older brother, Chris as Thor.The baddies played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who was very good as the sneerie and arrogant Jean Villain, and Scott Adkins, who shamefully he isn't even in the main cover art, if were given more screen time, both would probably steal the movie from The Expendables themselves. The end fighting sequence between Villain and Stallone's Barney Ross is one of the movie's highlights, reminiscent from Van Damme's character in 'Black Eagle' ('88) where he also played the main baddie.In short, 'The Expendables 2' is a good way to spend a hour and a half, like a trip to memory lane, watching this guys in action and reminding us about the hundreds of hours we spend watching and re-watching their action flicks in the videostore days, but as a movie it's just a so-so experience, that wants to please the Gen X, but in fact was technically and visually aimed at the Generation Y.It got an extra point just because of the ensemble cast, but it deserves less...",7,0,0,29 November 2017
Kickboxer," 'Never surrender, never say die, you got the heart of a Hero'
","As a 40-ish now, i was there (& aware) when Jean-Claude Van Damme became an action star with the mega-hit (& masterpiece of the genre) 'Bloodsport', a movie that only saw the light of the day, because JCVD fought for it to be released. 'Kickboxer' was his next project, now as established leading star and this time also as the co-writer & the director / choreographer of the intense (& realistic) fight sequences bringing with him the successful team behind 'Bloodsport': Mark DiSalle & David Worth (here as co-directors) plus the executive producers Menahen Golan & Yoram Globus, the two heads of the, at the time prolific, Cannon Group. The story is simple: after K.O'd every opponent in the American Kickboxer League, the confident, but pompous champion Eric Sloane (played by Dennis 'The Terminator' Alexio, a real life heavyweight kickboxing champion) accepts a match in Thailand, but by the rules of Muay Thai, against their undefeated and 'national treasure', Tong Po (played by Van Damme's real life buddy, Michel Qissi). Eric's entourage consists only of his supportive younger brother, Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) as his personnel trainer. When the savage techniques in the ring of the bloodthirsty Po, causes his brother to became paralyzed, Kurt vows for revenge and with the help of a former American Marine (Haskell V. Anderson III) & a Muay Thai secluded Master, Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), they must prepare him for an underground fight that may cost Kurt's own life... Re-watching 'Kickboxer' nowadays it's like drinking from an old Scotch bottle, a fine & genuine product of its time, when action & martial arts movies had, in fact, heart & soul and the viewers enthusiastically cheered for their subdued heroes on the screen and booed the stereotyped (but always effective) villains. 'Kickboxer' may not be the most original flick of its genre, it had the obvious influences that came from 'The Karate Kid' to 'Rocky IV' and JCVD's previous 'Bloodsport', but for sure this movie delivers way high on the entertainment / excitement level. Even if the critics (as always) disliked it, Van Damme is good in the main role and proves again that besides his martial arts' skillful techniques, he surely can act and sweat charisma way better than most of the nowadays cardboard cutouts / wooden / soulless 'action stars'.On the technical / artistically level, 'Kickboxer' looks good for its tight budget: very competent photographed (some of the shots are even beautiful filmed); the choreography of the fights is raw & realistic; the soundtrack mainly performed by Stan Bush is motivational, catchy, cheesy and a pleasure to sing-a-long; Tong Po became an unforgettable baddie in the 'action movies' best villains' universe & last, but not least, Van Damme's drunk dancing & fighting thugs at the same time, it's one of the most iconic scenes from the 80's action flicks.'Kickboxer' is a movie that is worthy of its own cult status and deserves to be forever revisited.",8,2,2,5 September 2017
Mississippi Burning," 'When America was at war with itself...' - a gripping & engaging experience !!
","One year after his misunderstood masterpiece, 'Angel Heart', the English director Alan Parker returns to the South for filming 'Mississippi Burning', a crime / thriller drama about 2 F.B.I. agents sent to Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964 to investigate the disappearance of 3 civil rights activists. Led by the younger agent, Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), a yankee 'crusader' and a symbol of Kennedy's administration, who follow the Bureau's rules by the book & his older and savvy partner, Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi Sheriff, who knows the behavior, mentality, traditions & way of life of his fellow countrymen. When they suspect that the Ku Klux Klan may be operating there and responsible for the disappearance of the 3 activists with the support of the local law, Ward & Anderson start a war against the 'phantom' killers in searching for the truth, clashing with the town people that don't want them there... Superbly directed motion picture from an engaging screenplay penned by Chris Gerolmo, based on actual facts and visually stunning, shot by the cinematographer Peter Biziou, who won a well deserved Academy Award, 'Mississippi Burning' is a gritty, realistic & sweaty movie experience, filmed on location near where the actual murders took place with even some scenes shot in a documentary style which enhanced the straight tone of the film. It moves at a thrilling pace, involving the viewer in the sordid ways of racism at his worst, stereotyping that (almost) all of the white southern characters are evil and preaches the audience about the innocent victims of the intolerance and the deserved punishment of their executioners, guided by the eyes of two different lawmen, the liberal moralist - Willem Dafoe and the conservative 'vigilante' , Gene Hackman. Hackman delivers maybe his best performance since his brilliant turn in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation' ('74), he's determined, reckless & sarcastic, showy, but commanding the screen with gravitas proving why he's one of the best (still sadly, underrated) north American actors ever. Willem Dafoe, fresh from his Academy Award nomination for 'Platoon', co-stars in a less prominent role, but equal effective, especially in his 'boy scout' antagonism with the Hackman character. Frances McDormand, who scored a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, is the stand-out / revelation as the disgruntled & fragile wife of the local Deputy. She shines in a role that could have been underplayed if performed by a less capable actress. The supporting players are top notch (kudos to the casting department & Parker's skillful direction of actors) from the always remarkable as the hateful 'usual suspects': Brad Dourif & Michael Rooker to R. Lee Ermey; Gailard Sartain; Badja Djola in an intense cameo appearance; Tobin Bell, making here his feature film debut, years before his breakthrough role in the 'Saw' franchise and Stephen Tobolowsky, among others. In short, 'Mississippi Burning' was one of the best films of 1988, nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director & Best Leading Actor for Hackman, winning 1 and perhaps only lost the Best Picture Oscar, due to the Academy's emotional vote in favor of Barry Levinson's sympathetic drama, 'Rain Man'. Highly recommended !!",9,2,4,10 September 2017
JFK," Intensely interesting thriller / drama, shot in documentary style, about the conspiracy behind J.F.K.'s assassination. The 1st and best from Stone's U.S. Presidents' trilogy !
","Absorbing thriller, written and directed by Oliver Stone, about the conspiracy behind the assassination of one of the most beloved American Presidents.
Based on the books by Jim Garrison (the real character played by Kevin Costner in the film) and Jim Marrs, 'JFK' establishes the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald never acted alone.The screenplay may be conjectural, and was accused of being one more 'conspiracy theory' by the well-known controversial director from 'Salvador' ('86) & 'Platoon' ('86), but besides what it dares to be, thruth or not, it's an entertaining and engaging piece of great filmmaking, from the intense & frenetic editing by Joe Hutshing & Pietro Scalia (both fairly awarded with Academy awards) to the cinematography, shot almost documentary style, by Robert Richardson (also Oscar winner) and the precise direction of Stone with the 'maestro' John Williams once again providing an unforgettable original score.The cast is fabulous and probably the best ensemble cast of 1991, led by a sober Kevin Costner, when he was at his peak in Hollywood (he started to shoot 'JFK' after he won 2 Oscars for his pet project, the epic western, 'Dances with Wolves'), as Jim Garrison, the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, Louisiana who starts a new Kennedy assassination investigation after the 'holes' on the outcome of the Warren Commission, with Sissy Spacek playing his devoted wife, Liz and a bunch of great character actors playing Garrison's legal team: Laurie Metcalf, Jay O. Sanders, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight & Gary Grubbs.
But it's in the supporting roles and the non-credited cameo and / or extended cameo appearances that 'JFK' shines:Tommy Lee Jones (the only member of the cast nominated for an Oscar) is splendid as the quirky Clay Shaw (alias, Clay Bertrand), Garrison's prime suspect, dominating every scene he's in, with Kevin Bacon & Joe Pesci, all playing against type as homossexuals, in a geniously & daring decision of casting.
Bacon is effective and convincing, Pesci goes a little over-the-top in some scenes, sometimes looks like he was still playing Leo Getz in 'Lethal Weapon II', but still delivers without dragging the movie down.Hollywood legendary actors and the all time screen partners, 'the odd couple': Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, are great in their cameos, even if this time they don't share scenes.Gary Oldman's metamorphosis into Lee Harvey Oswald is astonishingly 'chamaleonic' as the great method actor he is, and he deserved to be Oscar nominated as much as Tommy Lee Jones, but his performance is shorter on screen time and less 'showy', hence the snub...Donald Sutherland as 'X' could have made this kind of sinister part even in his sleep, and once again he does it very well showing what a pro he is.The late great John Candy, in a rare appearance out of the comedy films, is fantastic as the dandy / flamboyant lawyer, Dean Andrews. His witty speech delivery is a riot to follow.
Bill Murray's older sibling, Brian Doyle-Murray plays Jack Ruby, the mafia man who shot Oswald.Jim Garrison himself makes a cameo as Earl Warren, the head of the Warren Commission and Martin Sheen, who played Bobby Kennedy in the TV movie, 'The Missiles of October' ('78) and JFK himself in the miniseries, 'Kennedy' ('83), offers the intro narration of the facts that led to the Kennedy's assassination.The 'Director's Cut' is way better than the theatrical release, showing some pertinent extended scenes and added a bunch of new segments / characters that were left out in the cutting room floor like the Lolita Davidovich's interrogation sequence; Lee Harvey Oswald's impostor played by Stone's regular, Frank Whaley and John Larroquette, as a TV talkshow host, where Garrison was a guest.Nominated for 8 Oscars, but winning just 2, 'JFK' is one of the best movies of 1991 and if it wasn't for the sleeper hit, 'The Silence of the Lambs' and all the bandwagon around the Hannibal Lecter character, it could have won more relevant Oscars such as Best Pic and Best Director, at least...I give it a solid 9 !!!",9,2,3,25 June 2019
From Hell," 'From Hell' is stylish and exquisite, but ultimately, lacks substance...
","'From Hell' was loosely based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, but could have been just a remake of 'Murder by Decree' ('79), because both of the movies covered the same view / conspiracy theory on the Jack the Ripper's hideous killing spree and his true identity and motivations. The major difference is that in 'Murder by Decree', the screenwriters used the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creations, Sherlock Holmes (played by Christopher Plummer) and Dr.Watson (played by James Mason) to hunt Jack the Ripper, but in terms of story / plot is basically the same, except that the 1979 Bob Clark's directed film have, in fact, a heart and soul and substance over style, which 'From Hell' severely, lacks.The Hughes Bros. came up with a flashy adaptation of the Ripper case, turning one of the greatest unsolved mysteries from the XIX century into a computer game with the player controlling Depp's character who wanders through the movie in a sleepwalking mode, being as inefficient as his Freemason superior, played by Ian Richardson, accused him to be.The script is too predictable, not offering any layers or creative sub- plots, it's 'filmsy', everything appears or happens in the right moment in time to help the plot to move forward (can we even count the 'Deus ex machina' resolutions used, without being bored at it ?).In the technical level, the movie scores as the production / art design, sets and costumes are good in the invocation of the Victorian Era and the gloomy cinematography is competently crafted.In terms of acting, this kind of low life Inspector, addicted to opium, absinthe and laudanum, was tailor made to suit perfectly the Johnny Depp persona, even if his moody performance was too lifeless to carry on the movie. Heather Graham is attractive and likable as Mary Kelly, but she lacks acting chops. The supporting players did better with Robbie Coltrane elevating the scenes with Depp (almost stealing them from him) and Ian Holm, as always, was dementedly fabulous as the main villain. The virtually unknown actresses playing the ill-fated prostitutes (including the late British actress, Katrin Cartlidge as Dark Annie) were very good, especially in the dialect & the authenticity.In short, 'From Hell' is nice to look at, a visually engaging film, but unfortunately, even with all the style in the world, if it lacks substance and competent storytelling, it fails to achieve.Perhaps this kind of gloomy 'comic book movie' works better in fantasyland such as in the case of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', which was a critical and box office failure, but at least remained out of a 'based on a real life case' and was just a dark adventure / fantasy escapism.It worth a watch in a rainy Sunday afternoon, but nothing sort of memorable or a future cult-classic in the genre, if you're a fan of this take on the Jack the Ripper's true identity and motivations, there are far better movies covering the same premise, like the above mentioned: 'Murder by Decree' ('79) or the earlier: 'A Study in Terror' ('65) starring John Neville as Sherlock Holmes & Donald Houston as Dr. Watson and featuring an early appearance on-screen by Dame Judi Dench.",6,0,0,7 November 2017
The Wrestler," Little gem of a film, a brilliantly directed character's study about highs and lows with a remarkable performance by Rourke, who transcends the material !!
","Darren Aronofsky is a daring filmmaker, he knows how to stage cinema, both visually & technically, and how to defy the 'genres' at the same time, and above all, he's a magnificent director of actors (Ellen Burstyn in 'Requiem for a Dream', '00 or Natalie Portman in 'Black Swan', '10, being great examples of that).In 'The Wrestler', Aronofsky once again scored high in every department, starting with the 'risqu√©e' casting of Mickey Rourke, one of the best post-Brando performers which, unfortunately, his genuine behavior against fake posing and politics in Hollywood and the sincere passion for the method performance itself costed him his leading status and then his career, and Aronofsky's own 'cinema v√©rit√©' style of directing mixed with 'guerrilla filmmaking' approach that transcends the american roots of the Wrestling Entertainment to an 'artsy' film more European inclined.The original actor hired by the producers, Nicolas Cage, backed out from the movie when he knew that Aronofsky's heart was with Mickey, his old pal from Francis Ford Coppola's 'Rumble Fish' ('83), and doing that, he was partially responsible for the film's success and for the resurrection of Rourke, who never really stopped acting, but was 'blackballed' to short cameo appearances in mostly indie films, even if he acted his heart and soul out regardless of his screen time (such as in Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' ('98); as Jan the Actress in Steve Buscemi's 'Animal Factory' ('00); as Jim Olstad in Sean Penn's 'The Pledge' ('01) or as The Cook in Jonas √Ökerlund's 'Spun' ('02).Aronofsky knew that the 'washed-out' / 'has-been' character of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson parallel Mickey's own descent into darkness, and both the character and the actor share the memories of the glourious and glamorous days of their stardom in the exuberant 80's and carrying nowadays the stigma that they not fit anymore because the world have changed (surely, not for good, in this reviewer's opinion) and years of self destructive behavior and premature aging due to that did not helped either.It's an amazing 'tour de force', organic, realistic and remarkable performance that may be the best from that decade. Mickey gave it all (his best performed leading role since 'Johnny Handsome', '89) and, finally, he was nominated and won every major awards, except the Academy Award due to the same politically correct that he fought against during his peak in the 80's decade.The script, penned by Robert Siegel, is simplistic, but goes deeply emotionally and, even if it isn't perfect (the over-the-top reaction from the daughter and even the Ram's outburst in the supermarket) gave those actors the ambience to create their own characters and even their own improvised lines that enriched the film to the level of realism.Marisa Tomei, who was also Oscar nominated for her brave role here as Pam / Cassidy, the stripper with a heart of gold, offers an inspired performance. She's real, both as a stripper (Mickey himself said that not every actress could be able to 'climb the pole' as perfectly as Marisa did) and as a single mom that wants to change her life and is afraid to fall in love with a former customer.Evan Rachel Wood, the young co-star of 'Thirteen' ('03) and 'The Missing' ('03), plays Stephanie, Ram's estranged teenage daughter that he tries to reconnect. Wood goes a little over-the-top, especially in her last emotionally devastating scene with Rourke, but it's on the screenplay, not all her fault, she needed to react like that to provoque the Ram's decision in the third act.The wrestling scenes are very well choreographed, some of the blood isn't even fake, and even if Aronofsky demanded a stunt double to protect his leading actor in some extreme wrestling sequences, Mickey himself at the age of 56 years old performed the majority of it.In terms of the soundtrack, Rourke's old pals were there for him, Axl Rose gave the permission to use the Guns 'n' Roses' hit song, 'Sweet Child o'Mine', played during Randy 'The Ram' Robinson's entrance to his final match, and Bruce Springsteen even wrote and performed 'The Wrestler', an original theme which was snubbed for an Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Song, both for free due to their friendship to Rourke and the movie's limited budget.Other great 80's glam metal / AOR bands featuring in the movie are Quiet Riot, Ratt (when Mickey and Marisa dance in the bar listening to 'Round and Round'), FireHouse, Cinderella, Scorpions, Slaughter and Accept.In short, 'The Wrestler' is a brilliant little film, a taking on the dark side of America's most cheesy sport and a character study on a man that lost everything and search for his redemption in the only place he's still respected: in the ring!!On a side note, Rourke's performance was lauded not only by professional critics, such as the late Roger Ebert, Owen Gleiberman, Ben Mankiewicz or Richard Roeper, and the audiences around the world, but also from his peers, from Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Brad Pitt to the Mickey's earlier co-star, Kim Basinger and even the WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon and former wrestling superstars as Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, the late great 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper, Bret 'The Hitman' Hart, Hulk Hogan, Mick Foley and 'The Narcissist' Lex Luger, which his body was used in the opening credits to depicts Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in the 80's.I rarely give a 10 to a movie released post-2000, but if any movie deserves it, it is undoubtedly, 'The Wrestler' !!",10,0,0,26 December 2019
Tombstone," Very good, but could have been great. Kilmer is amazing, but Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe & Stephen Lang stole the show...
","After the departure of screenwriter Kevin Jarre on the director's chair, Kurt Russell, advised by Sylvester Stallone, hired George Pan Cosmatos, a veteran filmmaker well-known in the 80's for ghost-direct two of Sly's most famous flicks: 'Rambo - First Blood - Part II' ('85) & 'Cobra' ('86). 'Tombstone' was since its conception a 'dream come true' project for Russell, an avid western fan, the son of one of the most prominent character actors of the genre, Bing Russell and even named his own son with Goldie Hawn, Wyatt. He took the helm of the entire production with Cosmatos standing only as an advisor and taking care of the look and authenticity of this period piece.In terms of production values, 'Tombstone' scores high in the art department, set design, costumes, locations (in and outdoors) and cinematography. It looks and feels like the Old West, but unfortunately, the trimmed screenplay and the scenes that were left out in the cutting room floor turned the movie a bit more generic, disjointed and the previous envisioned epic film about the life of Wyatt Earp was turned into an action film for the less demanding audiences.Some sub-plots went nowhere (more evident in the Jason Priestley's character, what was his purpose in the movie anyway?) and several scenes happened without proper explanation (suddenly the Curly Bill and Ringo's gang wear badges; who shot Billy Zane?; Michael Rooker's change of side seemed contrived) and in the last half a hour the movie looks like it was in a urge to finish with some quick editing thrown in and the result is a bit messy.It's a shame because the all-star cast is outstanding: Kurt Russell plays the legendary Wyatt Earp with conviction and adequate stubbornness, but he's upstaged by the brilliant turns of Val Kilmer as the lunger Doc Holliday, in one of his best performances to date; the criminally underrated Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius and especially Michael Biehn, who delivers the best performance in the film, as the cold-blooded killer, but educated man, Johnny Ringo. His blinkless eyes & facial expressions devoid of any humanity and on-screen vileness presence made his ruthless character one of the most memorable villains of the 90's.Manly, rugged and moustache favorite, Sam Elliott as the elder brother, Virgil Earp and the always watchable, Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp were both ok, but their roles needed to be expanded. Stephen Lang stole all of his scenes as the nasty drunk, Ike Clanton and Jon Tenney provides a smooth & slick Marshall Behan, an ambiguous character which reminds a bit of Jeff Goldblum's in 'Silverado'.The rest of the cast were given almost nothing to do, except standing here and there and recite a few lines, a waste of Joana Pacula, Billy Zane, Michael Rooker, Thomas Haden Church, Terry O'Quinn, Harry Carey Jr. and even the screen legend, Mr. Charlton Heston in a thankless role. Robert Mitchum as the narrator had a way noticeable voice for fans of him and his old westerns.
Dana Delany as Wyatt's love interest, well... she may be adequate as a television actress. but she's not a leading lady material for a movie like this, and even if she didn't ruined her character, she wasn't impressive either...Besides the screenplay & editing problems, 'Tombstone' have a couple of great and virtuously staged scenes, like the long walk and consequent gunfight at the O.K. Curral and the earlier confrontation between Biehn's Johnny Ringo and Kilmer's Doc Holliday in the Saloon, which are a joy to watch and because of that, the movie got its merit, but for a long, epic and more insightful view on Wyatt Earp's life, please go watch the Lawrence Kasdan's 'Wyatt Earp' ('94) starring Kevin Costner as Earp and an almost unrecognizable / skinny, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday.
It may be too long and boring for less demanding fans, but it's a much better written and directed film, and even if it flopped when it was released, it stands today as the definitive Wyatt Earp's biopic. Fans of 'Dances with Wolves' or 'Open Range' (both with Costner directing and acting in it) will love the film.",8,2,3,6 February 2018
Heat," Grim, stylish, sophisticated, well written, photographed & directed, surely among Michael Mann's best work !!
","'Heat' was publicized as the first movie featuring Pacino and De Niro in the same time frame (excluding of course 'The Godfather - Part II') and was often criticized as not being as memorable as it should have beeen the few scenes they shared in the wide angle shots.First of all, 'Heat' is a brilliantly written film, a modern day tragedy, a crime / thriller epic of great proportions, featuring one of the best heist scenes ever put on camera.
Michael Mann's sense of streets' reality with his stylish visuals was well-known back then, he had already created two of the best TV Shows from the 80's Era: 'Miami Vice' and 'Crime Story' and directed 'Manhunter' ('86), the first ever adaptation of a Thomas Harris' novel featuring the Hannibal Lektor / Lecter character and 'L.A. Takedown' ('89), a pilot for a new TV Show that was not acquired by the network and became a TV film. This flm became the basis for 'Heat'. What Mann could not tell in just hour and a half, he made it again, only this time the way he envisioned with a much larger budget and an all star cast.De Niro was the first joining the venture and convinced his friend and acting rival, Al Pacino of the possibilities of the well-written screenplay under the sophisticated direction of Mann and with this two Oscar winners on board, every actor performing in the 90's wanted to be part of 'Heat', including Val Kilmer, that shot his part on a break of filming 'Batman Forever' ('95), and another Oscar Winner, Jon Voight, in his comeback role.The cinematography is top notch, full of aerial shots, showing nice L.A. locations (some of them were the first time ever captured on film, great job of scouting those locations) and during the action sequences make us, the audience, almost being part of it, due to its extreme realism and the way that was shot.
Los Angeles never looked this good since William Friedkin's lost masterpiece of the same genre, 'To Live and Die in L.A.' ('85).The music by Elliot Goldenthal is phenomenal and perfectly adequate to the Michael Mann's visual style and the events on the screen.The work in the editing proccess, supervisioned by Mann himself with the help of 4 editors, ties the movie all together giving it a frantic pace, time for the characters to develop and turning an almost 3 hours film in an unique experience in this genre, it keeps the viewers on the edge of their sits and never gets boring.
Eventually, some scenes needed to be left in the editing room floor due to its length, including some more background on Tom Sizemore's Michael Cheritto character and the cocaine addiction of Pacino's Lt. Vincent Hanna that explains his over-enthusiastic behavior through the film.In terms of the supporting cast, it's one of the best ever assembled, amazing work from such charismatic character actors as Amy Brenneman (a few years before her hit TV Show, 'Judging Amy'); Ted Levine ('The Silence of the Lambs'); Mykelti Williamson ('Forrest Gump'); Kevin Gage (his villanious Waingro entered straight to the pop culture as one of sleaziest ever); Wes Studi (re-teaming with Mann after 'The Last of the Mohicans'); Ashley Judd (in the same year that she starred in 'A Time to Kill' playing a very similar role); the beautiful and underrated Diane Venora ('Bird', 'The Jackal'); Dennis Haysbert ('Major League', 'Navy Seals', 'Love Field'); Tom Noonan (re-teaming with Mann after 'Manhunter'); William Fichtner ('Black Hawk Down', 'Albino Alligator', 'Crash'); punk rock star from 'Black Flag' & 'Rollins Band', Henry Rollins ('The Chase', 'Johnny Mnemonic'); ex-convicted turned actor, Danny Trejo ('Runaway Train', 'Desperado', 'Machete'); Hank Azaria ('The Birdcage'); ex-stuntman & martial arts performer, Jerry Trimble, in his first mainstream role and even a young Natalie Portman (in her only second film after the outstanding debut in 'L√©on' one year before). Jeremy Piven ('Entourage') & Xander Berkeley (which played Waingro in the original 'L.A. Takedown') appear each one in one scene.The central characters of Pacino and De Niro have many layers and even if playing opposites as the cop and the robber, they are almost similar in attitude and that passion of 'get the job done'. The two characters (also the two actors) respect each other so much that they even bond on screen.
Pacino owns the show defying even his own Tony Montana's outbursts, with De Niro playing his role more restrained.Val Kilmer is solid, sporting an acceptable wig; Tom Sizemore is always a joy to watch and Jon Voight is playing the part of another ex-convict turned actor (& writer). Eddie Bunker (Voight's co-star in 'Runaway Train', 'Reservoir Dogs') .In short, 'Heat' is one of the best films that came out on the 90's Era, a great way to spend an after diner night at the movies. Grab your popcorn and beer and watch or revisit this masterwork of heist films.I give it a 9 close to 9.5 !!",9,0,1,28 May 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Boring, trite, lacklustre and too much toned down, just a rehash of 'Raiders', pleading forgiveness for the masterpiece 'Doom'.
","I still don't understand why this movie became the fans' favorite, when the vastly superior 'Doom' is constantly bashed. I was lucky enough to watch the original three in the cinema and i've watched them by the correct chronological order: my first was 'Doom', then a rerun of 'Raiders' and 5 years later as a teen, enthusiastically attended the release of 'Crusade', but it ended with me lefting the movie theater in a total state of disappointment. Where do i start ?Firstly, it lacks the sense of action and adventure, the sarcasm, the edgy and the goosebumping thrills from the previous two installments. When we think or talk about the most memorable scenes from this franchise, 'Raiders' have the most iconic and unforgettable opening in the South American jungle, like if a comic book came alive; the sequence in Nepal when Indy and Marion reunite; the swordsman in Cairo; the Well of Souls; the truck chase and so on. 'Doom' have a glamourish opening which reminds the classical musicals from the Hollywood golden age, mixed with the exotic war dramas from the 30's & 40's and the early James Bond films, plus the plane crash; the spike chamber; the black sleep of Kali Ma; Mola Ram (which was one of the most sinister villains ever put on film); the mine chase and the rope bridge.
'Crusade' have a lacklustre opening sequence, where Indy, at the young age of 13 and in the total of 10 minutes screen time, acquires all his future trademarks: 'It belongs to a Museum'; the ophidiophobia; the chin scar; the mastering of the whip and even his Fedora hat given away by a man who was supposed to be Abner Ravenwood, the future Indy's mentor, but he was ended up credited in the cast list as 'Fedora Guy', because Lucas at the last moment, opted to exclude the Abner connection. One of his first dumb moves.
To the rest of the film, the two beards gave us a tepid boat chase; the rescue on the Castle Brunwald; the zeppelin; the tank chase in the desert, which was an unimaginative rehash of 'Raiders', and the anti-climatic, to not saying boring, finale.Secondly, the MacGuffin in this one wasn't as exciting as the Ark of Covenant or the Sankara Stones, and once again it's a Jewish / Catholic artifact that resembles too much the Ark and even have the greedy Nazis as the evil nemesis, searching for the power of the Grail to make an invencible army. Not wanted to repeat myself, but once again, the germans are collaborating with a foreigner scholar, not Belloq who died 2 years before during the events of the Ark, but Donovan.Thirdly, the characters, Ford has been saying that this one is his favorite Indy, but what he said doesn't mean that it rings true, because he looks bored and uninterested for almost the entire movie and his acting feels more like a mix of spoofing Indy and playing Harrison Ford, than the Indiana Jones we all loved. His lack of conviction is apparent here, he grew tired of the character after the difficult shoot of 'Doom' and around this time, he was establishing himself in more serious roles in drama films. Connery was a case of mere stunt casting, not because he was the best actor to play Indy's dad, but the two beards wanted the former James Bond in it, and Sean was fresh from his Oscar winning role in the B.O. Hit, 'The Untouchables' and became a trend again after almost a decade into oblivion.
Connery's roles in the acclaimed, 'The Name of the Rose' and the sleeper hit, 'Highlander', in which he played the witty old mentor to younger heroes, convinced Spielberg & Lucas that he could do the same for Ford and cash-in on Connery's crescent popularity. The executives at Paramount, applauded.Poor old Connery delivers an inspired performance with lots of heart and integrity, which earned him the SAG and BAFTA nominations, and no question about that, but he wasn't the best pick to play Henry Jones, Sr. Charlton Heston should have been cast. Not only he resembled much more Ford in the looks, acting style and 'screen persona', but also Heston's jungle adventure movies from the 50's, such as 'The Naked Jungle' or 'Secret of the Incas', were the obvious inspirations to Indiana Jones. Even more than James Bond.The late great Denholm Elliott, returns as Marcus Brody, this time more than a glorified cameo, he's also into the adventure of tracking the Grail, except that in 'Raiders', Spielberg & Lucas established the character as an adventurer and an archaeologist like Indy in his younger days, but he only serves here the purpose of the buffoon, the comic relief, a distracted erudit that 'gets lost in his own Museum' and sometimes looks and acts as if he's suffering from Alzheimer.John Rhys-Davies also returns in this installment, but his character Sallah have as much importance to the plot as his brother-in-law's camels. A total waste of two great actors and two beloved characters from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.Julian Glover and Alison Doody are too weak villains, they look like Disney Channel next to Arnold Toht or Mola Ram.
Sexy and doll faced, Doody is certainly the nicest Indy Girl to look at, a delicious eye pleaser, but the worst in the acting department, and Glover is not a fill-in for Belloq's sophisticated and flamboyant eeriness, not even by a mile.
Michael Byrne as Colonel Ernst Vogel is the only menacing villain, but he's just supporting, at least they should have made his character more prominentLast, River Phoenix, sporting a late 80's haircut style, played Indy at age 13 in 1912, a bit 'off', but we can accept that as Indy is well-known for being a misfit. The late actor gave an acceptable performance as young Indy, after he played Ford's son in the underrated, 'The Mosquito Coast', where he studied his mannerisms and dialogue delivery.'Crusade' was scripted and made like this for both beards 'play it safe', after the bad reviews over 'Doom', they opted to dumb down 'Raiders' and offer 'Crusade' as a lacklustre crowd-pleaser, that is more a comedy than an adventure film. They atoned the dark, cynical and sarcastic aspects from the first two, in exchange to the politically correct and lighthearted afternoon flick in which Harrison Ford and Sean Conney sometimes it looks like they're playing Abbott and Costello in search for the Grail.It still have incredible production values: the filming locations such as Venice; great cinematography by Douglas Slocombe; the master musical score from John Williams (even if it was the weakest from the original trilogy); the stunning art & costume design and some impressive stunt work, but it painfully lacks in everything else from the acting to the tone, the trite directing and the unimaginative script.Neither Ford's heart, Lucas or Spielberg, were within the making of 'Crusade', and the magic started to disappear only in its third film (the Indiana Jones franchise could have been the next 007), maybe making this the last film (before the revival with 'Crystal Skull', that was a mess of bad CGI, blue screen and terrible cinematography), was a good decision by the main trio.As an overall saturday afternoon film, i rate it a 7, but as an Indiana Jones film i rate it a 5, so my final vote is a 6.",6,1,3,8 October 2017
The Birds," 'It's the end of the world !!' - yelled the drunken Doomsayer at the diner. An interspecies birds launch an attack on humans in the small coastal town of Bodega Bay.
","Coming from a last night screening of 'The Birds' in a drive-in theater, i decided to write the review here of one of Hitchcock's most critically misunderstood films, even if it's one of his most cherished & well known towards the general public.Firstly, it's undeniable how much 'The Birds' influenced the postmodernist horror & suspense cinema, from George A. Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' to Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws'; John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13', 'Halloween' and particularly, 'The Fog' or more recently Frank Darabont's 'The Mist', the sense of dread provided by a menace surrounding a group of individuals in a small coastal town became the pinnacle of a genre that still attracts millions of viewers.Secondly, Hitchcock's use of silence (no orchestration was used), except for the sound effects to create the birdcalls and noises, was a genious and inovative decision from the Master (Hitchcock had already used this gimmick in 'Lifeboat'), it created the perfect eerie tone for the film.Thirdly, the special effects and animatronics were outstanding for the early 60's standards, and it still holds well and way more realistic (the attacking birds and their interaction with the actors) than the nowadays' use of the overexposed C.G.I.
The way that scenes were staged and photographed by Hitchcock's usual cinematographer, Robert Burks (the visual craftsman behind Hitch's most celebrated films such as 'Dial M For Murder', 'Rear Window', 'Vertigo' or 'North by Northwest') were unique and inovative (it even amazed the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa who included 'The Birds' in his top 100 films ever made, using a technical and artistic criteria).Fourthly, the plot was loosely based on the 1952 short-story of the same name by the British Novelist, Dame Daphne du Maurier (who also penned 'Rebecca' & 'Jamaica Inn', two previous Hitchcock's film adaptations), but the screenplay by Evan Hunter was expanded to include new characters and sub-plots for the full length movie to work, hence the entire first act developing the relationship between the two main characters and 'the third wheel' who lives in the coastal town of Bodega Bay, where the main action takes place.The reason why the interspecies of birds attacked people during that fateful weekend was indeed left unexplained, maybe due to the imperfections of the human race (every character in the movie was written as having major flaws) and we're a condemned species after all and nature and the animals, the worthy and the pure ones who will inherit Earth, will come and take their toll.Last, but not the least, the cast. Nathalie Kay 'Tippi' Hedren (which is, with Peter Griffith, the parents of the Academy Award Nominee, Melanie Griffith), a former fashion model who was discovered by the Master when he saw her in a TV commercial, he put her under his wing and gave her an education in filmmaking, which is way evident in her screen debut in 'The Birds'. She's total confident in the role of Melanie Daniels and made the camera her own, following the footsteps of Hitch's other famous blondes such as Grace Kelly or Kim Novak.'Tippi', and now the tastes may differ, is probably the most beautiful of all the Hitchcock's leading actresses, she had a some kind of innocence, but at the same time a mysterious nuance throughout her on-screen personna and debuting at 32 years old on cinema she had much more class and self-confidence as a woman than Grace Kelly in her 20's trying to stole the focus in 'Rear Window' or 'Dial M for Murder'.
Her performance here as Melanie Daniels and as the title character in the Hitch's follow-up work, 'Marnie', where she delivered even a greater performance, are absolutely fascinating.Rod Taylor was cast as the male lead when Hitch opted for a cheaper actor (Connery wasn't avaiable because he was shooting his second entry in the Bond universe: 'From Russia with Love', but he was later used as 'Tippi' Hedren's charming co-lead in 'Marnie') than his usual lead stars of Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant. He wanted to make a film about the unexplained bird attacks, not about Hollywood's established hearthtrobs and stardom, so he keeped it low profile. 
The surly rugged, but wooden actor, who looked at least 10 years older than his actual age and could have matched better with his on-screen mother (played here by an over-the-top, but future Oscar winner Jessica Tandy) than 'Tippi', was not the perfect choice for the 'Mitch' Brenner character, but in his defense he didn't ruined it and, in a matter of fact, he fared better doing his beefcake action routine during the birds attacks scenes, than in the more intimate and sensitive moments with Hedren.To contrast his ladies, brunette Suzanne Pleshette was specifically hired by Hitch to play Rod Taylor's former fiancee, the school teacher Annie Hayworth, and she was jealous throughout principal photography of 'Tippi' having all the director's attention and being the lead star in the film, and maybe that bitterness enhanced her supporting performance. 
She's very good, especially during the initial confrontation with 'Tippi'.Former child star and future adult actress, Veronica Cartwright, better known as Lambert in Ridley Scott's sci-fi / horror classic 'Alien', is appropriate as Rod Taylor's much younger sister. Again he looked more his father than his older brother.To summarize, 'The Birds' isn't Hitchcock's american masterpiece film, that honor belongs undoubtedly to 'Vertigo', but it's one of his most daring and technically accomplished works. The birds as characters may not be as memorable as Anthony Perkins' rendition of Norman Bates in 'Psycho', but they're still quite effective and the movie deserves to be re-praised as one of the greatest entries in the filmography of 'The Master of Suspense'.",10,1,1,27 August 2018
