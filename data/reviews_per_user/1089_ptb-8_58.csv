Saturday Night Fever," The TAXI DRIVER of disco musicals
","I believe that Saturday NIGHT FEVER in its original 118 minute R+ version is genuinely one of the great dramas of the 70s, a film so severe, that I liken it to TAXI DRIVER in its relentless scathing depiction of NY life in the 70s. When first released in Australia in 1977 it was the full, full on, foul mouthed vicious version that I astonishingly saw in free to air TV in Sydney last night (on a 9.30pm slot). This R+ version had not been seen here for almost 30 years and only existed in its PG re release that played endlessly as a double feature with GREASE thru the 80s. Amusingly that is exactly how it played last night with GREASE prior at 7.30pm. All that aside, SNF with its scalding expose of the lives of these 20 somethings is a superb film, and for all those moaning about it not being fun because it is a musical... well it is not supposed to be fun... it is a damning comment on the uneducated and ignorance of the lives depicted. If you seek a fun musical then see STEP UP which is NY similar but nowhere as courageous and fully realised as this film. In 1978 with underage fans screaming to be let in, it was considered smart to cut 10 minutes out, dub over all the swearing (especially the two times Travolta says 'c*nt' in the same sentence, all the references and scenes to car sex...) and make it PG friendly... and it certainly was a success. But if you want a 'Scorsese version' as originally released, and you can tell drama from drivel, then this full R+ version is for you. I have never seen a better damning of an uneducated bunch of cruel insensitive people in any film... and if there is a moral to this cinematic thrashing... it is that if you are not educated then you will end up like this lot. Brit director John Badham has drawn well from the equally vicious portrayals seen in the 'kitchen sink' dramas made in Britain in the early 60s like 'Saturday Night And Sunday Morning' or THIS SPORTING LIFE where the working class who are bogged in their ignorance keep returning to an emotional bruising cycle of behaviour until one just plain stops and looks at himself. Like Tony does in this film. I also believe the scene with Karen Lyn Gorney and Travolta in the empty apartment they consider renting is one of the great moments in any American film (she is sitting on the window sill). This is a great film, uncompromising in its depiction of that 'lifestyle' cornered through ignorant mean-ness into delusion and nowhere. Perfectly realised. then cut to a PG. See the original.",9,11,17,8 September 2007
Black Swan," The Nut-crack-up? Creature from Swamp Lake?
","SHE'S CRACKING UP screams the poster for this jaw dropping new film which just might be the cinema world's very first horror ballet movie. In Australia we have a poster of porcelain beauty Natalie Portman with a big plaster crack from her jaw to her brain. Subtle it is not. A bit like the mad dolly toy that rattled from under the bed in a Pixar 'toon. This film, with especially hilarious moments for the slow learners in the audience to know that SHE'S CRACKING UP plays it like a mix of a Joan Crawford 60s shocker like STRAIGHT JACKET or BERSERK except that in BLACK SWAN we get THE (blood) RED SHOES as if played by Audrey Hepburn still in WAIT UNTIL DARK mode. While not quite the lurid standard of 60s guignol tabloid mania we sure are in the same league for some of the way. Hilarious and tingling scenes abound eg: Mommy Dearest played by Barbara Hershey, and especially the headless legless ballerina toy still twirling away on the music box to the off key deranged tinkling music. Mix in some sexual ALL ABOUT EVE understudy antics, add some FORTY SECOND STREET rehearsal calamities with the director berating the fragile star, pepper in some WAIT UNTIL DARK apartment creepiness, even 70s hi art junk like EYES OF LAURA MARS and voil√†: Natalie Portman looking like Audrey Hepburn in a Crawford-esque shocker pirouetting The Red Shoes for good measure: and serve it up with murky colorless digicam wobble vision with too many close-up stalker-vision moments. The BLACK SWAN even has her sprout a few feathers and smash a mirror and show us blood that might not be there. While not quite the female answer to NORMAN BATES ON ROLLER SKATES we are however in spinning madness territory, sort of a ballet-horror RED RIDING HOOD parable: first period for a virgin mental anguish, and the discarding of girlhood playthings (see the stuffed bed toys get shoved in the furnace) ... BLACK SWAN is no doubt a startling and hilarious ballet film about overwhelming pressure to get laid to become a temptress so you can dance properly in a black tutu. How Euro-horror can we get here? I expected to find this was secretly directed by the ghost of Mario Bava. THE CREATURE FRIOM THE BLACK LAGOON and BLACK SWAN have a lot in common........ BLACK SWAN delivers and the swirling marsh madness of our little horny ballerina stepping up (and out of her mind) to deliver the performance of a life time makes for a real horror movie leaping about on tippy toes while you sit there bug eyed at the sheer lurching hallucination of it all. Maybe it is meant to be funny. You should see BURLESQUE as a chaser, it is almost the same but knows it is silly. All BLACK SWAN needed was some torn fishnet stockings and BURLESQUE SWAN could easily be ready to go.",8,1,4,27 January 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," Tragic faux 'noir' drivel
","Babble repartee is not wit. Idiot editing is not dynamic. Covoluted storyline jumble and flashback is obvious. Josh Hartnett used to be interesting, Lucy Liu is petulant and as 'the sexy neighbor who lets herself in needing a cup of sugar' is possibly the lamest extent this 'Noir for those who do not know what noir is but have heard if it and want to call something NOIR' can make. THE WRONG MAN aka LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN is just mean jumbled crime rubbish posing as something interesting. It is a hoax noir and you are advised to see some genuine noir instead. Smart arse dialog and chop chop editing does not make a noir; and Hartnett seriously needs a new agent. Hopeless. Seems intent in adding an atrocity to chat about per minute in the offensively stupid script. Another violent crude Tarantino wannabe. Just listen to how many times Lucy repeats everything Hartnett says but back to him as a question. AWFUL. Joke line: 'He's sorry that he hit you' ... apparently this is funny in this film. Ben Kingsley should slap himself and repay his cheque to charity for taking part in this nonsense. AWFUL.",2,5,13,13 November 2008
Deja Vu," I saw something... but I got epilepsy
","Amid the mili-second edits and screaming wheels, and genuinely silly 'time travel' (!!!!!!!) and Denzel Washington trying to keep a straight face, we have again,... yes, again... in a film called DEJA VU, the usual Bruckheimer visual confetti pelted at the viewer in order to not allow them to think. DEJA VU is just rubbish. I can only imagine the story meeting where ten wannabees each add their 'fave moment' to be inserted into 'an action flick' and presto: the recipe for a variation on 55 other similar films is 'given a surprise twist' (now no surprise). DEJA VU starts with an insulting stunt to the residents of New Orleans wanders into CSI drivel, loops into sci-fi gibberish and then (aw, shucks) goes romantic. In order for us out there in the mallplex cinema no 99 guzzling a mega Coke and chomping through the cheops pyramid sized popcorn to keep gawping in wonder at this dazzling mesmerising experience our trusty producer adds pointless car chases, 'swoosh' sounds between scenes and misty shower scenes, thus fulfilling his shopping list of usual visuals and hilariously calls the whole celluloid hailstorm DEJA VU. Will someone please exhume Walt Disney or Alfred Hitchcock. Please.",2,1,3,6 December 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Carry On Killing
","This film really should be called INDULGENT BASTARD. Sinking dread is a great suspense device in any film, that uneasy feeling of nervousness you get when the characters in whom you have invested some time and emotion get slightly trapped. However, in the tedious sequences in this indulgent serial killing schlock the suspense quickly evaporates and you get to just sit there until someone gets killed. And then, in this 150 minute film, Quentin kills them right before your eyes. You must pay attention because all the hypnotized media wannabees insist you wanna be 'cool' too, but for anyone watching with film with their own genuine heart, brain, and actual courage, well QT the emperor of cruelty has no clothes (again). Once, in older films when someone died it was a tragedy for the character and emotion evoked from the attentive audience. Like when Sonny was killed in The Godfather. Now-days thanks to QT, someone getting killed as cruelly and graphically as his blood-lust allows, it is actually akin what was, in a better film, the punchline of a joke or a song sequence in a musical. Now that he has teamed up with Jewish cinema hatemeister Eli Roth and decided to reboot THE WAR (something each is too young (in every way) to have experienced, they have simply created a Nazi pantomime that is an excuse to dress some out of work actors up as the Third Reich and then graphically kill and disgustingly scalp them right before your appalled eyes. And of course, the gorgeous women in this film get defiled humiliated and mercilessly killed in the most graphic close up QT's fevered misogynist hatred allows. So what's new about this episode of hatred? Well, it is well produced hatred, well photographed hatred and well decorated and designed hatred. Then in apocalyptic episode of bullet spraying hatred, it all burns up and disappears up the rectum of the history of over praised gimmick cinema. I do not care to see Eli Roth ever again, in film or in person, and I seriously wish the entire planet's inhabitants soon realize what a destructive influence he is on young minds. QT's desire to show human beings mercilessly mutilate each other is both unproductive in cinema and a one trick career that might just as easily burn out like the final few scenes in the climax of this pop comic drivel. There are laws against hate crimes and QT needs to have his career as chief hate dude consigned to the cutting room floor. The fact that people get killed in telling stories is one thing, but QT's films aren't just that, nor are they devices to tell a story, they are the whole story: the film exists to graphically show you as much hatred in the most gleeful way possible. And for that I condemn this rotten tedious stupid film.",2,26,66,1 September 2009
Hostel," The gape of Roth
","OH dear, Eli Roth, what do your parents think of your new graphic imagery torture film? Perhaps some Jewish holocaust organization might like to shed some light on exactly what they think of a foul mouthed poo and scalpel jester Jewish boy like you (see Hostel's 'making of' DVD section) actually choosing to write and then film torture imagery that degrades the actors, film industry creatives and lastly the cinemas and audiences? What is the point of HOSTEL apart from wanting to show screaming 20somethings slashed and drilled and being physically destroyed? What does it say about YOU, Eli? Not anything good I suspect. Like Australia's similar abomination WOLF CREEK directed by first time movie business vandal Greg MacLean this is the tourists getting hacked to death imagery. Maybe Roth Maclean and Tarantino are actually the axis of evil. HOSTEL exists for no other reason that to celebrate Tarantino and Roth's delight in human mutilation imagery. Like the cruel businessmen depicted in the film they perform the same act on the audience (giggling hi-fives all round). Yes it makes money, but so does war. To be so young and to have already sold your soul to Tarantino is the greatest horror about HOSTEL. The fact that good young actors like Jay Hernandez (and Heather Mattazzaro in HOSTEL 2) are reduced to appearing in this ugliness is an equal disappointment. Maybe to fill in his time better, some Jewish holocaust organization might educate Roth and pals in the value of human life, that it is not, as the Nazis gleefully enjoyed, a thing to be degraded and mutilated as entertainment. Apparently, according to industry paper Variety, Roth is 'thrilled at how gore audiences have embraced his new horror film...' and that 'HOSTEL 2 will contain more graphic torture, especially on the new torture train...' . Gee isn't that just great for the impressionable teens of tomorrow. Go feed your Grandmother Eli, do something useful. Clean your street. Take some disabled children to see a real movie. One that is creative, not destructive.... actually I just had a thought: wouldn't it be funny if Tarantino and Roth were both crippled in a car crash and had to spend the rest of their lives being fed by old Jewish people in a nursing home..",1,0,4,14 December 2006
Don Jon," Spunky satire about the male tug of love.
","This dynamic new dramedy is a sensational writing and directing debut by the irrepressible Mr JGL. What a presence and what a star he is from this film. I actually felt it an update or a remake of Saturday NIGHT FEVER but smaller scale and crossing much of the same male ego and sexually provocative territory. But updated with new century chrome slickness and filth. It is a good film. Great casting, especially with Tony Danza and young Scarlett, always game for a smutty drama, and here being the emotionally manipulative GF to JGL's ego bastard. Then along comes some mature mind-sex leading into the proper emotion of the story. Clocking in at a slim but sturdy 85 minutes and with far too much product placement including the porn site which actually exists like an 85 minute ad for them, DON JON is fast and furious phallusy entertainment. Unreleased in cinemas in Australia because of the porn advertising site so vigorously displayed, DON JON was no crowd puller at the box office but is a firm favorite on the couch at home. Just like our hero.",8,0,2,22 February 2014
Match Point," not exactly love, is it...
","MP is a riff on A PLACE IN THE SUN. I saw SCOOP and NOTES ON A SCANDAL in October 2006 before I saw MATCH POINT tonight Dec 26 2006. ... Each have something in common with the other. As MATCH POINT was produced first and SCOOP secondly I find that SCOOP is a disgrace, out takes from MATCH POINT like some home movie fun project Allen decided to make for himself whilst still in London with a crew and Scarlett Johanssen. SCOOP now seems more reprehensible than when I first saw it 2 months ago . I also now can see how NOTES ON A SCANDAL came about given the acclaim and perfected London based thriller deception both MATCH and NOTES share. Generally one can see a theme in productions that feed from another's success; remember all the supernatural films that followed THE SIXTH SENSE.... even a copycat one with Cate Blanchett (some forgettable thing called THE GIFT set in a swamp in Louisiana and with Giovanni Ribisi).... now she has one like MATCH POINT called NOTES ON A SCANDAL. Friends told me for 12 months to see MATCH POINT and now seeing it as described above makes for reflection of production that I find rather predictable, a line of films I would otherwise not have linked. Lots of other comments here will explain the story and their own take but all I want to acclaim is three things: it is an excellent thriller with a moral and ethical dilemma that allows fate to take the lead... and I like that very much. also: thank God someone has finally given Jonathan Rhys-Meyers a truly decent great role; he deserves it and I have been interested in his career since VELVET GOLDMINE waiting for someone of note to actually showcase his considerable talents. MI3 and the interest of Tom Cruise does not count. .....and finally: the superbly written character of Chloe, the wife to Chris... what a great role and what a superb clean kind humane female part. I really cared for her character. MATCH POINT is a great film; well written, perfectly cast, supremely suspenseful .... terrifying actually....and not tidy...... reflecting life properly. But when and if you bother seeing the stupid tedious boring self indulgent thin SCOOP it will erase again whatever goodwill MATCH POINT allowed you to have for Allen at this late stage.",7,1,2,26 December 2006
Knocked Up," Knocked up in the edit suite
","Whilst watching this film I became increasingly aware of the bizarre editing. There seemed to be two different versions of the same film made and both edited together to make this one film. One version was a harder more verbally cruel one with anger-humor frat boy slacker (Sandler style) as a weapon and the other almost as a Drew Barrymore style comedy romance. It is as if both were filmed and then spliced together. I can see how neither tone or story angle worked so both were edited together to get this very uneven result. See the film again and then watch the out-takes and deleted scenes... there is material there that is both absurd and repulsive... and also explanatory (where Ben tells his flatmates he cannot live with them anymore, which is not in the final edited movie). Odd things just happen all through KNOCKED UP: There are whole scenes missing, linking scenes that explain why and how they are in the next scene. Ben just goes and rents an apartment; She has his picture on her work desk, as if he is some boyfriend when in the previous scenes she is exasperated with his sloppiness and person; suddenly they go spying on Paul Rudd and walk into a house somewhere... the intros of so many scenes have been chopped off and the viewer is abruptly halfway into another setting or tone or conversation without a smooth or logical segue-way into how or why they are there. Where is the scene where her mother actually meets him? The whole tone swings between vulgarity then really sooky romance then screaming rudeness, then shrewish selfishness, then everyone makes drag-queen style cracks at each other like some screwball comedy throwback (the Asian doctor for example) .. all inconsistent tone, direction editing and dialog. The gratuitous vulgarity and the extreme physical medical crudeness...the screaming subplot about the sister and her husband, the silly little girl rudeness etc... the argument in the car, it is all a jumble of different ideas and directing styles and writing. KNOCKED UP is a jigsaw puzzle edit of these films: ANIMAL HOUSE, MAYBE BABY, LOOK WHO'S TALKING, MONSTER IN LAW, BIG DADDY, American PIE, ROAD TRIP and any other US made crassness where humiliation and abuse is deemed funny. Howvere there is one genuinely inspired and hilarious scene in Las Vegas where Paul Rudd tries to explain why there are 5 different styles of chair in their room. It is as if someone else wrote and directed and edited in that scene too. Maybe KNOCKED UP was made by a committee. It looks and sounds as if it was.",6,0,0,18 June 2009
Shutter Island," yes, it was a dark and stormy night...
","SHUTTER ISLAND is visually one of the most fascinating and compelling films I have ever seen. The eerie Gothic visuals and sodden hospital prison discomfort, lashing rain, wet rocks, cruel sea etc are ingredients that have the viewer really descending into the movie with great interest. Scene after scene is just visually great. However, I have come away with a very dissatisfied feeling about the story denouement and the graphic violence and distressing scenes involving children. With such a rich palette of visuals to celebrate, again Scorscese overdoes the mass murder. For me it was revolting, it yanked me from my enjoyment of the story and the film so greatly that it was actually irritating. One mass murder scene in a concentration camp is just a spandau ballet death gimmick and is really disgusting Tarantino level visual atrocity. The graphic deaths of some children are so meticulously displayed at great length that it is so upsetting that I really mostly felt anger towards the film maker instead of being more immersed in the storyline. Overall it is a fascinating topic and the subplots of WW2 liberation and the trauma from the frontline of day one liberation are excellent plot lines with disturbing results. SHUTTER ISLAND might be a better watch the second and third time around and I hope I can plunge more into it's Gothic hospital cyclone of fear and hallucination more. I want so to really embrace this film. I am just so sick of Scorcese's irritating desire to whack us with atrocity visuals when it need not be so explicit. Anyone who loves THE WICKER MAN (1973 version) and LA CONFIDENTIAL and THE INNOCENTS and THE SIXTH SENSE will get a terrific charge from the art direction and set design and Val Lewton style RKO noir imagery. Again Leonardo displays his remarkable talent for really being the character. He is absolutely perfect. SHUTTER ISLAND like CASINO before is flawed by the Scorcese atrocity excess but redeemed by the fantastic tech qualities and acting.",8,0,1,13 November 2010
Watchmen," Computer geek porn violence
","THE WATCHMEN is a disaster. Relentlessly pessimistic brutal misogynist and silly, this supposed post-modern take on Lycra and rubber clowns who bounce about Manhattan maiming and bashing men and whacking women is a tedious repellent bore. It is almost 3 hours and in its bloated self importance and endless image borrowing from other sci fi nonsense, it becomes excruciating to watch for any and every reason that rolls through your head. Try this loony cinematic sci fi combo: DUNE + THE FOUNTAIN + BLADE RUNNER + TRANSFORMERS + BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED + some Lord Skeletor crap + COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK + THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN+ a Columbia serial of the 40s like THE PHANTOM + CAPTAIN MARVEL + STARGATE + WALL STREET ... it just becomes an endless parade of borrowed images from these films with ugly cruelties meted out relentlessly with bone smashing fights and vicious hatred of the female form. The OWL dude just looks like Hamish the gay Teletubbie and Billy Crudup's testicles put in a better performance than him as a whole. He is all nude and bright fluorescent blue and often seems to be searching for his underpants. At one stage he goes to live on Mars in a big clockwork toffee. The ultimate poof bad guy I think is called Adrian and has an art deco codpiece. He ends up somewhere in outer-space in a Styrofoam pyramid compete with a mangy pet and plastic Sphinxes. Jackie Earle Hayley acts better with a bag over his head because when it is removed all he can do is hiss a midget Clint Eastwood imitation from ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ. Every scene and character exists solely to display pulverizing violence or disgusting imagery of death decay urban ugliness weapons and brutality that is beyond belief. It is a failure rarely seen and I hope never again. It is like Tarantino's pervert version of the missing reels from BLADE RUNNER and STAR TREK. And Stephen McHattie! He survived MOVING VIOLATION in 1976 and if this is his comeback role then oblivion is a better choice. I can give you 300 reasons to avoid THE WATCHMEN.",4,9,19,9 March 2009
Cast Away," South x South-West Pacific
","I just had the unexpectedly strange and very moving experience of seeing CAST AWAY for the first time with a 39 year old male friend who is deeply traumatized because he is estranged from his pretty blonde wife and gorgeous young children. He lives in a coastal holiday resort; palm trees, hibiscus and mountain cliffs. His complete inability to previously express his agonizing emotional solitude whilst living here (in Australia) in paradise had him descend into sobbing heartbreak throughout in a way I have never previously witnessed. He kept exclaiming to the screen (and Hank's emotive performance and situation) 'This is ME, This is how I am feeling' and for the first time in many years was able to melt, awash with emotional relief at being able to translate his feelings whilst watching the ordeal in play. It was an astonishing paralyzing experience for me to share with him and it has as of today (today!) allowed him to seek the help and professional guidance with a degree of confidence and heartfelt understanding previously unavailable to him. So I had a double feature! A real life human drama in the room with me, and the film itself! It all added to the experience of having someone alongside who was living CAST AWAY for real in his own heart and head. Maybe if you have a distressed friend unable to break into or out of the emotional knot caused by bereaved family loss, this film will allow a way forward. It worked for us. any way.....One has to hand it to Hanks though for a front and center performance that allows every man watching to see his everyman persona on show and apt in every movement and emotion. CAST AWAY is a magnificent looking film, in c/s and on a huge screen it must be astonishing; great plane disaster set pieces and tropical traps, hilarious and heartbreaking Robinson Crusoe level drama and photography and sound design worthy of Oscars. I was queasy about all the FedEx 'ads' throughout but agreed in the end it was a great device. I especially liked the North By Northwest farm locale seen early and late in the film... and even the positive denouement allowing a realistic life pointer to be an acceptable ending. For a few moments there in the final act, I gripped the seat in apprehension hoping the schmaltz possible wasn't about to really happen. I would watch CAST AWAY again, in fact I want to and will start from the terrifying and spectacular plane crash through the excellent compelling Island sequences and exit with the ocean tanker in the background. CAST AWAY is a uniquely American film success, too long in the last act, and perfectly realized in all the island scenes by the irreplaceable Tom Hanks. I thank you and my pal is today able to move on as well. Other similar theme movies worth seeing are: 'Man Friday' (1975) with Peter O'Toole as Crusoe and Richard Roundtree as Man Friday, and the excellent LOST style telemovie made by Universal in 1969 called LOST FLIGHT which stars Anne Francis. (see my comments for that elsewhere).... and of course the best of the lot, the original version of LORD OF THE FLIES (1963).",7,3,4,26 June 2006
North by Northwest," climb The 39 Steps, meet The Man Who Knew Too Much....
","Endlessly entertaining and almost perfectly created in its Hollywood way NBNW is as smooth, sly and 'beautifully 50s' as a romantic thriller can be. I urge readers to get the sensational DVD recently released, it is fish tank clear and almost 3D visually. Also released in stores now is a superb 'Bernard Hermann Plays Hitchcock' CD on the market which has 'The North By NorthWest Symphony'. This music track when played LOUD when you are by yourself at home allows you to 'do a Risky Business' and whilst wearing your underpants like Tom Cruise, throw yourself about the lounge room conducting the orchestra. Make sure nobody can see you! Hermann's score is possibly one of the top three for a glossy thriller. However, some parts of can be heard previously in the 1952 RKO thriller ON DANGEROUS GROUND, as can bits used from that film later in TAXI DRIVER. Everyone has their person favorite Hitchcock thrillers and mine certainly those from the 50s like THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and VERTIGO as well as NBNW. Finally, after 228 comments for this film, why are people telling the story of this film as their comment? If I read one more entry that states; Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who...' I will scream again. It says COMMENT not SYNOPSIS. People do the same thing for SINGIN IN THE RAIN and GONE WITH THE WIND too! As if nobody knows what these films are about already! Yeesh.",10,1,2,5 March 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Pulverising porn violence
","What a disgusting mess or cinematic wreckage, and abusing the fantastic talents of Nick Stahl and Claire Daines. This is a horrible cruel and stupid film in which every single thing and person on screen gets smashed. One absolutely vile sequence sets the scene for future woman beating where two terminators, a woman and a man beat the cogs out of each other culminating where the man smashes the woman's head onto a toilet bowl shattering the porcelain. Whio made this imbecile crap? What's it's market? Blood and cruelty perverts? I am aghast at the whole production that seems intent in showing the worst of any behavior, robotic humanoids or not. The toilet fight and beating is the worst on screen bashing of a 'woman' by a 'man' I have ever seen... and this vile film is scrap like the rubble of the metal on screen. Headache inducing 'action' and imbecile violence galore. I hope Nick and Claire got well paid but it is as awful a paycheck as Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsdale agreeing to work in the equally disgusting porn cruelty horror VACANCY.",2,0,4,19 September 2010
Dreamgirls," Dream on and on and on.
","This is a colossal musical in every sense of the cinemascope word. Basically the story of Diana Ross the Supremes and the rise of Motown, and a megaton musical hit for those who did not know about the Broadway show DREAMGIRLS delivers over and over again. It actually made me curious to again see the mid 70s musicals MAHOGANY and BINGO LONG and perhaps even LADY SINGS THE BLUES. Jennifer Hudson's 15 minute Streisand level showstopper belting crying and pleading her way through 'I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' is the FUNNY GIRL/Don't rain on my parade piece most musical fans have been searching for since 1968. Well she delivers and the film shifts gear and upward into legend status because of it. Perhaps a little too exhausting in the delivery of every song (each is belted and troweled onto your face) it more than balances in the superb art direction, costumes and acting. DREAMGIRLS is glorious and massive, a satisfying musical achievement. I look forward to an encore and encourage you to see it.",8,1,5,25 December 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Catch 22 for ticket buyers
","About 45 minutes into this tedious vanity piece you realize it is just that: a tedious vanity piece almost to prove that George Clooney can get any idea funded that he chooses (He is a also producer of this film). While we all like George and his pals running amok in the Middle East wars for the purpose of cinema satire on the ridiculous wars there, it is just not right to make such a loose film and see it deflate at the one hour mark so the viewer just sits there waiting for it to end in the vain hope that it might have a punchline. There is a joke: the ticket price.. the punchline: George earns another few $$million. No joke really. CATCH 22 and SLAUGTERHOUSE 5 and MASH did it all better 40 years ago. Recent cinema skirmishes like THREE KINGS and SYRIANA and other Clooney boys-own love-ins did too. I was left wondering exactly who was acting the goat in this one. JARHEAD remains the best of the recent lot. Watch that again.",3,3,6,10 January 2011
Jarhead," a well MASH-ed American Beauty
","I love the smell of anti war celluloid in the morning. Today's session had many male ticket-buyers and their friends staring at this excellent new anti war film by master director Sam Mendes. I was particularly impressed by the superb production values, the exact casting and later in the film, the iconic imagery re created largely in eye fooling miniatures and special effects. This is Donnie Darko in Iraq, 1991. I did not recognize Jamie Foxx and Peter Skaarsgard until late in the film...I almost thought I was seeing a Wayan and a Sutherland. Sam Mendes has a superb eye for detail and composition...and why you are seeing something the way he is showing it. To me this identifies a very good director. I believe JARHEAD is a very post modern take on a sad corner of American war like politics, a sign of waste and cruelty for economic reasons and as the scene on the bus at homecoming shows, a hollow victory wrapped in disillusionment and emotional bewilderment. What a great film! It just makes you cheer for the upside of free speech the USA chants (the same free speech that gets abused when crap like DEVILS REJECTS is made).......... JARHEAD is a perfect 2006 film for Dads to take their teenage sons to and have much to discuss and bond about later. More than anything it shows the evil in the detail of Marine life, the reality of the Mom in Farenheit 911 whose son's life was wasted by Bush's recruitment drive through unemployed teens in miserable US cities laid waste by politics and greed.",8,0,2,20 February 2006
54," the last days of disco
","If you have a great home sound system and a big plasma TV then 54 can be a spectacular home experience. Unlike the real thing. STUDIO 54 as a disco scene is legendary but lemme tell ya, in Sydney in 1988-1994 we had the gigantic real thing: massive and spectacular dance parties (no NOT raves) but massive disco nights in a place that held 5000 people and staged Busby Berkeley sized massive dance entertainment. See any Kylie Minogue concert today to get a sense of we had for free at the time! They were called RAT parties and BACCHANALIA events. Often our own big disco clubs competed and it was massive and musical and a throb of wild night fun unlike anything I have seen in any movie anywhere. STUDIO 54 as a small movie version of what we know as gigantic and real in our own Australian lives and makes us look like Hollywood epic disco. What is in this film is quite puny and tacky compared to the real thing here. I thought the film was a good but could have been great disco drama. There has always been a call for a great BIG disco film or a dance party spectacular and Saturday NIGHT FEVER and 54 and even parts of WEST SIDE STORY about as close as we will get I guess. Ryan Phillippe is cute and Adonis and well cast as the pretty chipmunk bar boy, Brecken Myer believable in their NY suburban angst.... as is all the cast esp the girls Selma Hyack and gorgeous Neve Campbell...however the dialog at the end of the film where they reconcile is truly lame and lets the film down. I real life these characters would both end up as prostitutes. But it is Mike Myer pulling off another creepy performance (see CAT IN THE HAT for the other) that is the core of the film. Studio 54 as depicted in this almost-there setting looks like a stinky old cinema with nut-case clients and ghastly B grade celebrities. (Do The Time Warp, anyone?)I am glad I wasn't there for real as what happened here was real and astonishing. I hear there is a very sleazy and sexually explicit directors cut of 54 and that would be more to the mark as this is an almost-Disney version of what we can see had greater depths of nude depravity... all to a pulsating disco beat!",7,1,1,11 July 2010

","I have racked my brain to see what limits I can put on my sadness and disgust at this SAW franchise. So far I have made it through 1 2 and the vile 3. These films are a celebration of hatred and mutilation presented to 20 year olds to develop their taste for pitiless violence towards distressed victims. As graphic as pornography and as pulverizing as a steel-mill, these films are made to traumatize..... and then promise the spectacle of victim violence mixed with humiliation irrationality and plain viciousness. It makes a recipe for some sort of Corporate mind destruction towards young people who have not had much experience in humanity... so these films are designed to pour acid onto their young optimistic minds, to vandalize the senses and to entertain criminals... and develop a taste for inhuman destruction of the human body as 'a fun experience'. It also saddens me greatly that the original films were created by immature Australian boys who were seized upon by the American Corporate Machine that specializes in making sure these vicious pitiless traumatic exercises in evil reach the widest audience possible. These films are designed to show you hatred. To make a spectacle of the hatred and for you and your kids to enjoy watching the hatred. The relentless destruction of the human form pantomiming as 'scary fun' is probably the biggest most insidious evil permeating our 'culture'. Hooray for Hollywood as it is from there that this emanates; no other country exports so much visual hatred as America. No wonder less and less people go to the cinemas. Seeing other humans screaming in pain begging for their lives and dying in agony from mutilating wounds is so very sad in any film. For it to become a 'horror genre' is an absolute tragedy and a massive challenge in this early part of a bright new century. This section of what was an exciting vibrant film industry was once applauded for 'cinema verite' .........now it is to be condemned for what has mutated into 'cinema cruelite'. There is nowhere for these torture chamber films to go.... unless baby beating is forthcoming. (Eli Roth? sounds spossible)....",1,3,6,31 October 2007
Tropic Thunder," The Three Amigos do Apocalypse Now
","Sorta occasionally funny but not a FUNNY as it demands you find it. TROPIC THUNDER is the Three Stooges meets THE PLAYER or as my title says THE THREE AMIGOS do APOCALYPSE NOW. Another hybrid farce full of screams blood and humiliation passing as modern 21st century American comedy, TROPIC THUNDER is tedious and derivative and if you have seen the truly funny THREE AMIGOS where three B grade has-been film stars end up in a real war... it might seem a bit familiar. However as usual Robert Downey Jr saves the day, Ben Stiller shows that he really IS Zoolander and Tom Cruise goes for the wacky star cameo with false nose (Hello Nicole) and bald wig. Jack Black is as usual awful. The fake movie previews at the start at the most inventive and funniest and I for one would prefer to have watched 100 minutes of those.",5,2,5,18 October 2010
Blue Crush," Lemon squash....
","Good looking but ultimately routine surfing drama with 3 girl lead actors instead of guys.... offers more than it delivers mainly because there isn't a lot the producers can do with the material that hasn't been seen already in IN GODS HANDS or BIG Wednesday or even NORTH SHORE or Brit silliness BLUE JUICE or Australian travesties like LIQUID BRIDGE. In between great looking surf footage is the usual suburban TV level scenes in semi squalor, wild parties and teen arguments... or silly scenes in the workplace (hotel chambermaid scenes that are disgusting and just plain ugly....toilet bowls and condoms....ugh, yawn etc). Aimed squarely at teen audiences... primarily girls, and with the added butch aggro in the usual cranky performance by Michelle Rodriguez, there is absolutely nothing in this film for adults... sadly even those young adults in their 20s.",5,1,2,13 January 2008
1941," its a mad mad mad mad war
","This film is hilarious. And it has the most dynamic and exciting demolition-swing dance number I have ever seen on film. Overproduced to almost overspend it opened in 1979 to raspberry reviews and cinemas full of thoroughly entertained crowds. The sheer insanity of the tone and the massive set pieces, expansive model work layouts, spectacular and epic crowd madness and the sheer relentless comic book feel of the whole thing really appealed to me and many thousands of others I saw it with at my cinema. 1941 is Mad Mad Mad World and 3 STOOGES madness rolled into a colossal demolition derby and I for one just love it. Terrific teen actors like Bobby Di Ciccio, handsome under rated Treat Williams and the sadly recently passed Wendy Jo Sperber add enormously to the marquee names of Belushi and Akroyd. Stallwart stars like Slim Pickins and Warren Oates and especially Robert Stack crying thru DUMBO just make me love the nuttiness behind every idea pelted at me. I would like to see the longer version. I suspect most people who admire this massive production would too.....for any one of 100 reasons from casting to design to music to set construction to the fantastic model work... and especially the runaway ferris wheel.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Citizen Kong
","And, It's terrific! RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a very good action film that is good science fiction and not science preposterous. Emotionally engaging and with a constant wow-factor and an excellent use of CGI, the result is a major new franchise of intelligent APE movies (hopefully with James Franco) and a sequel run that is as well though and planned as this. I had no idea it would be this good. Others on this site will tell you the story and salivate accordingly over various actors and details, but the ultimate factor that sets this new film above the years CGI action output is that this film has a strong heart and a very plausible storyline. Scenes of Apes amok in San Fran are a major jolt, only lurching into silliness occasionally (Gorilla vs helicopter). I saw it in a digital presentation on a huge screen in a good cinema with excellent sound, and I hope you do too.",Null,0,2,17 September 2011
Behind The Candelabra," 88 keys to the magic kingdom
","This seriously funny and quite heartbreaking biography of Liberace works so completely well that you actually forget what the real Liberace looked like. The fearless performances of both Douglas and Damon with astonishing support from a hilariously well cast Rob Lowe make this film one of the best of 2013. Unfortunately nobody will win an Oscar for any thing to do here because it was a TV movie in the 'States. Internationally it was released successfully in cinemas. With excellent and humorous production values, a lot also filmed in the Liberace museum and home and with some key scenes lifted directly from his awful 1955 romantic drama SINCERELY YOURS, Soderberg's terrific and emotional film literally 'hits all the right notes' for me and ends up being quite a moving experience. Ghastly behavior, petty jealousies and a wry eye for the outrageous, BEHIND THE CANDELABRA would have been a serious Oscar winner had it made the cinemas and not cable. What Damon and Douglas agreed to do nude in this film is as astonishing as the story itself. It is hilariously explicit and with jaw-dropping costumes they clearly enjoyed making this film. Imagine LA CAGE AUX FOLLES in Palm Springs with grand pianos. Great to also see Debbie Reynolds aged 80 on screen still as Momma, hamming it up and celebrating over 50 years as a headline actress.",8,1,3,21 December 2013
Gone Girl," Terrific until the 140th minute
","Well, how's this for a terrific soap opera..... all too clever by half, and with so many new century thriller films, paints itself into a corner that cannot be redeemed in the running time. Here is a great modern destructive thriller with an ending that completely undoes the whole film. Drone character husband meets cryptic woman manipulator who scores a 10/10 for bitch mayhem. Wealth allows plot points and absurd new characters to be hired to glance sideways. In-joke about deception sees gay actor hired as hetero obsessed stalker lover. Ice blonde proves to be better temptress than all the men mired in ghastly double dealings. Oakie rednecks prove to be the smartest characters in WASP thriller. Stay gasping until the 139th minute.

Django Unchained," A major achievement by many crafts persons
","As I detest Tarantino and his violent cruelty fantasies, let me come out and say it now...this is an astonishing piece of entertainment and particularly well produced. The two Oscars it won are not the ones I would agree with, as This film deserved awards for the superb craftsmanship on display, more than for his wanky script and same note performance by Mr Waltz. The pleasure in this film belongs in the work of the cinema- photography, art direction, set design and melancholy acting by Jamie Foxx. I saw DJANGO twice and thought it terrific both times. The sharp editing allows the violence to be hard but appropriate and the storyline is strong. Leonardo plays it like Vincent Price channeling Snidley Whiplash, and quite camp. Terrific credit titles upfront, lots of 'spot the B grade actor' fun and a nice joke with Franco Nero. Outstanding atmosphere, realistic tension and quality work on the screen make this a major work by someone who might finally have grown up a bit. A plot hole a mile wide still does not spoil the result.",8,2,6,17 March 2013
Frozen," Magnificent.
","FROZEN is the new 'broadway' musical now as a Disney presentation in spectacular 3D CGI gloss. If this is the new way to get musicals back on movie screens then I am all for it. FROZEN is visually breathtaking and very very funny, with a great script and overwhelming visual scenes, one after the other. FROZEN is also a very clever and throughly elaborate way to ensure kids get to enjoy musical theater and fairytale delight as new movie cineplex fun. Most kids movies present such goony characters and lame product placement cynicism but FROZEN is pitched as clearly in tone and style as a $150 ticket stage show on 44th street NY. Everyone in the cinema today relished every part of the film and when the snowman showstopper musical sequence finished ('What'd I do in Summer'), there was enthusiastic applause. Possibly over-all 10 minutes too long and with two songs early on too many FROZEN visually is a sensation and astonishing in key scenes. I can see the stage show coming in 5 years time. But do not hesitate now to take kids of all ages and make this the 3D animated musical you decide to spend the extra dollars on. The male characters work in context and equally match the spunky young princess fruitiness. However, it's Olaf the snowman who steals the show and with what might be an Oscar winning song, one Oscar of about 6 that I expect to see FROZEN win. If FROZEN is now a Disney 'formula' for quality family musicals then they have got it right. And whatever you do do NOT come late, there is a screamingly funny cartoon ahead of the feature called GET A HORSE which combines hologram and 3D.",9,2,5,28 December 2013
2012," a recipe for disaster
","Here is the recipe for the 2012 disaster as we now know it: Take one chunk of CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, add NOAH'S ARK, some SODOM AND GOMORRAH, mix with an EARTHQUAKE, a shake of TOWERING INFERNO, some AIRPORT '75 cockpit grunts, some KARKATOA boom-box and flying island chunks, a serve of Yellowstone level VOLCANO and DANTE'S PEAK antics, two tsunami sized POSEIDON rolls, a SAN FRANCISCO shake up of LA instead, no-Hanks everyman family glue repair, some TITANIC vessels and a hilariously sloshy LOST HORIZON sequence with teapot monks and a monster 'plane skidding along a glacier, add $200million mix in some Teutonic severity about humanity and - DING - cook in the CGI microwave. The result is the over-baked catastrophe laden mega biscuit called 2012. For those who don't drown in destruction and can last the 158 minute apocalypse of suburbia slipping like cakes into the sea, you will marvel at the inhumanity of it all as everything we have ever known gets pushed over. My favorite bit? The massive Aircraft Carrier the John F Kennedy being washed onto the White House as Washington is drowned. Everything gets smashed in this movie. Those who survive are far from the best available too. 'What a mess' might be the most appropriate reaction, as you brush the chewed popcorn from yourself as you stand to run from the cinema. The CGI destruction is too real for it's own good and would certainly give pre-teens horror nightmares.",7,3,7,13 November 2009
P.S. I Love You," Pay $3 no more for a ticket to this sitcom movie.
","And here is the reason why: it has Lisa Kudrow continuing her FRIENDS pantomime... and that alone pulls the whole movie down into TV movie level. Otherwise, with Oscar winning female talent and a handsome Tom Jones /Richard Burton hybrid in Gerard Butler we end up with a very likable small movie that has outsized femme talent crammed into it..... this is a film that should have been made with no name female actors. In a GHOST meets TRULY MADLY DEEPLY way P.S. is charming and utilises travelogue imagery to make itself 'international'. But over all it becomes what is sadly described as 'chick flick' instead of 'romantic comedy'.. er, drama....

",I have never believed for a minute that Matt and Ben really wrote enough of this script to win an Oscar each. I get the feeling it really was the encouragement award not the Best Original Script award. I hope time proves me right and it is revealed that several other experienced ghost writers added the plot turns and the odd funny quip. I think it is primarily cursed with swearing and lazy characterization and it basically does not make sense. If Will is such a genius why can't he work out that behaving like a completely obnoxious idiot won't get him anywhere? etc...I agree with most of the criticisms on this site and place it gently in the bin for Movie Psychotherapy For American Audiences Who Need Movies To learn How To Behave.,3,8,14,20 February 2004
Across the Universe," up there where it belongs.
","An inventive visual treat from start to finish, this clever film is a great introduction for 20 somethings and teens who are not aware of the Beatles music or of the turbulent 60s and what it all meant. Wrapping 2 dozen Beatles standards in constantly amazing set pieces, I personally found ACROSS THE UNIVERSE a very satisfying experience. I kept thinking 'Kids would just love this' especially if they have not been weaned on good musicals, the political past, the wildness of the late 60s and especially if they unfortunately think modern entertainment is all killing and destruction. As a time-capsule, UNIVERSE delivers, and I would strongly suspect a DVD gift would make a greatly effective intro to witty visuals and extraordinary and emotional songs for any younger person. I am very impressed with the imagination that has been carefully developed in each sequence and genuinely enthusiastically encourage an older generation to share this film with the younger. UNIVERSE is genuine cinema visual art.",8,2,5,2 December 2007
The Hurt Locker," Bad title, great film.
","Well, here's my vote for what might turn out to be the best war or war related film so far this century. If you seek an Afhganistan experience that humanizes the 'war effort' and its suburban impact there and here, THE HURT LOCKER is it. Jeremy Renner is a strange new-ish actor, I have never seen him before but felt as though I had. He reminds me of Daniel Craig. Or maybe Craig's younger brother. I see today that Renner in in the running to play Max Rockatansky in MAD MAX 4 FURY ROAD. He is not suited for that but his suitability for the role of bomb defuse expert in THE HURT LOCKER is truly terrific. Strong guest appearances from Guy Pearce and Ralph Feinnes helped raise the budget cash and the international sales, I am sure even their roles are tiny but effective. Renner though is spectacular. I am not impressed with Kathryn Bigelow's previous directorial efforts but she has presented here with this film a redeeming result. Much of the hand held camera-work mars the quality and interest in the film, some of it downright irritating. However for a 2 hour war related film about the seductiveness of the adventure of war and its impact on one man with a family back home, THE HURT LOCKER is a great film. the scene in the supermarket with him searching for breakfast cereal is majestic emotional understatement. The title is terrible and will have put potential ticket-buyers off. So take my advice, and go, and then settle in for an experience in tension and emotion and humanity.",9,35,55,27 October 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Boring
","As with other Tarantino films, this one delights in spectacularmutilation, particularly inviting the passive audience to enjoy thebrutal degradation of women. I was repeatedly saddened by hiscruel closeups of Uma Thurmans beautiful face beaten for hisenjoyment and projected into our view.

From Dusk Till Dawn," Enough of the 'cool' crap. Please.
","I did not realize exactly how much I detest this film until I saw it again last night. The sight of Tarantino with a gun just makes me want to smash my own television. The sight of Tarantino killing someone makes me want to cry with despair at the state of the film industry. I can only hope that one day George Clooney faints with the genuine realization he chose to be involved in this heinous vile film. Why cannot other people see Tarantino as I see him and his awful cretinous mutilation and degradation films? I cannot be the only one. Every film he makes is sheer humiliation violence towards women. They are not 'cool'. They are designed to ridicule violently every character because Tarantino sets out to defile everyone and everything because he cannot create. He is a destroyer: of images of beauty, of the human form and I am sick of hearing how 'cool' he is and that the films he makes are 'cool'. Clearly every woman in his films and especially this one are simply there for him to manhandle and humiliate, defile and then to kill... that is if he does not get to have rough sex with them first. The scene in the motel with Gloria the hostage who is crying with fear... she gets used as a gun gag and her brains are splattered on the wall. This is so vile and so cruel and especially that as a character in this film she is a middle aged woman, someone's mum and an ordinary woman. Tarantino's psycho character encourages her to relax so he can rape her then blast her face off. This apparently is funny. Hence my rousing identification of the true destructive and defiling nature of this rotten film. The showgirls in the Titty Bar are shown hacked up and tossed in a heap...because all beautiful women in Tarantino films really are monsters and if you don't f**k em first you'd better kill em. Tarantino's films are specifically designed by him to simply rip to shreds anything that is humane and beautiful and of value. His film world is one of emotional and physical brutality and the sheer obvious hatred of women of all ages. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a vile cinematrocity and should be studied for what it truly is. The scene where Harvey Keitel is begging his kids to murder him is just an atrocity on every standard of life any society holds with value. In this film Tarantino has written it as a part of his 'wacky adventure in the dirt'. Next time you have an accident in the street and lay bleeding in terrible pain and some pitiless passerby by says. 'ooh cool' as you pass out from the pain.. think of how well Tarantino has infected their psyche and eroded their humanity via his assault on society by films like this.",2,2,4,3 April 2009
Paranormal Activity," A wild poltergoose chase
","This tedious headache inducing 99 mins of stupefyingly boring nothingness apparently had some easily scared girls wincing in their seats. Oh please! PARANORMAL ACTIViTY is a very ordinary haunted house movie about a VERY ordinary couple who film spooky things when they sleep. AND......? Nothing....................... Please may I suggest a 2007 Australian film called LAKE MUNGO. Yes again Australia makes a film that gets copied in the US with lame results. It is about a family who believe they have a spirit in their haunted home and so they set up a digicam to record the noises and images that go bump and boo in the night.... sounds like PARANORMAL ACTIVITY? Yes it does and it is a far better film with seriously chilling exposures and a fantastic and real appearance of a very scary ghost....totally unlike PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. Even more irritating, is the fact that if you have seen the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY trailer, you have seen the punchline of the film so their marketing is spoiling the film before you see it. So uneventful is PARANORMAL ACTIVITY that when something does happen you have lost any tension felt. One minor moment that almost delivers is a good drag scene....but by then you are at the threshold of utter boredom. Find LAKE MUNGO and see the real thing.",2,28,56,6 December 2009
Into the Wild," The Little Punce
","Sean Penn's film about Christopher McCandless who shed his college and suburban life for a fatal nomadic journey is a really disturbing and absorbing film. It is extraordinarily well made and acted by Emile Hirsch. However what struck and disturbed me more than anything was how cruel and self absorbed and selfish our hero behaved. He caused pain beyond belief to his well meaning parents and sister, he burned his money instead of giving it to a poor family who needed it, he squatted in self absorbed diary bliss, he rejected all advances of friendship that did not benefit his mood at the time, ... in fact a good moment to demonstrate how unconscious he was of anyone else's feelings is late in the film when he cajoles an old man to climb up and across a really rocky and difficult mountain blissfully unaware that the hike is physically beyond the old man. He simply has no clue to another person's feelings. So our hero does really silly and dangerous things in his Kerouac style adventure down rapids and on freight trains and hitching lifts and staying as he chooses... and causing heartbreaking grief for his family. I was appalled to find this was a true story and it is to Penn's skill as a film maker that the astonishing selfishness of McCandless' self absorbed pilgrimage is spelled out as clearly as it is. Our hero might have had some teen issues with his family, but the rejection and ignorance of their feelings is utterly vile. Only a rich white teenager could behave in such a rotten way believing in this self righteous bubble that his selfish quest is some misguided noble back-to-basics adventure. In a film of many great scenes the standout was his tortured despairing father collapsing on the road in the suburb where they still lived. The hurt this boy caused! the terrible agony of not knowing where he was, and this brat thought all that was OK because HE was on a selfish quest. Penn's film is a great one and an expose of the sort of ruthless inconsiderate cruelty one generation worries about for the younger.",7,1,3,26 February 2010
Blood Diamond," A bloody good movie
","What BABEL strives for with 4 contrived tragic intertwined story threads, THE BLOOD DIAMOND hits a bullseye with one excellent and timely topic with a powerful and believable subplot.......and a stellar performance by an ever increasingly admirable Leonardo Di Caprio. Like Matt Damon in THE GOOD SHEPHERD and James Franco in FLYBOYS we see a major young male actor delivering a performance that carries the whole film, elevating it to near classic proportions and allowing for a complete absorption and focus for the astonished viewer. I have high admiration for the massive production undertaking that is clearly on screen allowing for a spectacular and tragic epic drama that bats political home runs right to the viewer's increasing awareness of the horrors and cruelties of Africa. As 'worldly' as BABEL attempts and becomes laboured, preachy and contrived; this film succeeds because it is mounted as a combat political thriller with deep social awareness, family realities and utter sadness of loss of spirit. THE BLOOD DIAMOND is terrifying in every way and clever to allow the viewer to be so well swept up that any 'lessons' of the plot and character come as welcome fascinating insights rather than a shopping list of BABEL misery. Director Edward Zwick who also was behind GLORY in 1989 sees the power in the struggle of injustice and noble races has, to me, now offered a superb tough look at the reality of recent Africa and a consumer issue still valid in 2007.",8,1,2,18 February 2007
Avatar," 3D astonishment
","Well, me too.... I am thrilled to admit AVATAR is every good as I had hoped and I find myself reaching for superlatives. Half way through, I realized I already wanted to see it again. I saw it in 3D by which I did get exhausted and had a headache the next day, eye strain etc, but I actually put that down to the cinema film projection ... so next time I will see an actual digital presentation as opposed to a film presentation. Friends who saw it digital projection said how sharp it was. Yes AVATAR is a massive leap forward in tech excellence and I applaud Cameron again for delivering on the hype. Fox must stand in awe of him as much as savvy audiences do. I was a converted fan from THE ABYSS onwards, and TITANIC was massive, but this film is simply a colossal achievement. AVATAR is setting a new benchmark for cinema and I am thrilled to see it brand new in my cinema-going lifetime. From FANTASIA to FERN GULLY to APOLCALYPSE NOW and POCAHONTAS, it is all there but amped up to a jaw-dropping visual level unseen creatively on a screen before. AVATAR is as good as anyone says who raves about it. The repeat business for AVATAR will be extraordinary and the Fox/Cameron legacy deserve it. So do we. It also contains a strong political opinion.",9,4,10,19 December 2009
Grindhouse," Dumb and Dumber costing $88 million.
","Now released in Australia and clocking in at a ridiculous too-long 191 minutes, this cynical vicious and boring vanity piece by Hollywood's misogynist violence peddlers seems to believe that their names and some extensive female mutilation and humiliation will once again strike a chord with the sort of 20-somethings who kill classmates in hallways. Fortunately here in Oz GRINDHOUSE was snuck in under the radar into one cinema (yes just one) and met with a nonplussed crit and box office. By virtue of being on one screen only it can report healthy first attendance (70% drop week 2) but that is really the only 'healthy' thing about this wasteful misfire. Here is a supposed double feature of crappy films with crappy trailers in between. It's a good idea and could be fun if it was created and presented as such. In fact it is also an old idea, the film MOVIE- MOVIE from the 70s with George C Scott gave viewers a fake double feature of as if we had gone to the movies in 1933, complete with fake movie trailers, so did Weird Al Yankovic's VIDIOT FROM UHF in the 80s. With GRINDHOUSE we get the abattoir version of 70s drive in flicks up-slashed with seriously vicious female humiliation and mutilation. We get two indulgent directors who do not know when to stop (as opposed to 'cut') and each idea of two 90 minute films is misguided as they are 20 minute ideas. If GRINDHOUSE ran a total of 100 minutes (like MOVIE MOVIE) then it would work better because the curiosity value can only sustain itself for that shorter period. I am again saddened at the horrific cruelty towards women in DEATH PROOF which clearly did not impress the young audience at the opening night session I attended. The film stopped being any sort of fun and really dampened any enthusiasm this crowd of 20 somethings showed. PLANET TERROR is a zombie film and as such alone is disappointing as the poster alludes it being science fiction, not just another boring ugly zombie blast-em 'spectacular'. As a production and a release, GRINDHOUSE is a spectacular financial failure and hopefully will see the real end to this disgusting extreme screen cruelty (as some warped spectacle) that Tarantino and his disciples insist the cinema-goers of the world find interesting. Game over QT. Note: one fake trailer from Eli Roth has a cheerleader getting killed when she does the splits onto a large knife. These film makers display a pathological hatred of women and their inherent beauty as human beings. GRINDHOUSE is all about killing and mutilating the human form. Nothing else. I would love to hear Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell's daughter's reaction at seeing their father participating in this vile cruelty.",1,4,10,24 January 2008
A Clockwork Orange," Please, NO Tarantino remake.
","In the 37 years since I saw A CLOCKWORK ORANGE I have always staunchly offended this stupid movie. I loathed it then and after seeing it again recently I loathe it even more. Why? it is BORING. It is OBVIOUS. It is a 20 minute idea that takes 2hrs 20 minutes to crawl through the projector initiating the sort of visual atrocity that these days, sadly, Tarantino and Roth get good reviews for. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is and always will be a terrible film; a vicious misuse of character, slyly pathetically trying to present a poncy vandal murderer as some witty ant-hero (yawn) and using classic music and songs as a defiant act of cine vandalism. An absolute no brainer to simply invert dignity and humanity and then bash it all together with stark sets and overalls. It is so unimaginative. And ugly. and did I say BORING.... it just goes on and on .. and even in slow motion! for hours. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE only has a future if remade as A CLOCKWORK CHUCKY and adds Bart Simpson rolling it all into a dumb pop satire of silly-Chucky doll grimace and Simpson's awareness. In 2011 when A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is 40 years old it will just again look as wasteful and bereft of creativity as it always did. Hopeless. What a con it was and still is. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is really just Tarantion's version of SINGIN IN THE RAIN before we knew the vandalism his films would celebrate. Thanks Stanley! For nothing.",1,13,33,13 November 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Radical Radcliffe and the role of a lifetime
","With astonishing production values, terrific scripts and endlessly fascinating serial dramas, my contribution to the phenomenon of the HARRY POTTER films will just be a speck of glitter on the ten ton ball of chrome these films represent in movie history. Now that I have a box set of blu-ray DVDs, I am relishing them title by title as we watch them over and over again at home with and without kids on the lounge too. There are 1001 delights and moments to admire, and endless jaw-dropping visuals and imaginative tricks. Over and over again. However, it is the music scores that I am increasingly loving. Lush lavish orchestrations and endlessly inventive use of individual instruments, and soaring emotional oceans of music. Most acting chops are right, the casting deserves an Oscar of its own, every film, and the delight in seeing, film by film, each young actor journey through their teens to genuine human wonder. The almost seamless transfer of Dumbledore from Richard Harris to MIchel Gambon is not even noticed by the keenest of eyes. I especially liked the hideous Dobby being realized in ghastly character style Arthur Askey. The HP series is GONE WITH THE WIND for the 21st century in landmark film status. Everything works. I recently also saw Radcliffe in THE WOMAN IN BLACK which I thought also quite magnificent.",8,0,2,28 December 2013
The Departed," Yes, well... departed is right.
","This Scorscese good cop-bad cop opus is a pretty terrible film. Yes I know it won Oscars as sort of consolation for Scorscese not winning Oscars previously, but, erggh, THE DEPARTED was not the film to be handed them.... THE AVIATOR is the film that should have won the Scorscese Oscars not this horrible film. Jack Nicholson's truly terrible idiotic clich√É¬©d performance is possibly the worst since THE SHINING with silly grimaces and Huntz Hall mugging. The shabby restaurant scene when he impersonates a rat is simply woeful, an insults the ticket-paying audience who have trusted the film makers and actors to deliver something a lot better.If you want to see imagery of your most admired young male actors having their brains splattered on a wall, this sadly is it. As usual over violent, and that as usual marrs most Scorsese films: idiots with guns, swearing and urban decay. Not much has changed from MEAN STREETS. The DEPARTED is a major disappointment. Not as groanworthy as GANGS OF NEW YORK which is simply THE CAT IN THE HAT meets MOULIN ROUGE with a cleaver. Think about it.",Null,0,2,16 September 2011
Burlesque," All That Fosse
","BURLESQUE sets itself up for some fairly blunt 2011 criticism for it's lame storyline but if one knows their films of the 30s to the 70s, you can see they type of nightclub musical it wants to be. If BURLESUE was made in the 30s it would be a Warner bros Vitaphone musical like 42nd STREET or FOOTLIGHT PARADE. Christina Aguelira would be played by Joan Blondell who she actually resembles. Cam Gigandet would be James Cagney. Cher vs Mae West. Hop into the 40s and we might have Rita Hayworth as Cher, Berry Grable as Christina, and called COVER GIRL or PIN UP GIRL, or if you prefer staying in a cheaper locale THE SWING PARADE OF 1946, Monogram's big nightclub musical mess starring Gale Storm and performers in a finale who did not appear anywhere else in the whole film. In the 50s, well just have a look at either PAL JOEY or THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. The opening 5 minutes of BURLESQUE resembles the 1965 Elvis credit sequence on a bus in TICKLE ME. BURLESQUE really really wants to be all of the fabulous nightclub scenes from SWEET CHARITY... the scenes where Charity meets Vittorio and sees the RICH MAN'S FRUG dance numbers with awesome Barrie Chase and her 10' legs and whopper hair. Now that we are in Fossey territory, add some CABARET (in fact, a lot of CABARET), mix in MOULIN ROUGE and plenty of CHICAGO and Columbia's B grade subsidiary Screen Gems give us a new B grade nightclub musical with all the above elements called BURLESQUE. This film just wants to be some of all those above. Hell it is far better than NINE and miles ahead of RENT, which for me is just fine. I actually think the 'lets save the nightclub' storyline is a wink to other clich√© musicals and knows it. (Boogaloo, anyone?) What is good about BURLESQUE is the hilarious script which has some terrific lines, the excellent rapport between the three leads Cher, C.A and Stanley Tucci... and of course cute Cam as the Paul Newman type love interest. His 'box of cookies' nude scene adds some well timed zing. The dance numbers are thoroughly enjoyable albeit badly edited and filmed too close, like most of the film. The songs good and the costumes offer the old razzle dazzle as well they could and actually do. BURLESQUE knows it is silly and has a great time with it... hey just like an actual BURLESQUE show. Just enjoy. it's not difficult. BURLESQUE might even get Barbra Striesand out of the house to make a new musical given she would see it as her husband James Brolin has a cameo and Cher is her same age: 66. Also finally Cher might get the cash to make the Mae West musical for which she is now ideal. BURLESQUE would make a terrific double feature with Columbia's own 1948 cheapie LADIES OF THE CHORUS starring Marilyn Monroe in the Christina part.",7,5,6,17 January 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," The sad new low in cinema.
","I am going to amend my review below, as I have had several days to mull over the tragic depth this to which awful movie has taken us. It might be clever 'Scorscese' film making, but really it is a horrible excessive movie about utter pigs. Yes I get the 'haha they are drug animals without consciousness' but really. Hasn't Marty just also steamrolled right over the line of what can be put on a mainstream movie. I think this film is filth. Just depravity and a sad new low to what can appear on a multiplex cinema screen. Leonardo is so well liked and to see Marty excess the reasonable acceptability by having this young man and all other actors just degrade themselves so they can appear in a 'Martin Scorscese film' ... well it is a hollow victory. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is a degrading sad film made by an old man who likes to see good looking young people degrade themselves for his own gratification. He has insulted and degraded the entire film making system and those who participated in this ridiculous ugly mean film by being willing to undress and make ugly naked faces of themselves. It is horrible and a new low, the lowest since HOSTEL 2 in mainstream American movie making and nothing to admire or be proud of. I am sad for US film making and Scorscese needs to retire. It's grubby and Marty has grubbied young admirable talented Leonardo. Bad Bad and sad. Martin Scorscese had outed himself as a defiler. A defiler and corrupter of youth. My previous statement: Yes it is a very clever film, well edited acted and written. However like that 10th line of cocaine, by the third hour of WOLF OF WALL STREET there is an overdose imminent. Some films can be too clever for their own endurance test, and whilst there is much to guffaw at and much to be faux-shocked at, after 120 minutes and before 172 minutes I just became bored with the whole thing. Again we get the hyperactive Scorscese swooshing narrative and the pantomime of men-without-a-conscience and the terrible things they do to each other, their women and the audience. It is all colossal and then after it is over, I am glad I will never feel like watching any part of it ever again. Three hours without story suspense, a bit of character build, just episode after episode of CASINO/SCARFACE/NY blather, and yes we have seen it all before. How poor Thelma ever edited this bombastic overload of brute force money avalanche greed etc etc and not lost her mind having to watch it over and over and over again whilst tweaking it into its releasable shape, to me is another more interesting story deserving of an Oscar. I admired the production more than I liked the film.",5,5,11,2 February 2014
The Reader," After The War.
","I can see that I am not the only person who missed this excellent drama upon first release, and in fact I actually avoided it at the time, not bothering. Friends raved about it and I was ho-hum. Now I wish I had seen the film in a cinema, given it's potent impact even through the hell of watching THE READER on commercial clogged Television. A revisit on DVD is now a must. Similar in structure to SOPHIE'S CHOICE another WW2 aftermath moral dilemma with time shifts and character revelations, THE READER is a completely absorbing and thrilling drama with superb casting and excellent production values. Made on a modest budget and with new comer David Kross' pivotal performance as the teen in love with older woman with a vile past (Kate Winslet) THE READER establishes itself strongly with a heady mix of sex and secrets. The scenes at the lake with his teen friends realising he is up to something are also evocative. A similar but more ghastly film was the 1971 film THE NIGHT PORTER with a role reversal and disgusting fetish. If you see it you can see the identity swap and the cruelty of attraction. THE READER has a sunny lead teen and a cold femme balance. The moral dilemma is not to be revealed but witnessed as you see the film for the first time.",7,1,1,21 June 2011
The Good Shepherd," A great sad huge spy epic.
","For anyone who remembers and cares when Hollywood produced interesting films for adults in the 60s and 70s, titles like The Manchurian Candidate, The Great Gatsby, The Conversation, The Godfather / 2 , Chinatown and in the 80s, Tucker are celebrated and revered..... Well here is a 160 minute drama that in a combination of all of those titles, and impeccably produced by Francis Ford Coppolla.... and with an astonishing Directorship by Robert de Niro. THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an excellent and absorbing drama, a spy thriller that is about a wonderful charming youth turned into soulless man via the emotional cruelty of politics and espionage. Many parallel 2007 themes are obvious, right down to a folded paper suicide note burning down in a miniature image of the World Trade Centers falling. Scenes set in the 20s and 30s are superbly evoked and overall the art direction and set design and imagery of this expensive thoughtful film is as interesting as the grey subject matter itself. Then front and center is Matt Damon yet again fully shouldering a huge and absorbing epic level classic style drama. He is never less than mesmerizing and astonishing. Angelina Jolie is even gorgeous and fascinating in what would normally be the Sharon Stone role. Perfectly cast edited and realized this is one great paced spy drama that is as heartbreaking as it is real.",7,1,2,13 February 2007
Never Back Down," Never see this.
","NEVER BACK DOWN is a disgrace. A brutal teen movie that is deliberately made to show handsome 20 somethings (posing as as teens) beating each other in teeth gritting bleeding fistfights as pretty girls cheer and ogle in glee. It is absolutely reprehensible in the way it is made: a cobbled-together story basically about the popular brutality of teens in school as some popcorn movie thrill. Like a perverts FIGHT CLUB this film is made by adults who should know better than to simply use revenge and social decay as an excuse to show fit and healthy guys and their bimbo girlfriends gleefully enjoying bashings. This sickening and frustrating formulaic high school flick wastes the talents and looks of everyone involved. Sean Faris as your hero Tyler is some Tom Cruise look-a-like with someone called Cam Gigandet as his Brad Pitt style nemesis; so obvious is the casting in this image that immediately the films contrivances become obvious. Hammy dialogue as drama, lame arguments between his Mom, misunderstandings that cause you to roll your eyes and moan, and some Karate Kid style gym antics with mentor Dijmon Hounsou just add to the irritation in their half baked imitative style of other better films. NEVER BACK DOWN was a bomb in Australia and it even failed during the school holidays as bright healthy happy Aussie teens ignored it and had fun at the beach instead. This is the fist-fight-porn version of the disgusting NAKED MILE: American PIE. NEVER BACK DOWN fails on every level. If all this is not enough to put you off, then please let me also advise you it is filmed by handy-cam, with idiotic closeups and wobbly picture. Terrible and offensive in every way. A contrived exploitive vicious mess. Even our hero's nerd pal is there and cops a beating to ensure the climax is about revenge.... This disgusting degenerative and derivative film is directed by someone who wants you to enjoy teenagers bashing each other, and the film as a production actually fosters the social blight of kids filming schoolyard fights for YouTube.",3,3,7,30 May 2009
The Queen," Crowning Elizabeth.. and the rest of 'em.
","What a creation this film is! Atmosphere so well realised you can almost feel the cold in each room of the palace. Equally fascinating and astonishing by reel 3, it does take a good half hour for one to get used to the pantomime happening with gradual credibility before your very wide open eyes. Initially it looked like a farce when University students get dressed up as old age pensioners. Prince Charles looked like a silent screen star without the pancake makeup. Within 40 minutes, this well crafted and very sly comedy has convinced you that you are actually peering into the Monachy during private days and fussy querulous nights. A great plot device to sincerely help us understand the Queen's feelings and her cementing over them once revealed involves a mighty Reindeer Stag. Well done. It was Mirren's Oscar moment by the creek... and if you see this film you will instantly know what I mean. Brutally satiric concerning both The Duke and Cherie Blair both hilariously pungently observed. What a production... cold color and fog. Just like the Monarchy. The intense sadness that wells again upon seeing the news shots of Diana and the sea of flowers as well as other well edited news footage is superbly presented for maximum effect (on me anyway). I would love to be a fly on the wall the night HRH and family... esp Phillip... see this film.",8,1,2,21 December 2006
1408," 0 0 0 1.... really.
","What a disappointment. What starts as an interesting premise just slides into silly episodes of ridiculous imagery, hallucinations and mumbo jumbo that becomes tedious. John Cusack is always interesting to see on screen and there is a trust that you invest in him as an actor. but sadly here his character is abrasive and selfish and sadly argumentative. Cynical. As a result as he bounces off walls (that drip jam/jelly/blood/yawn) you end up not giving two hoots how he is coping. I actually think 1408 is an allegory for DETOX. I mean that the film is about drug addiction and 1408 is the detox (room) that one endures and the demons faced during.",Null,0,2,1 March 2012
Step Up," Rebel With A Tune.
","This is a sort of BIG BILLY ELLIOTT movie. Very familiar and yet very entertaining dance school pic has the awesomely charismatic Channing Tatum there to anchor it to the screen. Looking like the love child of James Dean and Josh Hartnett if that was possible, he has looks of both and solid acting skills... enough to overcome the hilarious Eminem 8 MILE nonsense first half complete with hugely over-sized toddler pants and silly hat scenes. Similar to any two reels of TAKE THE LEAD or CENTRE STAGE or HONEY and SAVED and STRICTLY BALLROOM and even Saturday NIGHT FEVER this is a FAME /Ballet school drama that is predictable in every scene, but because of Tatum stays watchable. The tiny-tot ballet scenes are hilarious. Can Tatum dance? Yes, and even seems to manage hip hop dance athletics. He was a standout in the lite teeny SHE'S THE MAN at another school and survived the dire drivel of GUIDE TO RECOGNISING YOUR SAINTS... and I welcome any new pic I see his name. Hopefully the 'action producers' can keep guns from his hands and let him develop into a major male star in romantic and music dramas. He is better than being shunted into cop pix and awful BLACKHAWK DOWN imitation pix. The dance numbers are energetic.. especially the blue shirt one in the middle of the film... the goofy romantic thing he is capable of is very appealing. The camera loves him and he has a solid male image excellent for new young adult films like this. Rachel Griffiths plays the thankless role of the headmistress of the school and she sleepwalks thru her role as if she filmed her scenes on a Monday after a day on the SIX FEET UNDER set. It's a Tatum pic this one and it works completely because of him. Terrific photography too. I really like this film and those above like it. It is a genre I enjoy and each time offers teen audiences values above explosions, arguments and squalor so prevalent in many new films.",7,0,0,10 August 2007
La Vie En Rose," I had regrets....hours of them
","This elaborate but headache inducing bio of apparently cranky wretch Edith Piaf is like a Bollywood musical in French: it has every imaginable dramatic sequence, a lot just plain exhausting and contrived, and the viewer is left bludgeoned by the result and endless running time. I actually really disliked this film and thought the character of Piaf was rude ungrateful and mean....maybe she really was, but I really did not care two hoots by the end of the film. I am also sick of seeing Gerard Depardieu in French films.... why is he in so many? Isn't there other actors in France. This film is known as LA VIE EN ROSE in Australia and it had a good run but after discussion many people reveal their thoughts are not too different to mine. However there is one superb sequence when she discovers her husband has come to her in a vision. Other than that it was a dirge with a thumping delivery of trilling songs that just simply gave me a headache. I know Cotilliard is up for an Oscar in 2008 and her performance is a complete one but the film is too long and terribly overwrought... among all that screaming misery and endlessly moaned songs.",3,9,18,29 January 2008
Signs," but not of intelligence, unfortunately
","See a yokel club an alien with a baseball bat! Yee ha! Well up until that point SIGNS was a reasonable Close Encounter with a predator in a wetsuit who could not find its way out of the pantry. See the director give himself a part with Mad Mel (still rolling his eyes and in Richard Gere style then look sideways). The two kids were the best actors in the film. Rory Kulkin still continues to astonish. SIGNS was truly silly...all style and no sense after the lights came up. It looks good, well photographed and good art direction on the farm and the local village. But once you see that alien..... well we now have a drive in movie pretending to be a Spielberg movie. and once that baseball bat was reached for, well, I'm sure all hooted and hollered and dropped popcorn in the cine hyper mega plex because once 'the usual American violence' took over the movie showed no sign of recovery. Especially the scene where the little girl watches the man bash the humanoid alien into submission with the baseball bat, so hard that the bat breaks.",2,3,5,19 March 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," WarGames,Terminator and Bruce
","This surprisingly enjoyable (and very overdone: music, mess and grime) action thriller benefits from the excellent and shrewd casting of hacker Justin Long whose Gen x computer antics pitch well against Willis' John Wayne/baby boomer no nonsense heroics. There is a tremendous a lot of babble, apocalyptic urban smashes and stunts, and a full scale Terminator level truck and car chase. All chrome and concrete, DH4 has jaw-dropping set pieces, improbable but believable stunts and destruction galore. the CGI of stunt and vehicle and even freeway vs plane antics (like from TRUE LIES) is absurdly hilarious and crowd pleasing. Why the bad guys just did not kill Mclane's daughter when they first had her is one of those silly plot holes like you would get in any dopey spy film (as Austin Powers would point out). Like any respectable serial there is a colossal hero disaster every ten minutes. Some gun scar and drug quips wrap up the pic over a rock score. It's great to see NZ actor Cliff Curtis on high profile in this rock'n'roll action stew.",6,1,4,14 December 2008
Final Destination," the dead pup club
","Groan................ swearing, suburban kitchen idiocy and local household accidents make up most of the drama in this suburban grim reaper drivel which displays the icky ways that rich young Americans can get mangled in the Hollywood murder machine. Plenty of other comment posts here will tell you entire story and their angst but my comments will focus on how boring this quickly became. And BUT and as usual it is a massive butt...again we are pestered with the boring and irritating Sean William Scott..what can i say other that ENOUGH. However I do notice he is trying to resurrect his flaccid career in JACKASS 3D:Cornhole Party.I saw FD2 first and that is a better setup and pay off for the cruel kids who like killing as their Friday night popcorn fun fest. No wonder the multiplexes are empty with a FD set of sequels and Uncle Quentin and Cousin Eli now filming the wound.",3,0,2,1 December 2010
300," Bloodfeast for perverts
","CGI... now what does that mean again? Cruel Gross Idiotic? ..what about Cinema Goes Irrelevant? ... there is many CGI word games to be had with this comic book abattoir movie that seems created by CGI blood feast perverts to entertain their disciples. Like some sort of Eli Roth creation ..maybe: Hostel Goes To Sparta ..this drivel called 300 is a excuse to use millions of dollars of CGI to create the ultimate in mutilation cinema. Hilarious and stupid and endlessly brutal by turns it is a nosedive into a trough of offal with human beings as the slaughter subject. Well known actors have their heads screwed onto gay leather-boy jockstrap bodies and the whole thing starts to resemble a blood and weapon leather fantasy created by a rich closet queen who is also a psychotic mutilation fan able to buy the heads of actors who should know better so he can pawn their muscles into bleeding porn. All that yelling, slashing and monsters. In the studio too. But for me, well its just another sad stupid and disgusting example why cinema is committing suicide. The hilarious narration pretends to be some sort of David Attenborough history lesson when it just sounds like a pervert uncle whispering seductions in your ear. Wait until you meet Xerxes! He is a ten ton chain and jewelery festooned monster queen looking for the PRISCILLA set.",2,1,5,26 December 2008
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsmen....or clown..
","Clever slick and all Steed-shiny...but this film, poached from KILL BILL, THE SAINT, INCEPTION, THE AVENGERS, any 60s BOND etc...with added CLOCKWORK ORANGE violence simply shows that Matthew Vaughn is just another vile Tarantino wannabee handed a big budget and excessively indulgently produced a stupid film with set pieces of boring ugly violence. Some scenes, as in the church, are just disgusting, and from that point the interest level wanes. The scenes in the mountain lair are INCEPTION meets ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill. 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director, this film is great initially, for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes. Yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes. I really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished. I thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studio's trust. To show contempt for the audience with such cretinous perverse 'action' and result, the villain even spews on the audience. Then there is the 'hilarious' anal sex joke. The last 70 minutes of this chrome dildo of a movie are truly horrible.",3,48,95,12 February 2015
Moon," 2010: A Moon Odyssey
","ooh... here is the new century's equivalent and homage to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY but only 90minutes in length. Clearly inspired from the 1968 Kubrick film, MOON allows Gen X and Y to have their own look alike complete with ambiguous themes, clunky white/grey sets, and calls to home. I was actually really pleased to see MOON especially with the completely magnetic Sam Rockwell and the overall effect of the film which is to challenge and entertain with some space paradox ideas and melancholy. Kevin Spacey as Gertie - or PAL or even KPAX the talking robot - was a good touch and the eerie and tense atmosphere, especially once the 3 year life of the job is revealed was both compelling and effective. However you must see MOON on a huge screen... to see this Cinerama sized drama in cinema 10 in some shoebox-plex is not doing yourself, your cash or the film any favors. Seek the biggest screen, sit alone, and go on a journey.",7,0,4,27 October 2009
The Great Gatsby," a sumptuous magnificent spectacle.
","I have not seen any film so splendidly spectacular and sumptuous as THE GREAT GATSBY since possibly TITANIC and HELLO DOLLY and the massive major musicals of the 60s. GATSBY 2013 is an astonishing visual achievement. I reluctantly saw it in 3D and within 10 minutes was so pleased I did. The 3D is utterly breathtaking. The 3D clarity and the steadiness of the photography allows for 3D clarity unlike any I have seen before. Yes I balk at Baz, and I was worried that this was just going to be Baz' flapper dance party, and yes, for a few minutes it is that but 99% more. I sincerely hope this heralds a new era in gloriously beautiful stylish and intelligent film making. Gatsby's Leonardo entrance, about 25 minutes in, is an emotional thunderbolt of sheer beauty. I defy anyone of any age and gender not to gasp. Toby Maguire is utterly accessible and charming, Carrie Mulllgan an ideal Daisy and Joel Edgerton a terrifying Tom. The art direction and set design and costumes are superb. I know I am raving but I want to. I am genuinely enthusiastic and shocked at how thrilling and beautiful this new GREAT GATSBY is. Reward yourself and see it in 3D in a good cinema.",9,2,5,23 May 2013
