United 93," Audience silence?
","Audience silence:Knowing that this movie was very accurate made me very proud of the passengers and crew.The best part of the movie for me was watching the passengers charge up the aisle and overwhelming the terrorists. As the cockpit door was being knocked down, I imagine that the terrorist pilot knew that his plans to attack D.C. was not going to be successful.I was not sure how I would feel going into the movie but I cheered loudly as the passengers charged the terrorist and hearing one of them have his neck broken by in a headlock by a large American man.It occurred to me that I was one of a very few people in the theater whom cheered. Most sat there in stunned silence.",10,0,3,9 May 2006
