Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sad that a director/visionary could go so low..
","I think there's about 1,000+ words to describe how disappointing this movie is for fans of the genre and fans of science fiction, I look to science fiction cause it's the only interesting thing my mind I can't predict well.. And so in the original trilogy we saw much of that greatness in this cheap cash in we saw little of the original..I finally wanted to know more about why Lucas the man behind the series destroyed the former glory of the series and a little research easily turned it up Gary Kurtz original producer of the first 2 of the original trilogy is largely responsible, a good interview with Kurtz done by FilmForce shows that he was responsible for hiring the director of The Empire Strikes Back and for keeping the film highly original Kurtz described a concept which I think is true of Lucas's writing and directing work to date, he described a movie term called the 'Roller-coaster Ride' and that's what Phantom Menace is clearly it's a roller-coaster ride without question..Why should movies be great? Why should movies inspire to push our moral/social limits? Why should movies have story or imagination? When all we need is a good ride and this is sadness to phantom menace because it comes from the push of movies to a roller-coaster ride..It's easy to spot the roller-coaster ride in the sequel or #3 in the trilogy 'Return of the Jedi' why a 2nd death star? why the ewoks? Where was the originality in #3 we see the originality sapped and the beginning of plagiarisms And Lucas's career continues in this saga with more Indiana Jones with Willow and with Howard the Duck.. there is a extra feature on the DVD of Willow where Ron Howard (Director) and George Lucas (producer writer) talk and you can tell the relationship between two great artists is strained and this was the truth in every movie Lucas made that was good he was strained in both Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back he was challenged and pushed to do better..In these movies he is not challenged he is in charge and he wants what he wants.. he's lazy and he let's ILM cover his butt on challenges he doesn't want to handle..George was Director, Executive Producer and Writer on this movie that means that every thing you saw was what he wanted there was no one to say no to him, no one to say what if we did this better, he shot every scene with his movie in mind and in this case with no one there to tell him his vision missed what the public wanted.. this is his movie, this movie will not connect with a audience and therefore it's just wasted cause we know George's film past that George could connect with audiences really well he just didn't want too he was going his own way.. so this film will be forgotten and his original legacy will live on..This movie is a sad excuse because it provides little enlightenment and shows a once semi-competent producer/visionary/director in a utter-cash in half -ss attempt And I recently watched a re-work of this movie dubbed MAGNOLIAFAN this one edited and slightly changed movie increased the overall feel of this movie by 25%, I have seen this movie perhaps 3 times now and this re-work beat out my previous viewing experiences.. this re-work helps make this movie better and if Director's continue to get rewarded (our money) in the theater for sub-par crap then the Roller-coaster movie cycle and re-works will continue to be in our future..No one who wants more from movies should ever support the industry in failures such as this one.. the pocketbook speaks to these guys more then anything.. I think old George has gotten too much approval for sub-par work and I'm sure he thanks his marketing people most generously",4,1,3,29 December 2004
Independence Day," Generally, well done.. certainly not perfect..
","It's been about 10 years since I've seen this in the theater (or getting close) in theater my reaction was generally mixed.. didn't hate it.. and generally liked it.. I do a re-watch on average of every 4-5 years..I think in some ways this movie details a great scenario of what if, we where attacked.. chaos in the streets (certainly maybe not as much as was shown) Use of Nuclear Veapons or non-use (yes, I did miss-spell weapons) Ability on a short time scale to even be able to react.. and a ability to get organized.. realistically though if the supposed aliens where smarter they would have killed every one by the end of July 2nd in movie terms..Of all Roland's movies, I like this one best.. still despise Godzilla (some thing about that damn 2nd/4th act with eggs) and can stand to watch 'The Day after Tomorrow'. He described this movie as a 'Popcorn Movie' and that it is.. this movie has a nice array of comedy, acting and style along with a plot that's semi-believable.. (be willing to stretch imagination and the law of odds) And it's one of those movies that has 'SHOWY' special effects but it has a actual STORY; with so many ample cheap special effects movies these days.. story/plot some times becomes easily forgotten While theoretically speaking the odds of knowing nothing useful about a alien technology after 40 years of scientific study is borderline stupidity and the odds of attacking a unknown enemy with a computer virus are staggering.. if you look past some of the impossible or impractical and let it slide the movie's enjoyable in all manors including plot I should of course make a note that as always.. I am a total sucker for sci-fi all other stories honestly bore me.. I have too much imagination to be suckered by common Fiction and even some Fantasy, sci-fi's too me are the best movies only because it's possible reach a unknown",7,0,1,1 September 2005
Iron Man," The Best Super Hero movie in 2 decades..
","I'm not one of those that is impressed by 'Spiderman' or recent incarnations of 'Batman' (I think they all have poor story's and boring remake style) including a fan favorite 'Batman Forever' but for the 1st time I found myself liking a super hero movie when they all make me yawn.. the last one that wasn't so terrible was actually the newest Superman but this movie actually beats it out..So what do I claim the last best super hero movie was.. Tim Burtons 'Batman' starter of whole franchises...What I liked about this movie was that it had plot, it had acting and it wasn't over the top or too long (spiderman is a great example of this) and maybe it's possible that it stems also from the fact that I haven't seen any cartoon series of the show.. (though I'd never seen Fantastic Four cartoons and those movies were generally terrible) I like that in this movie Robert Downey Jr. has a ironic or albeit poke fun at self sense of humor.. and the fact that in some ways his character really does embody his Hollywood persona One thing I noted is that this movie wasn't rife with Hollywood cliché's I expected to here it time and time again.. Jeff Bridges (the bad guy) killed his father.. never said it once (as far as I know) and in the end the comment about his father was more of a compliment to Roberts's character.. and what about the fact that Robert didn't exactly get the girl this isn't exactly a Hollywood typical fair..So what can I say about this movie.. Best Super Hero movie in 2 decades!! Original, interesting, good plot, good acting.. worth watching.. it won't shake you with awesomeness but it won't leave you bored either.. thank Allah, (cliché') that Hollywood can still turn out something original.",7,2,4,3 May 2008
