The Avengers," A perfect assemble of superheroes - The Avengers.
","After a long time of waiting finally The Avengers is released. I have waited for this movie from last 3 years. Iron man series is one of my favorite superhero series and I love to see every movie in which Iron man was there. So after long time I went to cinema hall with my cousin and watched the assemble of 4 superhero Hulk, Thor, Iron man, Captain America to save the world with help of Director Nick Fury and his agents Black Widow and Hawkeye.As movies starts it is more concentrated to storytelling and linking of the previous movies Ironman 2, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor and Hulk. The first half part is about summoned of these superheroes. Another part is packed with superb visual effects and sound effects also dialogs are awesome. Especially Iron man's dialogs are hilarious and quick witted.The movie is well balanced with story and action scenes some movies are failed to adopt this phenomenon such as Transformers 3 Dark side of moon and Ghost rider 2 spirit of vengeance. These movies are concentrated to only special effects and lacked in story whereas The Avengers has overcome from this. A mention about Phase 2 sounds like a another part of the Avengers that is part 2. This is one of the best action movie, watch it in theater that would be better than home. So go to cinema hall spend money it's worth it.",10,2,5,28 April 2012
127 Hours," What do you want more from a movie ????????
","127 hours is a movie based on a true story of a mountain climber Aron Alastan who struck in a canyon in Utah for 127 hours. Later he cut his arm himself with a Chinese multi-tool kit which have no sharp edges and survives..127 hours is directed by master story teller Danny Boyle who have directed a lot of super hits movies such as Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, Sunshine, Millions etc.A mountain climber Aron Alastan left his home without informing anyone where he is going on Friday morning. He even did not answered his mom's call. In the afternoon of Friday he struck his right arm with a boulder in a canyon of Utah . He tried to get help by screaming but he failed. Then he made a lever with a rope and tried to pull over the boulder but he failed again. later he tried several things in five days but everything gave him no result.He start filming himself with his camcorder. He had only 2 bottle of water one he dropped by mistake and have some foods. When all food end he cut his arm and start sucking his blood he also feeling of vomiting but he did not open his mouth for spill out because he knows this will lead him dehydration of water. He started bad dreaming in days and remembered his mistakes done in life he also had dream that whom he loves all of them are nearby him on a sofa. By that dream he got will to cut his arm himself and he got so much pain but he succeed. What a will of a man..... !!!! It's extraordinary...!!!! The most touchable scene is when he cut the his arm it's so unacceptable, hat's of the director, actor and all crew members for this scene in the film. What do you want more ????? This scene is superb I had several goose bumps while watching this scene and hearing the noise of cutting veins in his heart. The movie had best cinematography, sound effects and music,composed by A. R. Rahman, and it's too good. James Franco (Aron Alastan in movie) reached edge of acting. Danny Boyle is a great director and sure he will get at least, best director nomination for the directing of this film. What a good movie !!!! Watch this movie in theater nearby your locality It's worth of money...",9,0,2,3 February 2011

Visual effects are too good and sound effects are also good. Acting, directing and editing is also beautiful. Everything is well balanced. Hugo had won several Oscar, Bafta and Academy awards also. I love this adventure drama film. Total entertainment for a entire family. Watch this on Sunday with family everyone appreciate your choice.",8,3,5,23 April 2012
Warrior," An emotional drama to remember.
","Most likely I less prefer emotional drama movies because I do not want to wet my eyes while entertaining myself. Entertainment means enjoyment, an entertainment which will give tears in your eyes is not a entertainment, But in some cases tears in eyes gives you a pleasure that can not be purchased, and a pleasure is also a entertainment.While watching warrior I did not get any drops of tears in my eyes but the family reunion and love had touched my heart. I admire this movie because it has well storyline and well directed although song The National 'About Today' in last is superb. I love the song.Warrior is a movie which is referred by my friend to me, and he is referred by his sir. Warrior is a story of two brother who fought final match in mixed martial arts tournament both brother got separated in past and they live without their father. They hate each other because of their family problems and behavior but a brother is a brother, he loves his brother irrespective of behavior that is shown in the movie at last. I think that's why movie got more popular and fantastic.In starting 20 minutes movie is slow and boring but it gain speed at proper time, the cinematography, editing, screenplay, directing all are good, there are no need to complain, overall I like this movie and I enjoyed it twice.So go rent the DVD and watch it, have tears in eyes.",8,1,4,23 April 2012
