Come and See," A must see
",I think this movie was amazing. I think that there has been a lot of films that have been made about the time of Hitler and the tremendous tragedy that all felt. The way this film portrayed this time in history made you feel deeper than any film I have seen before. Your heart always hurts when you hear about the war but this film makes you feel like you are there experiencing it in the moment. I also enjoyed the parts of the film that were almost dreamlike and surreal and you wonder if the characters are floating to another reality or if this was reality and the insanity that was happening around them was a dream. I loved its raw beauty and tragedy. I highly recommend this film.,8,3,4,10 December 2007
