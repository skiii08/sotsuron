Requiem for a Dream," Quite an powerful film.
","This movie combined and amazing soundtrack with a shocking, but realistic ending that leaves you on the edge of your seat and let's you sink in as you reflect on what you just saw. I in fact loved this movie, as it shocked and appalled my sense of 'decency', if you will. The range of emotions experienced in this movie, by not only the characters, but also as the plot suddenly transforms, transpired to an excellent movie. The cinematography in Requiem for a Dream was unique and enchanting. Requiem best reflects Larry Clark's shocking `KIDS' documentary, as it presents you the truth about drugs between 4 deep and sketchy individuals.  The way the score was chronologically placed in the movie was pure genius, as it slowly crept up on you and then overtook the screen in the final few scenes. This movie shows us that reality cannot be escaped so easily without repercussions and dreams can be shattered in an instant.",9,0,0,27 January 2001
