"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Top Staying Power
","When 'Priscilla' first came out, my husband and I thought it had 'Oscar' written all over it!! Well, it won for costume design ...This movie, actors, and message have stayed with me and that makes it a 10+. I've seen it 4 or 5 times.We enjoyed the relationships between the friends ... and hope that in the near-future movies such as Priscilla, Flawless, and Brokeback can capture the coveted Oscar. That's when Peace can begin to reign across the globe.The scenery, the humor, the music, the costumes, and, last but not least, the story are all worth revisiting The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert over and over, making it a Classic for all times.",10,3,6,6 January 2006
