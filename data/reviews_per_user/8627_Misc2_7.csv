The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie that I ever saw in a theater!!
","this is probably the best marketing but worst movie that I ever saw in the past 10 years and probably in the next 10 years too. man, even now I still regret why I picked this movie to watch instead of watching the sixth sense when I was in Canada. :( thumbs big down. Poor video quality (I doubt that people would even consider to buy DVD version of this movie?? oh you did?? geez..), poor sound, NO MUSIC at all (not even light background music), poor acting (it's so fake!) gosh, the list could go on and on... why people would love this movie? THis must be a cultural thing. Probably only American people would love it, people living in other country would probably never get it. :(",1,2,3,27 October 1999
The Blair Witch Project," It sucks!
","After I read some good comments on imdb.com about this movie, I went to see this movie. It really sucks!! I admit that it's (the idea behind the film) kind of creative, but since the movie wanted to 'simulate' (this is NOT a true story by the way, I believe) what happened out there, the unprofessional shooting (camera moving so quickly and lots of temporarily black out) almost made this movie unwatchable. It was like you want to read a good written, creative novel (story) only to find that the font printed in this novel is SO SMALL and fuzzy that made the whole novel unreadable..I won't recommend this movie to anyone. But it's just my own opinion.Besides, although the actors tried to act really 'natural,' but if you are a movie fan and have watched a lot of movies, you would still feel that it's so FAKE. Especially the actress, man, it's so fake. When you are in such a scary situation and knew that you were totally lost in a forrest (in real life), how could you still so calm to continue shooting the film?? ha, it's really a joke!!I really regret that I spent my money to see this movie, one of the worst movie that I ever saw in a theater and in years. :(",1,1,3,21 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointed
","I have to say that I'm very disappointed with The Phantom Menace. It has great music, great visual, but lack of story (it's so hollow almost like a kid's movie). The story is just too easy to predict and I'm so surprised that it's almost a exact 'clone' of the first Star Wars with regard to the story 'pattern.'  Almost everyone could use a math formula to describe the whole story, that's not good.",6,0,1,23 May 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Still a great movie even watch it today
","Just watched ET again and still have to admit that it's really a master piece. The acting was great, story was great, and the concept was great. It really touched my heart when I see little children tried their best to help ET to go home. That kind of 'love' is what we American really need today.",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
12 Angry Men," Amazing! All the directors should see this movie!
","For those die hard Star War movie fans, I really think that you should watch this movie. Man, incredible!! This film is almost entirely set in one room for 90 or so minutes, as the valiant dozen play cat and mouse with the accused's life. But it would really suck you in and you just can't turn off the VCR while the story is going.. very powerful story telling and acting and directing! For those fancy special effect directors, you should really re-think of the power of good story telling!",10,0,1,27 May 1999
Glory," didn't feel anything
","I don't feel a thing after watching this movie, it's probably the best war movie shot before 1990 (consider the war scene was 80-90% realistic), but it just missing something, Robert Shaw is too young, acting was so-so, but other black actors were just great!",7,1,3,1 October 1999
Life Is Beautiful," The best movie that I have seen in years!
","Should I say more? Just rend it or get a DVD as soon as you could if you haven't seen it. A wonderful movie full of love, family and imagination. This movie definitely make the 'Austin Power' look like a 'toy' movie. One of the BEST comedy movie that I have seen in my life.Great job Benigni!!",10,1,2,21 November 1999
