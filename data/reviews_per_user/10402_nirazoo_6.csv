There's Something About Mary," Good but not the best comedies to hit the screens
","I think the high school parts were really hilarious and well acted. I prefer those scenes more than the time they have grown up. Visiting the house to take Mary for prom was very funny and written well. The chemistry between the two lead Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz. Matt Dillon was very good and funny. Also the rest of the cast were good too. Other than these facts, the movie was an average rom-com which really gets boring at a point. Even though every actor gave their best performance, the script could have been better. The thing I liked about the movie was the laughs and the soundtrack that was very suprisingly cheerful Overall, I would refer this movie for laughs (It has a lot of hilarious scenes in it) and for the chemistry between Ben and Cameron. So that is why I give this film a 6 stars",6,0,1,27 July 2018

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A truly brilliant masterpiece
","A movie about a washed up Hollywood actor who tries to try his stint as a Broadway Director is amazing. The movie dives into the celebrity world and shows every emotion of a man who used to be a popular actor of an iconic role he portrayed and his haunted by his past. A must see movie for movie enthusiasts. The acting, directing, production design, special effects and the cinematography is well done. A new take on camerawork by director Alejandro G.
