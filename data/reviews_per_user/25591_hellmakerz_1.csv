It," Loved IT!
","Simply Brilliant !! Highly recommended ! I was waiting for this one since i heard about it two years ago! I watched the original 1990 and i loved it a lot, And so i was afraid that this will fail like most of the Remakes nowadays But it Didn't ! Well directed , Good Scares, Totally worth the Cinema Money.",Null,4,10,7 September 2017
