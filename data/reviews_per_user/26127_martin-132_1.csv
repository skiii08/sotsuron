The Blair Witch Project," not as good as expected
","horror movies never are very good, but at least this one was creative. not enough dealings with the bad guys, and a ending that could have been better, although i guess a really crafty funky ending makes the home video concept seem less genuine. a reasonable way to pass a couple hours, but not as terrifying as your goofy friends say it is.",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
