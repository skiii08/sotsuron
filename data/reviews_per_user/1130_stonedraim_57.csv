Black Swan," 2010 Black Swan. 2015 Whiplash. ... or is it?
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Probably, there is a extremely thin line between ingenuity, extraordinary full-fledgeness (pun intended, yes) and insanity. There are many movies and books on this subject. Black Swan is one of them. Pushing yourself to the extreme 'only' to surpass both your competition and yourself; is the longterm aftermath and consequences worth it? Is it brave and impressive to struggle, practice and breathe just and only one thing in life to keep up and satisfy the trainer and the mentor? Can there be a sane life after being completely lost in a profession? All these answers is subject to discussions and debate. Black Swan is closing up to these matters of life.... and in a frightening way twisting them into a dark saga.Black Swan is a grasping drama motion picture that contemplates an important topic in a intimate way... and throws in sudden moments of thriller on the edge to horror. The entire production team has done a splendid work in taking the 'usual sudden horror jump-out-of-the- chair-moments' plus emotions and brought them new life through a drama kind of way; instead of 'horrifying monsters sudden impact', there is same emotions within the moments lived through the main characters experiences. Innovative and... fearsome...Natalie Portman is doing one of her absolutely perfected characters in this one. The splendid spectra of emotions and thoughts goes right through the screen. Ans she has the top-notch class to even give the character that little forced persona that often high performing show artists, dancers and so forth have. Just a little glimpse of that conscious 'over acting' within the role of the character. Wonderful and marvellous of Natalie Portman! Academy Award for that one.Point of views that becomes interesting for me: - A mothers sorrow of a lost career. - A disturbing relation between a daughter and a mother - Is sanity the insane... or is the insane sanity? - Society has extreme demands on culture and entertainment.. is it right to give the audience exactly what they want?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Reconnoitre of the ballet business and behind the scenes of the same is done very well. The focus on one thing and one thing only, to drive the motion picture into the supposed direction. Sound, picture, acting, costumes, make-up, lightning... achieved, yes! The soundtrack has the same theatrical sense as real ballet; touch√©! - The actors : Oh....my.... this production team has really casted this one for real. Astonishing! The director squeezes the facets out of each actor. This is true art. - The story : Ballet takes on the well-known 'how-far-are-you- willing-to-push-and-give-to-get-the-success' story. And that so in a dark and competent way. - Entertainment : Enjoying the acting and the tensions between characters. Academy Award winner, and I close my case. - Age : 15.7,9 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)",8,0,2,8 May 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," Blast from the past... meets Hidden.... meets Signs.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.John Goodman is nearly perfecting the character and lifts the whole movie... his acting is a feast for sore eyes. Because sore eyes this motion picture gave me. Sadly.... I had so high expectations on this one... and about 40 minutes into it it's still slow and just too boring to keep the tension alive.One thing that really shook things up were the sudden turning off events and also sudden death... just like that. Very emotionally made with close atmosphere there. Story closes in.... grabs hold of me... and there....on the floor...human in acid....did I hear somebody say Cloverfield Robocop?One thing that the production has done very well is the mysteria around the why and how of the underground living. When things starts to shake and the truth shall be revealed, there is a sudden and immediate impact from the other motion picture of Signs, by Night Shyamalan. Is it this...or is it that? Well.....the questionmark that Signs puts on is almost the size as in 10 Cloverfield Lane. In some ways it was too obvious and too clear to in a magnificent way shake the viewer up. The reason why there is turmoil is cleared up in a fast and almost fearsome way, just to get around again and... oh, no... is it that way?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Well made, believable and authentic. Environments and scenery give it a special touch. - The actors : They all... the 3 of 'em is nailing the characters and pushing the story forward. Good and solid! - The story : Well....... seen and heard it too many times. The twist at the end with 2 deaths, explosions and...behold....extra terrestrials, gives the story a kick. - Entertainment : Interesting to watch just to see what the truth is.... that's about all. - Age : 155,9 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)",6,0,2,25 May 2016

Guns. War. Money. Twist of a true story. Interesting story. One perspective is that 'more want more'. So much that it almost always goes down the drain, as it becomes too much to bear for the businessmen. Keep it simple, be grateful and take it slow, good and easy. These people did the opposite.Look this up: 'Where should we go for dinner?' '180 f-n'tons!'Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Typical American standard: this is a little further stretched than that. - The actors : Deliver what they are they for. - Entertainment : Ups and downs. - Age : 156,0 out of 10.

","Paint the big picture... with oil... for 87 days.**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.In very few words; these days it is fairly easy to look up and gather information (the internet, social media and so on). With that information and events, the true stories speak and act for themselves. A time ago, those stories needed to be tweaked for the viewer to be appreciated. These days, it is more and more the opposite. Deepwater Horizon is one of those. I am delighted to that fact!Sadly, often movies has to be themed and fictionalized is some way to really hit the great rate. So even here. I think people in general are numb to the plain and simple truth of events. That is sad... sad to the deep water.....Over to the movie as a product: - The production : More than the typical American Standard. - The actors : Kurt Russel. Mark Wahlberg. John Malkovich. Shall I go further to make my point? - Entertainment : The true story itself is more than enough. - Age : 157,3 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

HAHAHAHAHA! I love... I adore the way this movie begins. A bunny makes through police academy, says goodbye to the family and make the turn to the big city. Along with the story goes amazing song 'Try everything'. That graceful and dream flattering touch within the song made this story kick off in a ricochet way and then just continued to aim and shoot for the stars. When the first notes of the song with its 'Oh oh oh oh oh' reached my ears, the tears started to gather and my errector pili (yes, try and look that up on...well try Altavista for once....) go wild! Thank you, Disney! This is one reason (and bulls eye of that reason), why I clap my hands and hold American musicians and music dearly within my heart.The animations is breathtaking.... I am in awe! Magnificent and awesome!A little story of a bunny taking the opportunity to be an detective so solve a case leading to different scenarios. Little interesting touch in an animated movie to put crime and the work of an detective in front. Nice.Amazing scene with sloths. Here in Sweden, every Christmas Eve there is a program on the television at 3 pm showing old cartoons. It's called 'Donald Duck And His Friends'. At the end there is one or two snippets from new animated movies. Zootopia were shown 2015 in that program on Christmas Eve. I laughed hard at the sloths....so hard! Disney has again shown that animated movies is just as much for adults as they are for the youth and children.I will leave the rest up for you. Enjoy this one!No...just wait.... I have to add the phenomenal parody Zootopia does of The Godfather. The accent, the way the mob leader express himself... oh... it is exactly how Marlon Brandon did it in 1972. Magnificent!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent! I am in awe of the animations! - The actors : Nailing every character! Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman (one of my favourite actors)... massive work! - The story : Disney almost always have a deep moral woven into the stories. So even here. Very good! - Entertainment : Laughs. Tears. Warmth. Feel good. - Age : From 7... and I feel, that is correct. Some things that claims some maturity, as for a seven year old.7,7 out of 10.

To create something around a children's book is intelligent and creepy. Again....weird movie.Second comments after a day or two: I change my mind a big bit... watched the movie at night and shut down the sound because it scared me in a horrible way and made me feel nausea, which is really good as it is a horror movie. Now I have watched again with sound. The authentic feeling with a lot of silence is... appalling.A mind of a broken down mother can create every monster in the world.......... ;)Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Fair and good production. - The actors : Keeps up the script and brings it to the movie. - The story : A ordinary child terror with a screwed twist. - Entertainment : Fear of the dark.

The Danish Girl," Important... important movie... important message.
","*** May contain strong spoilers *** Who are we? Am I just the one I think I am? Is there more? The whole concept of transvestites, homosexuals and the other sexualities is very important for the human being.I will be totally honest. I am open for the sexualities of every human and the way every human chooses to live their lifes. Despite this, I had moments where I were moved in a peculiar way in this movie. Aspects that that also reflects in the film itself; is this right? Is there a right or wrong? Will the human being ever accept every thing about itself and other human beings? Can I have a little bit of this and a little bit of that, or do I have to choose and say no to something else? Can a 'soul of a woman' be born inside a man body, and vice versa? Is the person that existed before the transformation into the other gender a lie...is it wrong? Is the person schizophrenic in a 'good way'? The chooses of a human being is greatly beautiful to be made by the individual itself...wonderful! Important questions, and Alicia Vikander included Eddie Redmayne make these life situations very vivid.Aside from that; beautiful environments and beautiful designs and costumes regarding the era of 1920. Very good!On the downside... I am a Swede. I live 'close' to Denmark. Why....why speak English when almost every one in the movie should be Danish? It feels so... so... can I use the loaded word of 'fake' here?Highly recommend this movie of the importance of the human being.7,0 out of 10",7,0,1,7 February 2016
Orphan," Russian orphan being all alone in the world... with darkness around.

Magnificent and wonderful track! Anyhow.... this is something else.... oh, well.... to the movie.Got onto this story and motion picture with kind of high expectations. Two things that really got me almost directly; a little forced script and lame acting. The things: the nun says goodbye to the family and then all of a sudden needs to go outside and wave when the family is just metres from her? Typical bad directing, script and acting... it is separated from how the social behavior use to be. Nr. 2: the father neglects the sons achievement of Rock guitar all of a sudden in that manner as he has done it for years... and the situation is all new. Nr. 3: The mom and her mother speaks in the kitchen. They speaks around something and all of a sudden A.A.- meeting comes up. And then...just to clarify too much, she has to say that she's stopped drinking and things like that....? Like that were an enigma with A.A.-meetings? Nr. 4 : Oh no..... the boy in the family starts to bully his own sister? Even if she is an orphan and is separated from the rest of the family in that matter, this is just too much... builds up to an ordinary 'oh-a-little-cute-child-turns-out-to-be-like-a-demon' movie. Nr. 5: Oh, come on..... one meeting with a professional psychiatrist and Esther has tricked her senseless? This is just too much! This is ridiculous! Nr. 5:Realllly bad acting and directing... about 1 hour and 3 minutes into the movie. Saarsgaard.... please.... you have to push the director to push you further! Nr. 5: A father almost harasses his newly becoming daughter by saying 'You're not scared, are you!?', when Esther is going to the dentist? I have to say that by now this movie have to rise like a Phoenix to be good! Nr. 6: The father has accepted and convinced himself that Esther is just misunderstood and all things is just accidental. All of a sudden in less than five minutes he leaves all that and says straight to Esthers face 'You are so confused' and 'I have to quit this now!'. From 0 - 100 in five minutes?This could have been an splendid movie. With the ending this stops by little more than approved.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Well made as normal standard for an American 'almost good movie'. The blood and shatter is a little off here and there. - The actors : What can I say... sometimes Esther is rolling on her Russian accent with 'thunderous' R:s, and sometimes she speaks almost like a full blown American. Well.... I think this is kind of bad. - The story : Little angel girl turns out to be a human demon. Heard it before.... seen it before... bought the t-shirt. - Entertainment : Some entertainment. Almost just waited too see how much terror Esther could drive in and between the family members. - Age : 155,1 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)",5,1,3,11 June 2016

OK....big differences; Yes...it was the Swedish church. Yes... it is different from the Catholism. Still...it is the church.Through the years around the church I have heard many cases of people being 'bought out' of the church for making big mistakes and errors in their service. I have heard one case where one employee were 'bought out' ('retired early' I think the official statement was) as it came to knowledge that the employee as far as I have heard and understood were interested in young people... Yes....very young people. Illegal young people. Can it be that the church (in generally all religions) have acclaimed a false and therefor an nearly dangerous innocence? So, out of that perspective this movie is very important and raises a debate that is extremely vast of importance.Production: Solid! Excellent! Actors: Gives the emotion that a Academy Award Winner usually does. Entertainment: Very so, yes...indeed. Age: 15, due to topics and psychological aspects.8,3 out of 10",8,1,2,19 November 2016
Youth," Beautiful. Emotionally. Wonderful. Dream.... dream... dreams and of the youth. (The Grand Budapest Hotel II in a serious way.)
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.The opening scene in this movie has something special in it. You hear a band tuning up and then they start to play. Suddenly they cut to visual and the singer sings, the drummer plays.... only the singer is in focus, and they play on a rotating stage. One take and the tune continues in one take. Straight on, straight up, right on. And then cutting to Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) listening to the same tune that the band played. He seems little troubled over something... Cutting to Fred Ballinger (Sir Michael Caine) sitting in a garden being interviewed by somebody that apparently comes from the Royal Highness in Great Britain. Mr. Ballinger shows a little arrogance and fatigue with a high integrity and solid character directly. Very amusing! At the same time they focus in on a young man, Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), sitting at a table listening to the conversation between Fred Ballinger and the Queen's Emissary. A few cuts back and forth. And then suddenly a cut showing the whole garden and the young mans table is exactly centered and hiding the table between Mr. Caine and the interviewer. The whole scenery is just about perfect and my mind fly over to the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel. Fred Ballinger refuses to the Queen's desire and starts to play with a piece of plastic paper from a candy. Just by playing with the paper and the sounds from the paper you can hear the expertise from the conductor and the subtle music coming from a highly experienced conductor; the rhythm of drums and the rhythm of the whole orchestra. Mr. Ballinger's fatigue and his finished career and arrogance of the subject being brought up again and again is perfectly displayed by this simple manner... The Queen's Emissary says 'Gooday Maestro!' and leaves. Mr. Ballinger remains silent and continues to read his paper and playing with the candy paper. Jimmy Tree gives a little nonchalant salute to the conductor (as in 'Good work, there!') and Fred waves a little back... perfectly executed! There is so much going on directly in this movie that I just had to write this. These opening minutes is well planned, well produced, well directed, well acted and well accomplished... plain and simple great! The title of the the movie comes in after 14 minutes in a sequence that is true art. This movie is a piece of art. This movie has special moments. This movie is beautiful. You will love it, or you will hate it. And now the words will be left out for you to experience the movie.Instant classic line from the movie (Jimmy Tree, Fred Ballinger, a boy and Diego Maradona speaks to each other. They talk about the fact that the boy is left handed.) Diego Maradona: 'I am also left handed!' (instant silent moment) Jimmy Tree: 'Christ! The whole world knows you're left handed!' Diego Maradona: 'Thank you.'Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Wonderful cinematography! Very well written day to day dialogue. Sound recording with high class. The clarity of the picture deliver the sense of art that this movie has to offer. Sometimes a little bad sound editing where you can hear the in and out fadings before and after the characters lines. (Especially about 34 minutes into the movie between Michael Caine and Rachel Weisz.) The music is magic... Academy Award Nominee! Astonishing! - The actors : Competent with depth. Mr. Keitel and Mr. Caine together brings solid performances to the screen. - The story : Interesting. Exploring a hotel little like the motion picture Grand Budapest Hotel. Two friends having reflections over life and other things such as careers. - Entertainment : Great! Piece of art speaking of cinematography and picture recording blended with quite the interesting story... and Diego Maradona! - Age : Due to nudity, I will give this opinion to parental guidance.7,8 out of 10.

Hotel Rwanda," There is always room.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.The Rwanda genocide were happening during about 100 days. As far as the authorities could count, about 1.000.000 were slaughtered, butchered, killed... a brutal hunt due to deep political issues between what we all define as upper class and lower class. Terrible.This is, as I use to say, an important movie. Shed the light on a genocide that took place in a country 'only themselves cared about'. With just those first words, the whole situation and repulsing actions could point to the darkness of insanity. Many thoughts were let through as I watched this motion picture. One of them were that I had only 'heard something about terrible events in an African country'. This is why these movies is so important. If movies can gather the whole global population in a good and human way, let the movies do that. It can be a fantastic change. I am so glad I turned on this film and were able to grasp what happened down in Rwanda. Mr. Paul Rusesabagina; was he a hero? In the aftermath, there were information coming from a hotel guest during the real activities that Mr. Rusesabagina took money to keep the people at the hotel, with priorities given to the wealthier people. Is it correct to call Mr. Rusesabagina a hero? Only taken consideration to lives, he helped people to survive. About 50 years later from World War II, another man took action and saved lives. In WWII, it was Oskar Schindler.I can perhaps missed myself information in this movie about exactly what the story and history behind the genocide were. Perhaps I just filtered that through as I enjoyed the movie. On the other hand, if the writers Keir Pearson and Terry George left out some of the background information, this movie may miss the target a little bit. I myself researched a little around this devastating event. With that background information, I could in a better way understand and grasp the entire story and motion picture. Let's all make an effort to create a world where we wish each other well and treat each other well with good will. Where we desire that we all feel good. Where we all should take the chance to be the best versions of ourselves. Where we care about each other. Where the conditions are created to become competent adults and good individuals.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Authentic scenery. A soundtrack that gives the film a little push to enhance the drama. Editing in some scenes could have been better. A few times I could see some errors and strange things from cut to cut. Especially one time, the acting were suffering due to bad editing (quick talk between Paul Rusesdabagina and madame Archer). - The actors : Academy Award nominees. Questions to that one? - The story : Magnificent work to bring light upon the genocide. - Entertainment : Left me with both a sad and happy emotion thinking of all of us humans on this planet. Important and entertaining. - Age : 15 due to brutality and blood7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

The Hateful Eight," I still like Mr. Tarantinos work.....?
","****May contain strong spoilers****Have to be honest. The slow paced and detailed dialogue starts to take the toll on me. Have seen too much movies and communication acting to appreciate it to the fullest nowadays. I my perspective, Mr. Tarantino has to come up with something new and fresh.As usual, the package of the story and the movie is very intelligent and intriguing. Nice production, innovative (or is it, nowadays??)and really good acting.In my opinion, about 160 minutes is too long speaking of this kind of storyline.Nice touch of blending a criminal act and detective story into this one...who did what to whom? Fresh moments there.Very surprising seeing Channing Tatum in this kind of movie and with a production of Mr. Tarantino. All actors doing their part and nailing their parts. I LOVE Kurt Russell... he is just awesome and genuine. The question for me were if The Hateful Eight, The Revenant or Bone Tomahawk took the year of western in my opinion...here it comes...and I assume there will be a lot of question marks on this one; Bone Tomahawk took the prize. By the way... wanna see a copy of Christoph Waltz, and his character in Inglorious Basterds? Then....watch Tim Roth in The Hateful Eight. Almost a clone.

A long time ago, there was an evil force that kept the islanders on the dry land. Suddenly, the heart of the world had kept the secret too long, and there were the chosen one. Does this sound like a fairy tale made by Disney? Well, that is 'cause it is. Moana is a little too sweet, little too deep in the attempt of being cute, funny and amazing. Moana is a good movie. Moana is fun and cute. It could have been a lot better with a more serious matter of conveying the story, the actors and the jokes. This is keeping the movie in the 6,5 barrier instead of jumping up to the good old 'Eight of the great', speaking of IMDb.In the late days, the animation movies has begun to shape the appearances of the characters as a little nod to the real actor behind. So in here; Dwayne Johnson shines through and gives Maui (and yes, 'The Rock' is Samoan ((as Maui)) in real life) a solid voice and atmosphere. It is done with such intensity that 'The Peoples Eyebrow' is projected onto Maui. The production team also gives the character the little 'narcisisstic touch' that The Rock so shines with, speaking of his proud and hard muscles. That is both fun and good to watch.Nice nod to Raiders Of The Lost Ark 41:30 into the movie. Nice nod to The Abyss with the water as a lifeform... see especially at 1:18 into the movie....and.... you're welcome.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent and fantastic animations. - The actors : They are all animated. Did you miss that? (Dwayne Johnson struggles to keep it simple and believable.) - Entertainment : Yes, it is. Just to see all the nods to Dwayne Johnsons character 'The Rock' in WWE is funny.

Suicide Squad," Is this a suicide concerning creativity? Or a squad beneath acting?

Inflation. Heard of it? That's when something is losing it's value and there is something too much out there to be appreciated. The first word comes to my mind in here... inflation. Building the story up, starting it out just laying it out there... trying to be 'just so cool and, man, so awesome' with something serious over the top happening (with authorities, police officers, the government and something like that) and delivering it with some 70-80's music in the background and just so 'cool' and smart dialogue (...hear it, man? Yo!), to give it the weird and twisted touch. Grasping to be 'awesome in the cool-ness'. Just watch the opening scenes. Well... inflation.Just seen 'Stranger Things' and...wow, here he is again; David Harbour! Let's see if he delivers in the same way as in the stranger areas (pun? No...really?!)The Joker must have listened too much to Marilyn Manson. Sweet dreams are made of...? Well. Insanity, making the Joker looking like the rock star. And how...by the love of...by the love of...by the love of Robocop, how can Joel Kinnaman get these super roles in movies? Yes, he is a Swede, so am I. We are country men. Even so, I would strongly advice him to read the book by such of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for better knowledge about acting. I will go that far to even recommend the book of Sylvester Stallone (he got the nomination long time ago) and Arnold Schwarzenegger; they are way better actors than Mr. Kinnaman. He is often so bad that I can feel the directing through the screen. Where is the heart and soul of the characters? Gone. Joel Kinnaman made this production cave in. Just when the other actors have made it almost great a couple of minutes, in comes Mr. Kinnaman and... the house of cards is left in ruins.Inflation nr. 2: explosions, devastation, guns, bombs, ancient forces, 'alien-like- enemies'... is it really that hard to write something more subtle and innovative? Or is the money right now in these kind of movies?Do you like super hero movies and all the new X-Men? Then I can almost recommend 'Suicide Squad' as entertainment.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Kind of a modern film noir here and there. Twisted, crazy, weird and solid. - The actors : Did I mention Joel Kinnaman? (Otherwise, I have to say that Jared Leto created his own version of a modern new age Joker, and delivered... yeah, he actually delivered.) - Entertainment : Worth the watch. David Ayer got little water over his head here, both writing and directing. Too bad. - Age : 154,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

When being a victim of a terrible accident, saying to the surgeon who tells him that they did all they could: 'I could have done better.'Somewhere in the out rolling of 'Doctor Strange' the movie 'Inception' comes into mind more than three times. Is that good or bad? You decide.To the recommendation part. If you really like Marvel and 'super hero' movies with lots and lots of special effects, look this one up. Then it is probably deserved a high ranking, as for an 8 or so. If you are looking for another type of movie, for your own good, turn around and face another motion picture. For you, this one is probably worth only 4-5. Doctor Strange starts out as an interesting way displaying an Marvel story. As the story comes out loud, it fades away into infinity of devastation's, bombs, explosions, superheroes... you get the point.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Special effects. A doctor. And strangely enough more effects. - The actors : Enough. Enough for this type of movie. Benedict Cumberbatch faces his challenge in a good way. - Entertainment : As said before; yes and no. - Age : 154,8 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

Interstellar," In three words: WONDERFUL, AMAZING AND FANTASTIC!
","*** May contain strong spoilers ***I'll start off with a little personal touch: maybe one of the best movies I have ever seen! I write this review over 4 months after have seen the film, and still I have the emotion of a masterpiece within myself.As a firm believer of 'there is more to know about the universe' I really got hooked from the start with this creation.Matthew takes this one out of the ball park. The character of a father that comes back into the whole universe of space (pun intended) is somewhat of a vast task, and still he gets it all the way.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : very high quality and solid work all around. (Sound: good. Screen and picture: great. Editing: very good.) Won an Oscar for the production; says it all. - The actors : Well... 8.6 on IMDb says a lot. Great acting, splendid director. - The story : in its time (pun intended). Science is making breakthroughs and the human is getting more and more information about how the universe exists and got for the astronauts to explore. In a sense there is a little feeling of video games in the story; get into the worm hole... explore three planets... find out what is going on... - Entertainment : Have heard both sides... 'this movie is a waste of time and reaaaally should be thrown into the garbage can' to 'What an extraordinary and amazing piece of art!!'. Personally; nearly 10 out of 10. - Age : Couple of dramatic scenes that may be to much for the youth. Maybe too philosophic for the young ones, so I would recommend from 15 and up.Christopher Nolan; thank You for another one! Keep up the fantastic and wonderful work! This creation is definitely an interstellar... another pun ;)Instead of writing a bunch of what this picture is all about and the story, I'll just make the statement that; You have to see this... and....well....

This is the the beginning of a wonderful and heartbreaking movie named 'Lion'. 25 years passes; and the now adopted man returns to seek for his biological family.'Lion' is... I'm trying to find words.... Fantastic! Due to that it is a true story, it is marvellous! As a bearer of India in my heart (Mumbai and Goa 2002), I've seen the poverty and the hunger in the misery on the streets of India. To understand all that, You have experience it there yourself... in India. As a traveller there about 15 years ago, 'Lion' found it place directly in my heart.This movie is allowed to show India its pure nature; raw, ugly, poor, religious, sad... to grasp all that and still deliver the true story within 'Lion' is astonishing!I close this review right away, just to give you the time to experience it yourself.

The Revenant," Crawling into the bone
","****May contain strong spoilers****As this movie is very different from almost everything else that is done today, it was an experience to watch it. The vast nature environment, the grueling story and the truth from the age of time makes this piece a spectacular one. Great acting, great script, great director and a splendid production blends together to make the movie and the experience a magnificent one. The violence in this movie is both haunting and realistic. Remember....it's in the beginning of the 19th century. As the story goes the picture also has some spiritual and soul searching aspects. I my own opinion, I have to say that people that claims that this movie is just waste of time and boring....sadly, they are missing the point and lacking the way of enjoying art.On the other perspective; If you want action, explosions, sex and 'Hollywood-where-is-the-reality' type of movie with fast pace and impulsive rounds of shotguns....well.... this movie can be rejected. So...I can grasp where the negativity for the movie comes from.In my perspective; let this one take hold of you and make the mindfulness fill you. We have so much to learn about love and caring for one another.8,0 out of 10",8,7,13,27 December 2015

Humour, brutality, warmth, strength, reality... it all fits together in this picture and brings a great experience for the viewer. I thought; Oh....another one about the wars and the Second World War. I confess; I was wrong. And I am grateful and happy to have seen this movie.In my perspective; Oscar nomination...?

Split," M. Night Shyamalan climbing up... should he make 25 movies, to complete the circle?
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Right into it; The way M. Night Shyamalan in a very clear way makes his way through the 23 different personalities into the showcase of the movie is more than great. All viewers should have a fair chance to take onto the contemplation of the 'different splits'. On his edge, Mr. Shyamalan is here. Enjoy!It seems as Mr. Shyamalan has taken several movies and stories as inspiration and made this his own. I find traces of 'Room' and 'Cloverfield Lane 10' On top of this, the hide and seek motion and emotion from different horror games grasps hold of the screen as the audience just can follow through the games of the 23 patients. Watch the game 'Alien Isolation', 'Dead Space' and 'Outlast'...As usual (speaking of let us say Signs, Unbreakable and The Village) the blend of a social oriented day to day basis along with a creeping disliking horror comes to surface as the time passes by within 'Split'. If you like a some what original movie with a tight script and story, then 'Split' should be taken care of by you. Some of you will crumble into psychological elements now and then, just to be aware of yourself jumping high and.... scream?!One of biggest fear of modern society may be the new and yet to explore sides and spaces of the human mind. All the psychological aspects, all the dysfunctional aspects, all the borderline discussions and the realism of philosophy; 'Split' combines that with fear and throws a vast heap of question marks along the entertainment to both comply and investigate. I am very impressed how this is handled. Look about 35 minutes into the movie.----- 41:30...hey.....it is M. Night Shyamalan himself behind the computer! 'I've got red socks... I've got blue socks too... etcetera...' Is this review a little different and goes here and there...? Yes, it is. Can there be a 25th........? 'We are what we believe we are.' -----This movie evolves around very interesting and deep matters. Can a human mind through extreme 'measures' or 'pure power' change a human being physically? Can it be that a human that has traumatic and tragic episodes processed have a more vast conscious and become/be more of an evolved person? Is schizophrenia a psycho-social matter, or is it in some way 'a true distorted view' formed by the mind and brain, physically? What if adrenaline by the form of the story behind Bruce Banner becoming an extremely strong human being (The Hulk) combined with schizophrenia can create 'something'/someone abnormal, as the beast in here.....? Can a person develop strong skills and behaviours from animal and form itself from there on into something else...?M. Night Shyamalan himself were 'bad mouthed' from fans and media about being a some what of schizophrenic.... and here he answers all that with a whole movie. (Clap clap!) The woman in the movie has been sexual abused. Can that be that she comprehend dominating males to be 'monsters'... is that her perspective? The viewer gets to know her more and more... and, at the end.... why is the steel bar of the cell all of a sudden straight again...? Is the perspective in her mind?In a time where the neuropsychiatric world is more and more explored and 'combinations' such as ADHD, ADD and so on is under the microscope, 'Split' takes that social debate and twists it. Well done! Are the society labeling too harsh and being judgemental...?The ending is one of the most intelligent I have seen in a long, long time. Made the rate jump up a bit, actually... over 8,0. It starts about 1 hour and 50 minutes into the movie. The music, the timing... M. Night Shyamalan... Sixth sense, Unbreakable... Bruce Willis.... Mr. Glass..... it all came down to this. I shouted right out and felt my hands applaud... What an ending!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : An simple and pure production. In its narrow path of production, the horror elements become grotesque. Mr. Shyamalans way of letting the truth and authentic story come forward is right in place in 'Split'. M. Night Shyamalan has almost perfected his own style. - The actors : James McAvoy nails the part. He delivers both pure evil, manipulation and grief of some kind. A textbook example of schizophrenia; see about 40 minutes into 'Split'. The whole session is finalized with depth of an competent actor surrounded with expertise of M. Night Shyamalan. - Entertainment : The motion picture takes you on a roller coaster. Up...down...here and there... and inside out, if you let it. - Age : 15, due to strong psychological aspects, violence and blood.8,5 out of 10.

Captain America: Civil War," An Avenger movie with new angles and depth.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.First off, two things comes to mind. Nr. 1: When will Robert Downey Jr. involve himself in a movie that is plain and simple bad with bad acting? Because Robert Downey Jr. is one fantastic and splendid actor that nails his characters every single time with his eccentric and detailed persona. Very sophisticated, sarcastic and subtle at the same time. Nr. 2: It feels so good and safe watching a movie that obviously has a vast budget, a really characteristic and experienced director and good actors all through, such as William Hurt, Paul Rudd, named Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Don Cheadle and Jeremy Renner.As I have written before, these modern Marvel movies has become atomic bombs in sense of delivering devastation, war and explosions...so to speak. Therefore, it is very fresh and it feels good coming to that conclusion that this picture starts off in little more emotional matter. That with the relationships between the Marvel characters and the little story around Tony Stark and his work for the students at the university.To involve both the Spider-Man and the Ant Man seems like a fresh angle and a moment that created a strong; 'Hey! That was fun...nice...cool!' The thing that these characters all of a sudden came into place, was coming from out of the blue as a very needed surprise. And at the same time, as someone else wrote in here; did they have to involve those new characters for the fight to be exactly 6 on 6? Did they...?The humour in the film is generally sophisticated and blends into the movie in a neat way. Instead of creating humour into the story, the characters themselves, just being the way that they are creates elements of humour in the incidents and moments that goes by. That is professional and an aware work from the director and the script writers.Best dialogue of this motion picture: The secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and Tony Stark discusses the situation. Tony Stark: 'Let me catch 'em... give me 72 hours.' Thaddeus Ross: '36 hours.' Thaddeus Ross leaves and Tony Stark expresses his emotions: 'Hmmm... my left arm feels numb... is that normal?'Dialogue nr. 2: The woman plants Ant Man (that is new to the gang) into the side of the van. Somebody asks Sam 'Falcon' Wilson (Anthony Mackie); 'What the hell was that?' Sam Wilson: 'Everybody's got a gimmick nowadays...'Maybe the best Avenger screen picture I have seen in a long time... Instead of having a massive and over explicit fight in the end with devastation, bombs, guns, explosions, superheroes etc., they have implemented like 3-4 fight into this one and more kept the process on a relationship basis, which gives the whole story a deeper and more trustworthy meaning. Superheroes that fight side by side solving inner differences between them for a greater cause; a really good script. You have done a great job, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Solid production with a few errors here and there where it clearly stood out that it was effects. All in all, splendid production speaking of sound, visuals, special effects, editing, acting, directing, and so on. - The actors : Every actor nails their own special character and their superhero talents. The directing is very, very good. Thank you, Anthony and Joe Russo! And again... Robert Downey Jr., a class act of his own. - Entertainment : Very much so, indeed. - Age : 117,5 out of 10.

The Conjuring 2," Take a breath... count to ten... see the true shadows which the academics clarifies as fiction demonization and say... MY HOUSE!
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.This is one more of Hollywoods productions where it is clear that they learn more and more about how to entertain the audience. The way that more and more movies only uses the sounds of the surroundings and the natural sound effects and keeps it quiet around, that brings a more authentic touch and a deeper presence throughout. The haunting is taking place whenever, wherever and with whomever. The police is coming at night and as in other horror movie and motions pictures overall, the events and incidents suddenly stops. Here... oh no... it keeps on. The family of the Warrens is haunted at the same time as the new case comes in place; the first spiritual experience in the Warrens residence is of a nun. The police says minutes before to Peggy that the priest of the church is a friend and that the priest will call the Hodgsons. The religion and church blends together and is used as a line of argument. Wonderful! The production team has made an excellent research and at the same time a nod to the horror movies of the 70's. Where the then modern design were natural, the production team takes the same thing and push it a notch in modern daylight to give this movie a splendid design. They uses for example a girl with the 70's haircut and clothing (as is natural, of course) and puts some of the classical camera production in place just as it was in the 70's. There is some small camera movement representing the movement of the human body that is just... oh, it is so legislative and enhancing! This and a knowingly and consciously work to make the camera slidings and movements accommodative! All through this named topics; genius!We may have one of the few sequels that beats the original one here. Yes.... actually, we may have that.To come bock to the beginning of this review; oh, yes... there is some hefty signs and traces from Poltergeist. The TV starts to go crazy and.... MY HOUSE! There is also some nods to the production behind Poltergeist; in one scene in Poltergeist the chairs around the kitchen table is behind the scenes put up in a very fast way from one moment to another, all in one take. In Conjuring 2... also...all in one take; a chair is set in one place... the camera is rolling and the girl is acting...zooming out, the chair has been moved. A whole room is shut down because it was there the activity were more than demonic.... and there is the line of argument from Poltergeist. 'The Babadook' has taken its toll on the crew here... suddenly a presence is coming alive from a toy and children's song; as taken straight out of The Babadook. The classical of Warlock has maybe been been seen; what is the name of the demon....? It even rains and has an relationship to a book, just as in Warlock. I really appreciate the way the whole team behind this movie has gone through and in depth of 'old horror movies' and taken some small things, some small bits and pieces here and there and made them their own. Clap, clap! (yes, pun intended to the Conjuring)There is so many little story lines, incidents and events throughout that I could write for hours. An enormous twist that is within the spiritual world; Bill is himself haunted by an evil presence, making 'him' do the things 'he' do to the family. Later on, suddenly there is proof that the girl is faking it all; an hoax. Enjoy the Elvis impersonation, the crew taking documentations and the love between the Warrens, as Mrs. Warren is scared to death (pun intended) of losing her husband.......Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and production design is top notch. I was enjoying... nay, I was feasting on the astonishment of this motion picture. 'Somebody get an ambulance!!!' is a excellent way of going from let us say chapter 1 to chapter 2. The frozen picture, the terror in the mothers scream and the echoing is accentuating this whole process, just as in a saga. Chapter 1 is finished. Off to Chapter 2. And then chapter 3 goes off with the lyrics of 'I started a joke'; spot on! - The actors : Solid, good and realistic. Vera Farmigas scream in the beginning of the film is horror chilling and icing to the bone. The little girl (Madison Wolfe) is shaking and stirring things up here; I could feel her horror! Academy Award in the future! - The story : A house that is haunted. A well known and used story. And.... they make is work...oh, they make it work. - Entertainment : Chilled. Horrified. Scared. - Age : 15... or even 18 due to the depth of religious and spiritual level in which the evil is presented.8,2 out of 10.",8,1,4,19 June 2016

Kennedy and his death. Herein, it is viewed a little different.As the story drags through a mist of sorrow and despair of Mrs. Kennedy, the journalist is there to remain steady, calm and deliver a hard hitting social question mark. It is also the journalist that sums the story up, confirming the bitterness of Mrs. Kennedy. Look it up... about 1 hour and 22 minutes into 'Jackie'.Natalie Portman delivers such a steady role that it is more than fair that she is nominated for an Academy Award.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very good regarding the time and era.

Legend," Hardy is kind of a hard and dry Hardy bloke.
","****May contain strong spoilers****Sophistication. Crime. Insanity. Money. Brutality. True story.As the story goes on, I am hooked. The story and the movie has a great start out and many laughs upon the twins of Kray, Ronald and Reginald. The longer the picture rolls out, some things begins to fade and the interest does the same, sadly. I have to agree with other reviews that come with their perspective of a brilliant Tom Hardy and a 'so-so movie'. The first 35-45 minutes is just a heavenly entertaining chunk of movie, with it's pure and dry British humour and a brotherly love.The production is solid; all in for that one.What happens in the late of the movie is the great sad story behind the brothers. Maybe it's there where the movie loses some of its touch. Starts out as a interesting crime story with lots of interesting happenings... just to spiral down the staircase many steps to the lies, anger and sadness.With that said...maybe the film is great, after all...all in all. Maybe it's the true story that is hard(y) to comprehend.Thumbs up for good actors and good directing...and Tom Hardy makes one of his best performances, against and with himself.7,1 out of 10",7,1,2,28 December 2015
Room," All room there is lies within
","7 years is a long time. It is a 5 year old whole and complete life. The story behind this movie is so much more than possible displayed via a screen. A life taken away from the world is gruesome. A life coming to the world inside a maybe 10 square metres of a room is so far away what the ordinary thoughts can grasp. I were so emotionally involved in the way the mother had routines, structures and organization to build both her and her sons life. Amazing! The whole concept of a human settle down in its own mind and accepting a room for life is breathtaking. Accepting the fate and raising a child for 5 years inside a shed. If I only think about that, I feel so alive and proud of the freedom in the world... the freedom in making own decisions. So...all right....enough with the philosophy and the realistic point of view for this one.Oscar nominations has brought attention to the picture. And that is fair. This movie has great acting, great production, great aspects of the whole storytellling and a really good director.Maybe there could be even more realism considering the boy is out in the world for the first time in his entire life.... and, on the other hand... the mother had raised and educated her child in such a good way that the courage took overhand in situations and helped them escape.The way back into the world can be long. The way back into the world can be devastating. Sometimes is the sad thing the only thing to hold on to...the habit of having something.I am so impressed by the way the story and the movie rolls out. Splendid and important movie.8,3 out of 10",8,1,5,19 February 2016

Despite of the almost 12 years passing by since this won Oscars, I can honestly say that it was one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. Been produced in 2004.... WOW! A lot better compared to multiple movies being made today.... and that says a lot.So... a family being incredible with all super skills... can that be something? YES, IT CAN! Take a little the Saint...take a little Avengers.... take a great deal of James Bond... take a great deal of Superman and the Marvel hero group. Shake it around in a crazy mans brilliant head... and there you have it... Brad Bird. ;)Overall a great experience. On the downside it stands clear that both the story telling and the humour telling is a little out of date. Some things can be told before they happen. Some comic incidents and humour skills is little to obvious, to be funny in a WAY OUT LOUD- thing in 2016. And.... maybe that is only a little charming nostalgic trip into our history?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Academy Award winner. Questions, anyone....? - The actors : Hahaha..... Craig T. Nelson meets up with Samuel L. Jackson. Amusing and authentic and more than well acting. Great job, everyone! - The story : Good old fashioned 'come to save the day' and some twists into that. Very good! - Entertainment : Maybe little too stuck in its age of 2004 for its own good.

What if we could look inside a billionaires life and mindset; is money always satisfaction? Is money the way out?

A movie that tend to play the strings of mysterious ways and suspicion.

Girl lying in bed (in Batman Bruce Wayne is in bed), the father says 'Never!'... as so does Alfred in Batman.There is a strong message behind and inside 'X-Men: Apocalypse'. Will humanity fall by its own hands? There is also 'an description of how 'God' can act and be', just watch En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse. What if there is a 'God' that is a mutant, can grasp everyones power to become almighty... and is just asleep and been so for thousands of years? Well, it is whatsoever in every way besides that a great story and can deliver fiction.This X-Men has transformed into a youth based fiction that better suits up into the category of let us say Hunger Games and Divergent. This... is a sad fact. The world is suffering from environmental threats, economic disasters, terror and then some... The movie industry suffers from inflation in special effects. And; period. As once said in movies; we need a bigger boat (Jaws).... we need big f****g guns (Split Second)...well, it could be one of those things that makes X-Men sink. Or am I wrong?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Great effects and sound. - The actors : Has to connect more with emotions to deliver.

Silence," Cinematography. Period.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.To the point. Do you like movies about religion and its priests and gatherings? Then look into Silence. Otherwise, just ignore this. Silence comes into play as two priests search for their mentor and spread the word and faith of Catholocism. It is fascinating how the world and people has developed from the surrounding religion and faith that were all mighty life through God. There is strong similarities between the fate of the priests and the movie itself, and the known story of Jesus Christ and his suffering, becoming a martyr.Martin Scorceses presence is touchable in here. The silent tempo with the dialogue... it is Mr. Scorcese, that is right. The length of the movie has also MArtin Scorcese written all over it, and that is on the bad side. If Silence were just about one hour in length in all, it could have been well worth the watch. Now... it is just passing by. Add to that what is written below under the production section.On the upside, there is a natural and comfortable pace and display of the story in 'Silence'. That is shown and delivered in a good way. Almost free and a prayer parallel during the entire movie.On the outside and the poster of 'Silence', you see Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson is just a little figure being in play some minutes in the film. To put him on the poster is a trick taken from the 80's: put the most known actor first, how little he or she may be in the movie. Naive and false trick to market a movie. Used here, in 2016. I say; what??This is the first film is a looong time that I have fast played forward during the film after 40 minutes. That is remarkable.Andrew Garfield. It is highly interesting that one actor can be involved in one confusing and poorly executed movie, and at the same time and year be involved in a great one and also Academy Award nominee, 'Hacksaw Ridge'.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : It was a looong time ago I saw and heard so bad editing, both visual and of sound. Several times the sound goes up and down in the same take. You can hear the wind in the microphone (one example: about 28 minutes into the motion picture). The visual editing time to time is so bad that you can easily and comfortable see that things is changing within the seconds in the same scene. Maybe I also saw the same scene being used twice (watch as Garupe ((Adam Driver)) is hitting hard in the cabin to split the food up). If that is so, this is almost a new low speaking of great productions and speaking of movies nominated for the Academy. The make-up is easily to discover, especially as the Japan Christians is crucified near the water; this is awful! At the same time frame of the movie, you can see how poorly executed the production is as a Christian from Japan is hanged on a cross only bound by his arms. His legs are free and still his arms is bent as he stood on something... what is this? Have the production team just almost fumbled totally on this one? The cinematography is amazing and wonderful, yes, and there the Academy Award nomination comes in hand. Otherwise; I'm so surprised that the surprise almost switches to a chock... oh, my! - The actors : Sometimes Mr. Scorcese is grasping for the natural behaviour so far and too far, that it becomes bad acting. There is a thin line, yes... and Mr. Scorcese had to be blind for that. - Entertainment : Religion, Japan and priests. Entertaining... for me, a vast no. - Age : 154,6 out of 10.

I thought that was an Nintendo game. I was wrong.La La Land. I thought that could be an boring jazz thaaang. I was wrong.La La Land. I thought a lot of prejudice would do me right. I was wrong.

Welcome to an astonishing display of music, theatre, acting, dancing, timing, stepping... and a major nod and salute to the musical classics and all of those people who strive to get somewhere in the show business. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are vivid in this motion picture.You take a a little of Academy Award winner 'Whiplash' (hey...what do you know.... J.K. Simmons!) and go bananas with 'Birdman' and let energy flow through with the twist of 'Singin'in the rain'. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone takes on Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, and out comes: La La Land! Excellent!As I am myself an musician and more, this movie went into my heart. Wanting that lifestyle... to be able to do the genre of show business that you really dreaming of, and to that full time with a good financial situation. This movie conveys that well.One definitive sad thing about 'La La Land'. That one thing made that nice balloon pop and the air went right out, in a strong negative way. In fact... I was going to give this motion picture a strong rate of 8 or more of 10. Then it came... and left me really sad with a strong melancholy inside. There it was... the one thing that made me go 'No... why, in this kind of movie?'. That settled the score for me. 6,2 out of 10. The reason;'The End'.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Academy Award nominee. Winner of 7 Golden Globes. Questions anyone? - The actors : Academy Award nominee.

From Hell," Stylish with less to offer.. with a 'Hell, yeah!' (a curse of the pun)
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****Right into the 19th century in the heart of England. The accents, the people and the city gives a breath of the time. Nice little touch with a man giving illegal protection to prostitutes, instead of being the ordinary coupler. Being true to both the age and the country (speaking of the language) raises the bar both for what may come in the movie and also creates the precise and trustworthy frame to 'From hell'. Joyce Gallie and Sally Osoba has been able to gather true British talent in seeking of the authentic expression; Ian Holm, Ian McNiece and Robbie Coltrane is just a few there.As of many movies that Johnny Depp is both involved in and also acts in, there is an vast theatrical sense going right through the screen in here. Maybe it fits the 19th century as the story is rolling out into, and maybe it fits anyway. It made me wonder, even so. Interesting to watch with those clear and explicit expressions and acting.The way Jack The Ripper is presented shows what way the producers, the writers and the entire team behind the motion picture wanted to go. The criminal killer is embedded in a gentle costume that has a solitude feeling of a sophisticated count, with the black cape, pure white gloves and the black hat. Add the little toolbox by velvet with knifes and such that is treated with a careful hand, being clean, in order and structured... then you have 'The Ripper' in here... as a terrifying and hidden monster growing for more... As if being displayed on stage as theatre. Appreciated!Some special effects blended with dark orchestral music creates moments here and there that pushes this film upwards both in entertainment and quality, besides the planning of the mentioned. A picture is taken of the photographer; flash, and a black and white second is being displayed. 28 min and 30 seconds, a blood red sky gives the impression of the pure grit that grips hold of the situation. Astonishing! At 41 minutes, the fast cuts as knifes cuts through the air showing the instruments of dissect, and a filter of strange colour for the screen. The colour of red is recurring here and there, just to underline the stream of blood that is important for the 'refined gentleman that has drops of blood in the wine and eats rare steaks', Mr. Ripper himself. A delicate touch of art, there.Underneath all this theatrical undertones, expressed acting and the story itself, there lies a clear social question mark; how far will the human being go for the sake of science? Can it be any good in killing innocent people to receive and get the answer for important breakthroughs in medical and scientific matters? Can it be any good in showing horrible diseases as in the old freak shows and circuses, to get the mentioned breakthroughs? Just look at about 46 minutes into 'From hell'. Interesting how Joyce Gallie and Sally Osoba gets the whole storyline together, indeed. Raw brutality and effective and close detective work, plus the atmosphere that it all brings into 'From hell'. In 'The Silence Of The Lambs', it's 'I ate his liver with a can of beans and a bottle of Chianti'. In 'From hell'; 'I send you half the kidney I took from one woman, preserved for you. The other piece, I fried and ate. It was very nice!'. Psychological frightening. And then, the title being mentioned in its fully state: 1 hour and 15 minutes.Sadly, 'From hell' only reaches a little above a good movie. To reach for the high and excellent rate, they should have pushed more into the actors, pushed more into the written dialogue both in timing and social expressions as for a more vast and appropriate vocabulary (as some expressions is over used, such as 'these unfortunates' and 'whores'), more well written screenplay, worked harder for the extras/the figurants to be better, dug deeper for the special effects, pushed harder for the realism and the authentic feeling of the blood and the gore, a more believable and distanced relationship between Abberline and Mary, and created a better soundtrack. Then, 'From hell' would have taken a better place in movie history.I really want to give this film a higher rate. And.. again, sadly, I will settle with around 6-7.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made! Costumes, the era of the century, the society... then some little vague production speaking of let's say the blood. - The actors : Some good, some just above approved. This kind of movie maybe sort the acting out by itself, leaving an experience of art for the viewer. Robbie Coltrane gives a solid touch of the sophisticated yet straightforward English man; nice to see. Heather Grahams attempts to give the character some depth is dearly missed, I might say. They should have gone with some other actress there (to get the innocent prostitute with working moral and social ambition) to grow and be displayed. - Entertainment : Yes. - Age : 15 or maybe even 18. This is due to the grotesque art that the story gives, and also the cruelty, the harsh environment and much nasty gore. Add Jack The Ripper, some horror elements and a mysterious form of script line, and maybe 18.6,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)",6,0,0,4 September 2016
Reservoir Dogs," Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?
","****May contain spoilers****I had great expectations on this one. Have seen movies from Mr. Tarantino. Last one Pulp Fiction. Have to say that Mr. Tarantino has grown into both the big picture (punt intended) and his role of a movie creator. Pulp Fiction were disappointing. Reservoir Dogs were a bigger one. All the dialogue and the dialogue and the dialogue and the dialogue... all the communication about small ordinary day details...come on! Yes, I think the work and the dialogue from let's say Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained is pure genius. So, Quentin Tarantino has really kicked it up several notches.Reservoir Dogs. Some good moments, several boring and the movie is just trying to get to the goal, only to miss it. Sure, the way of directing and trying new things with camera angles, the characters way and several innovative production works...that is fine. I really appreciate that.A thing I can appreciate in his movies is his sometimes sophisticated detailed social dialogues about something small...let 's say a fly on a dirty wall. 'Hey, have you seen that fly? The wall is dirty? Is it because of the fly? Why does flies love dirt... or do they? Was it a big fly? Maybe it was a wasp? How did you know that? You asking me? How should I know? I am asking you because you have a doctor degree from Harvard. So? Well... flies maybe love dirt? Especially on dirty walls. Do you think it's special with a bathroom room or a just ordinary wallpaper wall? You asking a guy that maybe has a doctors degree from Harvard? What am I... a f'''''ing fly spy?' Well...you get the point.The best part in the movie; I am a Swede....hearing the Swedish artist Bj√∂rn Skifs singing 'Uggashacka, uga, uga, ugashacka' were the highest entertainment moment.And as usual.... this is StoneDraims own opinions and comments.5,9 out of 10",5,0,1,25 December 2015

If you are to watchthis movie... this piece of odd art, then you have to be prepared... really prepared. I recommend this movie for only 18 and above!Sal√≥. I try to write something about this movie and there is so much going on in my mind. Is it a masterpiece? Is it only a polished turd (pun intended)? Is it genius? Is it totally insane? Is it great? Is it bad? Is it beautiful? Is it ugly? Is it horrifying and compulsive? Is it creating nausea? Is it art? Is it plain and simple evil? The answer is yes to all above. A pure showing of a religious experience of a narcissistic group of fascists. Doing exactly what they want and how they want and when they want it, just for their own pleasure.I have seen a lot of movies. I have experienced a lot of genres. This movie shocked me. Both as an adult and as a youth. By a mistake I saw the part of the eye-gauging torture and have been wondering what movie that was. Suddenly, just a few days ago... I saw it again. It was pure sodomy. The scenes where the people is eating and feasting on human excrement as it was a lovely and wonderful delicious dessert on plates with spoons...... those scenes were just.... just so repulsive.One thing I can guarantee you; you will remember this movie. I understand why the director was killed under certain circumstances after the completing of the movie.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Extremely well made to be from 1975. - The actors : More of a documentation of human torture. - The story : Spot on. Pure in its own way. The one of a kind story. - Entertainment : This movie is... everything... and then I mean everything. - Age : 18... with a warning before.

A low budget production with a lot of strength and charisma. The heavy environments and simple way of doing the cinematography and the visuals is tremendous. Terror is hunting two individuals down and the elements of emotional distress when watching this one is high here and there. Innovative with only three main characters throughout the entire story. A claustrophobic act when the man and the woman is locked inside the house; this is is giving the film a well deserved and earned push. Simple story and yet so compelling and fresh at the same time. Two very big twists that flips the story around and keeps it moving forward at the same time. Two twists that is well placed and made me on-edge at times. The blind man takes them one by one and he wants to get a new daughter... and how will he do that...?Some references to the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (chased through the basement), 'Saw' (when the girl is tied down in the basement, acted by Jane Levy) and a little taste of 'Cujo' (the mad dog).At the end of the movie I was having a little adrenaline going through me and wishing that this 'Don't breathe' (or 'Hold your breath') will be the only movie in contrary to the movie industry, where sequels is more common today. When I thought it was all set and done (like I did three or four times), the motion picture is just going on and on and on and on... with a nice thrust every time. This movie is very well worth a watch, and I recommend it to the ones that want a moment with a simple, innovative, high octane and hard boiled thriller flick... with some deep horror elements.One liner of the movie: The blind man: 'Nine months, and I will give you your life back.'Over to the movie as a product: - The production : The production is great speaking of camera angles, the solid dark visual theme, the sound and the editing. Sam Raimi having a little say and touch to this one. Good! Director/writer Fede Alvarez, writer Rodo Sayagues, producer Sam Raimi and producer Rob Tapert, the composer Roque Ba√±os, and also actress Jane Levy all worked on 'Evil Dead : 2013' before this movie. - The actors : Both the directing made by Mr. Alvarez and the actors is there and in place... very good in balance of telling the story and keeping the tension and thrilling action going forward. Director Fede Alvarez has done a tremendous job with a minimum cast. Stephen Lang is delivering a very good performance creating a hard hitting ex-soldier with a criminal vengeance resulting in an gritty and dangerous man. - Entertainment : Been a while since a movie made me sit up and on edge. So I have to say 'Yes' to that one. - Age : 15. Language, heavy violence and psychological aspects.6,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

The haunting emotions, the fear, the anxiety, the terror... and the complex warmth from the people around John Nash. Fantastic! Can there be an understanding coming out from that 'genius and bright minds' goes too far in an complex pattern inside the human so that it creates an imaginary world out of 'an fake habit'....?Russel Crowe shows his best sides in acting and should have been given a double Academy Award for his work in this motion picture.

Made by instrument that really sounds that it would come from the time of the story. Realistic scenes and even so very terrifying. The music and soundtrack makes the story and the subpoena horrific. Creeping upon you.... scaring me in a old, great way. Two worlds crosses and leaves the viewer in a realistic sensation of the strict holy life within 'God Jehova' and the existence of evil; these two things just collide and creates the horror itself. The realistic and authentic pace and situations that clashes is more than enough to give this motion picture its atmosphere and message to the viewer. Even the language is old English and gives the film an even deeper touch of a authentic storyline.The entire living of a family being banned for religion in the 17th century is very well depicted, in language, picture and social considerations. A tragedy strikes the family and throughout the movie it is highly entertaining to hear how the family is speaking off and to each other,and also how a piece of time could in total be about survival, crops and religion.Some moments and surroundings of the production and the age which the story takes place in makes me think of another horror movie where a witch terrorizes the good; Warlock. Slowly evil is being shown through several signs within the crops and the family... slowly.... slowly it is coming...... High class horror and mystery movie!What brings down the rating from being terrific is the time in the middle of the movie to the impact of the witch. It could have been a lot more sights of the witch earlier and bringing more evil to the table in its pure existence. Another thing speaking of the negative sides is the more usual way of ending horror movies these days; evil prevails and win. That is just boring and wrong.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made. Authentic and real. The picture and screen writing is plain and simple better than good, showing the cold weather and the harsh living. Sound effects and the music creates a frame in the mystery and the haunting horror in a fantastic way! The research of the religious Christianity and differences between Jehovas Witnesses and 'ordinary' Christianity is well done. Give depth to the movie. - The actors : Great work showing the 17th century and how people lived by then.... the speech, the religious boundaries and the cold living for crops. Good acting is giving the story a really good sense. - The story : Good old fashioned.... good versus evil... a witch searching for more evil to spread around. Simple and straight forward little piece of art here in the storyline. - Entertainment : Had a good time watching this. All elements in this movie is giving viewing pleasure. - Age : 15.

The questions arises; can everybody have the talent to act? Can everybody have the talent to sing? Can everybody have the talent to say that they have talent? This film noir touch√© claims all these questions, answers... and more.Jesus Christ. This biblical sense is the reason of one of the best scenes in this motion picture. To dissect what a god is...what religion is to be real...what religion is to be fake... Can a film studio claim all peoples happiness in the description and the casting of a storytelling about 'God/god' and/or Jesus? Great dialogue, impugn and oppugn!A nod to several classic parts and shapes of movies. Fantastic choreography in the marine dance act starring Channing Tatum! Funny and amazing way of hitting the button to reflect on the 'homosexual phobia and the hidden sexual aspects between men'. Several laughs there, just to end in Christopher Lambert telling Mr. Mannix about; 'Hilsa Fl√ºge....from Malmoe!' That was hilarious.... as Malm√∂ is in Sweden...and I am from Sweden...and therefore...ehhhm....well.... forget about it.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : High class and top notch creation of the 1950's; furnitures, clothes, costumes.... nicely done! - The actors : Josh Brolin has the ability to give the character a heavy depth. George Clooney is spot on of a actor thinking to high of himself. Ralph Fiennes is...what is the word.... admirable of his 'lock-in' to the segments and dialogue.

WALL¬∑E," Eeeeeeeeeeeeeve.....a.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.I attempt to force through my own opinions and preconceptions lately... and with and through that get more experience of movies and other things. So.... Wall-E is a movie I have neglected... thrown through the window with the sign 'Disposal' over it. And... now I am sitting down and will watch this Academy Award Winner of 2009. It will be interesting.First off I am struck by the fine animations of universe and expecting some epic orchestra striking a magnificent tune. And.... well... no, no, no... already here Wall-E comes out with a Big Bang (pun intended) and let us enjoy... a little musical tune as coming right from the musical of 'Annie'. Interesting. And moving on.... Amazing animations showing the chopper perspective of a planet/city that has gone under some kind of natural disaster or something... the tune fades away and leaves us in silence with the words 'I won't come home'... spot on! Wall-E breaks the silence and rolls down and between some alleys and buildings... what song is that Wall-E is playing? Yes... the musical tune comes back. A lot of good directing, sound editing and the showcase of a production team making their finest. This is only the first couple of minutes into the movie. This leads to my first big honest laugh; a cockroach (or some bug looking like a cockroach) is Wall-E's friend and following him in its work. The 'roach is crawling into a ventilation system of Wall-E and tickles Wall-E... hence Wall-E is giving a little robotic giggle. Fun! Thereafter... a moralic chunk of message goes through the screen, to the story and gives the whole motion picture is in depth thinking; BUY LARGE.... a franchise that everybody is buying from. Buy a lot, and save money. Buy a lot and there will probably be much waste and with waste a harsh strain on our planet Earth. So, Wall-E comes out big time proclaiming that it is time for us to take care of our Earth.... otherwise we may end up similar to a well-known film about a robot on a planet collecting trash... did I hear the bell of wisdom sound off now? Really cool and top notch way of getting through with those commercial videos with real humans and actors in them... genius! Thorughout the movie there is a lot of moralic dilemmas taking place that is giving the viewer time to reflect. Nice touch! Also nice to see all the retrospective things like VHS, cassette tapes and....the game of Pong! Long time no see!A fantastic animated movie showing the aftermath of a probability where humanity has forced forward and maybe too far in getting robots doing every little daily issue and tasks. Where humans is living in a spacecraft for 700 years and lost all aspects that makes us humans; awareness, love, analyzing ability and so on.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Wonderful animations. Academy Award Winner! Further questions anyone? - The actors : Oh... Wall-E is fantastic in showing its feelings for Eve....a. - The story : A creation made by masterminds. Is the future this cold? - Entertainment : Very amusing. So exiting to see Wall-E and Eve dance in space. - Age : 78,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

Arrival," Clear and beautiful interpretation with extra terrestrials
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.In some movies (often high rated ones) there is a sense and/or something in the beginning that gives away that this motion picture probably in the view of the majority will hit the rate far up and deliver an extraordinary experience for the viewer. Arrival is one of them. As soon as the melancholic, sad, professional and heavy violin starts off to a voice telling its truth in an almost grieving way, I thought and felt; OK...I got it... here they start off with great expectations. This is going to be one of those....Arrival is the movie about extra terrestrial contact through 12 enormous air crafts from the universe making it's way to earth. Displaying a interpreters' work in speaking with them. This is intact. This is interesting. This is tense. And for them that are interested in an innovative experience. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) travels through emotional and logic senses trying to solve the language to get to the point: What is your purpose here? A beautiful, thoughtful and slow paced motion picture about contact and visitation of another life form from... somewhere. Made with such grace and deep feeling that it up rises a different new type of era in the 'science fiction' genre... or...how long will it be science fiction? Just the scene with the explosion done in some kind of caring harmony is telling the tale of what I mean.The production has blended heavy and sentimental every day drama with near and authentic emotion together with a high sensitivity and social description; the explained is on edge and almost done to perfection.After less than half the movie, I thought that maybe it could be the daughter reincarnated/continued into an extra terrestrial that came to Louise in Costello. I was wrong... or...wait....was I?Halfway through Arrival, one thing came to my mind frequently. If this movie has the authentic and serious way of wanting to convey the both excitement, entertainment and the continuing on the path of making the film near to grasp, the picture should have a solid ending.The way Arrival contemplates the special 'sixth sense and wonderful talents/gifts' of human beings is remarkable and astonishing! What is out there for us to learn? Is life so much more than our body here and now?Denis Villeneuve, Eric Heisserer and Ted Chiang has taken a different and innovative turn of events in telling this unique (and at the same time 'good old genre') story. Done with a sense of realism, drama and a vast tension that is all over the screen, through the audio field and in the experience. Entertaining to a high degree. Some great dialogue throughout Arrival: Louise Banks: How about if we just talk to them before we start throwing math problems at them?Ian Donnelly: It is a good story. Louise Banks: Thanks! It is not true, but it proves my point.Louise Banks: What should we call them? Ian Donnelly: How about Abbott and Costello?About the dialogue, I really want to give a little pun for the story, for you all to discover; Sheena Easton, is the arrival of your future past for your eyes only?I immediately was hooked by Arrival, both for the product itself and also (as written about before in my reviews) because the story and meaning itself went straight to my heart and mind.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Audio; those dark and bass oriented sounds that almost could be as vast alarms and growling sirens brings another huge dimension to the movie; very good done and great collected! The audio is very close and done with more than excellent precision; close your eyes and listen to all the little sounds and effects about 27 minutes into Arrival; amazing! Visual: top notch. All those colours! Look at the innocent and clear white and orange as the team is leaving and entering the 'ship'. A feast for your eyes (or is it pun intended; 'A feast for sore eyes... for your eyes only?')! The environments inside the 'aircraft' is fresh, simple and very tasteful... almost artistic. Strong, authentic and straight forward and honest dialogue. - The actors : Golden Globe nominations. Further questions? - Entertainment : Wow. That is a word I said out loud as the team entered the vessel; the artificial 'flash light' is thrown up and lands on the wall as it is the floor. Then there is weightlessness and hefty breathing... what is happening? Recommendation? Yes. Why and how? Clear your senses and be opened minded. Arrival has arrived and with the arrival arrives a different kind of twist on the whole 'they're here' topic. This is well done. This is a film for those who appreciate extra terrestrial movies, and with that a slow paced and thoughtful one. Otherwise; look for something else. - Age : 118,6 out of 10.

Straight Outta Compton," Anger. Frustration. Ruthlessness.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****I want to make a statement immediately... This movie is such a realistic and great view of the time and an era that created so much. To see how Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Snoop Doggy Dogg and other rap artists came about is very fascinating and interesting. For a guy like myself that turn off almost everything that says rap, this creation is more than worth watching.This movie is a deep cover of the anger, frustration and the point of view in the segregated parts of the United States Of America... maybe the parts of the world.Great screen writing. Great acting. Great dialogue... capturing the slang and offensive language... excellent! Some times there are small things and emotions showing that everything can be better; little glitches here and there... some over acting, some 'under acting'.All in all;' 7,8 ....straight outta Compton... yo...

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The Tin Man of Bat meets Mr. Kryptonian Steel... and then some.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.And....right to it: Seems like Christopher Nolan has taken the success from let us say Batman and a little flushed the experience gathered down the toilet, allowing himself to be executive producer for 'Batman v Superman'. They try to just ride the wave and lean on the fact that the way of making movies has gotten them to where they all is today. Sadly, that comes through in Batman V Superman. Same thing over again. (If Christopher Nolan would have directed and produced this one, I am confident that the film would have been greater.)And even some little touches of lousy dialogue and bad acting and directing. This made me in fact say out loud: 'What!? In a 'block buster' movie!?' And why....why....WHY (!!?) did they choose Jesse Eisenberg to jump into the cast? Jesse is a really fine actor. It is just that the neurotic sense that Mr. Eisenberg often portrays should fit excellent in another film. Here, it gives the whole experience a naive and silly (ridiculous?) enhancing which push the total production down the rate. I understand the concept of taking something old and make it fresh with new actors to give something new and bring another (and maybe younger) audience. And with that said... Ben Affleck as Batman? Henry Cavill as Superman....AGAIN? They try to make Ben Afflecks Batman move and fight in the same solid and heavy manner that Christian Bales Batman did... and it is just terrible. One scene where Batman is surrounded by soldiers is plain and simple bad. I could see several things in the fighting that were acted and several things that just screamed 'GIVE ME MY Christian BALE!'. Some scenes has a lot of too enhanced both acting and surroundings to convey 'the drama of the moment'... it even feels that the music and things is too far out that the story is gasping for air.... overacting and a theatrical soundtrack creating a 'fake sense' of what Zack Znyder and the rest really wanted to produce. (An example of this is 1 hour and 55 minutes into the movie, where Mr. Luthor confronts Lois Lane on top of a skyscraper and Superman later talks to Mr. Luthor.)Batman has gone from fabric tights (tv-series) to some kind of modern leather tights of kevlar (Batman- trilogy)... and all that were fine. And now.... a kind of clumsy tin as armour. Maybe they meant it to be 'The Two Men Of Steel', and had to settle with one man of steel and one bat in armour... Some action scenes contains so much over the edge things that it just feels like fiction. In the old Batman (Christopher Nolan) and Superman movies there always were a great nuance of authentic 'realism'. Here... they blend it too far and swept away my entertainment a lot.An obvious and typical bad writing and script example; Batman and Superman are enemies to each other and tries to kill one another. By one word ('Martha') everything is switched, and just minutes later Batman says to Martha; 'I am a friend of your son.' Friend? Really? Already? Minutes before deadly enemies and all of a sudden they went so far in the relationship that they are friends??In the end, this motion picture turns into a parody of Marvel. Explosions, monsters, weapons... devastation and destruction. It almost feels like the film were given a poor team as for the production. They tried (or did they?)... and failed.Now I am criticizing in a negative way. And I am trying to find solid entertainment here. And.... no. All I find is a polished production on terms of cinematography, sound, visuals and editing. Otherwise...this was a disappointment.... a huge one.I love the Batman-trilogy. And I loved Christoffer Reeve and Brandon Routh as Superman. Zack Znyder just gave me a rugged picture of my superheroes....and that in a negative way. What if Christopher Nolan (executive producer) were given the resonsibility of directing and producing this one....?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Great production! Good sound, good effects and good visuals. A negative and destructive thins about the production; they tried to to copy Mr. Nolans productions with the typical 'Nolan Dark Theme'. - The actors : Well.... they do what they are supposed to do... almost all the time. - Entertainment : No, in all. Some moments here and there to get a little cinema itch from...that is all. - Age : 154,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe in a criminal detective story that oozes all the little things that made the 70's the 70's. I have to bow down to the fact that the production and acting is in place, almost perfectly. After the end, the expectations missed the target. Yes, I am disappointed. There is humour, there is class, there is a solid performed story and acting. I just think that the total crew behind this film should have twisted something into this movie, for them to discover. Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozi had a story to tell, and wrote it well. Shane Black had the heavy army of actors to switch on to the picture. Can a director with great cast fail even so? Yes. Did Shane Black that? No. He delivered, plain and simple. Could have squeezed the cast much more. Some scenes is little light in comparison to the depth of the story. David Buckley and John Ottman has done a tremendous job regarding the music! Throwing in Kiss and other known stars to be discovered throughout the movie. Entertaining! To the point. Was the movie bad? No. It could have been a lot better. Now I am settling with a good movie, for my entertainment perspective.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made and is top notch speaking of the time the story is related to. Music, commercials, clothes... everything is in place. Very well made, indeed! Splendid! - The actors : Splendid!

The first tones of music builds up and gives it an almost fake impression of a inflated and pompous movie. the second thing is that the actors seems off... smiling, just all that easy going and calm. As if they were under the influence of something. At times I think for myself; what, 8,3 on IMDb with that bad acting? Thinking of the man under the car being hurt in the leg. And speaking of that, the blood and effects of the squirting blood seems bad made.The second impression of this movie is this: Mel Gibson has as the director done an marvellous job in creating an atmosphere of easy going, calm, straight forward, pleasant and honesty. Well done! I am embracing it at the fullest! I love the way the casting team has worked on making roles for the army. Vince Vaughn as an sergeant?

First off; if this is the first time you read anything about this movie, push play and watch it. To take the atmosphere of the movie in in a total neutral way is a great way of being swept away in this a little mysterious story.... this saga wrapped in a modern package, so amazing! If only for the design and the producing of the picture and the shades of colours... The Great Gatsby is worth watching.A costume movie with interesting and modern twists. A tale told by a contender of his own life, as the time of modern production helps the story moving forward.Blend a musical, daring dancers, music and emotions from the modern society of the 21st century with a story situated in the 20s.... scramble a little.... out comes Gatsby... the great Gatsby!Like an amusing park with a little itsy bitsy touch of psychadelica... how about parties in the '20s driven by pumping music of today and the feeling of a circus? Kind of a sophisticated psychadelica...Greenery and the environments is beautiful.... and the name of the girl is Daisy! Hilarious!The scene in about the middle of the film (around 1 hour and 1 minute) is magnificent put together. The music, the emotions, the clothes, the joy... the warmth between two human beings in a delicate situation. Nicely done!There's a little sense of a cartoon in the scenery and the environment... and also a little in the camera angles and shooting of the film. Makes me think of another movie a little like 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. Such a presence in laying out the entire cut of the movie.. a mellow feeling of perfection. Just the scenes where the surroundings is absolutely centralised in the exact middle of the screen and the symmetry... marvellous!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Beautiful special effects... wonderful and living colours everywhere!

13 Hours," Michael Bay makes Libya and the true story live by the authentic story.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.I was very surprised over the entertainment and the quality of this one... surprised in a good way. '13 Hours : The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi' made me draw the conclusion that when things comes together well in a movie, there can be both a almost repetitive script from other movies and actors that still is to become stars and well known.The film starts off with you getting to know the characters and the daily life. Then the viewer comes to follow a certain group of people, soldiers, during their time under fire and war in Libya. Michael Bay has made a tremendous job in getting a sense of reality and entertainment at the same time. Moment to moment, the characters is getting alive and creating relationships throughout their own special way that forms them into who they are. Michael Bay is balancing that is such a great way for it to really grab hold of the viewer. One special scene is where the soldiers is waiting for the next attack, if there will be one, and having little both emotionally and lightheaded conversation about the topics of war and daily life. About 1:41:00 into the movie there is another conversation about that the interpreter want to stay when recommended to leave. Amahl (Peyman Moaadi) goes down to the war room and 'Tanto' (Pablo Schreiber) turns to his partner in war, 'Boon' (David Denman), and breaks the silence with: 'I'm gonna have to break up with him before we leave Libya....' 'Boon' starts laughing with a good and tired heart in the background, very clear and sound. This is an example of the entire movies solid authentic feeling. In most of the movies nowadays there would have been silence after 'Tanto''s line, and for the audience to catch up with the humour and laugh. In reality, it would probably be in the way Michael Bays lets it go through here. By letting 'Boon' laugh, it takes the reality into the story and keeps the authentic touch. Extremely well written and directed both acting and dialogue. The soldiers different lives besides their war both within and in Libya is properly taking care of and showed respect for. Actors, script and directors drives the full length of the movie in the same way and gives the finished product what it needs.The synthezisers rehances the balmy breeze that sweeps around in immediate surroundings... that is creation in a high level... really high level. Just enough so I can hear the extra rehancing of the surroundings and the sound carpets. Classic Michael Bay. People sit and communicate, and a gentle, deep and saturated sound carpet is the basis while the hair and other loose objects sweeps around by both the daily and the nightly wind. Excellent! There is a couple of scenes where the troopers is gathered and exclaims their feelings and emotions of the situations. One of them is (just as in 'Bad Boys' where Will Smith And Martin Lawrence turns around slowly and the camera is going around them, as they are tired and grabbed by the moment) where the soldiers stand by an airplane and the total scenery and sound effects blend together with the camera giving the full screen of tired and broken down soldiers, hot breezes and an air plane getting to the runway field. Furthermore, the entire production group creates such an authentic feeling climate and environments in Libya that I'm effectively aware in film. That is quality... good quality. Then I come to the comparison between Michael Bay and Michael Mann. I had check who did what to define and distinguish them them. I prefer Michael Mann; his excellent magic in creating a melancholic hopeful feeling by image, ambient environments, sound and the music is phenomenal! And... then that was said.Last out... a little thing that is conveyed both with class and just the right amount of attention to give the viewer some extra involvement and entertainment: Everybody's name in movies is Jack. Jack Bauer in '24 Hours'. Jack in 'Titanic'. Jack Ryan in 'Jack Ryan : Shadow Recruit'. Jack Twist in 'Brokeback Mountain'. Jack in 'Speed'. Jack Torrance in 'The Shining'......you get the point. In here... they even go so far that the character being a guard and undercover is named Jack, and the character in the movie is also Jack. Did I hear 'Do you know anything.....do you know jack....?!'Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Look above in the review; astonishing work! The war scenes, the perfect match of sound and exploding weapons and weaponry, the blood, the realistic scenes of soldiers getting hit, the grading of light and so on... everything is well taken care of. Chuck Hogan has drawn his experience and expertise to this one. - The actors : For me, kind of external names in the list of the cast. And, wow... did they deliver! Some little acting abilities here and there that raises my skeptical sense. Other than that...: great! John Krasinski lays it all out there; a true piece of art! - The story : A true story. And that is that. - Entertainment : Both the story, the characters, the music, the sounds, the....well.... almost everything has its own entertaining in here. - Age : 15... or 18, due to gruesome scenes and language.7,8 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)",8,2,7,28 May 2016
Sully," Solid Sully
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.The motion picture Sully is sort of a parallel to the production Flight, with Denzel Washington.A wonderful way to display what happened. Instead of the ordinry Hollywood type (and hype), this is showed in an authentic way... probably just the way it happened. Very, very good!An out of the ordinary movie, as it is a true story that gives it a feel good touch.Highly recommended! One of the best lines in the entire film: Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart): 'Can you believe they charge 5 dollars for a Snickers? I can bankrupt the airlines in about 4 bites.' (Approximately 12 minutes into Sully.)One digital cameo... about 39 minutes into this one. Look closely at the upper right when Sully is out running.... and, yes...there is the director Clint Eastwood on a commercial for Gran Torino.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : High American quality. Sound, visuals and editing very good. Some errors in the special effects, that gives a touch of an surreal feeling. - The actors : Outstanding Tom Hanks. Very good Aaron Eckhhart. Period. - Entertainment : A true and solid story about an amazing moment in time. - Age : 117,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

The Martian," Let's bring him home... he'll make an important potato farmer.
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....Off directly... The first hour of the movie I felt grew on me, in a very positive way. The things the scientist and astronaut does on the planet of Mars is amazing to watch. How he finds himself in a state of mind to just getting the great goal to live until the next turn to Mars comes to the rescue. How he creates, inspires himself, uses his creativity, getting himself organized, structured and disciplined; I loved that part of the movie. Take that to life and you got...like...: 'Hey...look what I found..... a big juicy rebound.... score! and off to success.'The second part of the movie is in my personal opinion taking down the top notch rating a bit. For me, it's like: '...oh....oh...oh... here we go again... Hollywood comes into play and.. boom...failure...drama...tragic episodes... tears.... and I won even so... I am a hero!' A little too much. I've heard that the first manuscript (or similar to that) were ending in the spaceship when the martian (pun sooo intended) were saved. I felt that one. I thought for myself; this is great! End here now, and I will be more than satisfied. And....no....no way. Through in Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood to play.... and end it in a real old McCoy style where the 'cowboy is a hero' and everybody want his attention.One of the more hilarious one liners: 'Let's science the sh*t out of this one!'Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Oscar nomination. Anyone got further questions on that one...? - The actors : Oscar nomination. Anyone got further questions on that one...? - The story : in its time (pun intended). Science is making breakthroughs and the human is getting more and more information about Mars. A little negative side in the second half of the movie. - Entertainment : Laughs. Excitement. Inspiration...oh...laughs again. Good entertainment. - Age : Probably more for the adult viewers, as space and planets can be hard to grasp for the youths, as far as I know (and...well.. maybe I know nothing...)The Martian won a lot of prizes and nominations. Fair and square.8,0 out of 10",8,1,3,12 March 2016
