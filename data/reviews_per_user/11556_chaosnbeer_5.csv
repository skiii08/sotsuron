Requiem for a Dream," a descent into hell
","Ok we all know drugs are bad , we know drugs will ruin your life , and yes we've seen dozens of other movies about drugs and the dangers of drug addiction to the point where it's a boring Hollywood cliche. So what exactly makes Requiem For A Dream so different? I'll tell you. Requiem For A Dream is not exactly a morality tale about the dangers of drug addiction , it's not a warning , and it isn't preaching. It's a descent into the darkest pits of hell. It is an excrusiating emotional torture lesson in the death of hope , and the death of a future. Requiem plays like a sonic assault on your emotions , fears , and sympathys. It doesnt hold anything back , and leaves you feeling sick and emotionally drained and disgusted as the very last note on the soundtrack plays.*SPOILERS* It tells two storys interwoven together. Sara Goldfarb played by Ellen Burnstyn  , a sweet sweet Coney Island woman who is oblivious to her son Harry's habits and behavior played by Jared Leto and her obsession to be on television and lose weight to fit into her red dress. She seeks the treatment of diet pills and soon becomes addicted to them leaving her in a downward spiral of self destruction..what makes her demise the hardest is her character comes off as this sweet nice old lady and the viewer is felt disgusted by what happens to her. Harry and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayanes) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) are drugged out losers from the begining so the viewer doesn't really feel sympathy for them but towards the end their sickness and destruction of hope is felt very hard by the viewer. Requiem's power is in it's editing , acting , and score. We don't actually see any graphic drug use like you would in Trainspotting or other films , it's not that type of movie. It's a movie bent on hurting your emotions , making you feel what the characters are feeling and it does a very good job. Definitly not for the faint of heart or emotionally unstable.",Null,0,1,26 October 2002
Army of Darkness," hail to the king baby
","3rd chapter in the Evil Dead trilogy is also the most produced and financially backed. Despite it being more produced ,with a sense of credibility with some somewhat known actors , it still retains a sense of low budget B movie fun that is rare in films like this..and it's also an early sniff of Sam Raimi's later directorial films that would look polished , but still have a fun not too serious touch which has become a great thing about Raimi's films.*Spoilers maybe*Bruce Campbell returns as Ash , this time super p***ed and ready to rock. Pushed to the edge of insanity by the torture and abuse  from the first two movies , he's ready to rock the middle ages. It picks up where Evil Dead II left off pitting ash against knights and deadites. With all the slapstick , one liners , and fun stupidity and even some in jokes for film buffs..you can't go wrong with Army Of Darkness..even though the slapstick and Three Stooges humor may put off some people ..it's a treat for us Evil Dead fans who just love this kinda stuff10/10..definitly check it out",Null,3,4,28 December 2002
Scream," Not as bad as purist will make it out to be
","First off I guess you can say I am a purist horror fan , and alot of fans hated Scream as being a lame teen oriented wannabe horror movie. Well I saw Scream when It came out more as a parody on horror cliches , not so much as a horror film itself. It is loaded with horror buff in jokes and references to old horror classics , but it also has a teen idol kind of vibe which turned alot of fans off , and gained alot of boppers. Scream is actually a good movie..the sequels werent all that great , and it isn't quite Wes Craven's shining moment but it is a nice take on the horror scene. It wasn't really that scream sucked so much..it was the after math of it's success. Before Scream's success , there wasn't a single theatrically released horror/slasher movie in years , the aftermath of Scream's success created this bubblegum teen star type of horror movie. It would be loaded with the trend of the hip hop alternative era , the leading roles would go to WB network stars or any other teen pin up idol , and it would be very tame and lack any horror elements that made films of the past so great , they basically all just ripped off this movie which is why it is so disliked by purist horror fans. I myself like it..I think it's a good movie and I will defend it as a parody thriller , not a horror movie.8/10",Null,0,0,1 January 2003
Signs," I think this is a sign for Mel to quit
","Ok...i'm just gonna come on out and say it..this movie SUCKED!..i'm serious..it wasn't good at all , I guess it's because I had such high expectations for it after all it was the #1 movie in America for a few weeks , and grossed quite a nice number ..the question is why???..why were people flocking and wasting their money to see this , it was slow..boring , I couldnt keep interested in it , the aliens were boring , the faith plot was really stupid ..so I guess I've lost faith in that hollywood movies are good..I should just stick with some cheesy itallian horror..at least they are entertaining",Null,1,1,12 January 2003
Evil Dead II," groovy
","Yes folks , we have a sequel..and the mother of all sequels it is. Each film in this trilogy is very different in style. Evil Dead was a grusome horror movie with gross out effects ..Evil Dead II however is a gross out comedy with over the top corny effects..and it never gets better than this. This shows Ash's evolution from a wimpy worthless coward to a cowardly madman who takes abuse like no other , and in the end straps on his shotgun and chainsaw and fights deadites in a 'groovy' way.*spoilers possibly*This sequel is alot like the first one , and at the same time nothing like it too. It's basically the same plot , same story , same character Ash getting beat up by demons possessing 2 backwoods hicks , and 2 college students or something..anyway if you saw the first one you pretty much know whats gonna happen..except that this one combines lots of doses of slapstick and humor instead of chills and thrills..and of course it works. Only two directors have been able to mix horror and comedy..Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson..i've never seen it work in that many films with the exception of maybe Return Of The Living Dead.Don't expect much of a horror movie , expect a very rollercoaster comedy horror..and then check out Army Of Darkness for more laughs.10/10",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
