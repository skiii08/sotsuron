Come and See," Debasement and Moral Penury
","Come and SeeThe study of history asks a prescient question of its representation in media. Every sentence, documentary or film about a particular event removes some layer of epistemological truth from its location in time. To effect, this sometimes informs upon the event, bringing a renewed sense of interest, if not objectivity, to the moment. However, the question of authorship remains a dilemma for any historical study.Rarely does the depiction of an historical period transcend both the practice and medium. Elem Klimov's 1985 bildungsroman 'Come and See' achieves this transformation, surpassing its aesthetical limitations to inform and illuminate the German occupation of Soviet Belorussia in 1943.The viewer enters upon a depleted landscape as two youths dig for guns in sand. The nature of the earth confirms the abasement we will see further on. We soon learn one must provide their own weapon to join local partisans fighting the Nazi invasion. As Flyora, the young teenager at the center of the film's narrative, leaves his home to join the fighters, the audience doesn't yet know, upon his return, nothing will ever be the same again.Once in the forest with the partisans, the director deploys the camera in two distinct modes. The initial offers us witness, as the merry group poses heroically in front of a photographer, awaiting battle. We will see this again from the German side. The other, more common treatment seen throughout the film, involves Klimov turning the camera upon a principal actor and, in return, that character confronting the viewer. The director's adversarial use of the lens confirms the nature of the story and provides a direct emotional link to the two main characters and their utterly abject edification.In the forest, Flyora meets his female counterpart, Glasha. As they play amongst the trees, the horror of war besets their pastoral harmony. They are soon forced on an odyssey of complete physical and emotional penury.The film's corrupted landscape echoes the scabrous topography of moral depravity. Even the film stock, defused of color, pale and sallow like the characters, plays to this aesthetical anemia.The use of sound and its elision also reinforces the nuanced destruction of warfare. After a bombardment shatters the two teenagers' frolic in the forest, Flyora's deafness permeates the soundtrack. We are left with the piercing pitch of aural trauma and the fuzzy static of a muted world.The narrative reaches its licentious climax as Germans commit a 'pogrom' against the Jews of a Belorussian village. Klimov blends hyper-real images, searing their ghastly certainty deep into the viewers' minds, with completely absurd surrealism. Never has war looked so absolute and horrifying. The other-worldly feeling of the film washes upon the screen like a diaphanous cloud dissected by the violence of sunlight. It is a liminal reality in which the two main protagonists disappear.By the film's end, Flyora stands unrecognizable. Klimov's elision of time casts our teenager as an old-man, visible wrinkles and scars appearing from nowhere. Likewise, once an image of innocent beauty in a flowing green dress, Glasha reappears, blood running the length of her inner thighs, her physical violation reflecting her emotional depredation. Gone are any traces of the characters' former selves. In their place lie the type of fragments only war's monstrosity provides.We are finally left with a curious interweaving of stock footage, deployed by Klimov in a radical 'de-aging' of Hitler to the moment of his childhood. As Flyora stares at the non-diegetic image of Hitler as a child in his mother's arms, the viewer recalls a man's warning at the beginning of the film: Do not dig! It starts with children. He soon disappears into a mass of partisans as they traverse a forest. He has achieved his desire...He is now a soldier.",9,1,1,11 April 2020
Skyfall," An Honest Review...Please Read if You Are Rational
","No Critical Spoilers or Plot descriptions Here, so Don't Worry.Firstly, let's get one thing straight...To judge Bond films against the backdrop of other movies is preposterous.All franchise films can only be seen against their predecessors.In this respect, Skyfall is the best bond since For Your Eyes Only.I don't understand such abjectly poor reviews on this board, however IMDb is the domain of idiots and losers.Skyfall stands as a bond unique to the franchise in that it avoids the implausibility of 'Grandpa' Bond Roger Moore, the camp of the Brosnan days and the banal drudge of the Dalton films.Skyfall is a more thorough and sensible film than Casino Royale and Rolling Stone put this film in the TOP 5 of the franchise.I agree.It's not the best one, but far, far from the worst. That would still have to be A View To A Kill, in which one waits for Moore to reveal his Depends under-support whilst undressing.Javier Bardem is delightful. Craig puts in his best Bond.Bérénice Marlohe is incredible and has more character and emotion in her face than %90 of actresses out there presently.The only shame is we don't get to see her very long in the scope of the film.THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS INCREDIBLE. No one on the message boards probably has any consideration or understanding of cinematography and probably are so CG'd out (Michael Bey can rot!) they probably complain when their Christmas family photos don't have a robot in them.The only complaint I have is that the film could have been a little longer actually, and we could have seen more of Bardem and Marlohe.The plot is tight enough and the action well-paced and dispersed throughout.I love Ralph Fiennes and the Mendes does a nice job of putting in some subtle, and some not- so-subtle internal references to the franchise's legacy.Skyfall is a good film.

Prometheus," Fassbender=Peter O'Toole?
","Having attended a midnight viewing of Prometheus, I can assuredly state that it's a comforting thought to know Scott is back in the science-fiction genre. Oh, how we have missed you Scott! No one tells SciFi with a cerebral edge anymore, and, no, Transformers does not count. I read most of the reviews before watching this movie myself and I can absolutely say that those who gave negative reviews, mostly European attendees are complete dunderheads with very little imagination and/or education. It goes as standard assumption that Europe produces a populace with greater sensibilities than America, however, this is not so according to the reviews from that lot.The negative reviews centered mostly on the the interaction between the main players and the 'holes' in the plot.Some criticized the Scientist characters for not being scientific enough, saying a blah blah wouldn't behave like blah, blah. Let me tell you that, in case you are a complete boob, no one in movies are who they say they are, that's why it's called acting. Also, Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Koto weren't very scientific in Alien, and we again have mercenaries on this voyage.Only two of the characters are wastes, and I found Theron's character unpleasant in the extreme. Rapace and Fassbender carry the movie, and that is Scott's intention. You will see why by movie's end.As for the plot-holes, Scott plans a sequel, so unless you are mentally incapable, the holes make sense in this context.This movie is well paced and plays out in clear stages like a small theater production. Scott establishes clear moods and scenes and uses the viewers foreknowledge against them at times. Look, everyone knows what this movie is going into it, so it's no small achievement to even have this level of interest in the production from the beginning.This may be hard for some to not expect Weaver to come in, bombastically, with Avatar-Boy Cameron on a rope and save the day.No, Cameron is a waste of space and is just a high-price Michael Bay. If you want wonderment, at times awe-inspiring visuals and you appreciate cerebral SciFi, then see this movie.Ridley Scott's entire SciFi career centers around one question: What is Artificial Life and How Do Androids Relate in a Human Universe?This movie is less about the origin of the Xenomorph and more about Fassbender and again, AI's role in human relations. Fassbender plays the contrarian well and there is a shameless homage to Peter O'Toole (surely an inside joke considering Fassbender's look for David 8) early on in the film.But this qualifies Scott's intelligent sentiments and one would not see this in most other wash SciFi directors today.Also, there is a strong Oedipal story going on near the end...You'll see, but only if you are familiar with Oedipus Rex can you see the relation between Rapace, Fassbender and others in the origin story.I've said enough. Go see the movie. I saw the IMAX 3D, which I never do, and I was not disappointed and in this instance, worked quite stunningly!",9,4,10,8 June 2012
