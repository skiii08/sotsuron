The King's Speech," AMAAAAAAAAAZING!!! Absolutely Amazing!!!!!
","I had seen no previews to this movie, and I had read no reviews. The only exposure I had was the ad for it on this website, and I knew I had to see it. I was fully expecting to be 'satisfied' with 'a good flick', but what I was not anticipating was to be swept away by an utterly amazing work of art. I cannot recall a single character or even bit-part in this film that was not played with such refinement and skill. When an actor(s)can make you forget that you're even watching a movie, yet make you feel like you're watching real life taking place, you know they have really worked their magic.I've seen very few of Colin Firth's movies, but what I have seen I was very impressed with. Helena Carter can play such wide a variety of characters, and is truly a skilled actress that seems to know how to nail each role, whether she's playing the Queen of Hearts in Alice In Wonderland; a mentally unstable woman in Fight Club or Sweeney Todd; or her more refined roles in Room With A View and The Kings Speech. Then there is Mr. Rush, who is always a pleasure to watch, and really made me understand the tremendous power a supporting actor can have in a film.I missed this when it first came out in theaters because I had no knowledge of it at that time, so I was so pleased to have been able to view this during the re-release before Oscar time. I've not seen the other movies that are up for Oscars, but I am positive that this is going to be the movie of the year, and justly so.",Null,1,2,29 January 2011
The Sound of Music," One Of My Absolute Favorite Movies Of All Time!!
","I realize that it doesn't completely and entirely follow the true story. I realize that Maria did not completely approve of this film. I realize that there is a lot of 'sugar' in this film, however, it remains to be one of my all time favorites. Unlike so many movies these days, this movie is filled with joy and happiness. My Mother took my 5 siblings and I too see this when it was re-released into theaters years after it came out in 1965(they used to do that with the bigger movies - before the days of VHS and DVDs). When we left the theater and walked home that evening, we talked about the movie the whoooole way, and sung the songs in it. It made such a wonderful & powerful impact on us, and to this day it is a family favorite.",10,4,11,21 November 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," O' Disney, Where Has Your Magic & Imagination Gone??
","I watched this movie for 30 minutes, but nothing was taking hold of me. Nothing was grabbing my interest. I felt myself going cross-eyed and nodding off (and I'm not a person who naps), so I put it on super fast forward, stopping at a number of different scenes, thinking that maybe it just had a slow, dim-witted beginning. No, every scene was the same: Old, tired, over-the-top, unimaginative Hollywood tripe. I just couldn't continue, since it was far too painful of a venture. I love Ben Kingsley, but not even he can save this flick. Maybe it's me. I think I'm possibly too old for this. Maybe it'll appeal to those under the age of 40. Maybe grade school. No more Disney for me. The magic left so long ago.",Null,0,1,21 November 2010
Juno," OF VERY LITTLE VALUE, Yet HIGH In Offensiveness
","Do you know what it's like to listen to someone tell a joke for an hour before finally getting to the punch line?? Do you know what it's like when someone goes on for an extremely lengthy period of time just to tell you something they could have told you in 3 minutes?? Do you know what it's like to have to wade through a mound of garbage to find one singular element of value?? That describes this movie to a 'T'.I have never met anyone in my life, much less an entire community of people, like these depicted in the movie, ANYWHERE in the Upper Midwest part of our country. How offensive it would be to people from there being depicted in such an offensive, base, degrading manner. I thought the movie 'Fargo' and 'Drop Dead Gorgeous' was BAD, but they are practically human praise reports in comparison to this piece of work. The Scandinavians I've met and gotten to know from there have been the KINDEST, MOST MANNERLY, ETHICAL, NON-OFFENSIVE, and CLEANEST LIVING PEOPLE in our country - Not the stupid, simple-minded, alcoholics like they are far too frequently depicted as. If they really were like that, the rest of the country wouldn't continue to make such drastic attempts to get them to live and work where they're living.I honestly tried to look beyond all the distractions of ill behaviors, vulgar phrases (to put it MOST mildly), & numb-skulled existence, but the volume of it was set so high that it drowned out any kind of message the Writer and/or Director was trying to convey. The acting was good, the execution of it was extremely poor.It just goes to show us, again and again and again, that enough hype and carefully chosen 'Critics' who'll script a response for the movie before it's even released, and enough 'plugs' on television shows, can indeed fully influence massive amounts of people into believing that garbage is a work of art.",Null,1,2,17 July 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Another 'God Isn't Going To Control Me' movie
","On a very surface level, I liked this movie. On a deeper level, I don't. It's another movie that reflects the modern way of thought: 'God makes mistakes, too.' - 'God doesn't know best, I know best' - 'It's all about me' - 'I'm going to have things my way (my way or the highway)' - 'I can defy God because I have free will' - (and the list goes on). When we are given precious knowledge and insight into the way God works and is moving, and we STILL demand on doing things our way, we are in a very serious danger zone. What caused Satan to fall? Pride - by thinking that he could do what he wanted apart from the Almighty - then acting upon it. It's movies like this that seem to have such a strong-hold on so people's minds, that if you cannot be with the person you want to be with - not even life itself is worth living. How many suicides occur each year because someone broke up with someone and they felt they could not live any longer? Love stories that convey those things are indeed dangerous on the young and weak in society. Stories that convey defying, disrespecting, and distrusting God are indeed dangerous to everyone in society. The end message is 'If you push Him enough, He'll give in and give you what you want' - 'God actually does want you to fight against him and fight for your free will because its a gift worth fighting for' - Can you see where these are serious twists on truths? Very serious twists. Watching this movie reminded me of one of the very first novels I ever read when I was a teenager, called 'Heaven, Hell, and the Megas Factor'. It's basically the same principles - or lack thereof. I don't recommend watching this movie for those purposes, but if you did like the movie, you would like the book 'Heaven, Hell, and the Megas Factor'. I really did love it when I was a child, but I've grown a little bit older and wiser since then.",Null,0,1,13 August 2011
Limitless," Another 'I Can Get Away With Murder If I Want To' movie
","This movie had me glued the entire time. I was enjoying it. I was thinking it was an anti-drug movie for the newer generation - a modern day 'Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde' movie (which was a campaign against drugs/alcohol) - or like the Ralph Fiennes movie 'Strange Days', or Christopher Walken's 'Brainstorm' - ya know, the old time movies that had actual (and truthful) morals to the story. Then the last minutes of the movie arrived and turned it all around, and it just became another 'the ends justifies the means' story - an 'I can have my cake and eat it too and as long as I don't get caught, it's all good' movie. People, the guy never learned his lesson - which seems to be an all too common theme in stories these days - it's more about learning how to not get caught so you can continue living immorally - then you're the cool one - the winner - the self-centered 'everybody likes me - I like myself' person. I've had enough of being shoveled garbage and sludge like this. Do you want to watch a better movie? Watch 'Brainstorm', 'Strange Days', and 'Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde' (The silent one is good, Mary Reilly is good, etc). It's high time to start boycotting this garbage.",Null,0,1,13 August 2011
Inception," Sigh...... Another Extremely Predictable & Repetitive Psycho/Action Thriller
","It was a pretty good movie, however, when I am able to predict the twists and turns that are going to be taken - and in the first 15 minutes of watching the movie - the movie automatically gets a lower score with me. I cannot count how many of these movies are being made, and most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is reality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one who's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that after Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the same kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept spinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake - which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was a bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that great, and I already can visualize certain types of people making attempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types' you will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and 'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter, etc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a lot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a cult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this movie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an unreality & fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie shows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person starts getting more and more confused about what is real and what isn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a total score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic why this movie is getting these kind of ratings.",5,10,14,19 December 2010
The Runaways," Acting Was Fantastic, But Movie Too Raunchy For Me
","Kristen Stewart's impersonation of Joan Jett was absolutely remarkable. Dakota Fanning does a fine job also. I wasn't a fan of Joan Jetts or the Runnaways, because I thought they were too mannish and raunchy. I was aware that the movie very well could be, as well, and I was right. Sometimes good movie-making depends on being able to omit/edit things to make way for a wider audience, as well as not to offend them with unnecessary B.S. - Then on the other hand, sometimes good movie-making depends on being able to show the truth and grittiness of situations. In this movie I felt there were things that could very successfully have been omitted, without loosing any of the gritty truth. They also didn't delve into the band's other members, which I can't help but believe that there were many fans of this group who were disappointed not to have seen more of their characters involvement in the film.",Null,0,7,21 November 2010
