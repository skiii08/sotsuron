Casablanca," 2nd Best Movie of all Time!
","Casablanca is both the definition of classic and 'cool' cinema. Humphrey Bogart just breezed through his lines like he was Rick himself. Every time he utters a word it comes out like silk and Ingrid Bergman is the best example of a true Hollywood actress no matter what time frame you're looking act. Peter Lorre is one of my favorites (especially after seeing him in this and 'M'), and his expressions in this, both verbal and facial were incredible. This is just a timeless masterpiece that is great to be able to watch on a nice relaxing day and see first hand that film can be one of the most beautiful forms of art when done correctly. It doesn't get much better than this, and even that's arguable to some I presume. I wish there were more movies like this but I'm sure that's easier said then done since it'd be next to impossible to pop out scripts like this. Oh well, one can wish right? If you haven't seen this yet then stop what you're doing immediately and rush out to the video store, it is of the utmost importance...I kid you not!!!Final 2 Cents:Movies : This must've been a gem on the screen.DVD Purchase : A necessity, now I just got to trade it in for the special edition.Rental : Absolutely imperative!",10,2,4,13 September 2004
Friday Night Lights," More of the same
","I liked this movie better the first time when it was called 'Varsity Blues'!I don't kid you when I say that there were so many scenes copied directly from that it was absolutely appalling. The only difference was that 'Friday Night Lights' was approximately 20 minutes longer and was a drama that contained comedy whereas 'VB' was a comedy that contained drama. Any scene that wasn't from 'VB' (which was scarce) was most likely from a different past football movie. Don't get me wrong, the acting was alright it was just that the plot was so unoriginal and it was unbearably slow-moving at times. The ending was the only thing that was somewhat unpredictable but even then it was more of a letdown than anything. If you score some complimentary tickets or are looking to burn a hole in your pocket than that's the only way I'd recommend seeing this as there was nothing special about it at all. Another thing I also hate is that every movie that supposedly had taken place in the '80s plays Run DMC's song 'Tricky' even though no one really listened to it back then. The only time it was ever popular was after 'Road Trip' came out a few years ago. People just don't stop to think about this at all. However one thing's for certain, Billy Bob has definitely been doing his fair share of bad movies!!!Final Acquittal:Movies: A waste of time.DVD Purchase: Only for someone that loves sports movies more than anything.Rental: You could, but view with low expectations.",5,1,2,14 October 2004
Citizen Kane," Greatest Movie of all Time!!!
","The American Film Institute knows their stuff and it's no wonder that they rank this movie the # 1 film ever made. Orson Welles portrayed some of the best dramatic acting along with directing that I've ever seen, and believe me I've seen a lot. This movie got robbed at the Oscars for reasons that I'll never understand. The quotes are so good and there are so many of them. Welles was a genius that was never fully appreciated even today, probably because most of us forgot about him. I felt bad for him because after he made this perfect piece of art he spent the rest of his life trying to make another one that was just as good or better and which he was never able to do (though it might've been impossible anyway because sometimes you can't beat the best). The supporting actors were fabulous, you just don't see it done this well anymore or anywhere close to it for that matter. This story has something in it that every person can relate to and it doesn't fall short on any of it. If you consider yourself even a novice movie lover you have to watch this and the sooner the better. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!Final Judgment:Movies : If it's ever re-released I'd be there in a second!DVD Purchase : Get the special edition.Rental : More important than air and water!",10,7,12,14 September 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Pretty funny
","This movie was 'bloody' well done...no pun intended. I went into this film not knowing really what to expect but maybe a dark comedy which is why I came out very happy. While I was right about it being funny, it's also an excellent zombie film going on in the meantime. Believe it or not there weren't as many comical moments as I thought there was going to be but some instances were just downright hilarious. The acting was superb and I could tell it must've been an extreme challenge for them since they'd have to go from comedic to dramatic to tragic in what was sometimes probably only a matter of seconds. I definitely gave a big thumbs up to the cast after I noticed this. Even with the apparent low-budget I think the zombie's were effective and looked just as real as in most other movies. Overall a great movie and I highly recommend it to take your mind of life's boring subtleties.Final Review:Movies: Worth every cent of the ticket price.DVD Purchase: Yes, there is a very good chance this might be the start of a series.Rental: If by no other means then absolutely!",8,1,2,27 September 2004
Alexander," Alexander the Boring
","Despite the awesome previews/trailers...I have to wind up giving this movie a negative review. The biggest disappointment was the fact that there were only two battle scenes in the whole three hours of it (much like 'Master and Commander' which was far worse since I could actually tolerate 'Alexander').That was clearly not enough for an epic movie, they were too short in length, and it was nearly impossible to interpret what was going on. I couldn't separate the opposing sides, the battle strategies weren't explained, and everything but the blood spouting out was unclear. Another downfall was that it focused too much on homosexuality, I mean Oliver Stone literally beat it too death and it wasn't even a known fact. It got to the point where I'm just like 'enough already'! Other parts that it was lacking include the lack of direction for the film's plot, countless speeches without any motivation for them, and just downright slow-moving parts that some viewers became fed up with and left the theater. The few plus sides were that despite being boring it actually passed by pretty quickly (although I don't understand how), a majority of the acting was good, and it was based on one of the most important people in all of the world's history.Val Kilmer who used to be fantastic seems to have dwindled in time and I don't think Rosario Dawson is anything special either. Take my word for it and skip this one!Final Days:Movies: You'll feel swindled afterward.DVD Purchase: What a waste of money!Rental: The only form I'd consider but this is something you can definitely miss out on.",4,0,1,26 November 2004
Hot Fuzz," 'Hot Fuzz'  Sizzling Entertainment
","It has been awhile since I've seen 'Shaun of Dead' but I definitely enjoyed it and was really looking forward to this installment. The best part of the British spoofs is they offer a far more intelligent sense of humor than their American counterparts. Unfortunately most of the mainstream audience here hasn't quite fully seemed to have grasped that concept, but there are those that can appreciate it. Luckily it appears to be catching on. I readily admit that sometimes I'm in the mood for the quick and easy laugh but more often than not I'd like to work for it.'Hot Fuzz' wasn't as funny as 'Shaun of the Dead', although I thought the story was a lot better. Another thing that I like about these British spoofs is that the film was good enough to stand on its own, even if the viewer didn't catch on to any of the references shown. Granted it won't be as humorous but still enjoyable enough. Whereas the American spoof movies usually rely on them alone, which is why they become quickly dated. The tough part is classic movies were paid tribute to here as well so if you aren't a huge film buff then you'll be left in the dark for at least a few instances. That should be enough incentive for you to brush up on some much needed cinema knowledge!Some critics have stated that some of the parodies are way too over the top and completely unbelievable. Well that's the point as it was poking fun at how many of the action movies are the same way. Others asked, 'could the people in a small town really be that blind and not see or want to believe what was actually going on?' Yes they could, it happens all the time in rural areas, as sometimes their people aren't fully equipped mentally to realize that there's more than meets the eye from time to time.The acting was great and no one dipped below the charts on this one. This is certainly one talented comedic troupe. Even though they're all mainly classified as comedians, they are excellent dramatic actors, which is what adds to all the warped fun since they all basically play it straight. I really hope that this bunch continues to make another film in this fashion and that it won't take another three years to do so. 'Hot Fuzz' was fiendishly clever and got the whole audience involved in its crazy antics mixed with a serious backdrop. These are definitely some short arms of the law you won't want reaching for you anytime soon!",8,4,8,1 May 2007
Ed Wood," Different
","This movie was unlike many others that I've seen which is usually a very good thing. However it is weird but you really can't expect much else from Tim Burton so if you like his movies then it goes without saying that you'll love this one as it is one of his better helms in the director's chair. It was kind of sad seeing the actual Ed Wood struggling so much and nothing going right for him ever. Johnny Depp did an excellent turn as this happy-go-luck fellow that was always down on his luck. Bill Murray was only in a short part but he was actually pretty funny as a man in dire need of a sex change. Sarah Jessica Parker played a very good bitch since that's what she is in real life and Patricia Arquette was great in her expected nice girl role. As for Martin Landau it is without question that he deserved the Oscar here. Everything he did or said was just carried out with such perfection it was uncanny. I can't figure out why he's never as good in his other roles as he is here because it can evidently be seen that he is a absolute genius when he wants to be. This movie could be boring at times but I still liked it a lot and the wait for it to be released on DVD was well worth it.Final Hatch:Theaters: Glad I missed it here.DVD Purchase: No, but I can certainly see myself renting it again in the not-so-distant future.Rental: I love it this way!",6,1,6,20 October 2004
Insomnia," I like it
","This was a very good movie but unfortunately I still haven't seen the original so I wasn't able to compare it to that. Al Pacino was riveting in his performance and I was able to feel his pain of what was happening to him throughout the duration. I thought this was one of Robin Williams better roles considering how I usually can't stand him except for say 'Mrs. Doubtfire', 'Good Will Hunting', and 'Patch Adams'. Hilary Swank did fine but as was said before, her character was fairly limited. She played the adorable apt pupil in high regards. The plot kept me intrigued and the dialog was clever for the most part. I still don't know anyone who can give an emotional-driven speech like Al! I recommend this film to anyone that likes police suspense movies and all Pacino fanatics like myself.Final Call:Movies: Would be worth the ticket price.DVD Purchase: Of course!Rental: A perfect choice.",9,0,1,19 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'  If Only That Were True
","The third installment of the 'Pirates' saga kicked off and I got to screen it a day early. I really enjoyed the first entry and thought the second one was over-budgeted and ended up taking the series in a direction that I didn't like. 'At World's End' wouldn't be much different. It ironically turned out to be similar in structure to the third 'Spider-Man' movie which opened up only a couple weeks earlier being that it was a little too long, had corny love scenes, and was extremely confusing to a majority of the viewers. However I think that 'Spider-Man 3' was the better film as this one exceeded to excess on all those factors. While there was action aplenty and even scenes I liked, when I left the theater I harbored an empty feeling.It was evident that while the action was there, a really satisfying concrete story wasn't. For example a new type of all-powerful character was introduced and built up for the first two-thirds of the movie, but when they finally do come to fruition it's an extreme letdown. In fact many new elements were introduced that weren't fully explained that just left me wondering why they even needed to throw these in the script in the first place. It was if they were more concerned about creating a long running time than an understandable story.The swashbuckling was decent and there were many fights, however not as many important ones as there were in the first twowhere it had more one-on-one duels. Here there were many every person for themselves free for all's. Another problem was the blur of succeeding betrayals. This made it hard to distinguish who was who. I like knowing whom to root for, or at least thinking I know who to root for. The special effects were amazing and the actual production itself was pretty flawless but it was a clear case of all style and no substance. Well maybe not no substance, but very little.Johnny Depp while having some funny moments didn't build on his character whatsoever and didn't even have the most comical parts this time around. They seemed to have gone to the parrot and the monkey. At least half of Sparrow's humor fell flat, as they were just rehashed jokes and retorts that I heard back in elementary school. Orlando Bloom's acting was safely bad as usual in his case. Keira Knightley was okay, but she's more there as a pretty face than a legitimate thespian. The supporting cast was exceptional though just as they had been in the first two movies, and luckily for the ticket buyer they had a lot of screen time. So between the good and the bad here it about evened out.At least all the open-ended conflicts were resolved at the end and there weren't anymore real cliffhangers. However it's appearing pretty favorable that there's going to be another trilogy on top of this which I'm not looking forward to as the series quality has declined steadily with each film. It's basically one big money making scheme now by just throwing a bunch of special effects on the screen along with a few cute people and have the young masses come teeming in spending their parents not so hard-earned dough. This is why I wish they just ended everything here while there was still a shred of dignity left, but Hollywood can't seem to let anything be if there's a shred of money to be made lately.Even though this was a long movie it actually goes by somewhat quickly which was especially surprisingly given how slow moving some of the scenes are and the fact that a lot of inane dialog is thrown into the mix. It actually is worth watching and is probably even above average but falls far short of what it could've been. I also predict that this will break box office records without a doubt, as a film doesn't have to be good to achieve that anymore. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' was decent but didn't live up to the anticipation that was generated and if these epics are continued to be made like this I'll certainly be at wit's end!",7,0,1,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," 'Spider-Man 3'  Summer '07 Officially Swings In
","Ultimately I was highly impressed by the last installment of a trilogy that due to its immediate success has spawned a supposedly unplanned follow-up trilogy. 'Spider-Man 3' starts off on a happy note and all is well for Peter Parker, however things quickly go awry as his web gets even more tangled than ever before. A big warning to all potential viewers should be that if they're not familiar with the comic books with at least a general knowledge of the new villains, then there's a favorable chance that they will become completely lost along the way. This is mainly due to the fact that so many characters and subplots were crammed into too short of a time and the story moves along at a lighting fast pace. If you aren't paying attention I can see how it'd be very easy to get confused about who's who.Even though there was a mostly younger cast they all did supremely well. Tobey Maguire was probably the only exception but even he was okay. J.K. Simmons was absolutely hilarious and even though he was cramped for screen time, whenever he was present the audience was laughing. The same went for Bruce Campbell who despite only having one scene, made sure all eyes were on him for that whole time. The biggest surprise for me was Bryce Dallas Howard who I normally haven't been thrilled by, nevertheless was very pleasant hereboth on the eyes and acting-wise.The biggest weakness of this film besides squeezing too much into it, was the cheese factor. The worst of the worst was when Spider-Man runs past an American flag. This was tied with the jazz club dance routine. The audience was literally groaning out loud at this and ruined the momentum that was built up until these points. Plain and simple they just didn't belong. I'm not even going to comment on when Peter Parker develops a darker side since that sequence was too corny to capture the essence of in mere words.On the brighter side there were many pluses, the first being the CGI as it was incredible. So much work must've been put into making the Sandman character as they fine-tuned him down to each grain. I also was impressed at how so many separate stories were tied together so well. The musical score was invigorating and set an appropriate pace. Even though the running length clocked in at around two-and-a-half hours, I couldn't tell since there weren't many slow moments and it seemed to fly by. The producers could've easily added on another half-hour and I wouldn't have noticed. That might've even been a better way to go.Any true fans of the 'Spider-Man' franchise should see this. The tone and style are a lot different than the first two, but in some ways this is better since it adds a darker feel to the experience. There are some great quotes as always, which is a bare essential of any worthwhile comic book adaptation. To all those cynics that are complaining about the lack of clearly defined villains, well welcome to reality. Even the most ruthless bad guys either have some good to them in real life, or there were mitigating reasons for what made them into what they are. I thought that touch made it easier to identify with the antagonists since they had actual human aspects to them.Sam Raimi stuck to his artistic vision as best that he could and the successful completion of a blockbuster such as this deserves the high box office results it'll certainly produce. I'm very glad that they will continue the series even if it means bringing in a new cast and crew. Spider-Man was one of my favorite superheroes growing up as a kid due to his sheer ordinary daytime persona and the horrible things he'd have to endure. Yet he'd keep on going, not by relying on his superhuman powers but by getting by with sheer determination along with the love from his family and friends. Thankfully 'Spider-Man 3' didn't stray too far away from the comic books that it was based on, and was one of those movies that really make you stop to think about the fairness in life. It strives to be more than it is and in most cases, that's exactly what it does. As Stan Lee would say himself, ''Nuff said!'",9,1,4,8 May 2007
Zodiac," 'Zodiac'  A Favorable Sign
","I knew a good amount about this case going into the film as I always found the famous serial killer ones very interesting when I'd see a TV special about them on. It's also no secret that it's one of the few that went unsolvable to this day, so I really didn't know what to expect from a thriller that pretty much everyone already knows how it'll end. However 'Zodiac' was made with a style that allowed the perspective to seem fresh, even if it ultimately wasn't. This is a must see for any true lover of real police work that gets down to the nitty-gritty of what detectives have to go through in actuality. No one's job is glamorized and in fact it's portrayed as the other way aroundpeople get fired, demoted, or simply go flat out crazy. What fascinated me so much about the 'Zodiac Killer' more than the other murderers I've heard about was how he kept changing his methods, which is the main reason why he was able to elude capture for so long. All in all this made for one excellent cinematic puzzle that remained that way.The biggest surprise of this movie was that David Fincher directed it. Even though he doesn't come out with many new filmswith the exception of maybe 'Panic Room', those that he does direct are both highly innovative and entertaining. However this effort strayed away from the beaten path and was very different from the type of flick he usually churns out, which turned out to be a worthy venture. While I still prefer the likes of 'Seven' and 'Fight Club', this was close to them in overall quality. So much detail was taken into account when recreating the time period and crimes. Even though the film was shot digitally they edited it so the appearance had a grainy texture as it did back in the 70's. Also the costumes, settings, modes of transportation, and everything else was matched to a T.The acting was strictly topnotch here and the biggest kudos goes to Robert Downey Jr. He was absolutely amazing! It's sad that he's at his best when he's playing a character that gets lost in a world of drugs and alcohol as his life has imitated this art for quite some time. Nevertheless he was so amusing to watch and added a playful quirkiness to Paul Avery that I don't think it would've been possible to play him any better. While Robert easily stole the show, a very honorable mention was Mark Ruffalo. He did quite well too and while he usually does, this went above and beyond what he's normally capable of. It's evident that as decent as Mark always has been in the past, there's always room for improvement. Everyone else put in great turns too, and there wasn't a single performance that came close to being unbelievable.Potential viewers should also be warned, this film isn't for everybody. There are a few very disturbing sequences, that while they aren't even terribly graphicstill manage to be creepy beyond belief due to their realism pertaining to the sheer coldness in which they're displayed. Another factor is the 160-minute running time, which except for the first third when the actual killings are taking place, quickly starts dragging on following that. All the facts had to be included though, so it really couldn't have been much shorter without losing its potency. You also have to remain open-minded if you watch it and can't demand any kind of closure except for what you can conclude on your own; otherwise you'll leave awfully disappointed. Finally it can be argued that only one viewpoint is being showed here and that is the author's, this automatically leads to a bias. I personally think it's the most logical account of events, but if you want an impartial take on what went down, your best bet is to watch a documentary on the history of events that took place.It's very scary to think that such a gruesome individual could go about undetected for so long and that we'll never get to find out the real answer on who it was behind everything. Fincher's latest contribution is a compelling view for all those with strong stomachs and was eerily refreshing compared to what junk has been streaming out of Hollywood lately. There are many notable guest appearances and is quite simply a well-done movie, even if it did get hammed up a little bit. I personally am going to avoid secluded places for awhilejust in case my astrological sign reads anywhere near the same as it did for all the poor victims.",8,129,188,3 March 2007
Blades of Glory," 'Blades of Glory'  Skating in the Laughs
","I finally got to see 'Blades of Glory' three weeks after its initial release and I had only heard positive things about it. Someone even told me that it was a laugh-a-minute thrill ride and came out much funnier than 'Talladega Nights', which I happened to enjoy. However after getting to watch for myself I have to disagree. While 'Blades of Glory' was funny, it was achieved in a cutesy kind of way. But the real Grade-A laughs were few and far between. Instead I was placed under a barrage of smirk-inducing gags that made me smile, but came short of laughing-out-loud.The plot was fairly unique and simple enough for everyone to understand rather quickly. Also the short running time made sure that the story didn't start to sag. The two leads were perfectly cast as Will Ferrell and Jon Heder put in excellent turns as the bad boy and effeminate heterosexual, respectively. It was also great to see Craig T. Nelson back on the screen as he always does an excellent job. The notable appearances from Nick Swardson and Andy Richter were appreciated as well. Actually all the ensemble cast was up to speed except Amy Poehler in my opinion. She just does not seem to be up to par as an actress and I don't think she's funny.This was a decent film that even breathed out moments of inspiration and had it not been built up so much beforehand I'm sure I'd rank it as excellent. In the end I can't help but feel somewhat letdown by it to a point as far as the humor was concerned, but at least the story was there. It appears that it was meant for a younger audience then Ferrell's latest installments. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone but especially teenagers since this offers more appeal to their age bracket. I'm looking forward to seeing both Ferrell's and Heder's next films still, hopefully they'll both be much cooler...without the ice.",7,0,0,29 April 2007
Grease," Adorable
","I hated this movie when I was a teenager and I'm so pissed at myself because of that. Looking at this movie now in my 20's I can appreciate what a fun-loving view of life this provides. All the songs are of at least decent quality but three of them in particular are just amazing. This is hands down one of the better musicals out there. The choreography can't be more well done than shown here. It's funny because I liked 'Saturday Night Fever' better when I was younger but now I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened with this one...go figure. Olivia Newton-John is just gorgeous, why she didn't star in many movies afterward I'll never understand and god what a voice!!! John Travolta was great, and everyone else (especially Stockard Channing) were all fabulous. Oh and if you ever go to a Karaoke night make sure you do the 'Grease Megamix' sometime throughout the night as it'll get the crowd pumped guaranteed.Final Synopsis:Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it was re-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it. This is one you can view easily on the silver screen and enjoy it just as much for a lot cheaper.DVD Purchase : Couldn't resist for only $9.Rental : This could easily be a once a year habit.",9,71,106,13 September 2004
28 Weeks Later," '28 Weeks Later'  Not Late At All
","An intelligent horror film goes a long way in my book and '28 Weeks Later' did exactly that. I enjoyed the first one but thought it was only slightly above average. Although the extreme low budget utilized did add to the credibility of the impressive box office underdog that resulted. Usually when money is added to a sequel, havoc is wreaked and the franchise tends to get washed down the tubes. This was not the case here as the second installment proved to be just as intelligent, if not more so. While it was a zombie-type film, it contained everyday concerns that our world faces.Technically those infected aren't zombies, so while it isn't a zombie movie per sethey do possess very similar characteristics to them. The way the virus can be transmitted has properties of HIV, but I don't think there was a social statement there as it was probably more coincidental. On the other hand, references to the war in Iraq were a little more poignant and while I don't think it was a direct blowthe director definitely wanted to point out how us Americans love our guns. Which is true. Chances are the U.S. soldiers here behaved exactly the same as they would in an actual confrontation such as this could it occur. They'd operate under the same short fuse and eagerness to bring out the big guns rather than sincerely try to rebuild a lost civilization.As good as the story was, it wasn't without a fair share of errors. For starters there were huge gaps in the continuity between both movies. Rules that were set in '28 Days Later' went ignored in the sequel, and even some new ones were put into effect. Also the editing was so jumpy that any viewer who succumbs to motion sickness should steer clear, as the camera tends to bounce around mercilessly. I thought some of the action sequences were put together too messily as it was very hard to make out what was going on in some of them as well.The acting itself was very appropriate for its genre and there were no extreme over-the-top theatrics that usually make me want to strangle some of the characters myself. My absolute favorite had to be Jeremy Renner though. I've been following him ever since his first underground film and while stardom has managed to elude him for quite some time, I think he is an excellent artist. Idris Elba I also adore ever since I've seen him on 'The Wire', and he was great here, however his part seemed much too small for a gentleman of his caliber. Imogen Poots was visually stunning and I must say I was rather impressed with Rose Byrne who often tickles me as an annoying character. Robert Carlyle was good as usual in a creepy kind of role that he seems no stranger to. A lot of the audience seemed to pan him early on for a life changing decision he makes that is easy to find fault in. However in a survival viewpoint, he really did the right thing given the sure doom layout that was set before him and due to the fact that he only had a split second to determine what to do.Now that the year is almost at the halfway mark, I must admit that I've been very impressed with what has been laid out so far. The cinema was getting so bad that I agreed with all the people that stopped going because of how outrageous the prices were getting. The costs have grown even worse in the meantime but they are almost worth it again and I wouldn't doubt it if the cycle reverses soon. '28 Weeks Later' is the best horror film I've seen in 2007 and I can't imagine what it'd take to beat it. This was an intellectual gore fest that combined great writing, excellent acting, and a break from formulaic slashers. I highly recommend this to just about anyone that can handle the jumps it dishes out and am willing to bet a third chapter will be on the way. Hopefully they can think of a better title than '28 Months Later' by then!",8,5,10,13 May 2007
Apocalypse Now," One of the Greatest!
","There's really no other way to say it except that this was a spectacular movie. Everything about it was just so perfect...the acting, cinematography, music/scores, directing, and action sequences just to name a few. I mean film doesn't get much better than this and the fact that this escaped with only a couple Oscars completely baffles me. Some classic quotes were also spewed throughout the duration and it really makes you think about a lot of things. Robert Duvall was probably my favorite character even though he was only in it for a smidge. I couldn't believe Laurence Fishburne was only 14 when he was in this, he looked a lot older. Martin Sheen was spectacular and believe it or not I think he did a better job than Harvey Keitel would've in this role (even though I'm one of his major fans), so when he dropped out I don't consider that to be a tragedy by any means. Marlon Brando is just Marlon Brando and despite all the problems he gave everyone before and during shooting I still really liked him in this role. As for Dennis Hopper, well he was very comical. This is hands down a classic and an absolute must-see!Final Recommendation:Movies : Man I wish I could've seen this on the screen.DVD Purchase : I have 'Redux' and it was a good investment, though the added scenes are kind of slow moving they still add a lot to the story.Rental : We all got to get started somewhere.",10,3,3,12 September 2004
Die Hard 2," Not as good as the 1st!
","I enjoyed this sequel but it was nowhere near as spectacular as the first one. The plot was much less realistic and the acting wasn't as good even though they had more famous actors in it. Don't get me wrong, it still was a good movie and it especially has more meaning in today's times since we're dealing with terrorism now on a daily basis but it just didn't flow as smoothly as the first installment of this series. There was one big plot twist which was pretty nice and as unbelievable as the plot seemed, something similar to this could probably happen someday if we're not careful. Bruce Willis was good and the 'Die Hard' trilogy (unless the rumors are true about a fourth one coming out soon) is probably my favorite role of his...well actually one of the very few that I like him in. If you haven't seen this or if you have and it has been awhile then watching this again can't hurt.

The Number 23," 'The Number 23'  Interesting Concept but Lackluster Result
","I had heard terrible things about this movie before watching it so luckily I went into the viewing with low expectations. While it wasn't as bad as some people were making it out to be, it was nothing special either. What boggled my mind is that there was actually potential to make a quality film here but it wasn't utilized. This was stupid since there's so many historical experiences and anecdotes that deal with the number 23 theory. The historic ones make sense but the formulas conjured up for the movie were absolutely ridiculous. They completely overlooked any real laws of mathematics and apparently the theorist could apply any rule he wanted to over and over again to obtain the results he was looking for.However there was some good to this disappointing feature. I liked how a main concept was that an obsessive person could formulate anything because they'll keep going until they see what they want to see. This essentially shows that most conspiracy theories have probably came to being through acts of compulsion and really aren't based off of concrete facts. The twist ending was also fairly original but due to the heavy saturation of twist endings audiences have been bombarded with these past five years, it didn't really have much of an effect on me. As for acting, Jim Carrey was very impressive and he really carried the weight of the film on his shoulders. Even though he's often overlooked by the industry each year, he can really take on an incredible dramatic role and is probably the best actor out of all the comics to this day. He also teaches his son sound moral judgments throughout and exemplifies what a good father should be. All the other performers were suitable but no one else really stood out.Joel Schumacher has turned out to be such a heinous filmmaker that it'll be forever beyond me why studios keep hiring him to direct. 'The Number 23' was supposed to be suspenseful, and it was really anything but. The murder mystery aspect didn't hold my attention and I really could've cared less what was happening in those regards. The plot was confusing and the beginning contained so much unnecessary filler that it seemed to go on for way longer than its runtime. I absolutely hated the Fingerling scenes and thought they were pure drivel. They exemplified absurdity in its purest form and it was if they came out of some cheesy made-for-TV erotica flick on a late night premium channel.There is absolutely no way I could recommend to anyone that this is a movie they should catch in the theater and hesitate to do so for even a rental. Unless you're still one of the unduly shrinking Carrey fan base or you enjoy any kind of paranoia theme there is no matter how dull it is along the way, then you'll do better off checking something else out and not wasting your time with this muck. This was a perfect example of an ending that puts together a twist just for the sake of having a twist, and it really showed. Connections were made that were obviously purely coincidental and no justice was done to an intriguing question that has plagued man over time. If only the film was only 23 minutes long, that's one enigma I could've lived withand it would've been a better movie for it too.",5,20,41,3 March 2007
Ghost Rider," 'Ghost Rider'  Blazes, But Not Nearly As Expected
","'Ghost Rider' was never my favorite comic book series as a kid but I did enjoy it a lot and overall it was probably one of the better ones. However while the movie adaptation was decent it wasn't nearly as good. The biggest difference I noticed is they took a lot of the darker edge away from the story, which seemed to now cater to a much younger audience in obvious anticipation of boosting ticket sales. This'll undoubtedly work monetary wise but as far as quality is concerned it definitely took a hard blow.The film itself is entertaining enough and is kind of cool considering how it blends a mix of genres such as fantasy and western. The acting was okay but some people were completely miscast and not just by how they appeared in the comics but also how they behaved. A grand lesson the filmmakers hopefully learned afterward is that dialog which works in print does not necessarily translate well to the big screen. Some of the one-liners were absolutely heinous and literally made me cringe each time I heard an utterance of either, 'youinnocent,' or, 'youguilty.' Some raw nacho cheese quotes to say the least. The special effects are great, however somewhat overdone. It seems CGI was thrown into just about anything the editors could get their eager hands on and this added to the corny factor as well.Nevertheless I still think Johnny Blaze is a neat character and contains a very alluring back-story. Not to sound trite myself but I really like how the allegory is based on solid morals and life lessons. The main plot is what sets this apart from a run-of-the-mill movie for me. That being how long should an individual have to pay for a stupid mistake? Surely it's not fair to have to suffer for the whole duration of one's life and that's what Mr. Blaze here discovers, that he can't be scared anymore and he must move onto learn from the past and fight the good fight.I also can't help but complain about the soundtrack, as that was procured for the teenyboppers too. The one huge exception was when 'Crazy Train' was blasting during a well-suited stunt that synchronized perfectly. That whole warm up and death defying leap will forever be ingrained in my unforgettable moments of cinema. On the other hand ghost rider's nemeses were wholly unimpressive. The biggest of all disappointments had to be the final fight since it led the viewer to believe there'd be this giant showdown between two titanswell let me just say this idea fizzled fast into one immense letdown instead.The irony is that although this film is flawed beyond belief, it's enjoyable and worth watching as questionable as that sounds. My best prediction is that this'll be one of those installments where there'll be a much better sequel as the first in the series usually serves as the establishing point and has to contain the more obligatory conception sequences. True fans of the comic might be a little disappointed but it's by no means a complete catastrophe and any teenager will love it. It appears that 'Ghost Rider' will be setting down the path of justice after all with this debut, but it might not be the right one just yet.",7,1,2,24 February 2007
Men in Black II," Nothing New Here!
",If you've seen one Will Smith movie you've basically seen them all. With the exception of 'Six Degrees of Separation' he plays a character with the exact same attitude in each one. The only film he did that I ever deemed worthy enough to buy was 'Enemy of the State'. Other than that it's just the same crap different day. It was a bad idea for me to rent this as I didn't really like the first one and even though it's been awhile I still remember it to have been much better than this. Actually they used a lot of ideas over again and I can't figure out why they felt the strong urgency to make an uncalled for sequel. Tommy Lee Jones did the best acting out of everyone but he was only in it for the last half and even he wasn't anything special. I will say however that Lara Flynn Boyle had a knockout body in this! She was always considered hot but breast augmentation really worked well for her. I hear now she became anorexic though and that's a shame because she should've stuck to what she did here. It'd be unwise to critique Johnny Knoxville's performance since I don't think he's really considered an actor. The only rendition he ever did that was good enough to be thought of as acceptable was in 'Walking Tall'. Finally Rip Torn was underused as well. Therefore I can't recommend this except to fans of the original that are dying for more.Final Shuttle:Movies: Would've been a waste of money.DVD Purchase: I'm not that crazy yet.Rental: I didn't think it was worth it!,4,0,0,23 November 2004
Children of Men," 'Children of Men'  The Brainchild of Humanity
","There has been a lot of emphasis in movies lately that depict the topic of the ending of both humanity and civilization. However this is the first one to breach on the idea of is that really such a bad thing? At first look, yes it is terrible as all humans no matter what they feel at times have an inherent survival instinct. But on the outside looking in, it's being said now that people are too destructive in their consumerism to be able to blend in peacefully with the rest of Mother Nature.'Children of Men' examines the pure chaos that would result if every person in the world knew that the end of life as they know it was coming to a screeching halt in less than a century. Instead of life being put up on a pedestal it has the reverse effect and becomes even more worthless than it is considered today, which says a lot. Terrorism runs rampant and the government has gotten out of control, deliberately abusing all of its authority. The ugly side of human behavior is flashed at the viewer just about every chance there is and the worst part about this fact is it's completely realistic. While this film shows what will happen to societies in the world if nothing is done about the growing intolerance we share towards one another, it's actually being done right now in more parts of the world than we'd like to think.A good amount of symbolism is relayed throughout the duration such as dogs and cats get treated as children and water represents life. Also many potshots are taken at American practices, some are hidden while others are direct blows. The most obvious hits were at Homeland Security, foreign refugees, and the illegal alien policieswhich mostly criticized the Bush administration. While it wasn't officially declared, it appeared as if a state of emergency had been activated in London and emphasizes why we should never consider that as an option here.Every aspect of this movie tried to produce a sense of realism and the result was very effective. The cinematography was gritty and contained one amazing lengthy take towards the end that would stop the harshest critic dead in their tracks. The script was great and highly unpredictable. The scenes contained so much information that this'll be one of those films where you'll catch something new with each viewing. Many clues were lurking in the background. It's very easy to miss a small detail so make sure you pay close attention as the pacing can get extremely fast without warning. What really stood out above anything else was the tremendous success of humor. There was such a mix between subtle, dark, and even downright twisted comedy that helped make all the horrible scenarios bearable to the audience.Finally the acting was superb as everyone really put in the work. The two that stood out the most had to unsurprisingly be Clive Owen and Michael Caine though. Clive must be the best actor with the most limited range and I say that with great admiration. He never plays anything different but we all love him anyway and rightly so. Starting out as a detached alcoholic that had an ambitious past, he begins to regain his sense of responsibility and the belief he can make a differencewhich he does. Michael is cast here as a hippie, yes you read that correctly, and was absolutely delightful. An honorable mention is Chiwetel Ejiofor who easily brought to life a cold-hearted villain with a purpose. While everyone in the government is basically portrayed as bad, the terrorists are split into those that possess good intentions and the ones that are downright radical lunatics, which certainly shed light on an important issue.This film is not for everyone, but on the other handeveryone should see it. It's meant to require all watchers to do some soul-searching and realize that positive change is needed. But even if everyone stopped his or her hatred dead in its tracks and reached a pinnacle of self-realization, there'd always be at least one idiot out there who'd ruin it for everyone else. While preservation of our species is a priority, should it beand does it even matter at this point? As the movie itself shows, human attempts at correcting the wrongs of the world are always short-lived and hence it very well may be too late.",9,2,6,7 January 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Mindless Fun
","After reading all the heinous reviews of the movie I went in to this last night with ridiculously low expectations. To my surprise I actually left the theater extremely pleased. I didn't like the first 'Resident Evil' film but this one was a lot better. There was actually some sort of plot going on and the action was really great. Okay so the acting wasn't stellar by any means but it didn't make me want to vomit either. If you're looking to have a good time and aren't in search for the next 'Citizen Kane' then this would be a recommendation for you. I am certainly looking forward to the third installment since they left me kind of hanging at the end and I haven't followed the video games. I also think they should have titled this one 'Nemesis' instead of 'Apocalypse' because now they're going to be in a bind when they actually get to the one that's supposed to have that title. Oh well...I'm sure they'll think of something, they always do.Final Call:Movies : Enough action and special effects to make this worth the ticket price.DVD Purchase : This may just be a guilty pleasure.Rental : Yes but this one is better to see on the big screens.",7,1,2,12 September 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," Very good
","This was a good movie though isn't anywhere near comparable to 'The Godfather' or the like. There are some brilliant scenes/moments in it that'll have you gasping but I have to admit that some parts are way too slow for my tastes. The acting was no less than spectacular and this had to be one of James Wood's better roles. Rent this movie if you have a 3-day weekend coming up and will have the time to devote to it. It is very confusing at points and it seems like there are many different theories on how to take it in. I wasn't amazed at this film but I definitely give a hats off to the amount of time that was obviously put into a gangster epic such as this. Overall a good to very good rating.Final Call:Movies : No (4 hours in the theater for a slow moving movie is too much for my tastes).DVD Purchase : Maybe, but I'd get tired of watching this after awhile.Rental : Yes, perfect for a historic-themed movie night.",Null,0,1,7 September 2004
This Is Spinal Tap," The Best Mockumentary Ever!
","Even though it was made 20 years ago it hasn't lost any of its flavor that made it such an incredible original that will without a doubt eventually become a classic. The best part about this was an amazing back up cast that came in for cameos a long time before they were famous including Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, and Fred Willard. What made it so funny was that even though it was satire a lot of the dialog they were using is how real rockers talk in interviews and such. They did it perfectly and I can see why Christopher Guest and company shot to legendary status right after this even though I'm not always the biggest fan of his. A film very similar to this but for a rap group is 'CB4' which is also very comical but this certainly took the cake. The songs are actually decent as well and probably served a basis for 'Tenacious D' as an inspiration since they are very close sounding even though 'The D' takes it even more over the top. I enjoyed this a lot, I just wish they made it much longer!Final Jam:Movies: I wouldn't mind at all!DVD Purchase: It might make a very nice addition if I do say so myself!Rental: Didn't go wrong.",8,0,4,5 December 2004
Saw," The Best of Times, the Worst of Times
","I found this to be a mix of 2 movies, one I liked very much, 'Seven' and one I didn't like much at all, 'Phone Booth'. This one ranked right there in the middle but probably should be closer to the latter. The idea was nothing real new here but some of the concepts were. However this film had one major problem and that is it wasn't scary which I'm pretty sure was what it strides for. Whereas 'Seven' was beautifully rendered and flowed like poetry this just became downright stupid in some parts. It could have just pertained to my audience but a lot of them were laughing at parts especially during the second half. This was good in one instance that was supposed to be funny however I'm quite sure that the others were actually very serious but unfortunately didn't get perceived as such. The acting wasn't anything to write home about either. Another goal that didn't get reached was the audience was supposed to stop and think both during and after the viewing about their life, kind of like 'Seven' did, in the whole 'what would you do if you were in this spot' mode. Sadly this didn't happen as I left the theater disappointed in a few ways. The gruesome factor wasn't that bad either and most people will be able to handle it without any qualms. A good attempt, but needed big improvements all over the place.Final Slander:Movies: Not really worth it.DVD Purchase: See previous line.Rental: Waiting for this option is probably your best bet!",6,1,2,31 October 2004
National Treasure," Enjoyable
","I honestly thought this movie was going to be terrible and luckily enough I came out pleasantly surprised. To start off I must state the plot was incredibly flawed in not just the concept alone. But the fact that Nick Cage can put together these impossible riddles out of the blue was ridiculous. Or that Sean Bean could figure them out as well even when he didn't have the clues was even more so. Add some crappy dialog and you end up with an unappetizing combo. However despite all these negative remarks I still thought it accomplished more good than bad. It did this through the sense of amazing adventure sequences and well thought out action scenes that weren't overdone. While it's not as good as 'Raider of the Lost Ark' I did think it was one of the closest attempts since then with the exception of maybe the two 'Mummy' movies...but they were a whole different ball game themselves. Diane Kruger didn't look as good in this as she did in 'Troy' but her acting was slightly better even though she's still not that great at it. There's a model for you. I felt it was worth my money and enjoyed the exploration of it all!Final Quest:Movies: Was actually worth it believe it or not.DVD Purchase: No, only because I wouldn't watch it more than once a decade.Rental: If you don't catch it in theaters then do so on the small screen!",7,0,0,20 November 2004
The Departed," 'The Departed' Won't be Leaving Anytime Fast
","There were a couple complaints about this film's length during my screening, as clocking in at just over two and-a-half hours, it's a long movie. But there's a big difference between good long movies and bad long movies, which this is most certainly the former. The time flew by and not once did I find myself checking my watch. That being said it was also a fairly original idea, despite actually being a foreign remake. I think it's definitely safe to say that none of the important parts were lost in translation during the conversion. The finished product easily did justice to the original, especially considering how poorly the majority of Americanized releases have turned out lately.As far as the acting as a whole was concerned, it was way above par. Jack Nicholson effortlessly played a great insane gangster, whose level of psychosis steadily increased. Alec Baldwin was hilarious as the dedicated but extremely sarcastic administrative officer. In fact I think it was the combination of these two characters that led to the perfect blend of comic relief that made it much easier for the conservative audience members to digest some of the harsher subject matter. The star turn was definitely put in by Leonardo DiCaprio, who displayed such naturally conflicted emotions and added so much inside depth to his role that at times it was even scary. Leo's both physical and various forms of mental anguish could be felt by all. I could really feel what he was going through the whole time without ever having those exact same experiences. This is one time where it'll be tough to ignore him at the Oscars again. Matt Damon gave a pretty flawless performance, but it also felt that he had the least interesting of all the characters despite having a lot of screen presence. Mark Wahlberg was surprisingly good in a different role than he's accustomed to, although he did drop his accent a couple times. Somewhat newcomer Vera Farmiga was passable, but not overly convincing and did seem to get clunky.Overall the character development could've been better as the viewers just received a surface glance at them, but I wound up caring for most of the individuals regardless. The cinematography was excellent and contained some beautiful scenes of Boston along with some not so desirable shots of its seedy underground. The soundtrack was amazing and not just for the wonderful songs themselves. They really heightened the emotions by being blasted at some intense scenes as well. Needless to say this particularly grabbed my attention. Finally, the editing was tight which also helped with the quick pacing and the script was smoothly written into several layers but at the same time not being formulaic. Even if the scenario mainly dealt with translating the 'Infernal Affairs' story for audiences over here.This was a highly enjoyable flick and I fully recommend it on just about every level. In fact, my only real problem with it was that the ending felt rather contrived and was a letdown. It turned messy quickly and was going all over the place when the filmmakers were trying to tie everything together. Not too mention also highly improbable. Notwithstanding, if you can overlook that, then you'll be in for a real treat as usual from Martin Scorsese. This is without a doubt his best film so far this decade, and could quite possibly be right there under 'Goodfellas'. It's fairly ironic that the title is 'The Departed', because I was so intrigued that I didn't want to leave.",8,2,4,2 January 2007
Die Hard," Still amazing!
","After many years have passed I have to say that this movie kept me hanging as it did when I watched it was seems now like ages ago. The Sheriff of Nottingham was the main villain (I don't think he could ever play a good guy with his expressions but just as well because he's always perfect as a downright evil mastermind). This is basically what made Bruce Willis and rightly so, he did do some of his best acting in it. All the bad guys were pretty good, the only character that really got on my nerves was Ellis because he was just such a sleaze. I thought it was cool that the father from 'Family Matters' (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you don't get to see him in too many pictures. This film is still exciting to watch and I definitely recommend it for this upcoming holiday season (as they play many Christmas songs throughout)!

The theme has been done many times before but I was kept watching by Denzel's exquisite performance. The action was incredible and there were some awesome quotes. I loved Denzel's character and I hope he chooses to do more roles along these lines in the future. However Marc Anthony is a horrible actor and he looks as good as he acts...how he gets movie deals is a concept way beyond my understanding. Radha Mitchell did a good job and is hot except for that bump right between her eyebrows (it is very distracting)! Christopher Walken had some awesome parts and Mickey Rourke actually didn't appear like a scumbag for once as he dressed up and bathed (both foreign concepts to him).

Shooter," 'Shooter'  A Shot in the Dark
","I normally have mixed feelings toward Mark Wahlberg movies. Mainly because he's in some spectacular films, but I usually don't approve of his acting, which causes a paradox for me. This however was the first one that I thought he actually was suitable for. The end result was a production that I thoroughly enjoyed much more than I originally expected. I had heard beforehand the novel was simply amazing and while I'm sure the book is better as that is pretty much always the general rule, I don't think this translation will be too far below the high standards it set.'Shooter' had many strong points and it got off to an excellent start. It kept up its momentum until about a little over halfway through when an ever so slight cheese factor popped its ugly head up. The frustrating part was it really didn't need to throw in a slow-motion walking scene and the worst part was the ending as it just screamed, 'we should've just let it finish at the prior scene but wanted to throw in more action for the sake of it.' There were some corny quotes but nothing I couldn't tolerate. Possible plot holes did appear but only if the viewer engaged in some hardcore analyzing, which the typical one probably won't for this. The tiny disruptions in the flow of logic are easily overlooked however and the picture is honestly very enjoyable.The comic relief was blended in smoothly and really polished off what would normally be some rough edges as there is some depressing ideology thrown around. There was definitely a sneaky reference made to Dick Cheney's hunting accident which was really funny as it happens so fast that it's hard to catch until after the fact. The action was great and very fast-paced. The coolest factor was that despite most of the situations being either improbable or even impossible, they were shot in a way that didn't make them seem too unbelievable at the present time. This was by no way a mindless flick either. The concept wasn't completely original, but new paths were followed and did branch out into uncharted domains.Already controversy has emerged that anti-American themes are displayed a lot. I have to disagree with this because while dissatisfaction with the sleazy way things are being run under our current administration is the underlying theme. By voicing that opinion is a perfect demonstration of the true American way. The oil crisis is looked down upon, as are some of our other questionable foreign policies. Specific monstrous atrocities are used as an example, but since they're in other countries no one over here really cares. This rings a true bell. Another moral that is stated by the attorney general near the end is that, 'justice doesn't always prevail.' That couldn't be anymore on the money either. Lately it seems the bad are the only ones being rewarded since they're willing to do things honest people won't.The acting was varied and Mark Wahlberg's voice actually changed at least three times. It might've been intentional but if it was, it didn't need to be. Everyone else was at least halfway decent and it was nice to see Ned Beatty appearing in a quality picture again. I highly recommend this film as it offers an interesting perspective on our present nation's status and is a great way to pass two hours. It offers edge of your seat entertainment and is the first straight up action movie that can spark fairly intelligent conversation afterward that I've seen in a long time. 'Shooter' will blast away most audiences and should snipe its way to the top of this weekend's box office.",9,7,16,24 March 2007

However as soon as I started my screening I instantly got sucked in and was eagerly awaiting to see what'd happen next. It was also neat that it was actually loosely based on a person in real life that has lived in an airport in France for a very long time now. I just may have to go visit him someday, well probably not but if I make it too 100 years old it'll be on my to-do list. Then again I doubt he'd still be alive...oh well there goes that plan! Overall it was really an uplifting movie and it had a lot of warm-hearted moments that were perfect for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend! The acting was first rate with only one exception with that being Catherine Zeta-Jones. She sucks! But despite her, everyone else did wonderful and since it had a big cast this more than made up for it. I'm surprised this sunk at the box office, if I knew then what I know now I would've laid off calling it 'a stinker!'.

This one of Ray Liotta's better roles and Johny Depp was wonderful, he utilized a perfect accent as well. I don't see why Penelope Cruz is all the hype because I don't even find her that attractive and we all know she can't act. There were definitely some awesome quotes thrown down and while everyone praises 'Scarface' to high heaven (which it deserves quite frankly) no one ever mentions this as a great movie even though it was.

","Well if one thing's for sure it's that Mr. Depp has certainly come a long way, not just career-wise but with his acting ability as well. I have the funny feeling that if you told this young man back then that he'd become one of the most sort after people in the moving picture business today that you'd only receive a laugh as a response. This was actually pretty good for a early-80's horror movie. The concept was great since it differed from all the regular slasher flicks and it gave the villain an eccentric personality.Some CGI could've been used but all in all the cheesy special effects did their job. The look into dreams was interesting as it is a subject that fascinates most people since we still don't know the exact cause of and reason for them. Unfortunately the first installement in horror film sets is usually the best and the series did tend to go downhill after this (although there were a couple others that were decent). The idea gets beat to death though when producers try to milk an idea for all it's worth and all that is left is just a corny by-product.

300," '300' Â– An Epic of Even More Epic Proportions
","I really liked this one a lot. It wasn't the best film I've ever seen or even the best epic that has been made, but it was quite exquisite. I was actually blown away by the time the end credits started rolling and something happened twice that I absolutely loveÂ…a round of applause. Not only after the movie was finished did people clap but also at a powerfully unexpected event about three-quarters of the way through. These were very pleasing moments as I haven't witnessed a show of acclaim such as that since 'The Lord of the Rings Â– Return of the King'. The theater I viewed this in on opening night sold out quickly and since there were a good deal of younger people in the audience I was worried about having to deal with every distraction known to man. This wasn't the case though as '300' was so powerful that it had the ability to silence everyone and keep them that way until it was over.The new film-making techniques were a very fresh look into what can be done now with today's technology and the way the script was written put a different twist on a historically true story. In a way I'm glad it wasn't completely accurate as it stated right from the beginning that it wasn't and it also made the plot more interesting. Frank Miller is such a highly creative individual and I think it's great how he uses such ugly fantasy creatures to really capture the aura of evil people. The use of slow motion was simply riveting and nothing like that has ever been done before for such a long duration.As a fan of machismo cinema the battle sequences were my favorite part. It did take a little bit of getting used to with how they were done but they really ended up growing on me. In fact I was caught off guard by how much sheer hardcore violence is shownÂ… ranging from decapitations to every type of goring imaginable. However I didn't find it in bad taste because it goes hand in hand with the type of story it represents, I'm sure not everyone will feel this way though. Another great aspect was the comic relief. Some of the characters had such funny expressions and quotes in inappropriate moments, which really drew a surprising jolt of laughter from the audience at unexpected times. The score is also a huge strength as it blasts during pivotal scenes to really get the blood pumping.The acting was great and I couldn't think of anyone else except Gerard Butler playing the title character, as he was so fitting that it was hard to imagine him as an actual regular guy in real life. Despite Gerard being in only a handful of roles before this I have always thought he was an encapsulating performer but he certainly took the cake here. David Wenham also did a remarkable job as both a warrior and a storyteller. The ironic part for me was the only one I wasn't too crazy about was Dominic West, who is usually one of my favorite character actors turned leading men. I will admit though that this might be since I'm not used to seeing him in a villainous role and he played pure weak sleaze here. Nevertheless a very robust cast was utilized that shows every emotion off imaginable to a remarkable effect, at least once.'300' is what going to the movies is all about and what has been lost as of late. This is what a trip to the cinema should be and it blew a breath of fresh air into an industry that needed revitalization more than it knew. Whether this alone will be capable of pulling off a new era of qualityÂ…probably not, but hopefully if it succeedsÂ…which, I can't see how it won't, it will encourage more invigorating filmmakers to follow in director Zack Snyder's footsteps. There wasn't any aspect that was neglected and it was the excellent combination of sound, music, colors, contrasted cinematography, story line, and wonderful performances that blew my mind. The morals also were near to my heart as it taught how beneficial it is to work together as a team and why one should always do what they feel is right no matter how slim their chances of success are. Overall the best blend of movie-making meshed together in probably at least the last couple of years. If you don't take my word for it that this is a worthwhile view, well then do it, 'for Sparta!!!!'",10,1,9,10 March 2007
