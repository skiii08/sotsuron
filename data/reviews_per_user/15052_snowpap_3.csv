Mission: Impossible III," I thought it was very entertaining. Much better than MI:2.
","Lately I've found myself not too fond of Tom Cruise. The way he has acted in recent memory has turned me off of most of his work. That and he has been in a lot of bad movies lately; Collateral, Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and Mission Impossible 2 all come to mind, especially Vanilla Sky - what was he thinking? In fact, other than possibly War of the Worlds and Austin Powers: Goldmember, I haven't cared for any other movies of his in nearly a decade! However, that all changed with MI:3. I found this installment to be very entertaining and on the edge of my seat exciting. I highly recommend this one and it was well worth the buck fifty I paid at the super saver. This one would even be worth the full admission price at many other higher priced theaters. This one is a definite renter if you have not seen it as of yet.GG",8,0,1,9 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The best adventure film since Goonies!
","This is truly one of the best, if not the best adventure film I have ever seen!  I'm not the only one as over 36% of the voters gave this one a 10 out of 10.  Great characters and terrific writing make this a classic for generations to come!  If you have not seen this one, get out and buy it today - notice I said buy and not rent.  You will love this one!",10,1,3,24 January 2004
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Watch if you want to be bored!
","This movie was just plane boring. Not funny and boring. Some of the scenes just went on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on without any end in sight! The only thing worse than this movie was his good buddy Vince Vaughn's movie The Break Up (which by the way could possible be the worst movie every made). 99% of this movie was just terrible with the other 1% being somewhat laughable; somewhat. If you have not seen this movie, read the other comments and stay away as this was by far Will Ferrell's worst movie he's ever appeared in. The only reason I keep on typing is so that this rant can actually be posted as it's still not long enough. Unfortunately for all viewers, this movie was too long and it was only 1 1/2 hours. Save your hard earned money or go rent Old School again to see one of Ferrell's better movies.",1,2,5,18 October 2006
