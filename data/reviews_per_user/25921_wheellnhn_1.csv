The Ring," Both Ring and Ringu send some chills
","Whilst I saw both the japanese version (Ringu) and american version (Ring),I wasn't disappointed by either. This movie sends chills up your spine and makes you jump... high. If you saw in the theater like me, you'll be even more impressed.",Null,0,0,12 March 2003
