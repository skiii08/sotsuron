First Man," Good, not great.
","It was good, just not great.As the title suggests it was more about the man, than the mission. Which is fine.
That being said, I feel like they even showed more of the moon landing than I was expecting, which was nice.I just felt as much as it was, and should've centered around Armstrong, it was just lacking character development for the other characters. Specifically the other astronauts. It made it seem like Neil barely knew them. Or at least had very little interest in anything or anyone but himself.Hey..maybe that was the case. Maybe it was more accurate than it seemed. I just find it very hard to believe he's take on those type of missions with people that wouldn't be considered more than acquaintances.Still worth watching. Very good acting.
7 out of 10.",7,0,0,23 July 2019
Hereditary," Slow moving, but the ending makes it all worth it.
","This movie is very good...bordering on great.
The ending really ties everything together. The only thing holding it back from a 9 or 10 rating is that it's a 2 hour movie, that should've probably been 30 minutes shorter. A lot of down time, but the last 20 minutes are insane. If you find yourself almost giving up on it... don't. It's worth getting through.After it ended, I pieced together about 95 percent of the story... if you don't figure it out for yourself, or really even if you think you do, it's worth reading an explanation article AFTERWARDS.It's quite an intelligent story, and world the writer has created. It's a thinking movie, but also with almost a 'slasher' feel.The movie was critically acclaimed and loved by critics... but received mixed reviews by the general public. I know the directed has just released Midsommer with a similar feel to it, but I really hope at some point he puts out a sequel to this one. Or at the very least a movie within the sane world as this one, as he leaves the ending opened up to A LOT of possibilities.Good Stuff.",8,3,4,5 August 2019
Us," Good, not great. Expectations were too high...
","I think after how phenomenal GET OUT was, my/our expectations were too high for US to live up to them.It was good, but unlike how GET OUT was a new take on horror films, I feel US was just a regular one. There is a twist at the end, however imo, it was predictable and not that crazy.The acting was incredible. NO complaints there. It was quite entertaining because of how good the actors were.
It just wasn't really that 'creepy'.
Also, even after reading cast and crew interviews, and watching YouTube videos...I feel there was a lot of things in the movie that could/should have had more meaning than they did.",7,0,1,28 March 2019
Joker," Overrated, but good.
","I'll start off by saying.... I get it.I realize it's not supposed to be an 'Action' movie or the typical comic book blah blah blah.
That being said, I still anticipated a lot more chaos.The last 30 min of the movie was great. Unfortunately the first 90 is....just okay. I found myself bored. Waiting for something to happen.I feel like you understand everything you need to know about the characters in the first 20 min. Then it's an hour of mediocrity, then it finally gets good.It was crafted very well, and the cinematography and acting were all top notch.",7,3,6,22 November 2019
Mother!," Must watch AT LEAST twice....so complex.
","This movie is outrageous in so many ways.
It's definitely a little slow moving at first, and it can seem quite random at times, but when you see the larger picture...it all starts making sense... and it's quite genius.Highly underrated, and unnoticed movie. I wish more people knew about it, so I could talk about it more.I strongly recommend watching it first....then googling some plot explanations...then watching it again. Some of the plot twist will make so much more sense the second time through.I'm not a big fan of spoilers in reviews, so I won't spoil it......but that being said, without a full spoiler, while watching the movie just think...
