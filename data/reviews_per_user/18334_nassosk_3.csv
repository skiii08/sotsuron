The Lobster," Lost at the end
","Nothing can prepare you for any Lanthimos next scene. A lesson I should have learned by watching Dogtooth.I pretty much had the exact same feelings (as the ones when watching Dogtooth) almost throughout the film: a sense of 'what if', a disturbing curiosity about people behaviors in situations that you know just cannot exist.The problem was that halfway through, the narrative loses its orientation. Is it a social commentary? Is it an extreme love story? Is it an allegory?I can live with the disturbing images and ideas because I expected them beforehand. It's just that, the film loses focus and feels like it could have concluded almost an hour before it did.And had it done so, we would be speaking about a whole different movie.",6,1,2,13 November 2017
Spotlight," Catchy story, but the film...
","Earlier in my life I would instantly 'rate' a film after having seen it, based on feelings it invoked to me. Nowadays I tend to ask myself a question: 'what is it that will make me remember this?'.Unfortunately for this movie after seeing it, I think that the overwhelming issue, the elephant in the room, remains the very subject that this film is occupied with in general. Almost nothing you see in this movie will 'stay' with you.Very nice cast, very nice acting all in all, but story and character building is 'flat' in my humble opinion. I never gotten to feel something for some character: not enough sympathy for the newspaper team (not threatened or risky enough - they didn't have to sacrifice anything), not enough dislike or wish for vengeance towards priests/Archbishop (did not actually see/hear their demeanor or reaction to this - just reported attitude), not even particularly sorry for the victims (just not convincing enough).A few years from now I think I will probably just remember that some journalists in Boston uncovered a lousy pedophilia scandal within the Catholic Church. And although pedophilia is a vast, shocking problem, well, you knew that before seeing this film.",6,5,9,1 September 2016
Elysium," Oh my God!
","This is what happens when you combine money with today's best movie- making means and no story at all. Utter crap.Every scene in this film, you have seen before. Every line in this film, you have heard before (only, better). Every character in this film, you guessed it: you have seen them in a thousand other films. If you are looking for new scientific ideas or some kind of breakthrough, forget it: this film simply defies a bunch of stuff we already know, because it fits the story.There simply isn't enough time to explain how this film fails on every level (except for visuals).This movie combines 80 years of Hollywood cheesy dialog, plot shortcuts, clichÃ©s, totally unreal/indifferent characters and comfortable twists with state-of-the-art CGI.",2,0,4,8 October 2016
