The Blair Witch Project," An atrocious waste of money!
","Being an avid movie-goer I usually check out every major film to come along. I had heard about the BWP for a while and was looking forward to it.  I did read some reviews people had written on this site but I chose to be skeptical(I am a skeptics-skeptic)  The movie did cause me to feel nauseous because it was filmed with the camera being deliberately shaken to make the film look amateur.  I found myself focusing on the seats in front and the walls and exit signs to reduce my eyestrain...from trying to follow the actors movements on the screen!  The lead actress was repulsive(big ass, and her face looked like the lead actor in that prison movie,  his wife is/used to be S. Sarandon) and did a horrible job acting--actually overacting--trying to appear terrified which wasn't believable.  The other two males acted like your typical stoned/half-baked college kids(they were supposed to).  The movie began with nothing,  had nothing in the middle, and ended with nothing and it made over $100 million!!!  Save your money and rent Evil Dead 2 and get a few good laughs and be entertained--this one is a stinker!!!",1,0,2,18 August 1999
