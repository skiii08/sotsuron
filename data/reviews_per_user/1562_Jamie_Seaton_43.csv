The Mask," Hmmmm
","i watched this film when it first came out so that would of made me about nine or ten years old. i really liked it and if i was nine or ten now i would of rated it eight or nine out of ten, but now i'm grown up....... and i give it a four. it isn't a bad film, its a kids film really. Jim Carrey is a little too stupid. i'm so glad these days he's in more serious films because he is very good in them.i think everyone knows the story to this. Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) works in a bank. living a very boring life until one night he finds an ancient mask and when he wears it he turns into a...... i guess a super hero.its not terrible, just isn't great either. not Jim Carreys worst but no where near his best....... 4/10........j.d Seaton",7,4,13,12 August 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," not as good as the first but wraps it up nicely
","i remember watching the first one and being completely blew away by the violence and choreography and stunts and was really anticipating on the second.iv now watched the second one and even though the action isn't as heavy in this i still got to say this is fantastic. the story carries on right after the first, with 3 more people left to kill.... budd, elle driver and the mysterious and unknown BILL. will the bride get to them ??? wait and find out. thats all i'm going to tell you about the film because i don't want to ruin it for you. quentin Tarantino is a marvel director that always makes films that become cult classics, this is the first sequel film he has made and he has done a truly brilliant job.my conclusion is that if you haven't seen the second one yet then go and get it now and if you've not seen the first one yet then crawl out of your rock and purchase both of them !!!!........ 9/10......... j.d seaton",10,3,6,9 August 2009
Black Swan," Aronofsky has done it again
","This extraordinary masterpiece had me captivated from the first minute right through to the end of the film. Now for all of you just expecting to see a light hearted ballerina flick then you are very wrong. I hav'nt seen Natalie Portman act as good as this ever, although she was brilliant in Leon and V For Vendetta. Mila Kunis has also shown first rate acting and Vincent Cassell was brilliant too as the strict ballerina teacher. Darren Aronofsky is becoming one of my favourite directors of all time, he hasn't made a bad film yet.Maybe people might of heard that this film starts off really slow but trust me its not. The film is just setting itself up and introducing characters and mood. Expect to be shocked by startling scenes with extreme originality and surreal undertones. Certain parts of this film even gave me sweaty palms, its that intense. This film will leave traces of itself in my mind for many years to come and would consider it to be one of the greatest films of the past 10 years.Natalie Portman deserves every award thats coming to her and the film should definitely have a run in for best film and best director. A MASTERPIECE 10/10.......J.D Seaton",10,0,2,20 January 2011
Changeling," one of the greatest films ever made
","this is one of the most powerful films I've ever come across. with it being a true story makes it even more powerful. i cant praise the brilliance enough. the film is on for about two and a half hours and my nerves were jacked through the whole of it. when you watch it you cant quite believe that this is actually a true story because of what happens to Angelina Jolie's character. its a very upsetting film and should be watched by everyone with a heart.the cast are flawless..... Angelina Jolie plays as Christine Collins who's son gets kidnapped, you really feel for her and her struggle to find her child. John Malkovich is also on top form as the man who helps Angelina (Christine) through her fight.it starts out quite nice. you see that Christine really loves her son. she goes to work one day and misses the last bus to her home. she walks back and finally makes it to her house at a late hour. soon as she opens the door the place is silent, already she knows something must be wrong. she looks in every room and even round the estate she's living in. she rings the police and they say the boy needs to be missing for a certain amount of time before they actually file a missing persons report. she then has a terrifying ordeal which is quite gut wrenching to find her son.once again Clint Eastwood has made a perfect film that will have me captivated forever. Clint is a genius, one of my favourite directors. he puts the exact pace in a film, the exact musical score, the right actors..... everything.i think this got nominated for three Oscars, i cant believe it didn't win any. i'm appalled by that. this film is absolutely amazing and there will never be a film like it again....... A MASTERPIECE......... 10/10........j.d Seaton",10,5,8,12 August 2009
Spartacus," 'the sleepy classic' as i like to call it
","i don't know what it is about this film but it is amazing, i just can never stay awake through all of it. i always have to watch it in three parts. its very strange because long films are my favourite, i think Stanley Kubrick cursed this movie ha ha. now then.... Stanley Kubrick is probably my best director of all time along with David Lynch, David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky, Richard Kelly, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and many more but i do have to say that Spartacus and Dr strangelove are the worst films he has done. i know this is a review on Spartacus but i gotta say how the hell did Dr strangelove get into the top 30 in the top 250 on here. that really has puzzled me. Stanley Kubrick is a winning director though, his films stand out from everyone Else's. he's a visionary and musical genius. i love the camera angles and the colours he uses in the sets, remarkable. he can also bring out the best in actors. i think Spartacus does deserve 4 Oscars because it is a well made piece of cinema with a strong cast of characters. Spartacus is played out brilliantly by Kirk Douglas, hes a gladiator slave that escapes capture an builds a team of allies against the rulers of Rome. its a fascinating film but far from Kubrick's best...... 8/10......j.d Seaton",10,2,5,12 August 2009
In Bruges," What's all the fuss about
",now i'm really into classy cinema and i usual like what all the critics like but i really don't understand why this has been hyped up so much..... its a fairly straight forward plot about two guys that are hit-man and are basically chilling out in Belgium. i guess the film talks on some levels about friendship and atonement but it doesn't save the boring plot. Colin Farrel does an OK job i guess and Ralph Fiennes is my favourite in this even though he's hardly in it. i wouldn't class this film as a comedy even though there are some subtle comedy underlinings. i'd be more accurate by saying this film is a moody and dramatic piece. i really couldn't find anything special about this. i didn't hate it. it had its moments of originality and i guess some people will love this but the film really didn't grab me.i am extremely astonished that this is in the top 250. its makes me think there must be something subliminal going on in this film that i didn't catch on too. overall this film was a let down and really left me feeling like i wasted my money from purchasing it........... 4.5/10...........j.d Seaton,4,10,25,15 December 2009
Se7en," David Fincher is a master
","this film is so beautifully made. it has to probably be the best mystery thriller of all time. director David Fincher is nothing short of a magician masterclass behind the camera. he has made other classic masterpieces such as Zodiac, Fight Club, The Game, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Buttons, Panic Room and the third instalment of the alien series. he really is one of the greatest directors ever and i hope he keeps making gems like these in the future.Brad Pitt (Fight club, Inglorious Basterds, Meet Joe Black) who is a Fincher favourite seeing as though he's been in a few of his films plays a cop who has transferred to take Morgan Freemans (Shawshank Redemption, Lucky Number Slevin, Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven) place as he is retiring at the end of the week. but before Freeman's hope to end the week nice and quietly comes to a halt when a murder is committed. Pitt and Freeman both go to investigate and eventually they realise that the killer is murdering his victims based on the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, envy, sloth, wrath, lust and pride). the film is so amazingly put together. one little problem with this which isn't really a problem to be honest is that the film should be on longer, its a classic film that really should be on for at least two and a half hours instead of only being on for two. the music and the camera angles are so stunning. some of the scenes are very shocking and will leave you thinking for many days after watching it. the chemistry of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is nothing short of remarkable. they both should of won Oscars for there roles in this. Gwyneth Paltrow (A Perfect Murder) plays a good role as Pitts girl. one role that really was breathtaking was Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, Superman Returns) as the killer. he should of won an Oscar for that role too. the ending to this film has to be one of the most shocking and most powerful i've ever seen. it really hits you like a wave and doesn't let go until the end credits. what a masterpiece this movie is.i'm so glad this film is in the top 30 films of all time because this film is definitely worth it. if you love this film you should try another Fincher classic called Zodiac. Zodiac is one on the greatest serial killer films i've ever seen. this film is going to remembered forever and not many films will surpass its brilliance.......... A MASTERPIECE............ 10/10............j.d Seaton",10,1,2,30 October 2009
Underworld," a very good stylish vampire flick
",Len Wisemen seems like a big up and coming director. he has also directed the sequel to this plus Die Hard 4 which is a brilliant film. i'm hoping to hear more from this upcoming director. i think Kate Beckinsale is good in this as a vampire. plus Bill Nighy makes a brief but good performance as the vampire king. Michael Sheen who is also in Frost/Nixon and the sequel and prequel to this is very good as a werewolf.the story basically is about a rivalry between vampires and werewolves. then one day Selene (Kate Beckinsale) finds out a plot the werewolves are planning and it starts a war that ends in carnage.obviously this isn't no classic memorable film but at the end of the day not many vampire films are. if you want a slick action film with good action scenes and good story then check this one out............ 8/10..........j.d Seaton,10,3,4,30 October 2009
Shaun of the Dead," its a good horror parody
",A fantastic Rom Zom Com! If you haven't seen this get round to it! I recommend this to anyone who likes good films and even people who are not crazy critics will love it too.... 10/10......j.d seaton,10,2,5,9 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," terrible !!!
","i thought this was terrible. once again the bad acting is beyond belief, even Johnny Depp doesn't salvage anything. this film has nothing going for itthe story is just so bad. now i know there's a third to these films out but u wont even see me rating that because this film has made me not want to bother. once again as i said about the first film, i have no idea how this is rated quite high on IMDb.com.... (7.3) ..... there must be some hardcore fans of this franchise out there....... for shame. if i was a hardcore fan of the first i really don't think id like this dull sequel. much like The Matrix, now i'm a hardcore fan of the first but the other two were abysmal.watch if you dare..... i dared and now i want that time back...... 1/10......j.d Seaton",1,6,7,24 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," why's this film rated so good ???
","as you can see I've not rated this film bad because there is a few qualities about it such as Johnny Depps acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow is quite comical and the graphics were good too. there was a lot of floors to the film too, a lot of cheesy bad acting is the worst. i just hated some things about it. its well overrated too, to be rated 8.0 on IMDb is a very lucky achievement for this.Orlando Bloom as Will Hunting and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swan are also among the cast and do a fairly good job. i do think Johnny Depps acting in this clouds over the other actors, he has done a very good job of this. the action and graphics have a big part to play in this almost epic feature.overall this film does deserve a watch but has been well overrated.... a good thing about the film is that there isn't really anything like this film around. was a good watch.......... 6/10......... j.d Seaton",8,2,7,24 August 2009
Pirate Radio," a fantastic feel good movie
","this film is really funny and the flow and acting are brilliant too. i don't know if other people have made the same conclusion but this film really does remind me of the film Almost Famous but obviously set on a boat rather than a bus. this film is also centred around music, so is Almost Famous. it also stars Philip Seymour Hoffman who is also in........... yes you all thought it, Almost Famous. there are other things too like the period the film was set in wasn't that far from each other. so is this all just a coincidence or did Richard Curtis (director of this) watch almost famous then has an epiphany in which he thought he could make a film that's almost the same as almost famous and succeed........ well i think he really did succeed because even though this movie isn't all that original i think he has made an unoriginal story very original with the actors and just the flow of the film.the film in a nutshell is about a pirate radio station that is situated on a ship in the British sea. the DJ's on this boat are brilliant and really keep this film alive. the government catch wind of this pirate radio station and through out the film they try to shut them down. meanwhile an 18 year old lad has been forced on to the boat by his mother for misbehaving at school and hopes this would teach him a lesson, how wrong was she. see this ship is the centre ground for drugs, sex and alcohol.among the cast of this brilliant comedy are Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Nick Frost, Kenneth Brannagh and Rhys Ifans. they all do a remarkable job in this. its also quite a lengthy film which i love and will always have a space in my DVD collection............. 9.7/10..........j.d Seaton",10,3,5,14 December 2009
"I Love You, Man"," slapping the bass !!!!!!!
","when i first heard about this film i thought it wasn't going to be anything special. then i saw parts of it round a friends house and laughed my as* off. i ran to the store immediately to purchase a copy. after watching it i had jaw ache because i was laughing so much. a huge plus about this film is it will speak to guys on different levels.the cast in this were very good. Paul Rudd (knocked up, friends) is once again extremely funny as a man who gets engaged but realises that he has no friends and would look silly at the wedding. so he goes on a mission to find a friend and leads him into some extremely funny scenes. also starring sort of new comer Jason Segal as Paul Rudd's new friend. i really liked supporting roles by Jon Favreau (director of Ironman) Jaime Pressly (not another teen movie, my name is Earl) and Rashida Jones.on a whole this is a comedy that has heart and really shows what friendship is all about. i recommend this film to guys mostly although women would also find this funny. two thumbs up.......... 9/10..........j.d Seaton",10,5,6,30 October 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Very good but could of been loads better
","now i'm not really a fan of the other X-men films but i really liked this. especially love the first twenty minutes of it. it really sets a brilliant pace for the makings of a classic super hero movie. after that twenty minutes it goes a bit down hill. it does pick up at the end. the CGI is brilliant. the acting is OK too so i don't have anything bad to say on the actors performances. i was expecting a rubbish film but this did stun me.the storyline is exactly what the title of the film refers too. its the origin and makings of Logan a.k.a Wolverine played by returning star Hugh Jackman. it basically shows him from an early age in the 1800's and through the starting credits you see him and his brother in wars that occur from the 1800's up in till today. brilliantly shot i think. Wolverines brother Victor brilliantly played by Liev Schreiber has the same abilities as him. both Wolverine and Victor join a small combat army of mutants. the leader of this team is Stryker played by Danny Huston and the team consist of actors Ryan Reynolds, Dominic Monaghan and believe it or not Will I Am from black eyed peas is in this too. he doesn't do a bad job. so this team go and kill people for Stryker but Wolverine isn't happy with doing evil deeds and walks away........... 6 years later and someones out there killing the mutants. Wolverine has been living the past 6 years quietly but unwillingly gets sucked into the battle.this film is really good but it has some flaws such as........ it ends too quickly. the film goes at a fairly slow pace i think. the film should be more explanatory and shown more scenes with the other mutants. i know this film is mostly focused on Wolverine because its his story but i think the other mutants should be in it more. it really should of been on for around two and a half hours i think. that would of bumped my IMDb rating to 9. the other bad thing was the slight cheesiness of it, it wasn't that bad but could of easily been suppressed at post-production and edited it out. if that was taken care of this film would of got a perfect 10 from me. but sadly that isn't what happened.this film should definitely be watched by fans of the other X-men movies and just movie goers that love a good action movie should see this too. its very good on a whole............. 7/10..............j.d Seaton",7,4,5,31 October 2009
Alexander," the most shocking front I've ever seen
","this film is directed by Oliver Stone and we all know that hes made some fantastic films. it stars Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer....... now thats a stellar cast. now with hearing who's directing plus the huge cast you'll think its going to be a movie event of the year.... WRONG !!!! this movie was really bad. i'm usually into similar films like this such as gladiator, kingdom of heaven, 300 and Cleopatra so i'm not criticising this film because of when the film is set. its just the whole flow of the film, it was very boring.i still think Oliver Stone is a brilliant director except for a few blunders like the world trade centre, born on the fourth of July and this film. i hope he makes a change in his directing techniques and makes some classics in the future. watch this film if you dare......... 2/10........j.d Seaton",2,3,4,26 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," brilliant forth instalment
","this was excellent. better than the third part but not as good as the first and second. i think even if they do carry on making more terminator films they will not come close to how good the first two arethere was a lot of things in this film that really stunned me. first of all was the camera angles and the way it would follow someone and move around crash sites. it really is amazing camera work. the action and CGI were through the roof in this. the action scenes were long and very detailed.even though this might sound a little funny but John Conner wasn't my favourite character in this. my favourite was Marcus, he really was the back bone to this film.this is another fantastic addition to the series and should be watched by fans of the other 3 films............ 9.3/10...........j.d Seaton",7,4,6,25 August 2009
The Terminator," a fantastic start to a brilliant series of films
","this film without a doubt is one of the greatest eighties films of all time. its dark, stylish and has some awesome action scenes. especially for the budget the film had.Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fantastic job of acting as the terminator that is sent back through time to kill Sarah conner (Linda Hamilton) in 1984. to kill the leader of the future resistance before he was even born, John Conner. so killing Sarah conner before she becomes pregnant would help Cyberdyne systems in the future in taking over the world. but john conner himself in the future sends a mercenary back to 1984 to protect Sarah Conner and destroy the terminator. so the legend of the future (John Conner) will be born. it really is a very well planned story that kept me on the edge of my seat when i first watched it. as i continue to watch the classic over and over again it gets better and better. the music really shows an awesome eighties vibe. the acting is good. the action is fantastic for its time.if you haven't seen this masterpiece i'd definitely pick up a copy if i were you plus the other movies that continue after this one. it really is a film that will be remembered for probably hundreds of years.James Cameron has really made a fantastic job of this timeless classic. he made an even better job of the second one so be sure to watch it if you haven't.............. 10/10.......j.d Seaton",10,3,4,25 August 2009
Fargo," A strong film, even stronger cast!
","Another winner by the Coen Brothers. Not my favourite of theirs but still a brilliant film. The acting is amazing by Frances Mcdormand, William H.Macy and Steve Buscemi. Love the voice lingo they use in this, its really odd. If thats how they talk in Minnesota then i better go there for a holiday hahaha!!Getting nominated for 7 Oscars which is more than your average film added to the awards roster and only won 2 if i remember correctly. I'm glad Frances Mcdormand 'a Coen regular' won an Oscar for her performance in this. she deserved it. William H. Macy should of won too i think.",10,8,9,12 August 2009
American Pie," a good teen sex flick
","this film is really funny. the cast is good, obviously stifler is the funniest. i bet everyone can agree with me there. from what i heard Seann William Scott who plays stifler got paid next to nothing for this role. this film also stars other young actors such as Jason Biggs, Tara Reid, Michelle Rosenberg, Chris Klein and others. they all do a pretty good job with this. i only gave it a seven because it isn't original and isn't overall that amazing, no matter how funny it is. see this film is porky's for the late 90's.its definitely worth the watch, number 2 is OK too but id stay clear of any after that.......... 7/10.......j.d seaton",10,3,5,10 August 2009
Burn After Reading," very good..... almost brilliant
","the acting in this is remarkable. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, John Malkovich, Frances Mcdormand and Tilda Swinton are flawless in this. directed and produced by the Coen brothers, so knowing all that you all know your in for a treat. the brothers have made better films but this is far from there worst. now for everyone of you that have seen the trailer to this and got the impression that its a laugh a minute film that you can watch with all your friends, its not. yes it is pretty funny but it has a fairly complex story to it. now i hope by saying that i don't give the impression that i'm discrediting the film but the funny parts in the trailer are about the only funny parts in the film. but i didn't want to watch this film for the humour. i wanted to watch it for the big cast in it plus the directors. this film is very well made by them. everyone should see this film .......8/10.....j.d Seaton",10,5,9,12 August 2009
Pitch Black," terrible
","how dare people say this film is good. vin diesel even though he's good in one or two films always finds a way to land himself in terrible roles in terrible films, this film included. there's no way of actually telling you what load of rubbish this film is, also for your knowledge the second one named 'cronicles of riddick' is even worse than this. if they end up making a trilogy to this already terrible franchise i might just take my own life. id avoid this and definitely the second one with every ounce of your beings. vin diesel i think needs a reality check, if he's going to keep starring in films like these then he will have no profession soon. this is really bad, i'm actually being very generous in giving this 2 stars......... 2/10.......j.d seaton",2,2,8,9 August 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Hmm not as good as the first and second
","don't worry people, i do think its still brilliant and carries on the story well. it just didn't have the intelligence like the first two films. we all know its because James Cameron didn't direct this one. still its a brilliant all out action science fiction film that does keep the story fresh.i do think this one is a little more cheesier than the first two films, just in little scenes. nothing major. i gotta say i loved the CGI in this, the graphics were immense and really kept me on the edge of my seat. it really is a very good third instalment that should be watched by allonce again i'll have to say Arnold Schwarzenegger did a very good job as playing the terminator and Nick Stahl (carnivale, sin city) played a good John Conner as well. Clair Danes isn't so bad even though i don't rate her in anything else. Kristanna Loken plays pretty well as the TX machine sent back in time to kill various important people and obviously John Connerall in all this is a brilliant third part and everyone who has seen the first two should watch this one too......... 8.5/10..........j.d Seaton",8,6,9,25 August 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," even better than the first
","now not many sequels surpass there originals but this one did in my eyes and in everyone else's eyes for that matter. this movie has gotta be the greatest science fiction film ever made, if not its very close. i'm so glad the first film is in the top 250 films of all time, i think its around 170. but whats even better is this second instalment of the terminator series is at around number 50 in the top 250..... well done, it deserves it.i'm also really chuffed that this classic won 4 academy awards. goes to show that some action films can grab that many. so Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the terminator which he plays beautifully. this time hes the good guy that has been sent back to the mid nineties by the future John Conner to protect himself as he is only a child in these times. the reason for John sending back the terminator the protect himself is because a very hi tech liquid metal machine posing as a human has been sent back to kill John so the resistance would be shattered in the future. the mother of John, Sarah conner is in this one too who teams up with the terminator and John Conner to kill the liquid metal assassin.the first of these films is brilliant but this one exceeds to the next level and really shows how fantastic this story is and can get for the future filmsamong the cast are Arnold Schwarzenegger (terminator, predator) Linda Hamilton (terminator) Edward Furlong (american history x) and Robert Patrick (cop land, die hard 2) they all play brilliant parts in this fantastic sequelbe sure to watch the first one before watching this because you'll ruin the story. i would recommend anyone to watch this because its not just a science fiction film...... its a well planned out science fiction classic. just look at the top 250 and you'll see why you need to see this.......... 10/10........j.d Seaton",10,8,11,25 August 2009
The Exorcist," why is this rated so good ???
","i don't see the big hype about this film. well i can certainly see this must of scared people to death in the 1970's. its not good though, its a bit sickening but thats about it.there's one or two good things about it and that is obviously that unforgettable musical score and Linda Blair's role as the young girl who is possessed by the devil.i just cant rate it any higher than four because i think this film is less than average. its way too over rated and doesn't deserve all the critic compliments. id advise anyone who hasn't watched this to go and watch it because its just one of them films everyone has to watch sometime in there lives....... 4/10......j.d Seaton",8,3,9,12 August 2009
Independence Day," this film is a failure
","not the worse film of all time by a long shot but no where near a good film. it has a large cast but don't let it fool you. i know it was classed as a big CGI film but if you watch it these days it looks terrible. i think all CGI films of the mid 90's looked bad. don't try and make a film that looks too computerised if they haven't mastered graphics to look good. these days graphics look brilliant. like transformers, dark knight and fantastic four. but in them days it was a disaster.Will Smith got on my nerves in the film, so did Jeff Goldblum. Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell were the only OK people in this feature.i cant really say much more about this film....... 3/10......j.d Seaton",3,6,10,12 August 2009
The Butterfly Effect," 'an amazing film with Ashton Kutcher in it' wow, i really didn't think i'd say that in a sentence.
","Ashton Kutcher has to be one of the worst actors at the moment. either that or he cant choose the right movies to be in. well this is the film and the only film where you'll see Ashton shine. he really does are spectacular job playing a guy with a mental condition that can make him Teleport back to his child hood and change the bad things that happened. in order to Teleport he needs his journals which if he reads a certain part he'll be Teleported to that part in his life. but this gift turns into a nightmare and everything that he loved is slipping away. Amy Smart, another actor i'm not a fan of does a really good job as Ashton's best friend and lover.this film really is powerful and has a lot of heart in it. don't expect your typical Ashton Kutcher garbage because this really is a winner that i think should of been awarded a few Oscars, especially for its staggering original screenplay. the music in this film really goes well with the film and adds power to it. words really couldn't describe how i felt when i watched this for the first time, its a brilliant piece of cinema. be sure to watch the directors cut of the film if you haven't seen this film yet as the ending to the original version isn't as good. i wont spoil it for you. plus stay clear of the sequels to this, there appalling. a masterpiece.............. 10/10............j.d Seaton",10,2,5,14 December 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," a truly wonderful and powerful film
","if you've not watched this film yet then go see it, its a beautiful film. brilliantly crafted by one of my favourite and best directors around 'David Fincher'...... both the leads in this should of won Oscars, especially Brad Pitt. Just seeing him going through the aging process backward in the film is beyond brilliance. Cate Blanchett is very good too as the women Brad Pitts character loves in the film. All of the actors really give it their personnel best in this timeless classic. The film is fairly straight forward even though it is weird, Brad Pitts character was born old and through the years of his life he starts to grow younger and younger. It's just an epic journey through the life of what this man comes across. The film is on for about 3 hours but when I watched it that time went very quick. I do think longer films are so much better than short ones for the fact that they are more descriptive and you can get amazed by the story more. I'm so glad this won 3 Oscars even though it could have won more. It's not Fincher's best work but it's sure a film that won't be forgotten........ 10/10....... j.d seaton",10,14,17,10 August 2009
Donnie Brasco," another classic gangster film that was a little over looked......
","I'm a big gangster film fan, always have and always will. this particular gangster film is not my best but still gets ten stars due to its flawless scenes and the effort made by Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche. i do consider this movie to be a mini masterpiece, its stuns me that the film didn't bring much hype behind it. this is a true story in which a cop (Johnny Depp) goes undercover as alias 'Donnie Brasco' so he can become friends with the mob boss's and infiltrate there schemes and arrest them.this really is a fantastic movie that i'll remember for a long time. its not as good as other gangster masterpieces such as casino, god father, departed, good fellas and so forth. but this film will leave you wanting more gangster action. i haven't seen the directors cut version of this yet unfortunately but hoping to do so soon......... 10/10........j.d Seaton",10,8,11,14 October 2009
Paranormal Activity," Probably the scariest film i've ever seen
","i don't believe in ghost's or demons or anything like that but when i watched this it really Creeped me out. i was actually scared which i never normally get. the only films that came close was The Ring, The Descent, Switchblade Romance and The Mist. this film really overpowered the scare factor over them films by a long shot. even if nothing is happening in the film it somehow makes you very tense due to the thoughts that something incredibly scary will happen. some of the scenes in this film are very disturbing. not in the violent way, in the mental way !!!! it will have you gripped to the edge of your seat.i like that the movie has been shot by a video camera. it adds depth to it and really played a key role in making the film much scarier than it would if the film was shot normally. if you've not seen this film already i'd advise you to watch the original theatrical version over the unrated version. both version are the same but the endings are different. don't get me wrong because both endings are good but the theatrical version is a lot more horrifying than the unrated cut that to be honest dumbs it down at the end. i am a little startled that this film is only rated 7.0 on here. this film really does deserve better. this film basically done what Blair Witch couldn't. i'd rate it as one of the best horror films ever made............ 10/10..............j.d Seaton",10,5,8,14 December 2009
Taken," a former spies powerful search to find his kidnapped daughter
","Liam Neeson is really fantastic in this as a hard man who's daughter (Maggie Grace) gets kidnapped while she's on holiday in Europe. Liam really captures the acting in this brilliantly. with him being an ex spy the interrogation of the men he knows has something to do with the capture of his daughter really have a bad time of it...... torture, painful deaths and some very skillful overkills are among what Liam Neeson's character offers. he really goes all out in the search of his daughter which i think any man would try to do if they were in a similar problem.there really isn't much more to say on this. its fairly straight forward but is very effective. the high points of this movie is the smartness of Neeson's character and also the high octane action that goes with it. everyone should see this awesome movie..........9.6/10",10,5,8,14 October 2009
American Gangster," nothing special
","i have no idea why this film is rated so good. Russell Crowe was really boring which i don't usually say and Denzel Washington wasn't up to much either. i think the reason why iv rated this low is because it doesn't even come close to other gangster films like..... Casino, Godfather films, Scarface, Goodfellas, Departed and Carlito's way.... all these films I've mentioned have a real classic feel and will be remembered. American gangster just isn't good or anything like a classic. i also have no idea why this is rated 8.0 ! there must be something pulling people in with this film, it just didn't pull me in. its a 180 minute bore fest...... 4/10.....j.d Seaton",4,3,4,12 August 2009
The Green Mile," Darabont has done it again
","this film is terrific. it hits you on all angles. it makes you happy, makes you laugh but the sadness is really powerful over everything. the film is also nice and lengthy so you can get sucked in by the story. i'm really annoyed that this masterpiece didn't win any awards, awards seem to repel Frank Darabont. he makes the Shawshank redemption which is at number 1 in the greatest films of all time but didn't receive an award. now he makes this timeless classic which i think is better than Shawshank but yet again no awards !!!!! at least it got 4 nominations, better than nothing.the film is set in the 1930's if i remember correctly. its set around death row and the strange events that happened there. a man convicted of murdering 2 young girls is sentenced to death and is awaiting on death row. death row is named 'the green mile' by the guards that run the place. the man who is convicted is named John Coffey, brilliantly played by Micheal Clarke Duncan that he should of won an Oscar for. the guards include Tom Hanks obviously, David Morse and Barry Pepper showing all that they can act amazingly. John Coffey is basically an innocent man who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. he was in fact trying to save them by healing them because he has supernatural powers. the film is very heart felt and upsetting. it'll hit you in ways you've never felt.Frank Darabont is a fantastic director and if he keeps this up he'll probably be crowned as the best director of our time........ 10/10........j.d Seaton",10,1,3,12 August 2009
The Wrestler," A powerhouse performance from Rourke and wonderfully directed by Aronofsky
","this movie is so powerful and moving that it hit me in ways a lot of other films cease to do. Mickey Rourke (Sin City, Spun, Rumble Fish) really shows a powerhouse performance as Randy The Ram. a wrestler that was considered by a lot of people to be a wrestling legend. a force not to be reckoned with. but Randy The Ram suffers from a heart attack after a match and has to force retirement upon himself. so with him not fighting anymore he finds life very empty and tries to rekindle his relationship with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and makes friends with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) and shows a lot of affection for her. you really feel the loneliness and sorrow for Randy as he tries to live life normally. the ending to this film is extremely powerful and upsetting.Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream, The Fountain, Pi) is one of my favourite directors. he captures this movie brilliantly. the way he shot this film really brings out the gritty atmosphere. it looks almost like a documentary style film, don't let that fool you because it works brilliantly. the film received two Oscar nominations which i'm angry about. first of all the nominations were for Mickey Rourkes flawless acting which he should of won and best supporting actress for Marisa Tomei which i can understand if she didn't win but Mickey should of definitely won. now the really annoying thing is where was the nomination for best picture ??? or best director ??? they should of at least got nominated because this film is amazing (better than Slumdog Millionaire) i do like Slumdog but this film is better. well no point in going on but the academy really overlooked this masterpiece.its awesome that this film is rated very high on IMDb with an 8.3 that places it at 119 in the top 250. the film deserves it. Mickey Rourke is with out a doubt the one and only guy who could of pulled off playing Randy The Ram. its one of the best performances i've seen in a while. i recommend this film to every one because its just a brilliant film that i think everyone will enjoy............. 10/10...........j.d Seaton",10,3,4,31 October 2009
The Waterboy," not good
","adam sandler is probably my worst actor of all time, the only good film he's ever been in is air heads when he wasn't popular. i don't hate this film because i was a young teen when this came out and did find it pretty funny but never thought it was good. adam sandler should do something else besides acting, maybe a tea boy ha ha. i'm sorry adam but you ain't fooling me with your silly acting. he's just trying to copy jim carrey in which jim carrey isn't so great in his silly performances either. i would recommend this film to people who just want to chill out and watch a film with no thoughts put into it. other than that just leave this film on the shelfs at the shops ........3/10.......j.d seaton",3,2,4,9 August 2009
Platoon," pretty good war film
","this film is good it just didn't have the effect of other war films I've seen. Oliver Stone just cant capture it good enough in my eyes. i see this film is brilliant from other opinions I've heard, i'm just sorry i don't feel the same. i have rated it six because it is still a good film that had me kinda intrigued.winning 4 Oscars is a little extreme i think but maybe there wasn't other amazing films out that year. to win one or two id be satisfied but to win 4 is very surprising.the acting was good in this. with stars such as Charlie Sheen, Willem Defoe, Tom Berenger, Keith David and even a small appearance by new comer at the time Johnny Depp.in a nutshell this is a good war film but lacks on what other war classics give. this should be watch by all just for its intense drama through out........ 6/10.........j.d Seaton",10,1,3,26 August 2009
Trainspotting," a funny but extremely dark portrayal of drug addiction in Scotland
","this is an extremely controversial film directed by film favourite Danny Boyle (28 days later, Slumdog millionaire) he really has made a dark masterpiece out of this. he really shows what happens when your addicted to drugs and how your life around you spirals into a deep abyss. the only film that surpass's the dark intensity of drug addiction is Reqiuem for a dream which is a floor less masterpiece directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly.the film has a brilliant opening narrated by Ewan McGregor as Renton 'choose life, choose a job' e.t.c........ as he's running from the police in the streets of Scotland for shop lifting. from there on the film has a brilliant way of showing you the grim look of Scotland and the chilling acting of the junkies in the film. Robert Carlyle (28 weeks later, the 51st state, the beach) is absolutely fantastic as psycho nut case 'Begbie'. there's also good performances from Ewen Bremner (AVP) Kevin McKidd (Rome) and Kelly McDonald (No country for old men) the film really has some memorable scenes and for whoever watches it will remember this for a long time. i'm surprised it got nominated for an Oscar, just seems like a film that the academy would pass over. i'm also glad this film is in the top 250 as it is fantastic. i don't recommend this film for people who like romance films or Hugh Grant ha ha ha. this is a classic.......... 9.9/10..........j.d Seaton",10,1,2,30 October 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," a brilliant action packed addition to the series
","what i love about the die hard series is that there quite lengthy compared to the usual hour and a half action films. die hard and die hard with a vengeance are better than this but this film is ten times better than die hard 2 die harder. die hard 2 was a disappointment but the other three are fantastic. what i love about this one in particular is its not full of killing and massive explosions, its not too over the top. Bruce Willis's role as John Mclane never gets tiresome. you can see hes getting old obviously because Bruce Willis is getting old but it still doesn't stop john from kicking ass and saving the day. Justin long does a pretty good performance but one thing that amazed me in this was Timothy Olyphants performance as the bad guy. Len Wiseman directed this film very well, he had some pretty big shoes to fill because of the other films being directed by John Mctiernan. what you should do is watch the first, third then the forth as a sort of marathon. forget the second one....... 9/10.......j.d Seaton",10,2,2,12 August 2009
Click," its good for an Adam Sandler movie
","i'm sorry but i cant stop terrorising Adam Sandler but he is OK in this. this is a pretty well thought out story with an impressive cast.... Kate Beckinsale, Jonah Hill, Christopher Walken and the Hoff man ha ha ha. they all do a pretty good job in this comedy.Sandler is a terrible actor and he has problems choosing what films to be in because they all end up being bad movies so when i started to watch this i wasn't expecting much. but it was good. not only is it a comedy it has a lot of heart too. the story is sort of complex and the script wasn't put together terribly like other films that Sandler is in.all in all this is a good kids film that adults would really enjoy too, good job eventually Mr Sandler he he he....... 7/10........j.d Seaton",7,1,3,26 August 2009
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," pretty good vampire flick
","this is no Bram Stockers : Dracula but still has a good story and some good acting too. it can be a little slow at times and that could make people want to turn it off but just be patient because its a good filmthere's some good actors in this. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Christian Slater, the up and coming star at that time Kirsten Dunst and believe it or not but Antonio Bandaras also plays an OK part even though hes a terrible actor.the over view on this film by my criticism is it annoyed me because i really liked Tom Cruises character but hes only in half of it. Dunst is really good in this too as a child vampire who goes over the edgeit is a good film but no way near as good as other vampire films such as Bram Stockers, 30 days of night and the blade films......... 6/10........j.d Seaton",6,0,2,25 August 2009
The Ugly Truth," An interesting comedy that was ruined by a very poor ending
","i can clearly say that both males and females can watch this. its not directly aimed at a specific sex. Gerard Butler play's yet another brilliant role and Katherine Heigl gives a pretty good performance but all that is destroyed by the very unfunny and tacky last 20 minutes of the film. apart from that its very funny and had me feeling this was a promising film. i think if its a comedy it should stay at the same level all the way through. not be very funny for an hour then the last 20 minutes to be really unfunny and extremely cheesy. see the last 20 minutes really leaves you disliking the whole film which is disappointing but true.this is a pretty good comedy apart from the abysmal ending and should only be watched on a chilling day. don't consider buying this film, wait till its on television. i can definitely say that you should not take this film seriously and don't try to enjoy the first hour of the movie too much because you'll end up hating the last 20 minutes even more............ 5/10............j.d Seaton",5,8,15,15 December 2009
Born on the Fourth of July," one of the worst war films
","i'm really into war films but this has to be one of the worst. i think Oliver Stone should stay clear of war films. he just doesn't make them well. Platoon isn't a favourite of mine either even though its rated high. Oliver Stone did make Platoon pretty well though but it doesn't even close to Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers.i think Tom Cruise did a half decent job of an injured war veteran that has been rendered to living in a wheel chair. Tom Cruise really is a fantastic actor but i didn't feel for him as much in this.the film is really showing its age too. films like Apocalypse Now still looks absolutely fantastic even today but every time i give born on the fourth of July another try it gets worse.you should watch this film if your a war fan because its not a rubbish film but you will agree with me that its no way as good as other war classicsi really have no idea why this film won 2 academy awards either. there was nothing special that stuck out of the film that made it worthy of two academy awards........ 4/10.......j.d Seaton",4,3,9,26 August 2009
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta.......... spectacular
",this film has been out for a few years now but i never got round to watching it and never really thought it was going to be a good feature anyway. but after watching it a couple of month ago all i keep thinking about is shall i watch it again because its so remarkable. i have now watched it three times in the past couple of month and it just keeps on getting better and better. i actually cant pin point the actual reason why this movie is so god damn amazing but i will say that it pulls you in and never lets go right until the end. the action is quite subtle but brilliantly put together. the story is well thought of and has a lot of originality to it. i really loved both the leads in this (Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving) Hugo Weaving plays one of the greatest mysterious characters in film history. he is sort of portrayed as a hero even though some of the choices he makes through out the film shows you that he isn't as typical good hero but quite evil and menacing. Natalie Portman is also really fantastic in this. you really feel for her character and some of the up hill horrors she faces in this.this movie all round is really brilliant and should be watched by everyone because it has a story that a lot of people could enjoy............ 9.8/10...........j.d Seaton,10,2,7,14 December 2009
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," a brilliant film for every mood
","another Coen classic, once again with it being a Coen film u have the regulars such as John Turturro and John Goodman. the lead is brilliantly acted by George Clooney. John Turturro is equally great and John Goodman is really fantastic in this even though he only has a small part.what i especially loved about this is the journey of it and what these three fugitives on the run bump into on there travels. its a fairly slow laid back film but that doesn't really make the film bad.not the best Coen film but it beats some of there other titles like millers crossing and the man who wasn't there........ 8/10.........j.d Seaton",10,5,5,12 August 2009
