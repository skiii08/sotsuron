First Man," Spectacular movie !
","Damien Chazelle trades in the arts for the sciences with First Man, focusing in on Neil Armstrong's moon landing in this handsome, technically astonishing awards contender. It's a surprising choice for the Whiplash and La La Land director, moving from pacey musical drama into the realm of biopic, scripted by The Post writer Josh Singer rather than Chazelle himself.For the most part, this change is handled extremely well, and Chazelle gets to retain one of his favourite themes - obsession. Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) was near fanatical in his devotion to his impossible mission, and Gosling nails the way this commitment often overwhelmed his emotions. Claire Foy is on equally good form as Janet Armstrong, generally more held together than the volatile Neil, but capable of fearsome fury.If you've seen an Oscar-friendly biopic before, there's not much in First Man that will surprise you, but with strong character work backed by an ensemble of solid performances, that doesn't end up detracting from the experience. Knowing that Armstrong and his crew make it to the moon doesn't make their flights less thrilling or failures less frustrating. Singer's script does place the film in its Cold War context, but smartly avoids jingoismThe flights themselves are spectacular, from a thrumming, intense low-orbit mission in 1961 to the fateful Apollo 11 landing itself. Almost documentary-esque camera work and superlative sound design immerse you in the shuddering cockpits, death never more than one minor mistake away.At a time when the governments of the world feel more insular and backward looking than ever, it's important to be reminded what humankind can achieve when we expand our horizons. First Man may not quite be on a par with Chazelle's previous two masterpieces, but it's still a remarkably well-executed look at an inspiring slice of history.RATING: 4/5",8,96,240,1 September 2018
Justice League," Another underrated masterpiece by our friends from DC
","It's the definition of entertainment. Joss Whedon (Avengers 1 & 2) made about more than half of this film and the script. And seriously, he made a terrific job. Where he failed with his Avengers. I know people will want to kick me in the balls, but Avengers was good. But less good each time you watch it again. It's good to see the Avengers, but the plot feels so empty, and this is where he excels here. The film feels like 4 good hours into 2. And that's not negative. Because you never have one single minute that is boring.The addition of new heroes in Jason Momoa's Aquaman, Ezra Miller's Flash, Vic Stone the Cyborg, Ray Parker I think the name of the actor ? Made the film so fun and entertaining to watch. Steppenwolf as the main villain that appear after like 10 minutes of film is awesome, because they talk to us about his history and what the hell he wanted. Because at first, we don't understand his motive.When Superman show off around half of film, i was so stunned. Man, the way he look Bad CGI ? Not at all ! The CGI is effective. I thought the Cyrborg will look weak with the trailers. He looks as real as the charismatic underrated Joe Morton (His father in the film).See it in theaters, because it's so much quality not only filmmaking but for the special effects. never, i did see something this good and entertaining since Suicide Squad. Easily better than the last DC films, and that include the great Wonder Woman that I love as much as any other fans !",9,2,8,18 November 2017
