First Man," Average at best
","Not a bad film but falls way short of what I'd hoped, good acting carries what I believe to be a very average film at best.",5,4,5,27 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Solid 6
","An enjoyable movie with good acting throughout, maybe my own expectations were heightened given some reviews and it failed to blow me away but a solid 6 rating for me and worth a watch.",6,0,0,22 July 2019
Joker," Very dark
","I found the first hour a real hard watch, to see someone struggling so hard with mental health was a very dark piece of cinema and at times I questioned wether this was entertaining. I got it and I guess for the film to have the impact it did then it needed to go to that dark place. It's brilliantly shot and some amazing acting but I felt coming out of the cinema just bad for people's personal struggles but glad they don't all go to the places Joker did.",7,2,9,13 October 2019
