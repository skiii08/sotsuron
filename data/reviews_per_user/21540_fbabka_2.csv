The New World," emotional poetic feast
","Wow! This is a really beautiful film. Half way through it I contemplated turning it off in fear of it falling into cliché of mindless violence, and this way holding on to the grace it portrayed. But to my surprise it carries it's beauty right to the end. This is a masterpiece of love and adventure; in it's content no piece of it is out of place or lacking necessity. I am just so grateful to have seen this!",10,0,1,28 April 2018
The Equalizer," Awful trash
","This is such a bad movie on so many levels i do not understand the IMDb rating.The violence is very graphic, and thats about it. Can not get more cliché than this movie, it's like Welcome to the Rileys with a whole bunch of retard thrown in.The film is pretty much a definition of cliché, Ex special forces guy living an ordinary life, Corrupt cops that he beats up, ha ha, A young girl caught up with some nasty shite decides to trust this guy to save her, probably because of the way he stares at people.It's just ridiculous, I walked out 2/3 through the movie, it really was that bad, only the second time in my life i've done that. And it's beyond me how the movie got such a high ranking here, the term ignorant masses comes to mind. If you love overdone overplayed clichés, you will love this film. Otherwise give it a miss.",1,20,41,16 January 2015
