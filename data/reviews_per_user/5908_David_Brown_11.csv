Skyfall," Classic Bond
","Lets start out with the bad, I certainly did not like the gay undertone of the film. But except for that, you see a Bond you have not seen in decades, a Bond who is not perfect, who has to find his way into the World (The same with the UK in general), and sad to say, is easily disposed of. The remark about 'One rat left', by Bond is a perfect metaphor for the fact, that Bond stands alone, in a World that needs him more than ever, but does not know it. The other think that is good, is you learn about where he grew up (He did not like it), including the names of his parents. The final piece is the return of Miss Moneypenny (Although quite different). The showdown at 'Shyfall' (Bond's home), and spoilers the death of 'M' were very well done as well. It does leave a lot of questions that can be posed? Is Blofwld and (Or SPECTRE) coming back? Could they actually see his son (He had one from Kissy in 'You Only Live Twice,'). Bond was not the best father, and this was dealt with in the novels not the films. Anyway it is classic Bond and a must see.",10,2,6,24 March 2013
L.A. Confidential," Should have won the Oscar
","There is one thing that most people who have seen LA Confidential can agree on it should have beaten out Titanic as Best Picture of the year. The performances are flawless, obviously Kim Basinger as Lynn Bracken was the Standout ( winning the Oscar), but so was everyone else. The unusual Thing is there is really is only one good guy in the movie which was 'Bud' White ( Russell Crowe), who although a violent person was decent and heroic. I go back to to what Lynn said to Lieutentent Exley ( Guy Pearce). ' you're afraid of Bud because you can't figure out how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics as you do . It makes him dangerous. I see Bud because I want to. I see But because he can't hide the good inside of him. I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who f---s for money. I see Bud because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. I see Bud for all the ways he is different from you.' Spoilers Ahead: Another difference, is he takes bullets for Exley, when the corrupt Captain Dudley Smith ( James Cromwell), tried to kill him. Another difference is Exley shot Smith in the back ( instead of arresting him or at least looking him in the eye, which of course, is cowardly). Smith, is really the worst one of all who wanted to take over the drug trade, and murdered fellow Police Officer Jack Vincennes ( Kevin Spacey), in his own home. Other miserable characters are the deep in the closet, DA, blackmailer Sid Hudgens ( Danny DeVito), and every other character except Bud and Lynn. The ending apparently said it all where the Crooked Smith and the murderous Exley are made out to look like heroes and as Lynn put perfectly ' some men get the world ( Exley), and others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona ( White).'However, I am not so sure that Exley won, because ' And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your soul?' ( Mark: 8:36). I think White was the winner because he was at least able to get to Arizona with Lynn. Is she perfect? No but she does love him, and he was able to not only survive ( unlike Smith and others), but can at least look at himself in the mirror ( unlike Exley). Basically this film is a masterpiece that should have won the Oscar. 10/10 Stars",10,1,2,14 October 2013
The Expendables," A Great Action Film
","I cannot say how much I liked this film, and the main reasons were the humor and Jason Statham. The one liners involving Stallone were priceless, and Lee Christmas (Statham)steals every scene he is in. My favorite was after this abusive guy hits Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) the woman he loves, he beats the you know what out of him and his friends, taking his knife to the basketball, slashing it, and telling Lacy 'Now you know what I do for a living.' (He did not want her to know he was a mercenary. But he knew that although she loved him, in order to have her, he had to come clean). This film after 'Red' is the best pure action film of the 21st Century, and it should be a must see (I want to see 'Expendables 2' and then part 3. 10/10 stars.",10,0,4,22 January 2013
Oblivion," Epic Fail
","This is one of the worst films of Tom Cruise's career ('Tropic Thunder' is his worst). What is so bad is 1: You can spot so many films that it is trying to steal from ('Total Recall' being the most obvious, but 'Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes' (the humans living underground, nuclear warhead and Morgan Freeman's glasses), 'Buck Rodgers' (the suspended animation), 'Independence Day (the way they delivered the nuke),'Top Gun' and even 'Knight And Day' (Cruise on the motorcycle)). 2: It is so predictable, that (spoiler alert) when 'Jack 49' does not kill 'Jack 52', you knew 'Jack 52', would end up with 'Julia' in the end. 3: There is no real evil villain. ex: Is 'Sally' (Melissa Leo) real, a clone, a human, an alien, a computer program, a leader, or what? 4: Too many plot holes. ex: 'Julia' smiled when she saw the Yankee Cap, and yes, Tom Cruise is a big Yankee fan, but why would 'Jack' (Cruise) wear it.? He did not know it was something special to him? They also never explained why they used him as a clone and what happened to the Original 'Jack' and his partner 'Victoria'? 5: Not enough action. The only reasons to watch is the playing of Led Zeppelin, and Olga Kurylenko ('Julia') who is hot to say the least. Basically an epic fail. 2 Stars.",2,1,5,11 August 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Clint Still Has It
","As a big Eastwood ( Gus), and baseball fan, this film is my type of film. What makes it different it was unpredictable, starting with Amy Adams ( Mickey), as his estranged daughter Mickey. She is a lawyer ( in an all male law firm), who goes on a scouting trip with him, because his eyesight is failing, and the Atlanta Braves ( the team he has worked for), do not know if he can do it anymore. They go on the trip to scout a star High School hitter,( Bo Gentry), to determine if the Braves should draft him with the number Two pick in the Draft. Adams is excellent and gives the best performance I ever seen her in. Another treat is Justin Timberlake ( Johnny) a star pitcher who gets injured and becomes a Scout. I have seen Timberlake in a couple of other films ( 'Bad Teacher' and ' In Time'), and he acted like a robot, here he actually showed he has a personality. What I like is how Gus and Mickey really learn about each other ( particularly how Mickey has baseball in her blood, like he does, and only became a Lawyer to please him ( he did not think places like cheap seats and pool rooms were appropriate places for her ( although that is what she likes)). On to the story: Gentry, is an arrogant self-centered creep who treats everyone around him like dirt. There is one scene where he has the peanut man throw him a bag of peanuts, but he refuses to pay. Gus by hearing, and Amy by seeing determine the guy has a hitch in his swing, and has yes, ' Trouble With The Curve.' and Gus recommends not drafting him. However, Phillip Sanderson ( Matthew Lilliard), an arrogant computer geek who does not see the human side of people was Chief Scout for the Braves. Out of disgust, Gus left a motel where he and Mickey were staying and headed back to Atlanta. Mickey then asked the maid ( Norma Alvarez), where he was but she did not know. She was getting ready to leave until she heard a ball hitting a glove and she saw a left-handed Hispanic kid named Rigo Sanchez throwing to his brother Carlos ( they are the maid's kids). She put on the glove and he had him throw to her. He had a power fastball and an even better curve. Mickey then called Pete Klein a top Braves employee and a friend of Gus who requested she go down and scout with him ( John Goodman in a very different and well done performance), and she told him to fly the kid and family up to Atlanta, and pointed out you owe me. He then brought them up, and when she was at the park with the family, Gentry, ( who Gus rejected), was taking batting practice, and she told him to face him. He laughed because he recognized the peanut man who he put down earlier. Needless to say, he struck him out three times ( and made him look pathetic particularly on curves). People were comparing him to Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson and the Braves signed him and fired Sanderson. They wanted Gus to remain but he said 'I will think about it' and Mickey ( on Gus's advice) will represent Rigo, and she quit the law firm. At the end Johnny was outside waiting for Mickey to begin a life together. The final surprise is Eastwood walking away and not dying ( which would have ruined the film). Basically I loved the film 10/10 stars.",10,1,2,26 August 2013
Rocky IV," One Of The Best Sports Films Ever
","This is my favorite Stallone film of them all, the training montage, the music ('Hearts On Fire'), and way that Rocky managed to turn the Pro-Drago (Dolph Lundgren), Russian crowd in his favor. I love the beat down that Rocky and Drago give to each other, and the respect that Rocky gets from Drago, 'He's not human. He's like a piece of iron.' The final quote of the film says it all. 'During this fight, I've seen a lot of changing, in the way you feel about me, and in the way I feel about you. In here, there were two guys killing each other, but I guess that's better than twenty million. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change!'Rocky 4 is an easy 10/10, and his best film.",10,1,2,24 March 2013
Bad Teacher," Laugh A Minute
","This film had me laughing out loud, and I think it deserves 10/10 stars.(Perhaps the BEST comedy since 'The Hangover'). Something else: I really detest Cameron Diaz (Except 'There's Something About Mary'), because generally speaking, she is not hot, nor can she act (As an example: See 'The Sweetest Thing' (Or better yet, DON'T)). But this film is different. Spoilers ahead: The scene at the car wash, with Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) in a wet tee shirt and shorts is certainly worth watching just for itself, and seeing what she does to the nasty Amy Squirrel (Perhaps the best name for a miserable character since Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.'), makes the film worth watching. There is nothing that can be done to Miss Squirrel that she does not deserve: Such as when Elizabeth gives her a spiked apple, and she gets a nasty rash, and when Squirrel has the Locksmith break into her Elizabeth's desk (After dragging it into her office and saying it was hers) and finds evidence that she cheated on a test and Squirrel snitches on her, she is able to turn it around and make people think Squirrel is is a drunk and a sleaze bag, and get her kicked out of the school, and put into a real dangerous school. The funny thing about Squirrel, is how the people closest to her (Her students and Principal Snur (John Michael Higgens)are the only ones to know what a nasty B***H she really is). Squirrel reminds me of a low class version of Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) from 'Working Girl.' whose character was explained perfectly by Tess McGill (Melanie Griffin): 'Look, you, maybe you've got everyone around here fooled with this saint act you have going, but do not ever speak to me again like we don't know what really happened, you got me?' The only difference was in 'Working Girl' only Tess knew, here others knew. Finally, although Elizabeth was a shallow, gold digging, drunk, you certainly like her a lot better than phonies like Parker or Squirrel, because she has a chance of redemption because she does not consider herself better than others, and nor does she pretend she is. Very easy grade of 10/10 Stars.",10,7,14,28 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not For Purists
","I will not go so far as to say this is one of the worst films I ever saw, or even the worst ('Howard The Duck'), but if you are a 'Spider-Man fan, you know that this story is not canon. Lets start here: Spoilers ahead: When Captain Stacy died (Amazing Spider-Man 91), it was after a battle with Doctor Octopus (Doc Ock), not the Lizard as was shown here. In fact, Stacy was much older then Denis Leary in the comic. Next, Gwen despised Spider-Man (Particularly after 91), in fact it led to the multi-armed armed Spider-Man (Peter Parker wanted to lose his powers). The Lizard did not look like the Lizard (No scales), and Norman Osborn is made to look like he was responsible for the death of Peter's parents. Osborn/Green Goblin, is responsible for a lot of things including the death of Gwen in Amazing Spider-Man 121, but not that. Nor was he aware of who was Spider-Man until much later. Here he is basically set up to be like 'Blofeld' from James Bond, whose identity is a mystery until later on. Martin Sheen & Sally Field where far too young to be Aunt May & Uncle Ben, and even why Uncle Ben died (In Amazing Fantasy 15 (The first Spider-Man) it goes to the inability for Pete to collect money from wrestling because the check was made out to Spider-Man). The Special Effects were very good, which prevented me from giving it one or no stars, so I give it a generous 2 stars.",2,2,12,23 April 2013
Here Comes the Boom," The Best Film Of 2012
","I really love Here Comes The Boom (HCTB), and everything about it, in fact it is my favorite film of 2012. That includes the music (Holly, Holy), the script and the characters. I think the standouts were Charice (Malia), former UFC Champion Bas Rutten (Niko), and of course, Music Teacher, Marty Streb (Henry Winkler). The comedy between Niko and Marty was priceless, particularly spoilers: The food fight scene in the Vegas Hotel. There are a lot of dramatic undercurrents throughout the film such as cutbacks in schools, people giving up, and bureaucracy. Perhaps the most interesting performance belonged to Salma Hayak as School Nurse, Bella Flores. If you are a Salma fan (You know she usually plays extremely lusty over the top characters (The ultimate eye candy)). But here (With the exception of the dinner scene), you do not see that Salma. Instead, you see a very dignified woman who really likes 43 year old Biology Teacher, Scott Voss (Kevin James), but not the way he is. Like when she pointed out 'You never ask me out standing up.' Also she is the one who fixes him up when he is hurt, and makes sure he has a rooting section when he has to go fight Dietrich in the Octagon. One important point is, there are some people who think there was no chemistry between Scott and Bella. Trust me there was, it was just very understated, and not overt. Anyone who sees the film, knows Bella was only in scenes that involved Scott, and she always had his back (Even in the beginning when he was still a screw up (Such as they showed in the beginning of the film), but was the basically the only teacher who really wanted to help save Marty's Music Dept). All she wanted was for him to respect her, and even more importantly, himself. One thing about sports films (and HCTB with Ultimate Fighting is without question a sports film) is they are almost never ambiguous, you know exactly how they end. One notable exception was 'The Main Event' with Barbara Streisand as Hillary Kramer and Ryan O'Neal as Eddie Scanlon. What happens to these two after she throws in the towel to end the fight (When he was winning). HCTB offers up an ambiguous ending as well. Major Spoilers ahead: We know by Scott winning the $50,000 in the Octogon, Marty's music program is saved (And he can provide for his wife and the new baby), we know Niko and the other immigrants gain their citizenship, we also know his brother Eric (Gary Valentine)has his marriage saved, and regains the love of his wife and kids after he becomes a Top Chef in a Phillippean restaurant owned by Malia's dad, thus, Malia can focus in on her music and studies, and we know Principal Betcher (Greg Germann), was caught stealing from the school, and will go to jail. But what happens to Scott in the end is not so clear cut. What I think happened, is hinted at in the final two scenes: First, you do not see him back in his Biology Class, he is also shown very well dressed (unlike throughout the rest of the film), when he goes to check in on Marty and the music program, and when he and Bella (Holding hands) go to the Citizenship Ceremony for Niko and the other immigrants. It is almost like Scott is saying goodbye to everyone in his previous life (Except Bella who is going with him). Keep in mind, he sacrificed a lot to make other people's lives better, and instead of going back to teaching (And dealing with many of the same people who really don't care about anyone or anything except themselves (The types who said nothing or even encouraged the shutting down of the music department)), he realized now it is time to move on, and essentially for the first time in years, do Scott (And I think based on his dress and increased self confidence, became successful doing it). Where will he go and what will he do? Wherever and whatever he wants, because he knows with Bella beside him, he will succeed. Basically a great film, and my favorite of 2012. 10/10 Stars",10,1,5,1 March 2013
The Last Samurai," Epic
","This is an outstanding picture, with plenty of action and honor. It goes without saying that the death scene of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) is an absolute must see. What people who do not care for this film fail to realize is that while it is true that dramatic license is taken Spoilers: (Like Cruise learning Japanese), the point behind the entire film is the redemption of Algren, and it is not necessary for him (Along with the rest of the Samurai) to die. In fact, it was necessary for him to do so (To explain how Katsumoto lived to the Emperor, and to show him that he is willing to die for principle). As for the happy ending, after having seen so much death and carnage, there is nothing wrong with Algren finally having to have peace and love in his life.",10,0,0,25 December 2011
In Time," A Waste Of Time
","It amazes me how many people think this film is original. I can think of quite a few films (All better) than this: 'Bonnie Clyde', 'Logan's Run' and Les Miserables' are obvious, but you also see 'The Chase' with Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson (The poor outlaw (Sheen) kidnaps rich daddy's girl (Swanson), and she becomes an outlaw herself), 'V For Vendetta' and even 'Son of Dracula' ( Where Katherine Caldwell (Louise Allbritton) was willing do anything (Including sacrificing her sweetie, Frank Stanley (Robert Paige)), in order to get immortality. This theme was also shown in 'Death Becomes Her' (With Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn & Bruce Willis). That said, there were only three ways to make the film work none of which were the theme this film: 1: A comedy. 2: An action film. 3: Suspense. What was also needed was an enemy that is really evil like Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) in 'The Running Man.' Although Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) was the antagonist of the film, he was not really bad. The father (Phillipe Weis), could have been, but he showed himself to be a quitter (Unlike say, Dalton Voss (Ray Wise), Swanson's evil father in 'The Chase')), which is true like just about everyone else except (Leon (The best one in the film), Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), and of course, Will Sales (Justin Timberlake)). Spoilers: The ending of the film with Timekeeper Jaeger (Collins Pennie), telling everyone to 'Just go home' after Leon dies, is like the poor accepting death throughout the film, basically accepting things the way they are instead of fighting back. I admit just before this film, I watched 'Snow White and The Huntsman', another film that dealt with others dying so a chosen few can live, so I could make a fair comparison. Basically, 'Snow White & the Huntsman' (Although it has a quite different theme and setting), was a superior film. More action, more humor, a much better villain (The Queen (Charlize Theron)), and everything else (Particularly the lack of thought into the environment of the film: The 'Casino Royale' ripoff card game, the bland cop cars, and failure to use proper colors in the movie are just a few). There is one exception: Amanda is hotter than Kristen Stewart 'Snow White'). You get the point, this is not my favorite film, and a waste of time. 2 of 10 stars",2,1,2,4 April 2013
