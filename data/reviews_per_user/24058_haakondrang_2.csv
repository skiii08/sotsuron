The King's Speech," Good movie, with a great cast
","This is a beautiful and well made movie. The director has made the story of King George VI into something more interesting than just 'the story'. The movie starts with George as the duke of York, and follows his way to become king, and his difficulties with the stammering. George finds a therapist, Lionel Logue, who will become more than just a therapist. A true friend.The movie is really well made. The music, the cinematography, the cast, the script etc. is good, and as it should be.Colin Firth in the role as King George VI is really good, and he is completely convincing as a man who struggles with different things, such as his temperament, memories from his childhood and of course: his stammering. The story of King George, and how he defeats this problem with stammering is a touching story to follow. Overall, a good movie, but not the best. 8/10.",8,12,12,4 June 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Don't bother!
","First off, I've always liked the movies of the Coen brothers. But, the brothers completely failed on this one. Did they even try? I never write reviews, but I feel the need to warn fellow movie watchers about this movie. During the screening of this movie, a lot of people quietly left the theater, and very few looked like they were entertained. A terrible and confusing script combined with a weird and unintriguing plot makes this very boring and not worth the watch. My biggest disappointment was how the movie was marketed, with a lot of big actors on the poster and in the preview. Unfortunately, a lot of these actors have small roles in the movie, and some of them doesn't even appear in the movie for more than 20 seconds. All of this makes the movie feel like a movie the brothers made just to get it done, like no one in the production really took this seriously.Stay away!",4,3,7,29 February 2016
