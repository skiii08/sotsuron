The Blair Witch Project," Some supremely chilling moments, but don't expect too much
","After hearing all the (what I now believe to be) hype about this movie, I was very excited to see the preview.  While the movie was very inventive and very creepy at times, it's definitely a case of the whole being *less* than the sum of its parts.The story line, about the recovered video of three college film students lost in the woods while doing a documentary on local supernatural happenings, is inventive and provides plenty of goose-bump inducing moments. The three main actors all do an *excellent* job, and each scene in and of itself is interesting.  However, just because a scene is well done doesn't stop it from being repetitive, and too many scenes rehash something an earlier one has already covered.The video, both hand-held and 16mm show the students increasingly getting on each others nerves as it becomes clear they are lost, and documents their terror each night when they hear unexplained sounds (and eventually more) in the woods around them.  But there's only so many times I want to see them all losing it and yelling at each other.  The strength of the movie is in the eerie nighttime scenes, and we could have used less of daytime bickering and more of what the movie excelled at.  However each of these nighttime scenes didn't quite go far enough.  They were always chilling, but never truly frightening.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because the mystery of what is happening, and what is going to happen is at the heart of this film. Suffice it to say that I was expecting more at the end than I got.  The last scene had me gripping the arms of my chair, absolutely riveted.  And then it ended.  Abruptly.  I think I can appreciate why the film's creators did the ending in the manner they did, but I was left wanting more.In the final analysis, the film doesn't draw together, it doesn't cohere in the way it needs to, and that is why its individual scenes, wonderful in and of themselves, don't quite create as wonderful a movie in total.",7,1,2,14 July 1999
Aliens," A great action film, but not the classic 'Alien' is
","This is one of the best 'edge of your seat' sci-fi action films ever made, yet the original 'Alien' still emerges as the more groundbreaking and daring film.James Cameron was careful to give Ripley a plausible reason to return for another bout with the face-huggers et al (and it's too bad the same attention to plausibility wasn't provided in the next two films.)  By the end of 'Alien', Ripley stood out as being the one character with the smarts we wish all horror movie characters possesssed.  In 'Aliens' she becomes a kick-ass action goddess, which makes for an enjoyable romp yet turns the movie into something more cartoonish than the original.The original had style and atmosphere in spades.  It wasn't afraid to take 45 minutes to really get going, and in that time we really got to know the characters.  There were layers of interaction going on between the Nostromo's crew that are lacking in 'Aliens'.  The marines are more simply drawn, but character isn't really what 'Aliens' is about anyway.  The addition of a prominent child character, normally the death knell to any good horror movie, is handled surprisingly well in 'Aliens', and her relationship with Ripley is genuinely touching.When Dallas, Parker, or Lambert died in the original, there was a visceral impact.  Most of the characters in 'Aliens' are far more expendable, and their deaths don't really have the same 'oomph', not only because they aren't as well-defined, but because the movie is so busy hurtling on to the next whiz-bang action sequence.While the first movie's timing was more predictable for the hard-core horror-movie fan, 'Aliens' is more inventive in keeping us on our toes, and in that way surpasses the original.  However, we know Ripley is the heroine. In 'Alien', we didn't know that, and so the tension was much greater because we didn't have a 'safe' character we could be fairly certain would live.'Alien' was the true innovator, both in style and substance, with it's organic look and feel.  'Aliens' smartly and effectively plays off of it. While not as atmospheric and layered, it's one heck of a ride for even the most jaded moviegoer.",8,0,0,21 June 1999
