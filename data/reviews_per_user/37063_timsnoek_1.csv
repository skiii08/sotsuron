The Ring," Nice compilation of the Japanese versions
","A few weeks ago I saw all 4 of the Japanese Ringu films and was very curious about this American remake. I didn't think the original was 'the most scary movie you've ever seen' - like everybody said, but I really like the concept of the cursed videotape and thought the Japanese did make a great movie. This US-version is a very good remake and also takes some information from one of the sequels. And that was what I missed in the original first movie.
Though the story is just slightly different (e.g. the horses) it's the same idea. Some scenes in the beginning are literally copied from the Japanese and that is wise 'cause the scenes were good as they were. Later scenes obviously had to change because the tape was totally different from the Japanese tape (and not the same as someone here wrote).
They succeeded in creating the same uncomfortable atmosphere by such small things like a fly and a bloody nose. The tension is always under the surface and is not spoiled by loads of special effects. I thought - even though I knew the story - this one gave me more creeps than the original. The scene with the horse on the ferry had my heart pound like crazy! And a big thumbs up for the cast. This is how I like my scary movies. 8/10",8,1,1,16 August 2003
