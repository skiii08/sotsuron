Angels & Demons," Code Cracking Film is not all it's Cracked up to be!
","ANGELS & DEMONS Director: Ron Howard Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 138 Minutes Rating: PG 13Everyone has heard the age old adage 'Lightning never strikes twice.' That's almost doubly true when looking at the work of an author, or indeed a film maker, who has created a piece of work that has set the public's imagination on fire. Whereas SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was in turns terrifying and electrifying, the sequels have been mostly damp squibs. And while there's no denying the box office clout of the more recent STAR WARS films few of even the most die-hard fans would dare claim that the films had as huge an impact as the earlier trilogy.Which brings us neatly to Dan Brown and ANGELS AND DEMONS! Brown's earlier novel THE DA VINCI CODE most definitely set things on fire. It even set itself on fire as right-wing Christians insisted on holding book-burnings! Such draconian measures did little to stem the success of the book and if anything the publicity brought the book even more attention. It was a monumental success and Ron Howard's 2006 film of the same name was equally successful, at least at the box office, earning a colossal three quarters of a billion dollars around the world. It's very difficult to replicate that kind of success.The team behind that global phenomenon return for the highly anticipated ANGELS & DEMONS, which is once again based on the best selling novel of the same name by Dan Brown. Ron Howard directs and Tom Hanks returns as the hero, Harvard Professor, Robert Langdon. In the earlier film Langdon went head to head against the Catholic church and in so doing revealed a closely guarded secret.This time out, however, the tables have been turned somewhat and the Vatican desperately need the help of Langdon because he has discovered evidence of the resurgence of an ancient secret society, which are known as The Illuminati. They are, according to the film, the most powerful underground organisation in history and are a deadly threat to the existence of their most despised enemy, The Catholic Church.When Langdon learns that the clock is ticking on an unstoppable Illuminati plot, he travels to Rome where he joins forces with the beautiful and enigmatic Vittoria Vera, an Italian scientist. They embark on a non-stop, action-packed hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on the planet! Together, Langdon and Vetra, follow the four hundred year old Path of Illumination that marks the Vatican's only hope for survival.ANGELS & DEMONS is guaranteed to be box office gold. If only one in three of the people that saw the earlier film go to see this it will bring in a quarter of a billion dollars and that's not bad! As a movie, however, it doesn't quite live up to expectations. So as code-cracking movie it's a little long and not all it's cracked up to be! Tom Hanks, however, is never less than watchable and the movie meanders along at a relatively enjoyable pace. Not great then but not too bad either.",5,0,1,25 May 2009
The Hangover," The Hangover is Rude, Raucous, Raunchy and Rib-Ticklingly Funny!
","THE HANGOVER Director: Todd Phillips Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 100 Minutes Rating: 16I like my comedies brash and loud. I like to find my self choking on popcorn and shooting Coca-Cola through my nose. I like to laugh out loud and so DUMB & DUMBER (1994) is most definitely my kind of comedy.Because of this I also loved the flood of films starring Frat-Packers Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller and the Wilson's. I laughed my ass off at DODGEBALL (2004), WEDDING CRASHERS (2005) and OLD SCHOOL (2003) which was directed by Todd Phillips.So I had high hopes for THE HANGOVER, the latest film from Phillips, a new comedy about a bachelor party that goes horribly wrong.The basic premise is this: two days before his wedding, Doug and his three buddies drive to Vegas for a blow-out night they're hoping that they'll never forget but when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning with pounding headaches, they realise they've just spent a night they'll never remember! Their posh hotel suite is beyond thrashed with a wee baby in one room and, of all things, a tiger in another. But worse than that the groom is no where to be found.With no clue as to what happened and little time to spare, the trio must attempt to retrace their steps and relive their bad decisions from the night before in order to figure out where things went so drastically wrong and, hopefully, get Doug back to LA in time for his wedding.However, the more they begin to uncover the more they realise just how much trouble they're really in!The film is already a monumental hit in the US, taking in more than $40 million in its opening weekend alone, more than double what was expected. The movie soared on extremely positive word of mouth that started, first as a trickle, from previews and then turned into a torrent as the audience who saw it on Friday and Saturday told their friends who flooded the cinema screens on the Sunday.But is it any good? Hell, yes it is! When the three groomsmen awake they lurch from one hilarious situation to another. It's a wickedly smart film and manages to mix the very lowest of the low-brow comedy to wondrous effect. It's rude, raucous, raunchy and rib-tickling funny. The comedy is brilliantly written, the characters are wonderfully played and the situations, while contrived, are seldom less than hilarious. If you're a fan of the movies listed above then you'll love this!",7,4,6,12 June 2009
Star Trek," Definitely worth the trek, this movie will make stars of its brilliant young cast!
","Star Trek Director: J.J. Abrams Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 126 Minutes Rating: 15AI remember the first time I saw automatic sliding doors, doors that opened when you walked towards them. It was in the new Quinnsworth in Tralee, in the mid 1980's, I was about 10 years old and I thought they were amazing!The only place I had ever seen sliding doors before was on Star Trek, which by the mid 1980's was a decidedly nerdy and old, television show. Fans of the TV series, and there are countless millions of them out there, hold this up as proof of the brilliance of the show and of the show's creator, Gene Rodenberry. They also say that Rodenberry's wireless communications on board the Star Ship Enterprise gave Marty Cooper, a young Star Trek fan that grew up to become a chief engineer at Motorola, the impetus to invent the first ever mobile phone, a claim that Cooper upheld in a recent documentary.When Star Trek first appeared on television way back in 1966, many people doubted Rodenberry's genius. In fact the series wasn't that terribly successful and was cancelled after just three years in 1969. Despite this, in 1976 fans of the series started a letter writing campaign and NASA's original Space Shuttle was named 'Enterprise' after the ship on Star Trek, while scientists from Steven Hawking to Bill Gates are fans.So there's no real doubting the passion and brilliance of the fans. There have been a further 5 series and 10 movies and almost too many books and comics to mention but I, for one, have never been a Trekkie, so it was with some trepidation that I ventured to see the latest Star Trek offering from J.J. Abrams, creator of LOST. Abrams boldly goes where no man has gone before, creating a story which explains the genesis of the original crew – so Kirk, Spock, Scotty and all the rest are back, but as we've never seen them before. The film tells the incredible story of the young crew's maiden voyage on board the most advanced starship ever created: the U.S.S. Enterprise. On a journey filled with action, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits have to find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind.There's a little twist in that the fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of Kirk and Spock who are bitter rivals in this movie. James T. Kirk is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy while Spock was raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. They're Yin and Yang but as fiery instinct clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger.So does it work? I think it does – brilliantly! JJ Abrams has created something as amazing as sliding doors! He honours the original creation while fashioning a film that the movie going masses will also embrace and in the process creates a movie for hard core fans and the general public alike. It's a movie for anyone that likes movies!",6,2,9,10 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's latest is a zany mix of the Good, the Bad and the Nazi!
","Quentin Tarantino quite literally burst onto the scene in 1992 with one of the freshest, nastiest, most brilliant debuts of all time. RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) wowed critics and movie fans alike and revolutionized a whole generation of cinema fans introducing them to Mexican stand-offs, gut wrenching violence and a cinema screen soaked in blood, wrapped in cool dialogue and delivered with the best sound track to hit theatres for years. PULP FICTION (1994) cemented his place in the pop pantheon and while JACKIE BROWN (1997) was genius his later movies have failed to deliver.INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is Tarantino's 6th film and sees him roaring right back at his roots with visceral dialogue, brilliantly violent villains and heroes that blur the lines between the good, the bad and the ugly.It opens in the first year of the German occupation of France, with Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) witnessing the execution of her family at the hand of Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Shosanna narrowly escapes and flees to Paris where she forges a new identity as the owner and operator of a cinema. Elsewhere in Europe, Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) organizes a group of Jewish American soldiers to perform swift, shocking acts of retribution against the Nazi regime, demanding 100 Nazi scalps from each of his squad.Lieutenant Raine's men are blood thirsty killers and hot for revenge, bashing in German brains while simultaneously battering down the doors of the German psyche, becoming a nightmare for the occupying forces who dub them 'The Basterds'. His squad joins forces with German actress and undercover British agent, Bridget Von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), on a mission to take down the leaders of the Third Reich. Fates converge in a cinema, where Shoshanna is poised to carry out a revenge plan of her own at the premiere of a movie starring an unwanted admirer of hers, Frederick Zoller.Employing pulp and propaganda in equal measure INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS weaves together the infamous, oppressed, real, unreal and much larger than life stories of WWII.It's opening title sequence, 'Once Upon a time In Nazi Occupied France', is reminiscent of Leone's Dollar trilogy and his later Once movies. BASTERDS borrows heavily from the brilliant Italian, even using a number of Morricone scores, while he riffs on John Ford's THE SEARCHERS, particularly in the scene where Shosanna escapes from the clutches of the crazy Nazi, Colonel Landa.Christoph Waltz is the best thing about the movie and is a Nazi that you will absolutely love to hate. He steals the pic from Brad Pitt and while it's a little early in the year to talk about Oscar winners, I'd put an early bet on him for Best Supporting Actor.INGLOURIOUS is not, as Lieutenant Aldo Raine suggests in the closing scene, a masterpiece. Not by a long chalk, but even an average Tarantino is far better than the dreck that's usually served in the cinema. Go to this movie, because you'll laugh your ass off and love it. This film might not scale the heights of PULP FICTION, but then few do. And while Tarantino might not be fully back, on the strength of this he's certainly on his way!",6,2,7,24 August 2009
Public Enemies," No where near as hot as HEAT!
","PUBLIC ENEMIES Director: Michael Mann Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 140 Minutes Rating: 15AJohnny Depp and Christian Bale are at the very top of the acting game. Depp has just emerged from one of the biggest blockbuster series of all time, bagging an Oscar nomination along the way for his role as Captain Jack, in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, while Bale is churning out massive movies every other week. Already we've had BATMAN and TERMINATOR and now we have PUBLIC ENEMIES, the latest from Miami VICE creator and all round champion of cops and robbers, Michael Mann, who brought Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino together in HEAT, where they appeared on screen together for the first time.PUBLIC ENEMIES follows John Dillinger, who is played by Depp, and who rocketed to fame over a period of just 14 months, beginning in May 1933. He and his gang blasted across the Midwestern United States stealing an estimated 300,000 during a time when soup kitchen lines stretched around the block. Through a combination of charisma and audacity Dillinger became an enduring American folk hero.Yet the movie never really explains Dillinger's mythical status. We only get glimpses. Early on in the film, in the middle of a heist Dillinger sees some money on a counter and asks 'That your money, Mister?' to a customer who nervously answers 'Yes,' Dillinger then tells the man, 'We're here for the banks money not yours. Put it away!' At another point he takes a female customer prisoner but gives her his coat.We get glimpses of the character and the reasons behind the legend but it's hard to believe that Dillinger was mythologised into a modern day Robin Hood on the evidence of this pic. Sure he gave young ladies his coats, and yes he was handsome but surely a hero needs a little bit extra? Something that sets him apart from the other thugs and low-lifes?Christian Bale is equally unimpressive as FBI agent Melvin Purvis, the film doesn't even hint at the demons that drive men to hunt down other men. Where as HEAT was an insightful look into the lives of cops and robbers and the women that share their lives, PUBLIC ENEMIES is a look at the guns, clothes and cars of the 1930's. If you're looking for a great character driven movie rent HEAT on DVD, if you want to see a pretty film, full of pretty people making a pretty big noise with machine guns then PUBLIC ENEMIES is for you. But I'm afraid it's a little too pretty for me.",5,4,8,7 July 2009
Terminator Salvation," Acting & Story lines as Mechanical as Terminators but Awesome Special Effects
","TERMINATOR SALVATION Director: McG Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 115 Minutes Rating: 12 AWelcome to the summer – the weather is gorgeous and the box-office giants are storming our cinema screens. One of the most highly anticipated films of the year and certainly one of the most talked about is TERMINATOR SALVATION, the fourth film in the Terminator saga which first hit our screens a full quarter of a century ago in THE TERMINATOR (1984). It made monumental stars of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and its director, James Cameron. The first went on to become Governor of California while the other went on to make the biggest box-office smash of all time, TITANIC (1997).TERMINATOR SALVATION arrives in cinemas dragging some serious baggage, courtesy of Christian Bale's infamous, foul mouthed on-set rant in which he eviscerated a lighting technician. If you haven't seen it yet, or rather heard it, you can easily find it on YouTube, and join the upwards of 5 million punters that have tuned in for a listen.The new film arrives without either Schwarzenegger or Cameron – the best things about the first two movies. The third installment in the franchise was pretty poor and didn't perform anywhere near as spectacularly at the box office. Warner Bros' and Sony Pictures' have taken a gamble in handing control of the latest film to McG, who was responsible for the unintentionally hilarious CHARLIE'S ANGELS (2000) and CHARLIE'S ANGLES: FULL THROTTLE (2003) so it had the potential to be a disaster!TERMINATOR SALVATION is set in post-apocalyptic 2018, where John Connor (Christian Bale) is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future that Connor was raised to believe in is altered, in part, by the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.So how does the movie rate against the earlier films? Unfortunately, it never comes close to scaling the heights of THE TERMINATOR (1984) or TERMINATOR 2 (1991) but it's a far better attempt than the dreadful TERMINATOR 3 (2003).While the story lines and much of the acting are as robotic as the machines there's no doubting that the filmmakers have pulled out all the stops when it comes to action sequences, awesome visual effects and technically astounding computer graphics. Hell, you can nearly see how the film cost a reputed $200 million! That being said, if you're hoping for something as brilliant as the first two movies you'll be bitterly disappointed. If, however, you're just looking for a two-hour distraction you'll be pleasantly amused.",5,1,2,2 June 2009
Watchmen," WATCHMEN Delivers Dark Justice
","WATCHMEN, Director: Zack Snyder, Country: USA, Year: 2009, Language: English, Runtime: 163 Minutes, Rating: 18What we got here is a Superhero movie that's closer in tone and content to TAXI DRIVER (1976) than it is to Spiderman, Superman or Batman. It's a dark, brooding, complex, multi-layered mystery adventure set in an alternate 1985, one in which Nixon is back for a third term as President and costumed superheroes are part and parcel of everyday life. The cold war rages and threatens to turn hot. The world is ticking dangerously close to nuclear war. Midnight on the 'Doomsday Clock', which charts the tension between the US and the USSR, signifies Armageddon and the clock reads five minutes to midnight.WATCHMEN is based on the comic book of the same name which was originally published by DC Comics as a 12-comic book series between 1986 and 1987. The 12 parts were subsequently collected into a trade paperback, and quickly became something of a critical smash. It's the only 'graphic novel' to win the prestigious Hugo Award or, indeed, to be named among Time Magazine's '100 Best English Language Novels.'The original Watchmen, however, is near un-filmable, such is its density. So the director, Zack Snyder, who made the wonderful 300 (2006) deserves a lot of credit for making a movie that's damn near as cracking as the comic. Few directors could get away with making a $130 million R rated comic book movie, without any stars, but that is exactly what Snyder achieves. And the film is all the better for it. The plot centers on Rorshach's investigation of the murder of one of his former colleagues. Along the way he uncovers a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. During the course of his investigations, he reconnects with his former crime-fighting pals  a rag-tag group of retired superheroes , only one of whom has true powers, the near-God-like, John Manhattan  and glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future.The film is fantastic, Snyder delivers in spades and the little-known actors are a revelation. Particularly Jackie Earle Haley as the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorsharch. His Noir voice-over is reminiscent of Bickle's in TAXI DRIVER, with words dripping from the screen like scratched treacle. 'The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout 'Save us!' And I'll whisper 'no'.'Classic!",8,1,4,7 March 2009
Knowing," Knowing too little
","KNOWING Director: Alex Proyas Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 120 Minutes Rating: 15AOnce upon a time I ran to see a new Nicolas Cage movie with the enthusiasm of a schoolboy running home but now I drag myself to see his movies with less zest than a schoolboy on his way to school. It's taken a long time but I've fallen out of love with his films.The Coen Brothers' RAISING ARIZONA (1987) is pure genius and Nicolas Cage is damn near the best thing about it. He's fantastic in MOONSTRUCK (1987), even better in WILD AT HEART (1990) and in his Oscar winning role in LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995) he is, quite simply, fantastic. But then he turned his back on the quirky, meaty roles that displayed his undoubted charisma and acting talents to such effect and, instead, plumped for the meaty pay packet. I can't really blame him there. I'd quite like $20 million myself.Sometimes the films worked, like the wonderful THE ROCK (1996) and FACE OFF (1997), but sometimes they did not, like the woeful GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS (2000). It would probably be kinder not to mention THE WICKER MAN (2006) but how do you ignore what may well be the worst movie of all time?Which brings us neatly to KNOWING, is it a movie to run to or a movie to run from? It opens in 1959 in a classroom full of eager students, filling a time capsule, due to be opened in 2009, with their interpretations of the future. One, clearly disturbed, little girl writes a series of seemingly meaningless numbers which, when the capsule is opened, make their way into the hands of Nicolas Cage, via his son, who is now enrolled at the same school.Cage plays an astrophysicist and discovers the numbers may have a meaning, he determines this by looking at the numbers 911 01, drinking a bottle of whisky, and finally figuring out that 911 01, might refer to September 11th, 2001. Ya don't need to be an astrophysicist to figure out where this is going. The numbers predict tragedy and Cage decides he has been 'chosen' to prevent the catastrophic disasters which have been predicted but have yet to occur. That's a lot for one man to take on, but Cage sets about his task with aplomb, tracing the numbers back to the little girl who wrote them and dodging some scary 'whisper people' on the way, as he strives to save the world.KNOWING has some nice ideas, some nice special effects, the sometimes wonderful Nicolas Cage and is directed by Alex Proyas, who made THE CROW (1994), DARK CITY (1998) and, more recently, I ROBOT (2004) but it isn't, unfortunately, one that I would run to see. It's not one to run from either, just pretty middle of the road. Perhaps best to just walk away?",5,3,8,1 April 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Hilarious Look at the Absurdity of War
","'I wanted to prove myself and for my sins, fate taught me a lesson,' says Ewan McGregor's voice over in THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS, invoking the classic Martin Sheen voice over in APOCALYPSE NOW.Both films take a look at the absurdity of war but whereas the latter film focuses on war, GOATS focuses squarely on the absurdity. And, boy, does it focus. The main characters focus on a whole slew of things throughout the film, from George Clooney focusing on clouds in an effort to 'burst' them to Stephen Lang, who plays Brigadier General Dean Hopgood, focusing on a wall before attempting to run straight through it! GOATS is a laugh out loud look at supposedly real life events that are almost too bizarre to believe. A reporter, played by Ewan McGregor, who has been brutally dropped by his girlfriend, discovers a top-secret black-ops wing of the US military when he accompanies an enigmatic Special Forces operator, George Clooney, on a mind bending mission in Iraq. Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a shadowy figure, claims to be part of an experimental U.S. military unit, the New Earth Army, a legion of Warrior Monks, or Jedi's, with unparalleled psychic powers that was put together by General Hopgood under the tutelage of Bill Django (Jeff Bridges).Intrigued by his new acquaintance's far-fetched stories, McGregor impulsively decides to tag along. The pair set off on a mad-cap adventure, eventually tracking Django (Bridges) to a clandestine training camp run by renegade psychic Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey). McGregor becomes trapped in the middle of a grudge match between the forces of Django's New Earth Army and Hooper's personal militia of super soldiers, a match that can only be decided by a liberal dosing of LSD.THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS was inspired by Jon Ronson's non-fiction bestseller of the same name, and is an eye-opening and hilarious exploration of the government's attempts to harness paranormal abilities.The jokes and the pop culture references come thick and fast or maybe, fed on a diet of conspiracy theories, I'm just making connections that aren't even there. Django is surely a reference to the classic spaghetti western of the same name while Clooney's Cassady and Lang's Dean Hopgood have got to be a reference to Neil Cassady's Dean Moriarty character in Jack Kerouac's ON THE ROAD.The funny thing is this – all those old hippy types genuinely thought that a little LSD could change the world, that happiness was available in little tabs. Hell, even Lennon, with his Love In, and his 'Give Peace A Chance' slogan bought into the new cosmic consciousness. So what's to say that the Military didn't buy into it too? And, if they did, then chances are something like this may well have happened.'More of this is true than you would believe,' states the opening epigraph to THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS and fortunately, given the nature of man and the absurdity of war, that's probably the case, which to my mind, at least, makes the movie all the funnier. If the sight of a fully grown man trying to run through a wall is the type of thing that makes you laugh, then GOATS is most definitely for you.And one thing is for sure, whether this film is true or not, it's hard not to laugh at the petty squabbling that is at the root of most arguments and, by extension, most wars. It doesn't take much to see that the problems of people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world, and it's pretty hard not to laugh at people making a big deal of beans. Or maybe I just dropped one too many tabs. Either way I loved the movie.",7,2,3,19 November 2009
District 9," Excellent movie that works on a multitude of levels!
","I'm always delighted when I see Peter Jackson's name above the title of a movie and while he didn't direct DISTRICT 9, the film is as brilliant as if he did. It's technically fantastic and emotionally wrenching, with all the action, imagination and elements that you would expect from a Jackson sci-fi classic.The story centres on Johannesburg, South Africa, where a huge alien ship stalled in the skies way back in 1982. The film begins in a mock documentary fashion with reports suggesting the ship became stranded after a command module separated from the ship and dropped to Earth. The command module, however, couldn't be found and when humans discover a large group of unhealthy and leaderless prawn-like aliens, they house them in a camp, called District 9.The camp quickly turns into a slum with the aliens, who have a taste for cat food and a seemingly low IQ despite their hugely advanced weaponry, competing with one another and swapping alien technology and weapons for cans of cat food. As the years pass, the alien creatures, derogatorily referred to as prawns, are treated like vermin and, in the early years of the 21st Century, a private military contractor, Multinational United, or MNU for short, is placed in charge of relocating the 1.8 million aliens to a new camp outside the city bounds, District 10.Wikus van de Merwe leads the relocation and during a routine search of an alien hut he sprays himself with an alien fluid, becoming infected with a 'virus'. He falls ill and is taken to hospital when his left arm mutates into an alien appendage. Because the advanced alien technology is bio-engineered only aliens can use it, which leads to MNU becoming interested in Wikus. If his mutated arm is capable of firing the weapons then the genetic code locked in his body is potentially worth hundreds of millions or even billions to the military contractor that unlocks it.Wikus goes on the run, takes refuge in District 9 and returns to the hut where he was infected. He partners with an alien called Christopher Johnson, who despite being initially hostile towards Wikus, becomes his only ally.What follows is a fascinating chase movie, part sci-fi but all high tension action as the unlikely new friends form an alliance to get Christopher home and to make Wikus fully human again.DISTRICT 9 works on a multitude of levels. It's a satirical look at racism. It's a hugely enjoyable, blood splattering action flick. It's a fantastic chase film. It's fiendishly well plotted and looks absolutely gorgeous. The mock-umentary style used at the beginning gives an electric and immediate feel to the film. You feel like you're on the run with Wikus and your attitude to the alien 'vermin' changes as his does. And you finish the film with an empathy for the prawns that seemed impossible at the start. The ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel and I, for one, can't wait to see it or any other flick with Peter Jackson's name above the title!",7,2,4,14 September 2009
2012," Predictable Disaster Movie without Characters to care for!
","This is an epic adventure about a natural disaster and the struggle for survival in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, callous politicians and a media interested only in the money shot, personal misery be damned. Sounds like the lot of the all too many flood victims either in New Orleans in 2005 or in Ireland in the last few weeks but it's actually the premise of a new movie, 2012.Roland Emmerich, its director, has brought us a whole slew of apocalyptic movies in the past, including INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996), which I loved, GODZILLA (1998), which I hated and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004), which didn't make much of an impression one way or the other.His latest comes to the theatre with an Oscar-calibre cast, including the always watchable Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover and Amanda Peet and the seldom less than wonderful John Cusack. So I was hoping for a film as laugh out loud enjoyable as INDEPENDENCE DAY, a witty, roller coaster thrill of a movie, with all the visceral spills in all the right places. What I got, unfortunately, was closer to THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, a film which, while by no means as dreadful as GODZILLA, never really scales the heights, happy to just float along, a piece of flotsam and jetsam in the ocean of disaster movies, not good enough to break through the clutter but not bad enough to be remembered for being truly brutal.The basic premise is ridiculous, but that in itself is no bad thing. The Mayan's, apparently, believed the world would end in 2012 and so, as is the way of such films, out comes the dodgy science to explain the apocalypse. The sun's activity is ramping up and a new type of nuclear particle has been formed. The new particles act in a similar manner to microwaves and are heating the earth from within and, as the core heats up, the crust is becoming unstable, leading to a series of earthquakes and tsunamis, which will, eventually, overwhelm the entire planet.Humans, of course, being clever little buggers, have cottoned on to what's happening. Well, some scientists have and a few eccentrics, like the hilarious Woody Harrelson. The scientists are well on the way to building 'ships' with the capacity to save a tiny fraction of the population, along with a number of important art works and a selection of animals. John Cusack, though a series of coincidences that are so wild as to almost beggar belief, finds out about the 'ships' and sets off to rescue his kiddies and his childhood sweetheart, Amanda Peet. As the movie progresses it delivers on what was promised in the trailer, but that's about it. All the best bits are in that, and, while it's fun watching well known landmarks disappear in a puff of smoke, the movie doesn't really have enough, either by way of plot, character, set pieces, or truly outstanding special effects to sustain it for its close to two and a half hour running time.Given the immediacy of global warming and the disastrous floods of recent times, surely a movie like this could have wonderful characters that the audience can empathise with, a horrifying story and amazing special effects? Now wouldn't that be something to see? A movie with characters you genuinely care about while things are falling down and blowing up! Or they could just give the $200 million that this cost to make to the victims of flooding but I suppose that's too unbelievable a story-line for even a movie.",5,0,0,3 December 2009
The Hurt Locker," A Stunningly Visceral Portrait of Modern Warfare
","Director Kathryn Bigelow is best known for POINT BREAK (1991) but THE HURT LOCKER has exploded, in both a literal and figurative sense, and her star will rise on the back of it, as will those of the new, and mostly unknown, faces that star in it.THE HURT LOCKER is a riveting, suspenseful portrait of bomb squad technicians' courage under fire. The movie begins with three members of the Army's elite Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) squad battling insurgents and one another as they search for and disarm a wave of roadside bombs on the streets of Baghdad. While there's no doubting that the protagonists try and make the city a safer place for both Iraqis and Americans alike, the film never once broaches whether Iraq would have been a better place had the Americans stayed at home.Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) of Bravo Company are at the centre of the war. They're part of a small force specifically trained to handle the homemade bombs, or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) that are a deathly, daily threat, accounting for more than half of American deaths and countless thousands of Iraqis.The job is a high-pressure and high-stakes assignment and the team loses its leader on what seems like a routine mission. When Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) cheerfully takes over the team, Sanborn and Eldridge are shocked by what seems like his reckless disregard for military protocol and basic safety measures. As the fiery chaos of Baghdad threatens to engulf them, the men struggle to understand and contain their mercurial new leader long enough for then to make it home alive and in one piece. They have only 38 days left before they get to head home but with each new mission James blurs the line between bravery and bravado, it seems only a matter of time before disaster strikes.Their mission, as it's presented, is clear – protect and save – but it's anything but easy, as the margin of error is zero. The film is a thrilling and heart pounding look at the psychology of bomb technicians and the effects of risk and danger on the human psyche. THE HURT LOCKER is a fictional tale, but inspired by real events. It was written by journalist and screenwriter Mark Boal, who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq.With a visual and emotional intensity that makes the audience feel like it has been transported to the dizzying, 24-hour turmoil of life in the bomb squad, THE HURT LOCKER is both a gripping portrayal of the soldiers' sacrifice and heroism and a layered, probing study of the soul-numbing rigors and potent allure of the modern battlefield. That the movie is a stunningly visceral portrait of modern warfare is undeniable yet its moral ambivalence keeps it from being a truly outstanding film. It's hasn't taken the title of best war film of all time from APOCALYPSE NOW (1979) but maybe we'll have to wait for the end of the Iraqi war before anyone can make a film of such brilliance!",6,1,5,1 September 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers is a brash, loud, boring mess!
","TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN Director: Michael Bay Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 141 Minutes Rating: 12AI remember my Dad bringing me to the cinema to see THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980), I remember the sweets and I remember the bottle of coke but most of all I remember the film. And even though EMPIRE hasn't stood the test of time all that terribly well, I still pop it into the DVD player every now and then for a quick viewing.A decade later I still loved going to the movies. A bunch of us would descend on the cinema still lapping up the sweets and coke but also lapping up tickets for films like GOODFELLAS (1990) or TERMINATOR 2 (1991). I pop both of those into the DVD player too.When TRANSFORMERS (2007) was made it was such a monumental hit that the sequel was green-lit almost immediately and it hit out screens this past weekend. It's an exhausting experience. It's overly long and overly complicated, it's a brash, loud, boring mess. In TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, to give the film its full title, two years have passed since Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf), which is a ridiculous name, and the Autobots saved the human race from the invading Decepticons. Now Sam's preparing for the biggest challenge of his life – leaving home for college. Despite his extreme heroics, the battle of Mission City has become an urban legend believed only by conspiracy theorists. Sam is still an average teenager with everyday anxieties and excitement about heading off into adulthood, separating from his parents and vowing to be faithful to his girlfriend. You'd think as his girlfriend is the stunningly beautiful Megan Fox that this last shouldn't prove too difficult!Any-hoo this leaving of home is something that the Autobots can relate to – the Autobots are the 'good' robots, by the way. Somewhere along the way the bad robots, the Decepticons, raise their heads. They were defeated in the first movie, but are back with a vengeance to crush all life on Earth. What follows is an ugly war between the good and the bad. No prizes for guessing who wins.So did this movie move me? It did. But most definitely not in the way intended, as I sat in the cinema all I could think about were the movies of my youth and how sad it is that films like TRANSFORMERS get made. It has no heart and tries to make up for it with a preponderance of special effects and a thumping score. I really doubt that anyone who sees this movie, whether watching it with their Dad or with their friends will remember it with fondness. And that's pretty sad. And I bet that very few people will pop it into a DVD player in a decade or three and that's pretty sad too.",4,37,80,23 June 2009
