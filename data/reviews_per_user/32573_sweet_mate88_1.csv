The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project Review
","The Blair Witch Project Review - Oliver Sequeira. BWP is a great film shot on a low budget, and this amongst others is why i class it as such a great film. The film is about three young film makers, Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams who set out to find out more about the myth of the Blair Witch and venture to the place in which the supposed being is meant to have once lived. It starts with the trio documenting themselves and preparing for their trip down to Burkettsville in Maryland. As the film progresses the trio begin interviewing locals and ask general questions about the place but as the trio dig deeper and enter the woods to find out the truth for themselves, they find that they are unwelcome and aren't to be taken to too kindly. The intentional Hype surrounding the film brought its fame and i believe its success was largely based upon this, although it must be said that the film is good and is a shining example of how successful independent filmaking can still be.",8,0,1,7 January 2007
