The King's Speech," Enjoyable movie but lacked a little punch
","An enjoyable movie that follows the usual Weinstein indie Oscar route of someone known struggling to overcome character defect. In this case UK royalty in the person of King George V1, who suffered from a fear of public speaking because of a stammer. It concentrates very privately (too privately as a King wanders about London - what would Obama do without his motorcade?) on the Duke of York (future King George) and his unorthodox Aussie speech therapist Lionel Logue with the former Queen Mother and wife to the Duke of York providing the buttress in the middle. The acting is uniformly good from the three principals - Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter, but the film lacks in two key elements. Firstly, Colin Firth is preposterously far too good looking and charismatic to be a convincing underdog who does not want to be King - witness his first meeting with the playboy Duke of Windsor, later Edward V111, where Firth outshines the shorter and younger-looking (sic) Guy Pearce. Secondly, the abdication crisis is rather ducked. I know we are all bored to death with Edward and Wallis, but a little more intimate depiction of what it meant to the Duke and Duchess of York at the time would certainly have helped to lift the film. And it is the acting which takes you with the movie, because the direction is workmanlike (TV mini series?) and the script has to portray the rather stiff and not always interesting mechanics of speech therapy. The difficult decision was whether to go deeply into the psychology of the future King and why he stammered - the film just about gets there in a comfortable sort of way and also nods at the impact of worldwide modern communications on public figures. Yes, it is enjoyable and comforting because of what the King had to face as Head of the nation and empire in its most difficult hour with some wry humour. The audience was full of pensioners with many who could remember the King - a lesson for filmmakers who pander to the dross of slackerdom and comics perhaps?",7,4,6,14 January 2011
The Avengers," One of Best of CGI Comic Book adventures
","After some right duds in the comic franchises lately - eg the latest 'dark' duff knight rubbish and 'Iron Man2'- it is refreshing to see an adventure that keeps you entertained almost throughout. The film revolves around the character Loki partnering some vicious aliens to take over Earth - cue get a group of superheroes together who have starred in their own films to row and fall out, but finally come together to take on the enemy. The action moves along at a pace, the script has some witty moments (the best being the screen operator who turns on his 'Space Invaders' while the Earth is under attack!), Ms Paltrow provides some fleeting eye candy, the CGI is well handled and not too overbearing, and the acting appropriate, eg Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johannson (one note actors) provide the well tuned one note performances required of them. And The Hulk comes out well after two appalling films! Not having seen 'Captain America' and 'Thor' the so-called tessaract did not mean a lot more than the wonder cube does in any other film, eg Transformers, the Fifth Dimension (that dreadful camp Bruce Willis scifi movie). But it provides continuity for teen boys who swallow up every blockbusting comic-based film that comes out, and the movie dashes along to its inevitable conclusion - a huge fight in the middle of New York as the aliens pour out of a black hole!!!! OK but let's not get carried away as if 'Citizen Kane' is about to get a reboot with CGI!!!",7,0,5,4 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Moves along nicely garbage
","Implausible plot and development with some ridiculous devices and chase sequences, but Americans can stand tall as one of their finest cracks the secret of the 'Lost City of Gold' that the conquistadors kept looking for in South and Central America, while all along it was hidden away in the Black Hills of Dakota! And ignored by that humdrum President Calvin Coolidge, and also by Queen Victoria, who had all the clues! Daft and a repeat of the first film, but some sly gags and a swift pace recommends about 15 minutes of this film. But please save us from the US 'redemption' motif of Ed Harris - nasty would-be killer to fame 'wannabe' to heroic sacfricer!!!!!! Ugh! Villains are just plain bad, even if they are US citizens.",2,3,4,27 January 2011
Men in Black 3," A Bit Thin
","Interesting enough as time travel with aliens movie but not really enough good ideas and does not contain much novel material. What a film that is supposed to be about CGI spectacle and strange aliens has to be fancy ar**ed about sixties cultural references - lord only knows. The plot revolves around 'The Terminator', eg Will Smith has to go back in time to prevent the Tommy Lee Jones characte being killed by his arch nemesis Boris, who has escaped top security jail on the Moon! The Boris character is not played by Tim Curry but nevertheless is way over the top but not truly original or menacing enough. Most of it is a conventional 'Let's save the Earth from a Napoleon-complex mega baddie.' And it is terribly thin on spectacle as it arcs its way to the final showdown at Cape Canaveral. Good jokes for adults and an excellent lookalike and soundalike performance by Josh Brolin as the young Tommy Lee Jones, but film wastes 3D - and the price at the Odeon Putney was a total rip off - Â£10!!!!!! Not good enough by half.",5,36,63,30 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Jolly Japes
","Yes, it is Panto season, and there is one on the big screen - this follow up to the rather dragged out first outing for Downey jnr and Law with Guy Ritchie helming. Not bad - a good frenetic, joke-laden, buddy buddy, effects heavy romp that is the norm for today's entertainment. Not heavy on intellect or memory, but watching is enjoyable in the darkened movie theatre. The best bits are undoubtedly the interplay between the two male leads - apparently involving some improv on set - and the worst bits (as in the first movie) the overlong, overdone action sequences, particularly the escape through the woods under fire from some nasty German heavy howitzers (unfortunately the explosive shocks barely travel more than ten yards!!!!). Many minor characters simply are pushed aside when they appear, but Jared Harris puts up a rather good 'professor' as opposed to the usual miscast villains in action movies. OK for the occasional blockbuster, but it all will need rebooting soon, if repetition is not to set in.",5,1,2,13 January 2012
Skyfall," Skyfall means Rosebud!
","Yes, a Bond movie takes the famous 'Citizen Kane' motif, but why? Well, it is a film that just lifts dialogue, action sequences, and tropes from other movies, so why not one of the greatest. Except it is a monstrous cheek and totally unworthy of a Bond tradition. It has action, but it is all rather too familiar (duel on top of train, motorbike chase around Istanbul, chasing along the Underground - yawn,yawn!). It has some jokes, but Roger Moore was better at it. It has wooden acting - Daniel 'one note' Craig. Everybody forgets that Bond has to go from suave seductive charmer to cold blooded killer in an instance - 'Dr No' and Zena Walker. Yes, only Timothy Dalton has come anywhere near Sean Connery. Lines are taken from a range of sources, including 'Buck Rogers in the 25th Century' - 'I've been ready since before you were born (Albert Finney originally considered for the first Bond!). Shots are copied - the final outside scene shows Bond looking over London from the rooftop as its guardian - Batman looking over Gotham City!!! Even 'Revenge of the Jedi' gets a look in with the Rancor Monster being doubled by the Komodo Dragon (which can never be exported by the way)! Plot holes galore and even the shirking of action killing - cue Tube train falling through the floor during rush hour but obviously having no passengers! And what about Javier Bardem locked up like Hannibal Lector? He escapes in an even worse plot hole than Anthony Hopkins! I could go on, but no, the film critics have lost all sense of critical judgment and objectivity - this Bond is only marginally better than the rubbish that was 'Quantum of Solace.' Give the role to Ola Rapace, who looked the part of Bond even though he ended up like poor old Robert Shaw, and the helm to a Swedish director - he might do better!",3,25,51,6 November 2012
The Hangover," Some good surprising laughs
","Another nerds' comedy, another bachelor party in Las Vegas movie,yes, but there are several laugh out loud moments, which carry you over the gross or unfunny draggy parts - and not many comedies of recent times can say that! The set up is different - a conceit that you are looking at the present as three guys try and remember - in time - where the misplaced groom is, having taken rufies by mistake and being unable to recall a thing about a bachelor party that went completely out of line. The acting is not smug or egotistical, eg not like those endlessly unfunny Ferrell, Rogen etc movies, the plot does not go too far out of reality, and the minor characters are not star vehicles for a drop in bit part. It rolls along, but some bits do not work - cue overplayed gay Chinaman, grotesque joke about masturbation with a baby, and leads to a happy ending all round. Heather Graham as a stripper is not given enough to do - did we see more in the cinema, because I saw this on a sanitised Virgin aeroplane? But at $277M gross for an R-rated movie, you have to see it!!!!!",7,1,2,6 January 2010
Iron Man 3," Truly Awful
","'Iron Man 3' has two highlights - Ms Paltrow in an Iron Man suit and seen with awesome red devil eyes. The rest of the movie is rubbish, pathetically attempting to be 'oh so serious' as Tony Stark tries to to work his way out of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from 'Avengers Assemble' action in New York. And doesn't he make a meal ( a very pathetic one ) out of it. By the end Robert Downey Jnr looks bored stiff and we have long lost interest! Again this is one of those blockbusters that has to have a CGI action scene whenever the writers/director thinks the audience is getting bored. The plot is a tired retread of the lunatic mad disappointed scientist (Guy Pierce) trying to bring the USA to its knees with a fake terrorist (amusingly played by Ben Kingsley). While Tony Stark is wandering around the Mid West (like Superman when he lost his powers!) trying to find answers and himself. The plot requires you not to understand who the bad zombie-like 'blow yourself up' terrorists are or what are the limits of their capabilities - because some can be killed and others magically regenerate! Yes, this film is lazily written, putridly directed, and barely acted, with an honourable exception made for Gwyneth Paltrow, who obviously demanded more of a part of the action. Ah well. The final blow out and blow up spectacular finale with umpteen dozen flying metal suits fighting numerous explosive zombies is just sheer and utter c***. And the film made hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office - I despair.",1,2,7,19 March 2014
Stop-Loss," A solid attempt at seeing both sides
","This film is never going to make money in the USA because all films and politicians have to make Amnericans feel good about themselves. This leaves one with the queasy feeling that not all is well - the US might not be doing the best thing by the Iraqis, after all whose country is it? Who invaded whom? And under what pretext? But the film is in favour of all those guys fighting on the ground, but they may be fighting the wrong war in the wrong place - and to conservative US that is not acceptable. So this film divides opinion. 'Hurt Locker' of course portrays US heroes so is going to be far more acceptable. The film has a fifties/forties feel in that a decent man makes one mistake, and becomes a fugitive. Montgomery Clift would have made this then. The film portrays a good man caught by duty and his own feelings of justice - a classic theme - well played by Ryan Phillippe, who does manage to show a good range of emotions, and who doesn't get the comfort of getting the girl into the sack - that was left for real life! The script shows the strain of loyalties and the effects of killing in a war that the West brought down upon a largely civilian population - sounds like Concord and 1776 to me! The supports act well and do not drown out the main action and character. But the film has a problem in that the spur for the action is played down too much - eg Brandon King refusing to be 'stop lossed' - and it does not want to make events too dramatic (something the more visceral 'Hurt Locker' engages). Therefore, the film tends to meander as it tries to be too understated. But it does get in several wry observations about an immigrant army, a creepy, smiling officer class, and promise all politicians. A good effort, but ultimately it gets caught between too many stools. A pity because the acting deserved more recognition than being tarred by the rabid, blind patriotism of Americans who see an anti-war and anti-US film!",6,2,2,5 February 2010
In Bruges," Boring rip off of geyser Tarantino movie
","In January 1993 I sat in a Cambridge cinema and watched an OK movie - not great but OK. It was called 'Reservoir Dogs' and I am still watching rubbish homages cum lazy rip offs of that so-called ground-breaking movie - 'In Bruges' is the latest and it is pretty poor. Yes, the first fifty minutes are OK in a breezy comic sort of way as a couple of hit men try to come to terms with being exiled after a botched job in Bruges. Then it tries to mix serious with comic and completely collapses so that even an excellent Brendan Glesson cannot save. Once again a director who has had praise for his first film makes a turkey but the critics cannot go back on their first impressions - witness the absolute rubbish that Tarantino has been turning out since his debut!!!!!!!!! So Ralph Fiennes, sporting the worst cockney accent since Dick Van Dyke (it's too posh even for mockney), arrives to kill Colin Farrell, spending hours walking around with a gun firing indiscriminately at the tourists with not a policeman in sight!!!! I kid you not! Unbelievable, don't care about the characters, writing that should not grace a ten year old's Nativity Play, and swearing that merely becomes tiresome. Well done, Film Four, thank you for such terrible cr**!!!",2,6,16,5 December 2010
Gravity," OK but badly over-hyped
","The technical achievement of this film is very very good, but as Dr Kermode said (and I do not very often agree with him!)'it is a popcorn movie.' The plot is a peaceful US mission in orbit round the Earth to repair the Hubble telescope becomes imperilled by a dastardly Russian endeavour to destroy one of its evil satellites, which causes a hell of a lot of metal to go at superspeed destroying anything in its orbital path. The film is about the consequences on survivors, except for visuals of Earth from 600 kilometres up - you do not see the blackness of space very often. Thus we have an Indiana Jones-type set up of jeopardy situations occurring every ten minutes or so, which everyone except Sandra Bullock seems to succumb to in deadly graphic circumstances. There are obvious holes in the plot, eg the speed with which Ms Bullock can get out and in of a spacesuit in weightless conditions would leave Gypsy Rose Lee tut tutting; the number of times Ms Bullock's suit hits hard and sharp surfaces on the outside of spacecraft without one tear or snag is absolutely unbelievable; and her ability to read Chinese and Russian from books while piloting escape pods becomes very silly. The so-called profundity in the film is very shallow - when I got home I switched on a 'B' western from the fifties on TV with the well trodden plot of a handful of people surrounded by bloodthirsty Indians, no water and no obvious means of escape except their own ingenuity. Cue dialogue about living and dying - and 'Gravity' is on the same level. In fact, the dialogue was better in the western! The acting is restrained except for George Clooney's turn as comic relief cum sudden sacrificial hero in places. The effects are very good, but cannot really sustain the bare 91 minutes. The 3D is excellent, but did we have to wait a tedious two minutes or so as Ms Bullock's tears drain out into the audience! And as for the two big visual symbols - Ms Bullock curling into the foetal position during weightlessness and her crawling out of the primordial mud for rebirth - were unwanted and too obvious. Go and see it in 3D and wonder, and then watch a movie with a middle.",6,4,6,13 November 2013
Star Trek," Alright, but let's not go overboard
","Wham, bam, actioner with enough nods to those who saw the series first time around. But it's only OK - a CGI fest with cheery reminders of a slightly simpler age, but not all the way, eg Spock's father is not the stuffy, male dominating character we all loved (and the actor was the first Romulan to be encountered by Kirk!). At the end I felt is that all there is? Rather like a Saturday Morning cliffhanger. There are too many references to Star Wars, and Scotty takes ages to appear - oh, that's a good thing, considering he's the light relief! Yes, it works, but no more, no less than Lucas' second Star Wars trilogy. Holes in plot, but it wings along. Holes in Time Travel, but it shoos along faster than Leonard Nimoy's delivery! Sex and Uhura - I had to go out to the loo! Memories - the green sex goddess at the Academy - Jim always did fall for them green irresistibles, along with half the galaxy!!!",5,4,10,14 May 2009
Fury," Derivative War Film That Does Not Really Convince
","A good effort at trying to portray war in its gory, dirty messiness - both in literal and ethical terms. But ultimately it fails on two counts. Firstly, it tries to be an all-embracing depiction of every war there ever was, but it is set in WW2, and it does not fully convince of its historical setting, eg incidents, characterisation, general philosophical observations in the script, and the incompetence of the Wehrmacht reveal a desire for universality rather historical accuracy. So we get soldiers depicted as if they are fighting in Vietnam or Iraq (you know modern liberal hand ringing about atrocities committed by US personnel), and new tropes of war based on YouTube videos from Iraq- officers do not really fight wars (if they do, they look 15 and get killed almost immediately. So why do snipers have orders to take out officers first and make soldiers leaderless? And every soldier must literally depict that they are suffering from PTSD so we get every actor, bar Brad Pitt, twitching his head slightly! The second failure is that the film revels in and perpetuates all the old clichÃ©s of the genre. Yes, the new kid who has to be shown how to fight total war; the war weary vets who have almost descended to an animal state; US GIs fighting almost impossible odds on their own; a couple of scenes with female civilians as 'normal life' is partially reconnected to; characters who have appeared in 95% of previous war films and are so recogniseable; and bits of other better films dragged in because the director/writer does not know how to be original. The latter sees Pitt and La Boeuf reconnect by spouting biblical quotations, just like Peckinpah's 'Ride The High Country' as Randolph Scott and Joel MacRae rediscover their bonds of trust and friendship for the final shoot out. While the decision to stay and fight a probably terminal stand is straight out of 'The Magnificent Seven.' It does portray a very bloody business, and the tank battle with the Tiger is thrilling, but the final battle is sheer Errol Flynn/Clint Eastwood with Veteran Wehrmacht/SS going down in their hundreds before the superstar's automatic weapons! And please why did the film have to pinch the ending of 'All Quiet On The Western Front?' Shame on you! The film should have just got on with telling how it was, not how Hollywood thinks it now is.",5,4,11,6 November 2014
Iron Man 2," After Avatar the Boreathon comes the utterly boring IronMan2!
","Just when I thought it was safe to go back into the cinema, after the dreadfully boring disappointment of 'Avatar,' I go to see something even worse - 'Iron Man 2.' How can Hollywood spend trillions on such product? It is absolutely uninteresting, except for whether Gwyneth Paltrow is wearing her killer heels in some shots but not in others, with little action, appalling script, lax direction, and mindless high tech imagery. We spend over the first hour while Robert Downey jnr calls on all his past personal indiscretions to try and portray a super hero who is falling apart because he is dying - cue, inaudible supposedly smart ass dialogue with characters talking over each other, which is absolutely a killer and not worthy of all that Hollywood has done in the past hundred years!!!!!!!!!!!!! This film stinks, the action is useless, so-called invincible super killer drones (actually robocop lookalikes) are mown down in two seconds flat (Get bored did you, JON?), the characters not worth bothering with, repetitious to the Nth degree, and the villain (Mickey Rourke picking up his pension money)keels over inside a minute! Miss it if you can - luckily I only paid Â£3 or $4.50 so I got away with it. The day before Polling Day in UK and there were some nerds from Uni calling it awesome - I don't recognise my country anymore. No wonder Tony Blair got away with it for so long!",1,41,85,5 May 2010
Argo," Watchable thriller that wants to say something
","Apparently it is historically inaccurate - typical Hollywood then. But it tries to pin blame on US interventions and subventions into other countries' affairs - George Clooney's agenda, which does not get a lot of airing in Hollywood! So give him some credit as Producer for getting it made. He has tried before, but not so commercially successful, thus he has upped the US ra-ra to get people to see it. Unfortunately this has dismissed the Canadians to mere bit players - and they were the ones in Teheran at risk!!!!!! As to the film itself, it works as a satire on Hollywood following trends for success rather than looking for new ideas - late 70s 'Star Wars' rip offs, 2013 Comic Book superheroes! And these sections are very funny. The scenes in Teheran are tense and do work - we do not need everyone doing Princess Di emotional hysterics to show they are feeling!!!!!! The actors trying to look under pressure but keeping the lid on things which seems pretty realistic to me. The direction is pacy, quick cuts etc which works most of the time, but is overdone at the end. The script and the fact that there is a lot of talking is what makes the film work - it is a 1970s style movie and why it succeeds with an older audience. Sit back and immerse yourself, but it will always suffer from historical inaccuracy and bias - we Brits have suffered this for decades from Hollywood! After all who usually plays the villain in US movies?!",7,0,0,29 March 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Abrams' Monumental Ego on show rather than a 'Star Trek' film!
","The film bounds along, and that's all the good news! The film is just an arrogant aside from director JJ Abrams, who thinks he is untouchable and can get away with anything on screen, which includes giving the 'v' to both SciFi fans and 'Star Trek' devotees, as well as producing a lazy action flick in which he has lifted and plagiarised so much it is a positive embarrassment. Some of the CGI and action is OK, but we get a repeat of the spacesuit flying sequence from the first reboot by Abrams - run out of inspiration already? The plot is a repeat of several old Star Treks, except they did it better. Holes are all over the place - the worst when Benedict Cumberbatch manages to hide 72 of his mates inside photon torpedoes rather than revive them from their cryogenic state! Incredible and terrible all in one! The dialogue and characters have already run their course - anymore Spock and Kirk immature spats and I will scream! And as for snogging on the main deck - not even William Shatner's ego was that big! But the major central problem is that the villain is none other than old foe KHAN, played by that well known Asian actor Benedict Cumberbatch. He has no back story except he is a genetically engineered criminal mastermind like Lex Luthor - lazy or what! It would appear that the only villains allowed in Hollywood are English actors and North Koreans - certainly not BRICs! In a cameo, Leonard Nimoy even gives the character his full Asian sub-continent name - Othello can only be played by a black actor but Khan!!!??? No, the original episode on TV had far more heft and intellectual credibility than this sloppy popcorn ( and that's an insult to popcorn!) movie. But there was one moment of originality, bringing in Alice Eve as a scientist, like that original episode, dangled the possibility of a repeat of the brave New World and 'Botany Bay', but instead we find out that in the 23rd century women still wear 1980s black bra and panties! No, being an auteur has responsibilities, Mr Abrams, and you do not take them seriously. God help, Star Wars 7.",3,10,16,5 June 2013
The Notebook," Nice film
","A film that if you look too closely at you can find probably lots of things not to like, but James Garner and Gena Rowlands along with Rachel McAdam keep it going along very smoothly. Underplayed by the director and writer, the schmaltz is kept under control, even though you can guess the end and the plot from early on. It is meant to be a love story with lots of ups and downs, and the ride is worthwhile. The story is told by an old couple looking back (in flashbacks) to an old love affair. Plenty of clichÃ©s, but the parents trying to keep the young lovers - one rich one poor - apart are not over the top, plot twists are just about believable, and the acting envelopes you, except for the really cynical and those who want their bagel and cheese (eg let's have the whole family feel good, and not neglected!). What really saves this film and promotes it above the dross and clichÃ© of others is the firm portrayal of Alzheimers' - Gena Rowlands only remembers herself in short passages, and when she regresses you see the impact on those around, especially her lover. It is cruel and very moving. Don't complain about the ending, it is not real, it is fantasy so that US audiences can have a happy walk out of the cinema. Surely it's obvious to anyone with a tenth of a brain!",8,1,2,5 May 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Romp in Sinbad tradition
","I never thought I would say this - Jerry Bruckheimer and restraint! Yes, the CGI is all in the background and it allows stunts to be beefed up, but not in your face like a Cameron movie - note to James, watch this and learn, less is more! It is a pretty romp, very much in the tradition of Harryhausen-based Sinbad films or even further back to Sabu! As such it does not demand too much, and bounces along like an old friend. OK so there is one too many chase sequences through the crowded marketplace, and the film stops for the plot explanations to occur, but at least there is an attempt at plot and characterisation! Writing is alright, and the direction fairly pacey if startlingly unoriginal. The acting is minimally challenging - English accents all round, old boy, because it is about kings and absolute rulers! No problem with the basis being a video game because most video games are based on old films or stories anyway! Full circle! The plot to save the world because a valuable artefact might get into the wrong hands of an evil old bald guy is pretty standard for action thrillers and fantasy adventures. A pity the film was not shot in sequence, because the most distracting thing is Gemma Arterton's complexion, which ranges from white to freckles to reddish sunburn in no particular order! far more distracting than Crowe's accent in 'Robin Hood!' I don't rate Jake Gyllenhaal as an action hero - he's rather limited and one note - so can we have a bit of heft next time, which means no Sam Worthington as a replacement!!!!!!!!!!!",5,3,6,4 June 2010
Terminator Salvation," No salvation even in loads of CGI
","Another CGI, video game, shoot 'em up, but it's supposed to be the Terminator franchise which is above that sort of thing, or is it? It's been given a 12A but the opening sequence includes an execution by lethal injection! The only tension is whether the character of Marcus is there to defend or kill John Conner - the rest just bowls along without focus, plot, or script, pinching from Transformers, Steve McQueen's motorbike jump in 'The Great Escape' and the smell of napalm in the morning from'Apocalypse Now' amongst others. This is a world where some resistance fighters grub around with tatty trannies,no fuel,little food, and grubby clothing, while the organised resistance fights with head mikes, Apache helicopters, and A10 aircraft, and its pilots wear imitation Gucci! By the way, Skynet Airways does not fly from San Francisco to Bakersfield (where the resistance airforce carries on quite undisturbed), and Marcus' stolen dirty overcoat is flameproof, unlike Arnie's synthetic skin!While the plot where every machine is programmed to kill Conner and Reese on sight, sees the latter locked up in a cell by robots so that he can be rescued by his son! Of course, it's not the machines' fault, it's a rogue human dying of cancer who sets up Judgment Day! Come back Arnie and James Cameron - all is forgiven. The TV series disappeared up its own backside, and this will just trundle along (there are fourteen years still to go before Arnie kills John Conner! While the real disappointment for female fans is the fact that Kate Brewster just moons about as a pregnant earth mother ( presumably Claire Danes took one look at the script and said no with the second word being off!). Good for teenage boys to look and be anaesthetised by violence - you can be thrown around by robots and still walk away with just a scratch!! Please get some help for T5 and T6 and three letter directors ar4e rubbish!",3,1,3,12 June 2009
The Terminator," Hits the spot every time!
","Forget all the timeline rubbish, and just watch a great simple thriller movie. Made before CGI it is all the better for it, as the story and action just follow a human-like robot that cannot be stopped chasing a naive young woman and her human protector. Both the robot and the protector are from the future so scifi is involved. But it is basically an updated chase movie based on the Frankenstein tropes and themes. The added love story works and the darkly lit sex scene does not get spoilt by actressy quibbles about getting kit off! James Cameron keeps the action moving, the script is taut, while Schwartzenegger is incredible for his passivity and menace (forget all the jokes about his acting and prepare to be frightened!). The following Terminator movies can never quite match up to the cheaper original!",Null,1,2,2 November 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Boring remake of a boring original - TV movie really
","Le Carre adaptations are usually boring, portentous, critic drooling wastes of time - this one really lives up to form. The worst sin is that it is in cinemas - like other UK films like 'The Kings Speech' and 'Made in Dagenham' they are nice little TV movies that do not require the big screen and all the whoha. I saw the original TV series with Alec Guinness - boring, prosaic, but of its time and therefore understandable, eg The Cold War was still on. But now? Why? What for? To give the next generation of British thesps (at least we did not get Jim Broadbent or Bill Nighy!) a fattish cheque? What was Ciaran Hinds doing in it, except to provide another 'star' to take attention from whether Colin Firth is the mole or not? Yes, it is the old hoary story of whether there is a mole at the highest echelons of British Secret Service, and retired George Smiley (played by Gary Oldman in exactly the same manner as Alec Guinness - fishy eyed and cold) is the man brought in to find the traitor. Of course the even bigger sin of the original was that they gave Alec Guinnes the Best Actor BAFTA instead of Bernard Hill's monumental and iconic portrayal of Yosser 'Gis a job' Hughes!!!!!!!!!!!!! The script suffers because you do not begin to get near the four main suspicious characters - there is little interaction and even less with Smiley. Maybe, I'm wrong but in the original Guiness/Smiley interviewed all four, didn't he? There are gaping plot holes, the direction is so slow I've watched paint drying quicker, and even the introduction of young male eye candy in Tom Hardy does not help. Overblown, of little interest to young cinema-goers (oldies will nod off), and showing a poor representation of 1973 (looks more like 1961!) this film just meanders to a conclusion which you have no idea how Smiley/Oldman worked out the villain, except he had a flash coat and shagged his wife! Oh well, it's conned a lot of us oldies to go and watch. See David Hare's 'Page Eight' for a rip off setting and Ryan Phillippe in a genuine fairly modern Russian spy traitor thriller.",Null,4,11,6 October 2011
Gettysburg," Heart in right place but far too ponderous
","This film tries to portray why civil war between friends can break out and carry on through the bloodiest of times. It tries, but because Americans cannot see themselves as bad or in any negative light, the film comes to a dead halt, because no-one is to blame for so many deaths and injuries!!!! There are tons of speeches to explain cause and character, but it all becomes too ponderous and portentous, and will not look deeply enough into the soul of America. The South were not to blame because they fought for State's rights, and the North was not to blame because they belatedly were fighting to free the slaves and enforce a union. So who was to blame? The acting is stiff - these are American heroes, so no-one can look bad (the recent TV series 'John Adams' managed it). The battle scenes aren't bad, but it looks too much like a re-enactment - no body parts flying around and disintegrating so again the impact of death and war is softened. A great pity - good intentions and an opportunity to absolve the South drift away into lengthy stilted set pieces. And what About general Meade who barely merits an appearance? Ah well!",5,1,2,21 April 2009
The Adventures of Tintin," Boring and too much Spielberg
","I'm afraid for most of this film I was positively bored and just waiting for the end. Cons - 'charmless' motion capture that does not work (sorry, no I'm not, Andy Serkis, this development in cinema should be stopped now), 3D (what a con because it adds nothing to the film and they charge Â£2 extra at my kino), far too reminiscent of Indiana Jones (Tintin can stand on its own), too long Spielberg sequences (the crane and the pirate fight episodes were interminable), and the referential visuals (even got in 'War of the Worlds!'). So, no, not a good experience. It bounces along in familiar Herge vein at times, but the cartoons were as good if not better. The voices were not bad, but Tintin and Captain Haddock are too nice and schmaltzy American-like, witness the dear old Captain battling drink and alcoholism towards Spielbergian redemption - oh dear, oh dear! And my final rant - Brussels (for US audiences, I suppose) is made up of cockneys and English people! Please, Steven, don't insult Europeans even if you spend a lot of your time insulting Americans!!!!",Null,5,13,2 November 2011
Interstellar," Mr Nolan Snr -you should not have taken your son to see '2001'
","This really is an extremely poor film by any standards. Obviously paid contributors have boosted its score to ridiculous levels! 'Memento, was absolutely brilliant, but Christopher Nolan's films from then on have got worse and worse -a distinct case of the Emperor,s New Clothes! 'Inception' was a sheer disaster with loads of holes in plot and characterisation, but this lacks any interesting plot or characters whatsoever.For a start it is obvious that Nolan went to see '2001 - A Space Odyssey' when he was younger and has been dreaming about remaking it and taking it further. Um, well messrs Clarke and Kubrick made a better job of it! That,s the end of the film written off - don,t pay attention to the very last fifteen minutes it is an embarrassment except for the 'Star Wars' imagery. The main plot is mankind is doomed, and only a mission to outer space through a wormhole can save us. A few films have done this better. There is no money for space exploration apparently, but nobody notices numerous rockets being fired into space! Please! When the mission lands on one of the selected planets the plot comes close to utter stupidity trying to resemble 'Total Recall!' And it does not get any better as we rerun 'Gravity' and '2001' before the Starchild repeat. Plot goes even more haywire then. There is so much mumbo jumbo that one loses interest entirely. The space sequences unfortunately have been trumped by 'Gravity' so the spectacle is empty and ungripping. The actors try but who cares about such an over-hyped, unbelievable piece of twaddle and s.....!A note to mr Nolan jnr - go and watch 'Shane' if you want to make a movie about love and family. Otherwise, give us all a rest from your ill-conceived so-called masterpieces!",1,11,23,12 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Godzilla v Mechagodzilla in spades!
","Del Toro (the director) grew up watching Japanese Monster movies from Toho pictures. His reaction - like everyone else's - was 'Why can't we have more monster action and less human talk?' The child del Toro has grown up, and has made precisely such a film with all the CGI that he can muster. So go expecting to see monsters grappling with giant robots every ten minutes in full glorious colour and technical brilliance. Any other attitude is just being stupid! The story is simple - giant sea monsters are appearing all over the world and wrecking cities. Cue human response is to build giant mechanical monsters driven by two people in bonded mind meld ('the drift'). The fights are a cross between WWF and some vicious swords and rocketry battles! The action is very spectacular and what CGI does best - it beats hands down any of the overlong Zod/Superman face offs in 'Man of Steel.' A pity then that the monsters are not individualised enough, as in Godzilla movies, so that the action is a little muzzy and repetitive. And the real villains look like a rerun of 'Independence Day.' But go turn off brain and enjoy - and have a rest from pathetic attempts at darkness and depth of comic book hero movies!!",7,1,5,17 July 2013
American Hustle," Insufferable boring mess
","There is a minor joke in the first 30 seconds (which goes on for another couple of minutes), then this film proceeds to bore the pants off you with some of the worst acting, direction and scriptwriting you will ever have the misfortune to experience. How the critics have fallen for this I do not know! Or perhaps, I do. Russell (Director) is seen as a mini great, so when he produces absolute rubbish of a script and film, then the critics have to back him or they will seem stupid for over-praising him in the first place. The film is very like 'Goodfellas' ( another pile of sh***) and there the critics had to praise Marty because he is a living God of US film directing. But, no, reputations are only as good as a last film, and this resides in the nether regions of totally awful. Plot - two smart conners - Bale and Adams - are caught by the FBI and turned to con corrupt politicians. Well, there is only evidence of their being mediocrities as conmen - their greatest feat being to con $5000 out of desperate people looking to borrow $50,000! Mad man Cooper plays an FBI agent on speed and falls for Adams as they try to frame Renner et al (New Jersey politicians). It all gets a bit heavy as the MOB appears ( you guessed it - Robert de Niro) and Bale has to con his way out (having spent the middle part of the film invisible!). The acting - Bale doing a bad impression of Quasimodo with back throat heehawing, bent frame, forever pushing up dark glasses, and a bad comb over (convincing no-one he is clever); Adams showing cleavage (not big) to show how men fall for her gets someway with her character, but not far; Cooper overacts and should never be allowed on set again until he has done three silent mime shows in the theatre; Renner an innocent who has too little to do; and Lawrence (seen for the first time by this reviewer) pouts and whines semi-angrily to get yet another Oscar nomination (what a totally limited actress she appears, but with this non-script I'll give her some slack). The script does not bear a nanoseond's consideration - was there a lot of improvisation?- because it simply is a mess - no proper characterisation, lines repeated, terrible voice overs for the thickest of the thick in Iowa presumably, and a plot that hardly holds any interest. Poor, poor, awful rubbish. It is a film that is about conning, and the critics and the Academy and BAFTA have all fallen for the con!!!!!!!",1,12,21,23 January 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Utter braindead derivative rubbish
","If I could give this a minus figure I would do. The well worn story of an amnesiac trained hit-man who is being chased by his own side because he has some secrets in his head. Yes, the plot of TV movie hidden away on US Fiver at three in the morning. But, no, the greatest action trilogy ever made!!!!!!!!! You are kidding me! The action was so repetitive - Bourne puts himself close up to his chasers and then as the technical wizardry of tracking him (my computer takes longer to start up than these people can trace a phone!) gets closer he outwits them, before we have a physical chase involving bikes, cars, and on foot, from which Bourne escapes to catch a plane or train to another fabulous location where the same thing is done all over again. Of course, the camera shakes (oh, so original), and the cutting is manic (oh so original), while Matt Damon out acts IKEA Knightley with B&Q Damon - a face so wooden that makes watching paint dry interesting! A word for Julia Stiles who acts her head off without any reward. The critics have lauded this derivative heap of junk (see Tom Cruise in MI whatever, John Frankenheimer's 'French Connection', or Peter Yates' 'Bullitt') because Paul Greengrass has apparently reinvented the spy movie - I must have missed that as I counted up the clichÃ©s and repeat shots! No, a director who has been praised for serious work on TV cannot be criticised, so like Tarentino, even Scorsese before him, if the critics have given you a huge reputation then they cannot afford to back down and call it cra*. I can, and it is!",1,6,11,13 January 2011
10 Things I Hate About You," Really funny and charming
","A film to see over and over - twice in three days and I still laughed at the jokes (verbal and sight). The writing is sharp, the direction is crisp, the acting fresh and involving, and everyone plays just short of going over the top. Of course, it's based on the Bard's 'Taming of the Shrew', which will never get the feminist vote as one of his greatest plays, but the film does not baulk at a submission scene at the end. And for a US teen movie that is an incredibly brave decision, which pays off handsomely as the two leads play it brilliantly. So funny and vivacious, the plot line has a believably angry Kat facing an off kilter dude in the High School world of barely human weirdos, using the usual clichÃ©s and stereotypes to play off and against. It works far better than the other teen movies of the year - 'Clueless' OK, 'American Pie' lewd if funny and boring, 'She's All That' disappears halfway through its premise. A pity the stars have not quite gone on to great things - Heath Ledger was dragging himself back before his death, but would have been trapped into going over the top after 'The Joker.' They act well and can play different things, eg Julia Stiles. But enough said - buy the DVD and repeat your laughs!!!!",8,0,0,6 March 2010
Oblivion," Cruise Tries but Very Predictable
","Tom Cruise gives it everything, but ultimately cannot make too much of a storyline/writer/director, who is more interested in big sets and oh so clichÃ©d familiar plot, that he has to put big messages out there so the thickest member of the audience can follow a not very complex story. So what is the story? Post-apocalypse Earth, devastated by inter-stellar war, has been abandoned, leaving the odd drone repairman and sidekick to keep huge fusion from water collectors harvesting the last of Earth's resources to be sent after the population who have decamped to Titan (cue reference to '2001' - and they keep coming! Unfortunately Tom's drone repairman character (not to be confused with Wall-E), Jack Harper, suffers from that Hollywood complaint - dreams and memories (despite a memory wipe!)cue 'Total Recall.' The dream involves a sexy young Olga Kuralyenko - so Jack's sidekick, the more robotic Andrea Riseborough, despite kit off antics and lovemaking in the pool in the skies, is on a hiding to nothing! The plot hinges on mysterious creatures called Scavs (the losers in the war) trying to lure Jack down into the depths (cue 'The Time Machine' Morlocks) and attracting a passing space ship with a signal from the shattered Empire State building! Cue all sorts of 'Planet of the Apes' tropes and 'Day After Tomorrow' visuals, where lo and behold out pops Tom's dreamgirl, who refuses to explain herself in case she gives away the plot half an hour too soon! I'll say no more about the plot, except to say I decided to go to the loo in a quiet moment - the sign of a mediocre movie- and came back to find Tom Cruise having a fist fight with Tom Cruise! Um. the obvious reason for knowing that not everything is right with this world from the word 'go' is that after a so-called nuclear war New York is not polluted with radiation, to be followed by the library episode (cue 'Day After Tomorrow') still having dry books after floods and earthquakes - there is also a pinch from 'Zardoz' with a book left for the droneman to read!!!!!!!!!!! I could go on.... So very spectacular, somewhat interesting, but poorly paced, badly written, over designed, derivative, plot holes, and can we please not have such prolonged over-emotional endings/fadeouts (cue the rubbishy ending of 'Skyfall')? Some good acting just about keeps it going.",3,6,12,25 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Boring very poor show
","Great big cast, Oscar winning writers and directors, but mostly a complete bore, that may have looked good on paper, but is really very poor. So George and Brad play against type, but apart from five good laughs there just is no point or relevance in the movie, which belongs to another Cold War era. It is in fact a very lazy reworking of 'Fargo' and it would not have found any daylight as a movie but for the names involved. Tilda Swinton bedding George Clooney is a good gag, if you know her views and politics, and her actual job revealed at the end is a pearler. Come on, George and Brad, you should know a decent script by now, after the utter c*** of Ocean's 12, so get the Coens to work a bit harder, not let them get away with this sort of shoddy, never very convincing, pseudo-fantasy black non-comedy!!!",2,4,10,23 October 2008
Watchmen," So What! And why did bother?
","160 minutes of fairly shallow, CGI-dominated, at times tediously boring, fare that is supposed to be packed with meaning, deep themes, and action-plus. Forget it - this is another comic book adaptation that takes itself and its material far too seriously. Underpinning it is an interesting thought - what happens when superheroes are forced to retire? Answer they miss the buzz of kicking a**, and when they return to it again, it turns them on like sex, and for real sex too! Wow, it's just like a Fellini movie! A more interesting question, which us oldies who remember comics in the fifties before they were banned for some years in the UK as 'penny dreadfuls,' is why didn't Superman defeat Hitler and Japan in WW2? The question is asked in this film - Nixon (plus false nose) asks Doc Manhattan (Superman) to intervene in Vietnam, and he says 'yes', mopping up the NVA and Viet Cong in a week, with no qualms or explanation! But later on, after a crisis of conscience, he can't be bothered to stop a nuclear holocaust! And lo, the prolonged tedious tortured path to get from one point to the other - supposedly deep and questioning and meaningful - is absolutely boring and extremely shallow. This is a graphic novel/Hollywood movie not 'King Lear.' So any claims of deep interesting material in this film are rubbish. And as for characterisation, feeble and been done many times before in other shoddy comic book adaptations. For example sexy Silk Spectre 2 (doubling for Lois Lane and looking like a young Xena the Warrior) is upset because the blue genie (Doc Manhattan) - and, yes, he repeats a scene from the pre-war 'Arabian Nights' movie when he reaches inside a building for a normal-sized superhero - splits off a couple of replicants of himself when he is busy with nuclear fusion to pleasure her. So she moves on to the Batman substitute, who is more human if rather nerdy (cue the younger male audience for Rogen, Stiller, Wilson rubbish movies and their female fantasies) for comfort and one of the more believable sex scenes of recent times (it's been dubbed porno of course by the serious minded politically correct comic book moviegoer). And Malin Ackerman is worth an ogle if a little under-cantilevered with her kit off! Plot is complicated (read other comments if you want a summary), and not helped by hurried and garbled explanations of what is going on, particularly at the end, which is awful in its' disdain for the audience - almost like 'you got enough action and sex, didn't you, so who cares if the plotting is a bit dodgy and you missed bits.' The alternative 1985 is rushed and not quite believable. The nuclear bust up again is too rushed and does not work. Take it from me, I lived through the Cuban Missile crisis, and it felt somewhat more real than a Spitting Image Richard Nixon saying 'Go to DefCon 1.' The character of Rorschach is just an excuse for some ultraviolent, but gradually dimishing return, action that graphic novels seem to be steeped in - but they are drawings and not real! So when is Hollywood going to do animated graphic novels like anime, rather than spending vast fortunes on these very ordinary pictures that just use CGI to make up for quality and illustrate fairly minor points in the storyline? And it has to be said Americans will not like this portrayal of themselves in the Obama-era. That is a past that resides in the Seventies and Eighties rather than the hopeful end of the naughties which features Guantanamo Bay, Extreme Rendition, and bringing freedom and democracy to 100,000 dead Iraqis! Please can we have some well written and profoundly observed movies about now and the past that are not based on the shallow inanities of comic books. Leave that to TV and shows like Ben10 and the Justice League of America!",3,3,7,11 March 2009
Man of Steel," Audiences are now Zombies - welcome General Zod our saviour!
","Yet another big budget (for CGI anyway) film based on a comic book hero - only this time it is a remake of a remake - the quintessential 'Superman.' Forget 'Man of Steel' it is a Superman movie out to get your hard earned money with all the usual tricks of an obscenely big budget actioner, eg Some poor over-acting, Christopher Nolanesque 'darkness', CGI effects every ten seconds that bore you rigid within a minute, plot holes too numerous to mention, riffs on every movie you can think of (including 'The Hulk' and 'John Carter'), false over-emotional climaxes every ten minutes, production design that you have seen a thousand times before (this time 'Prometheus') and a dreadfully, dreadfully, hollow script that should have been flushed down the toilet long ago. Oh, and by the way, the Director Zack Snyder should stick to the 300 franchise (the trailer for the sequel was shown prior to this movie!).So, any pluses - Henry Cavill for sure in the lead, and Kevin Costner imitating Glenn Ford as Jonathan Kent. There is a good joke about the 'S' on the suit, and a withering comment on drone warfare right at the end, plus, I suppose, a narrative arc that flips back and fore.But on the minus side, we get Jor-El (Russell Crowe) fighting Zod, flying about on a 'Avatar' lookalike bird, and the destruction of Krypton (eg Vulcan) being more of an afterthought rather than a devastating centrepiece. While Lois Lane manages to track down who Superman is in three minutes (or is it two?), there is utter confusion about where the Codex is (don't ask, it's a riff on Indiana Jones 4) - in Superman's genes, or an old scout ship from 18,000 years ago that turns into a Genesis Chamber! ? And don't scream in the middle of the cinema, when the bad Kryptons try to drill out the centre of the Earth - do scriptwriters in Hollywood have no new ideas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!? Enough said, sit back and let your eardrums get blasted and stuff your popcorn up your a*** - because that's how you are viewed by today's movie makers.",3,17,34,18 June 2013
American Psycho," A Total Mess
","This film does not know what it wants to be - a social satire on the greedy, yuppie Reagan era, a grand guignol bloodbath, a psychological study of a serial mass killer, or even soft porn distasteful misogonist exploitation? Frankly, none of it works, and hence the film is a mess and a total waste of time. There is some satire on the Wall Street arrogant yuppies, but they never do any work! Competing over business cards may have looked good on paper but fails to light up the screen. A bloodbath - some, but not full on to really work. Psychological study of Christian Bale as a mass murderer - no, Bale murders any real belief in the character. Soft porn - give me a break with a woman director she is more interested in not giving any teen boy the chance to abuse himself while he watches! Not a nipple in sight and the worst girl on girl action you are ever likely to see! What with a terrible voice over, shoddy script, poor acting, dreadful direction - sorry if an important novel is ruined. And, please, do not remake!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2,1,4,20 September 2013
The White Ribbon," Creeping Unease but too self-consciously art-house
","Well made, restrained, mysterious, flouts conventional storytelling, but also too self consciously art-house and arrogantly authorial and intellectual. It is a film about a small village in preWW1 Germany where strange accidents (like child torture and barns being burnt) begin to occur. Who is responsible and why? The answer is never given, but hints of dark forces rising because of the nature of the society that the villagers are living in are given full rein. This leads to a growing sense of unease on screen and off screen amongst the audience.I do feel it is about the fin de siecle of pre war comfort (but how comfortable was it really in an almost feudal society that tolerates child abuse and sexual exploitation?) leading to Prussian aggressive adventurism, so to the First World War, and, then more chillingly, the children who are to become the generation of Nazism with all its attendant horrors.There are signposts to the Doctor with the bad shoulder (Kaiser Wilhelm) and the Baron, whose wife cannot tolerate him or his lifestyle (Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and his wife Elizabeth), which show the absolutism of empire and sleepwalking to war, but these seem minor compared to the horror of the following generations' actions which are caused by the repression et al of a society created by the older generation. The key moment is when the quotation from the Bible about sin of the fathers following down to the third or fourth generations is shown near the end - this is the central theme to the film.But there is too much arch film making in a sort of fifties/sixties art house Bergfman/Antonioni homage to really leave you satisfied that you have watched a great piece of cinema. 'Cache' worked because it was not trying to be too clever - here the director is playing with you from olympian heights at times and it detracts from the well worked air and sense of menace which he creates brilliantly at times.",7,0,1,24 April 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Familiar Franchise Fare, but Flashily Ordinary
","Rogue Nation delivers set piece action and thrills to satisfy most of the intended audience, but basically they are rather hackneyed and fourth rate. They do not make up for the acres of empty space at the heart of the movie's plot and characterisation. Let alone the script and direction which are utterly predictable and gone through strictly by numbers. A just about good enough film that does not try too hard. After all, predictability is the key to a franchise success, or a dreadful bore to the uncommitted and unenthusiastic - there really is only an hour's TV episode material here. True, it carries it all off with gloss and panache, but then the Chinese backers would want to be sure on a return for their investment! Tom Cruise (looking older) gives his all-American, polished, believable performance we come to expect in his action genre films, while the support cast do their thing like moving wallpaper. Rebecca Ferguson flaunting her slightly heavy thighs at almost every opportunity is an interesting choice as the femme fatale (good or bad?), but Swedish/UK cool does not add a lot to a very clichÃ©d role. Sean Harris (unrecognisable) tries to method act the chief villain and still manages to make no impression. Just like Philip Seymour Hoffman in an earlier MI, you have to chew a bit of scenery rather than stay cold at a very great distance! Can we have a franchise-free (particularly comic-based ones) and Matt Damon not lost in space year of movies, please, and get back to some straightforward, effects-free entertainment that Hollywood used to do so well!?",3,20,44,31 August 2015
The Lego Movie," An Enjoyable Delight - but a little over-hyped
","A very refreshing and enjoyable film with lots of clever use of animation and humour for both young and old. But I am of the generation that never built Lego - only bought it for the next two generations. It is cleverly done as a movie, and the twist twenty minutes from the end puts the rest of Hollywood's wunderkind to shame! The characters are very predictable, but put themselves down with a distinct lack of ego (but then plastic models can, can't they?). The plot is yet another riff on George Lucas with a 'Metropolis' like society needing a Chosen One to release them to freedom - only the one chosen is not really of heroic stature. But the journey takes him to his destiny - freeing everyone to build their own models and not just what the packet tells them to! It runs out of steam after an hour before the big finish kicks in - plastic model cartoons can only go so far! And the animation can only go so far before iteration (like live action Hollywood!), but the biggest product placement in movies works well enough for long enough long enough to give a great deal of pleasure.",6,3,7,5 March 2014
Pearl Harbor," Good action, but oh the rest!!!
","You do see the money up on the screen - the attack on Pearl Harbour has some of the best CGI on screen, whatever the moaners say. It does not flinch from showing people dying - yes, Americans getting killed and getting their arses whipped! Extremely unusual on screen... The background as to why the actual Japanese attack is a little blurred - can't have any excuses for anyone wanting to attack USA, can we??? So the middle of the picture is pretty good - again don't listen to the moaners that Affleck and Hartnett don't play the real US airman who got in the air that day. After all the first officer on the Titanic blew his brains out on screen (sic?) and Matthew McConaughey rescued the Enigma codes in 'U571' for the US when in fact it was British sailors, and didn't Mel Gibson win the Vietnam War?!!! Yes, Hollywood has always played fast and loose with historical fact, so get over it. Mind I would have thought you might have seen a few more Yanks in the Eagle Squadron, and the Battle of Britain was over by 1941! But of the rest, the script is shoddy soap opera, the direction overblown, the acting with a couple of standouts poor, the plot derivative from other better movies (Kate Beckinsale on the beach in a two piece in Hawaii snogging!), and Ben Affleck's Clint Eastwood-like shoot out with the japs cringeworthy. Still one of the stars doesn't make it to the final shot which is unusual these days, although he comes home in a wooden box (Iraq, geddit!). And nowhere is there a hint that Roosevelt and Marshall may have sacrificed Pearl to get US into the war!",3,1,3,9 December 2009
Tropic Thunder," Unbelievably unfunny!
","There's a scene in this film about how to act a moron, but not be moronic. Unfortunately this film is moronically bad, and anybody who thinks it's funny must be a m.... Filled with so-so stars of modern cinema, it is an attempt to be a satire on Hollywood and its maleness/action movies along with a cheap way of getting laughs out of taking the rise out of Platoon, Rambo etc. Tucked away of course is the irony that Hollywood cannot sell an Iraq war movie, but can make a fortune out of a comedy about the tragedy of Vietnam - got that teen redneck dudes! It just is not funny, just a series of apparently good jokes (how Hollywood portrays a black man) totally and utterly stretched beyond any sense of humour. And in doing so, merely repeats the clichÃÂ©s of martial Americanness - Masters of the Universe - where even liars about their army service get good ol US salvation! And when are the likes of Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Ferrell, Carell, Vaughn, Rogen going to get off our screens? All we get are so-called slacker nerds triumphing at love, war, drugs and all that jazz - the complete and ultimate male fantasies. Of course they do it all with that post-modernist, deconstuctionist, ironic flavour, but, unlike their forebears - Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jack Lemmon - they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters! Please can real gag writers get back to the big screen.",1,134,315,19 September 2008
The Duchess," Princess Diana did not live in the 18th century!
","Another attempt to put real British history and characters on the screen for US audiences, only it does not contain much history - it was a really exciting period politically with loads of REAL characters far more interesting than the Duchess of Devonshire - and is just a tired retelling of parallels with the Charles/Diana/Camilla menage-a-trois done out with a glossy video of the best of UK country houses. Keira Knightley, over-exposed, cannot live up to the demands of being centre stage but does her best. Portrayal of aristocrats in 18th century is laughable, and, as for 'all girls together in a man's world, while I shag your husband'- what a total joke!Let Diana rest in peace!",3,22,44,14 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bourne again Bond
","From the ridiculous opening sequence - a chase (was it cars up in the mountains?) that is jump cut every 50 milliseconds so that you cannot follow or appreciate anything to the dreadfully arch assassination sequence at the end('M' even appears inside Russia to co-ordinate matters!), this Bond movie trails along on the coat tails of the so-called new paradigm of spy/thrillers - the Bourne trilogy. Just as they were alright, so 'Quantum' is alright. But no more. Following boringly in the trail of 'The Dark Knight' the hero is dark and moody, on the edge, which means you get a dreadfully one paced, one sour look performance from Daniel Craig, only relieved by one good gag about Dame Judi! The film requires a memory of Casino Royale to fully follow, and a longing for Goldfinger when the golden girl scene is repeated, although presumably not by the actress playing Strawberry Fields, a gag I only got from the cast list! The film is one long chase/action video game, with subpar villains and a subplot with an Oedipus complex - just let 'M' be a boss, please. This is not James Bond for the noughties - it is a second rate derivative credit swap. Next time make it without the second unit crew!!!",4,3,5,16 November 2008
District 9," Unoriginal shoot em up for intellectuals!
","The beginning is just a rerun of 'Alien Nation' - aliens with better weapons get forced to be subservient to stupid humans! The middle is 'The Fly' and the end is just about every other shoot em up you have ever seen. There are so many plot holes, it really is ridiculous. Two of the worst - eventually villainous multi-national company tries to capture the lead character turning into an alien by triangulating his mobile phone, only we won't pick him up straightaway, we'll leave it to the morning - yes, you guessed he's gone!!!! The second, every time the armed MNC's thick, boer, security heavies try to enter the town holding 1.8 million aliens and some very nasty Nigerian gangsters, they only take about two helicopters' worth of troops to dominate the area!!!! Yes, poor material that has got the intellectuals in thrall because it's set in South Africa, and has all that apartheid referential nonsense (actually it's about SA xenophobia at Zimbabweans, but let that pass) with most of the heavies, jarpie white SA's who get shot to pieces - cheer, cheer. What a lot better for the film if it had been set in Jerusalem, Baghdad or even Selma, Alabama, then it might have really ruffled some stereotypes and attitudes!!! By the way it took twenty years to process enough fuel to get the scout ship started, but it took a kid alien five minutes to wake up the mother ship (Thousand times bigger) and get it to move and haul up the damaged scout ship!!! Yes, there's that many holes!!!! Totally overpraised!!",3,6,15,21 October 2009
Mamma Mia!," Sorry but where have all your critical faculties gone?
","Having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the DVD for my wife for Xmas, I had to watch it. I did not expect much, which usually means I get more than I bargained for. But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! Her grand piece - 'The Winner Takes It All' - is Meryl at the Met! Note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. But what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the UK and the best selling DVD to boot? Blair, Campbell and New Labour really have reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties anyone???",1,41,70,2 January 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Boring and repetitious
","A visual treat, but it has all been done and seen before. The story is overlong and forced with, apparently, scenes from LOTR dragged in as subplots. How many Orcs have to die (saw the trailer for 'Lone Survivor' in that one just substitute Taliban for Orcs!!!!!!!!!!!!) and how many ways can Legoslas cut them down? It seems he can bow and arrow them from two Feet! The acting is okay, but the actors look bored silly. The script goes on and on over the same lines - how you can kill a good quest! The dwarfs and elves are like background wallpaper instead of real frontline characters, while Stephen Fry (playing basically Charles the First) is only slightly comical. And we have three more hours to go after the hours of boredom with 'Lord of the Rings!' Oh dear, can I stay awake in anticipation - the trailer for 'The Lego Movie' looked more interesting!",3,4,7,7 January 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Some entertainment, but totally repetitive
","A group of fantasy figures go on a quest across a dangerous landscape to a great high mountain, meeting and fighting a range of fantastical creatures on the way. LOTR - 'Fellowship of the Ring?', um, no, 'The Hobbit - Unexpected Journey' or should that be LOTR1 a total repeat of LOTR1V? Yes, this time it is Dwarfs (guided by Gandalf) in search of their lost homeland, who pick up Bilbo Baggins on the way. What happens? Lots of CGI fighting (at least two too many Orc encounters, a ridiculous video game of chopping off/killing loads of Goblins, who do not seem to have done anyone any harm, and a trio of Trolls masquerading as the Three Stooges), lots of declamatory mock-medieaval honour statements of courage and righteousness, and endless repetitive helicopter shots of New Zealand's Southern Alps showing the group trudging to the destination ( and, boy, does the trudge go on slowly). Many have called the film too long - it is - but not because of the forty minute introduction, but because of totally unbelievable lengthy CGI sequences. I will go potty if the heroes fall miles through caverns again without a scratch. No, it is no longer breathtaking and awesome, but mere repetition because the script is so utterly unoriginal and predictable. And the other thing is a terrible sequence where we are re-introduced to the lowlights of Gollum who plays riddles with Bilbo, who gets hold of the Ring (ooh, big deal!). Let us get it straight once and for all, whenever Gollum is on screen he slows the film down to snail's pace. The first minute you saw him, gobsmacked, the second minute cartoonish, dreadfully one note and repetitive, and inaudible, third minute you wanted someone to stick a knife in him - not give Andy Serkis a career and apparent genius rating! What saves the film? Martin Freeman as Everyman - a clear English rural character who saw out his duty in the trenches in WW1 and fought above the White Cliffs as a Sergeant Pilot in WW2. He acts well and his character develops. There is a narrative thrust - if incredibly familiar. And you want things to happen - not watch Gandalf slyly look at Bilbo's pocket and nod as if he knows 'The Ring' is there.But the final moment leading on to LOTR2 - how could you Mr Jackson repeat the US 'Godzilla' poster? I think you have nothing more to say - get a new team in with some new fresh ideas, or are modern audiences just hooked on over familiarity?",5,23,47,19 December 2012
Gone Girl," Utteryl Boring unless a Diatribe Against Female Empowerment
","Big spoilers in this review! From the off this movie was slow, slovenly written, tediously directed with some half decent acting. I just could not connect to the characters, which were just there to be manipulated by the writer(a theme of the film). Plot - wife disappears, apparently killed by her husband, who becomes increasingly under pressure to be arrested (media and a rent-a-mob crowd holding banners!). Suddenly big twist as wife reappears to tell her story, and the film drags itself to an unsatisfactory conclusion with the odd pot shot at the amoral media (TV actually). The plot of the first half owes itself to 40s noir with all those pictures with Barbara Stanwyck and Lana Turner in - now regularly revisited in made-for-TV movies. Then the second half turns into 'Basic Instinct' with buckets of blood, and the will she - won't she get away with it trying to drum up some vague tension. We even get a sex scene, where the wife's panties never move but she is being entered by a right schmuck. Another case of the star actress does not flash but earlier a minor actress goes topless in a fumble with the husband!Awful rubbish and a waste of two and half hours of my life. Certainly not the intricate shredding of marriage as an institution by everyone using facades/manipulation to merely survive that the press reviews trumpet. It is unbelievable because the characters have stepped out of an author's head and not anything remotely resembling real life. The only problem for reviewers was a lacklustre final third which some have tries to explain away as satire.The day after I saw the movie, I was still mulling over that problematic final third, when it struck me that the whole thing built into a savage condemnation/diatribe at FEMALE EMPOWERMENT - something the Liberal Intelligentsia could never approve of, even if they noticed it1 Let me explain. the wife (Rosamund Pike who is OK) is upper middle class and well educated, but also a psychopathic, manipulative, uber-bitch. The two female TV anchors are well spoken, manipulative bullies and control freaks. The working class robber from the motel (don't ask) is a manipulative, vicious, controlling bitch. In fact, out of the six female characters in the last third of the film, only two are likable - one, the twin sister, loves her brother (Affleck) unconditionally, while the other, the detective, has treated the husband with outstanding even-handedness. And the non-moving pantie scene takes on another meaning - it is a visual which tells you that a man does not really enter an empowered female! But all you liberals will be screaming 'no.' So how is it Ben Affleck yells out - 'God save me from female empowerment!' Or did I hear it in 'Midsomer Murders' later in the evening!? Yes, well done, Mr Fincher, you really have slipped in a crafty anti-feminist movie right under their noses!A last point - shouldn't the final scene have been of the two robbers in the motel recognising the wife on TV and saying to each other 'Now we can make some real money!' Pity the movie did not star Reese Witherspoon herself (given a producer credit here) and her husband had been played by ex Ryan Phillippe. Now that would have made for a really engaging and creepy movie!",1,76,148,10 October 2014
2012," Over the top CGI - and that's all, folks!
","The end of the world - and you get it, ten times over. In fact it gets a bit repetitive two thirds of the way through. Yes, mostly the CGI is very good - never very convincing, but then people put up with some wooden dummies in that helicopter shot of the 'Titanic' so we can't really complain! Having seen the trailer for 'Avatar' just before the film here, I was pleasantly surprised how good the CGI was compared to the Snow White/blue genie cartoon that Cameron wishes to dish up before Xmas. Unfortunately the in between dialogue pieces are pretty dire except for the odd gag - The Quenn and Prince Philip with the corgies getting on one of the arks! But let's face it, Jennifer Aniston and Seth Rogen comedies have some of the worst scripts imaginable, and they keep coming out, so why be so vehement about '2012?' The acting is unmemorable, and the San Andreas Fault seems to have the biggest acting role during the halfway stage of this overlong movie. Cut it down and it could work much better! However, Emmerich really does hide a lot of sly satire at Americans and the USA in his films that are a hoot on reflection. In 'Day After Tomorrow' the US had to beg for help from Mexico, while at the end of this Americans are going to have live in Africa! Hoot! Hoot! There should have been more of this but no, why bother, when you can demolish LA and Las Vegas, as well as the White House with a giant US aircraft carrier! Not much of the USA for Emmerich that is left to destroy!!!!",4,4,7,20 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," Tired retread of worst of Hollywood
","Can barely remember anything about this awful movie. Lazy - no plot and character development - repetitive - seen it all before - boring - even the cast look glad it is the last outing - lack of originality - comic devotees should be left in peace to read their dime novels while grander themes are given $100 million plus to make real movies.Now the stage in UK gets to see Magneto and Professor X reprising roles of two people who do not know what to do next actually musing around for a couple of hours in 'Waiting for Godot!' They could have slipped in half the stage play in this film and nobody would have noticed, despite the pathetic attempt at inferring a Guantanamo Bay subplot.Come on Hollywood, give us a break from this rubbish, which really is just a CGI fest for 16-27 male morons who think dark monotone comic superheroes are cooler than rubbish nerd movies starring Stiller, Rogen etc!!!",2,1,2,10 March 2009
Stardust," Boring awful rubbish
","This film is so boring and tedious. It is derivative - cue every fantasy film ever seen and bits will appear here - yes 'Titanic' bowsprit shot and all!! Script slow, ponderous and not funny. Direction tiresome and plodding as with plot. Acting in parts OK, with Pfeiffer and Danes giving it their all, while De Niro and his character is so not Johnny Depp, but is nothing and extremely tedious. Plot of boy crosses into fairyland, shags, son is born, star falls from sky and turns into girl, witches want to eat star to live immortally, so boy must meet girl and fall in love, and then defeat the witches before claiming throne of fairyland!!! You would think you could make that interesting, wouldn't you? But, no, you just sit there saying ';get on with it!' I must point out, that film PR people must be arranging for favourable reviews on this website by paying people to put great scores up - this movie proves it surely. Please can you pay attention to this malpractice!",1,15,43,22 March 2010
Lincoln," Excellent and not dull
","This is an excellent film despite the usual Spielbergian visual flourishes that clunk or exasperate in equal measure. The plot revolves around the final months of Lincoln's Presidency when he tried to push the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery through the House of Representatives in January 1865. The focus switches between the shenanigans and politicking to get 20 votes from the amenable and wavering Congressmen and Abe's home life with a distraught and grieving wife and a son who wants to enlist. The film is saved from over-worthiness and just being a drama doc by the towering and astonishing performance by Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln. The acting is uniformally good, the staging and production values excellent. Problems lie with the over-sanctification of Lincoln (cue bright shining lights from above onto Lincoln) by not including obvious bad contradictory elements to the story, and the playfulness of the script and director towards their liberal agenda, eg in your second term use your political clout to end the war! Will Obama take note? The complaints seem to be from the younger generation who cannot sit still and listen to a polished dramatic script that is conversational - tough, youngsters, this is not Iron Man 1865! I saw it with an audience of over-55s - it was watched in silence!!! Start weening yourselves off popcorn and popcorn movies, will you critics!",8,2,4,14 February 2013
Children of Men," Another dystopian future - another disappointment
","Just like 'Franklyn,' 'I am Legend' and 'Waterworld' we are presented with a dystopian future, where all hell has broken loose with the lack of fertility amongst the world population. Only UK has survived in any normal sense - although the film begins with a CNN-like coverage of Princess Diana's death, sorry, Diego's(the youngest man on the planet)How has this been broadcast? - and yet it is filthy, run down, fascist, with violence and bombing an everyday experience. What would make a real picture would an in-depth investigation of how a society like this can still supply transport(trains), energy, computers etc without normal trading links - something I am sure Gordon Brown would like to know about! But no, this turns into a shoot em up chase movie with various nods to Arab/Israeli, Iraq conflicts and immigration. So, yes, an hour to set up this dystopian vision, in order to get Clive Owen heroically battling soldiers and terrorists to save the first child born in eighteen years without taking up a gun! Lots of realistic war zone footage, with even a miraculous pause in action as the miraculous child passes through the carnage!!! Sorry how this film can be praised, I don't know. If you have a futuristic society - make it work for us. Don't just show a few coal-fired power stations in the background on the south coast - all the coal is in the north of the UK- and put all the problems down to a mysterious flu epidemic in 2008. Take a chance, not fall for the predictable Hollywood, video game violence and sentimentality!",3,8,15,23 April 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good mystery thriller with grisly bits
","I have not read the book, not seen the theatre version, or seen the remake for dumb audiences that cannot be bothered to read subtitles. I have watched the original Swedish TV mini series in two parts. A good mystery made in laid back, brooding Scandinavian style - a la Wallander (Hendriksson) and 'The Killing.' The thriller aspects are not overdone, so cars do not jump off roads in CGI and endless build ups are avoided. The story of a left wing, crusading journo (Blomqvist) trying to uncover a 40 year old mysterious disappearance of a multi-millionaire magnate's niece is deftly and slowly told against a background of shuttered lives and shuttered doors on an island setting. The interconnection of the journo and a rather psychotic young woman (Salander) works naturally and the unlikely Holmes/Watson combo solve the plot without too many blistering coincidences or plot contrivances. the acting is restrained and good - not too overboard and emotional (as the remake appears to be) - the direction slowly building to a climax, and the script - given the material - not too over cooked. A small problem is the porno-like violence involving Salander, which, while not graphic, seems overdone for the plot and a little tacked on. But have to see the other two films/books to judge whether it is all part of the bigger scenario. Why was a remake really required, except for US dumba**es?",7,1,2,19 January 2012
The Imitation Game," Good enough but historically sketchy
","This is a good enough movie, but skirts around the true story in order to make a clunky point about a genius hounded to death for his homosexuality. The plot is simple. Britain is losing the war and desperately needs something to have a chance of survival. Cracking Nazi codes to stop attacks at sea and in the air might just tip the balance. Step forward the secret decoding establishment at Bletchley Park, where expert mathematicians and linguists are recruited to try and break the famous codes sent via the German Enigma machines. And step forward one Alan Turing of Cambridge University, resident if gay genius played by Benedict Cumberbatch. To break the codes apparently Turing invents a machine to do this. Of course, this is all nonsense -the Poles had built machines previously to do this work and had broken Enigma, but with increasing sophistication they no longer had the resources so handed over their work to the British, along with a captured Enigma machine from the Wehrmacht. So tension mounts as Turing uses tons of money on a new (sic) totally innovative machine which does not seem to be quick enough. On the way an overly attractive Joan Clark (played by Keira Knightley), a double first, helps out and gets engaged to Turing, while silly old Commander Dennison played by Charles Dance tries to close down the machine!!!!! Eventually a chance remark and a realisation of something bleedin' obvious puts Turing and co on the right track. Just time for - we must not use all information or Jerry will know we have broken his codes, so little chat about who is saved and who isn't, which is pretty peripheral, before getting to the climax where Turing is chemically castrated by an unfeeling and totally ungrateful country. The thriller elements are okay, but Turing can do no wrong except tell Clark to leave Bletchley, which gets short feminist shrift! Oh dear, the script cannot help itself from being so terribly 21st century liberal in its preachy parts. A pity some other unsung heroes like Tommy Flowers and the Poles do not get a mention! The acting is fine all round, the direction serviceable, and it works at its own level, but the one man band tub thumping with Cumberbatch twitching and not looking directly at people (obvious Oscar material like 'Rain Man') really does a disservice to the great team effort of the wartime code breakers. Remember, an even more advanced, valve-based machine for breaking codes was developed with little participation from Turing by a working class GPO man - Tommy Flowers, who used his own money to finance it. Hope his story is not overlooked just because he was straightforwardly normal!",6,95,131,21 November 2014
The Adjustment Bureau," mixture of romcom and scifi does not work
","High concept scifi meets romdrama/com - result turgid predictable movie, only saved by wanting to see what happens at the end. The acting is pretty ordinary - how does Matt Damon get all these parts when he is so mediocre?! The direction is also incredibly ordinary - no tricksy stuff or originality. The plot put simply is that Planet Earth has always had its' Gods and subsidiary helpers, called different things at different times, eh angels. And when they intervene, it is against a detailed plan for each person contained in a moving book. these 'Gods' stepped back in history, and hence The Dark Ages and two World Wars. Obviously Matt Damon is meant to be another JFK, but he will settle for less if he hooks up with Emily Blunt! Stumbling across the angels doing some 'adjustment' he learns all about this. The film then watches him struggle with his written fate and what he really wants in life. Unfortunately the audience has to suffer so much mumbo-jumbo scifi explanation that the film practically dies on its feet with a leaden script. So cue chases, romantic ups and downs, and an ending, where the so-called chief God (Zeus?) chooses a new path for the star-crossed lovers. Bu which time we have all given up - mediocre c**p!",2,1,2,25 February 2014
The Dark Knight," Laughable - Batman trying to be an art-house movie!
","Batman is a comic strip! The Dark Knight thinks it's Dostoyevsky! Over long, exceedingly tiresome and boring, one note performances, stale CGI stunts with a script that is more pretentious than portentous! Director Chris Nolan gets some marks for subtly taking the rise out of Bush and America, and convincing a very large audience they are watching Fellini, Tarantino, M. Mann and Carol Reed all rolled into one! Yes, folks, if it's dark, it must be a serious film!!!! I loved the holes in the plot(must be deliberate), when The Joker says he is an anarchist, who does not plan, but then produces several stunts that would have required Rand McNally precision and hundreds of accomplices! And please,I know he died under strange circumstances, but Heath Ledger, although not bad,is miles behind Jack Nicholson. As for the rating certificate, the British censor should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, or did he think it was just a Tom and Jerry comic cartoon?",3,9,18,16 September 2008
Pride & Prejudice," Too rushed and tried to hard to be different
","It is difficult to put 'Pride and Prejudice' on screen in two hours when a lot of people have seen it very successfully adapted for TV over several hours! As a result there is a terrible feeling of galloping to get the plot set up for Lizzie and Darcy - witness the ridiculous treatment of the villain, Wickham, who really only appears twice. The historical inaccuracies that are very obvious really reflect the director's wish to be different from the 1995 BBC version, so no Empire lines and a generally tenant farmer feel to the Bennets. But why spend so much time building up this ambiance for it to disappear completely in the second half of the film!? The worst scene for this is Lizzie arriving at Pemberley (Chatsworth) looking like a ragamuffin and laughing at the irony of the fact that she could have been the chatelaine! Silly and ridiculously modern for a cheap effect! The direction is boisterous - Merry England (more 'Tom Jones' than Austen!) as the country fought for its' life against Napoleon! Or is that a modern parallel of Boozy English as the terrorists stalk the land!! The acting is ordinary - not enough time and dialogue to work with - occasionally the stars look good, but overall a third rate, messy, unwanted version of a much loved book and TV classic, that once again relies on you knowing the story and characters from other media, and then confronting your expectations... poorly.",4,2,4,7 July 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Bloated retread of fantasy movies
","I am not going to lash this rather poor movie with references to the books or Disney cartoon (although I did see it first time around in 1951 and was enchanted!), and just treat it as another movie from Hollywood. Why or why is everything now so derivative of what has gone before? Is it that filmmakers think young audiences must have familiarity with something before they will begin the lazy process of watching a fantasy film? This film is dark and poor - just like 'Batman' in the noughties, and just as awful. 'Narnia' springs to mind with Alice in silver armour and carrying Excalibur or whatever, 'Avatar' when the creatures chase Alice, cue big dumb giant sabre toothed tiger running through the grassland'jungle and swooping birds/dragons up and down (did Tim Burton use the same software for his CGI because it is becoming an awful pain to watch?), 'Titanic' with the heroine at the bowsprit, 'Lord of the Rings' with the battle between good and evil amidst a blasted landscape, and the usual 'spot the English thesp' voice amongst the support cast. Oh dear, one could go on, but why? The dreary experience in the cinema took too much out of my life! The script is poor, the imagination very thin, and lots of money has been wasted. Dear, oh dear!",3,7,11,22 March 2010
Avatar," Expensive mumbo jumbo boreathon
","Awful, awful waste of money and time. Hackneyed, clichÃ©-ridden, and 3-D so what! Admittedly a strange nexus of events in my life did not help viewing. Within the last three weeks I have been to Orlando, and the 3-D in 'Avatar' cannot compare with the 'Simpson's Simulator Ride' for being 'in it.' When the natives fly vertically, we do not see it through their eyes - too many people would leave the cinema sick! I also caught the James Cameron-directed 'Terminator Experience' in 3-D. Guess what, twenty minutes of Cameron cinema worked, this does not. I am afraid the spectacle is pretty feeble, and I was not immersed in this Disney fairyland with its only a dozen or so creatures (money run out?). Now for plot and characterisation, or lack of, should I say! In the last few days I have watched 'Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee' - same story but it really happened - is Cameron paying the Sioux any royalties? Then last night I watched 'King Arthur' - a lanky female archer with little bre**ts painted in blue leading an attack of blueies on the bad guys - is Cameron paying Keira Knightley any royalties? And as for rip offs from Steven Spielberg and 'Jurassic Park' and Kevin Costner and 'Dances With Wolves' - well, we'd better not get started. Supposedly a sci-fi film, there are huge mechanical robocops, but the hero has to put up with a 1960s' wheelchair, while full body DNA replicants of an alien species can be produced, but the private contractor army has to make do (in 2154 AD) with 1990s' bullets, grenades and high explosive (money run out for lasers, James?)!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No, this has to be one of the worst, most underwhelming movies of all time. Music - would you believe I came out of the cinema humming 'Titanic?' Well done, Mr Horner! And to cap it all, when I got home 'Destination Moon' made in 1950 for peanuts was on TV - in five minutes showing take off from Earth, there was more realism and emotion than all of 'Avatar.' But I have given it 1. Why? Because James Cameron has persuaded his countrymen to spend a quarter of a billion dollars to make it, and hundreds of thousands of Americans to watch what is basically a straightforward condemnation of the USA's past 'push west' and present arrogant imperialism in Iraq and Afghanistan. Can't all be bad, can it?!",1,33,71,7 January 2010
The Artist," Charming Movie
","Really worth seven and a half, but it is a very simple, charming film with an excellent performance from Jean Dujardin and his dog. Yes, it's not quite a silent movie - some other comments will highlight the shortcomings, but would today's audiences accept the mugging all the way through and the more crudely cut scenes and still camera-work. But at least the characters were alive - unlike Gary Oldman's impression of the Walking Dead in 'Tinker,Tailor etc.!' The storyline of the old silent star falling from fame, while the chorus girl (who secretly loves him) climbs to the top, is fairly trite and straightforward, but told with brio and pathos - and, more importantly, with sincerity and entertainment in mind! It is far more acceptable than Spielberg's heart tugging, hankie wiping, part failure with 'War Horse.' The direction is mostly good, especially in recreating the more humdrum, middle brow, actioners of the silent era, while the 'spot the original stars' shown is quite fun, even if there is no time to work out the anagrams of actors' names on the billboards! I must say the redemption of the hero is a little trite - I thought it would come through being the trainer of his dog as a sort of Rin Tin Tin/Lassie after being rescued, but there you go! All round just go and treat yourself to some entertainment - leave your preconceptions of a twelve hour silent epic 'Greed' at the door!",7,1,4,27 January 2012
Super 8," ET meets The Goonies in Cloverfield
","A film that you will have seen before - too often. The title says it all. Yelling noisy kids making a home movie on super 8 (cue uninteresting nostalgia for 1979!) and film a train crash (cue CGI splatter of metal which you know will never hurt anyone on scr4een!). There is a secret lurking inside the train wreck (cue easy guess it is some sort of creature!) and gradually the town is gripped with fifties-style paranoia, the kids (single parents of course!) get closer despite parental disapproval, the military are psychotic lunatics, and who but a couple of teenagers can save the world! Early on you know it is an alien, who turns out to have been tortured,(cue JJ Abrams long armed octopus!) and he just wants to get home - sic! Parents bond with kids, alien bonds with kid, and lo and behold, the ending has a strange alien spacecraft ascending to the heavens while 2011 motif of kid letting go of his dead mother's locket (cue no tears but groans aplenty). Manipulative, cardboard emotions, totally lacking in suspense (except for the possibility that the kid hero and heroine might be Luke and Leiea siblings!), and fairly thin. The praise must be down to how awful Captain America, Green Lantern etc are!!!!!?",Null,0,0,10 August 2011
Up," After touching opening,same old Disney schmaltz!
","The opening twenty minutes were quite touching (the famous sequence of boy growing through life and losing his true love/wife), but after that it just went downhill. How far Pixar have plummeted since 'Toy Story?'!!!!! The story is just a bit of fantasy of young and old trying to live out a dream in exotic setting, where danger lurks in form of batty old explorer and his many dogs! Gosh, what originality and what a plodding plot, characters, and empty subsidiary characters!! Yes, you just sit there while old Walt works the sentimentality line he did in the forties and fifties, only with modern animation, eg fat Americans who eat chocolate! Sorry I could not enjoy it more, but you suckered me into the cinema (only Â£3 each admittedly) and gave me a tired rerun of a lot of other Disney rubbish with superficial modernisms. And please can we really not have that clichÃ© of how the real American Dream of family, apple pie and redemption is just around the block? Does every US film have to make Americans love themselves with no criticism - after all the villain is voiced by a Canadian!",3,5,11,25 October 2009
Les MisÃ©rables," Cod opera = and mostly dire!
","This is a movie of a stage musical based on Victor Hugo's immense novel - 'Les Miserables.' The story of the book looks scathingly and at great length at society's injustices to the poor and needy, especially one, Jean Valjean, who is released from prison after 19 years (for stealing a loaf of bread and then trying to escape), breaks parole and betters himself. But on his trail is the wretched Inspector Javert, who believes once bad always bad. The latter half is about Paris, where once again Valjean has fled to live a proper life bringing up the daughter of a woman who fell into the gutter because of his neglect.A great premise for a story, but how can you engage with a sung through musical on realistic celluloid? Sorry, Mr Hooper, but cast singing live during shooting adds nothing, except for you to boast that you have broken the barriers of film!!!! The voices are OK, but not much more amongst the leads. There is barely a memorable tune or song - just a lot of droning repetition that bores from about ten minutes in! We also have comic relief - Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter - that is just a tired repeat of 'Oliver' and so ridiculous, it spoils what is good in the movie. Which is quite simply a series of overwhelmingly emotional climaxes - how the stage musical was so popular! But even that trick bores after a while.So direction is piffling, the lyrics and script a trudge through French history without the history, and the suffering over-hyped to be almost laughable towards the end - and doesn't the last hour dragggggggg! There is little explanation of the background to the barricades (the last interminable Act with no interval for a drink!) - and, indeed, the insurrection of 1832 achieved nothing and fades away on screen badly. Remember that Hugo was really writing about the later betrayal of the French Republic in 1851 by Louis Napoleon declaring himself Emperor Napoleon 111 - when he then manned the barricades but the people did not rise to support the Republic! So the story keeps itself alive in the closing stages with the mock-Ruritanian instant love affair between Marius and Cosette (lukewarm at best) and the suicide of the ever dogged Javert, as he realises Man has not Fallen, but can retrieve Himself through forgiveness.The acting depends on Hugh Jackman, and he makes a good stab at it, but cannot overcome the over the top demands of (cod) opera acting. A pity! The others are alright with Ann Hathaway the pick for pretending to be a prostitute! And the lyrics could have been updated - Herbert Kretzmeyer the lyricist was a writer for the 60s and 70s, and it shows... badly, like most other aspects of this creaking overblown vehicle for directorial and critical egos!",2,6,11,1 March 2013
Jersey Boys," OK Dull Biopic
","Singers struggle to get a recording contract from a poor background, magically make a breakthrough, hit 'no 1s,' get spoilt by success, fall into debt, and break up. Oh, and a miraculous reunion when entering the Hall of Fame. How many groups does this apply to? Well, with 'Jersey Boys' it is Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, and it is based on a successful and long running stage musical. The only thing to mark it out is that one of the singer characters is a tired, glorified rerun of a cheap young hood from Scorseseland. So, if you like the 4 Seasons, you'll at least enjoy the musical renditions. But it is a plodding, almost 'Made for TV' movie with little cinema, and a very old fashioned script that would have been out of date in 1960! The performances have been honed on stage and the actors just about get away with them on screen, although Christopher Walkden shows everyone what screen acting is like in a downbeat impression of a New Jersey mafia boss. Clint Eastwood directs competently (I have never seen him as anything special in the Director's chair, so not disappointed).But the major bugbear is the Tony Da Vito character. Once again an East Coast chippy goodfella gets the full treatment on screen as some kind of wise guy we should all admire more than condemn - America's fascination and glorification of two bit smart ass crooks (eg 'Hustle') shows a cancer at the heart of US cultural values. Yes, thank you, Mr Scorsese! This may be needed at the heart of the film but is vastly overplayed. Oh, and by the way, plot holes and lack of depth of characterisation abound, but let's face it you have to 'Walk Like A Man' and 'Big Girls Don't Cry.'",4,8,10,1 October 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Boring procedural overtaken by events
","You have all heard of a police procedural, well, this is a CIA procedural, until the killing of Osama bin Laden just before release meant the film finishes on a high of US Seals celebrating executing an old man as if they had won the Super Bowl! Presumably it was meant to end on a real low note of the heroine working for 11 years to find bin Laden, but not succeeding! I started watching with anticipation. So immediate scenes of US callously torturing countless Arabs ( all excused by the need for revenge for 9/11 - 2,000 - how many innocent killed at Hiroshima?), before heroine (with permanent pained and liberal disapproving look played by Jessica Chastain) introduces a little more subtlety. Don't bother trying to catch the inaudible dialogue, it is pure mumblecore and irrelevant - US filmmakers believe you do not want to know or care about the identity of the various Arabs being tortured. This is a procedural and it boringly drifts along with subtitles showing the different locations (more important than the Arabic characters?) where the various torturing takes place.Frankly I gave up after 40 minutes and turned to a tenth repeat of 'Foyle's War!' I then watched the end - or should that be two ends? The proper one finishes with a downbeat assessment of 11 years of faithful, hangdog failure, and your career is safe as a minor operative. Then suddenly we are in Afghanistan/Pakistan watching a fully togged, lit up Navy SEAL unit helicoptering in to kill and then steal the body of bin Laden. And guess who gets to visually identify the corpse? Yes, our heroine, the minor operative. Crass and at odds with the rest of the film.This is really a dramatized documentary for TV. ClichÃ©s crowd in from the director and scriptwriter, as well as twitching facials from Ms Chastain instead of acting still. It is a boring non-event except to an American audience, as the early torture criticism (?) is overwhelmed by the final section. To show how bad this film is. After bin Laden is dead, Ms Chastain leaves on an huge transport empty plane - 'You can go anywhere' and the dreaded utterly predictable visual from Ms Bigelow comes - the huge ramp of the plane closes (Yes, closure for the heroine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!) Oscars for direction and screenplay - please!!!!",1,8,16,2 February 2015
12 Years a Slave," Worthy but very predictable and dull
","The subject of this film is so worthy, it cannot be criticised. The slavery of Africans and their descendants in the USA in the years after independence is obscene and horrific. There I've said it in a sentence - this film beats you into submission in over two hours' running time by depicting the horrors and obscenity over and over again. It has nothing new to say, and with 150 years distance between the events, we can all leave the cinema feeling good about ourselves and how much more civilised we are today. I just wonder why Samuel L. Jackson questions the movie and points out today's racism!? But back to the movie - plot, free black man is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South of America, surviving by accepting his position and not fighting back despite witnessing rape and whipping and getting plenty of lashings himself. Again one sentence's worth and you have the film of over two hours. The script is relentless - some exploration of the economics of slavery might have helped point out its ridiculous and violent meaning. The direction is full of overlong imagery that is so obvious and bores the audience. The acting is perfunctory to say the least - Chitewol Edifor almost has a permanent look of bemused disbelief as he keeps his head down, Fassbender just goes over the top as a mad man so no blame to southern citizens really then, the rest just put up a clichÃ© of the symbol they are meant to represent, eg suffering beautiful female slave lashed to smithereens, and Brad Pitt swaggers in as a symbol of liberal Hollywood coming to rescue all 'God;s chillum.' But it packs a punch and tells a tale to remind the arrogant, greatest democracy in the world of its dark past, when most Americans looked the other way for so long. It is a pity that the aftermath of Northup's release is not touched on except in a few words over the final credits - but that would have implicated the US too much like the portrayal of the Emancipation Act in the much better 'Lincoln.' Remember 'Amistad' failed at the Box Office because of such scenes as a British sailor telling the US that the UK had long abolished slavery - Oops.",5,2,5,11 February 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Brave and Good Attempt at Something Different
","Is this film doomed to go down as a critically OK movie that failed at the box office? What a shame, alongside such absolute rubbish as 'Iron Man3' and 'Avatar' - standing in the top 3 of earning movies!!!!! Yes, the film is an expensive blockbuster with Tom Cruise as star - seems box office poison alongside mumbling riffs of rubbish from Downey jnr and little blue smurfs in outer space! Yes, it is a video game on the big screen - hero gets killed but gets another life every time fighting an alien race with killer instincts, so that he can learn how to defeat them. The film bangs along after a slowish start to establish the character and the situations which he, and we, will return to with growing irony and knowingness. There is the spectacular landing in Normandy to rout the aliens that turns into a massacre, and gives Cruise his apparent immortality - no drones visible so this is not controversial in the States!!! Thereafter, with the help of a former soldier, who experienced similar re-settings of the day, the hero grows into a true warrior from a PR wimp. The script is sharp, if somewhat incidental - certainly does not spend too much time on explanation - and the direction cleverly understated with masses of CGI. And, yes, Tom pulls it off to carry the film in that all-American solid way that no longer seems to get the crowds cheering. Ah well, go and see on the big screen and enjoy the spectacle without all the hype and very predictable dross surrounding 'X Men' and other comic bores this summer.",6,2,5,15 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excess, excess of Everything, so Ultimately BORING
","Another Scorsese movie - another over-praised piece of film making. This film is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stockbroking huckster, who used legitimate and illegal tactics to sell bad shares to mugs in the boom years of the nineties. Not only that he spent money to excess, and squirrelled it away illegally in Switzerland. His personal life would make that of a debauched Roman Emperor look like a Puritan - cue hookers, strippers, full front nudity, and drugs galore! So, excess is shown.... over and over again. In fact, this three hour pic should either have been a mini series or just two hours of hard hitting condemnation. But Scorsese indulges himself hoping to ping the great US public to reform themselves and their greed - some hope! But he is brave enough to try and attack the self-righteous hypocrisy that stands at the heights of the US financial and industrial power. But basically the main fault of the film is that it is a rerun of his other movies, eg 'Goodfellas.' The character of the FBI agent represents the ordinary Joe who lives on a normal salary and catches the subway home, while Belfort indulges in the American Dream unfettered by ethics or the law. Cue Ray Liotta at the end of 'Goodfellas' bemoaning living in obscurity when he once had the excitement of the high life of criminality with the Mafia.The character of Belfort is another Elmer Gantry or TV Evangelist Huckster, who can rally the troops to sell anything. And lots of ordinary people follow him from rags to riches by adopting his script and exploiting their fellow Americans. Leonardo Di Caprio fills the role convincingly but remains too one-note to successfully overcome the view that other actors would have invested Belfort with that bit more. the support is good, but not required to do much more than lay back and get a b*** job. The script is terribly repetitive and shallow. While the nudity and sexual intercourse is at times played for real, at others looks prissy which jars. And the drug taking unfortunately does look real and is barely condemned by the director! Too many faults and slowness detract from the bold theme and treatment of excess - a great pity.",4,2,4,10 March 2014
The Reader," Far too literary in style but useful about German guilt over WW2
","The main themes are about German guilt over WW2 and the Holocaust going down through the generations, so we flip about between the present and 1958 and years in between. Everything is bound up with whether Germans of all generations can face up to what happened and what they did. So, after an hour of nude sex scenes between a young boy (15) representing the postWar generation and a much older woman (about 36) who obviously lived through the war (done before in so many films, eg Summer of 42, the Graduate etc) with the usual clichÃ©s of bathing scenes (to wash off guilt), she leaves suddenly - the result being a dysfunctional character (brilliantly acted as a young boy by Kross, but mournfully miserable as usual by Ralph Fiennes) who has to find himself. But he finds out that his one time lover was a Nazi Concentration Camp Guard when he attends a War Criminal trial. He is able to save her from a long sentence and discusses it with his Law Professor, but that theme disappears. But he supports her in prison, but as she is about to leave he manages to get her to face up to her guilt. Cue more guilt and tragedy, only to be cauterised by his being open with his daughter - the next generation (groan, groan). Yes, you guessed it - far too pleased with itself for its over literary adaptation, mannered stylistic approach, with metaphors for actions and guilt barely disguised in everyday happenings. Kate Winslet looks suitably haunted though not old enough to look like Fiennes' mother! But it was a sucker for Weinstein with Oscar written all over it!!!!! Some good acting but far too pleased with its' own portentousness. And we did not need Kate with her kit off so often - not required for the storyline!",5,2,2,3 April 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Peter Jackson's CGI boreathons tumbled at last
","At last THE END of Peter Jackson's mind and bum numbing CGI so-called epic spectacles. They have become increasingly repetitive, dull, uninteresting and smugly self- satisfied at their own success. Scripts are shallow and full of plot holes, as they vainly struggle to catch the fine timbre of say 'Ben Hur' or 'El CID'. That the director and his writers fall short is due to elongation, greed and a belief in their own legendary status. It is called hubris. The plot is simple -dragon killed, orcs are on the rampage, and King Dwarf goes mad a la 'Sierra Madre.' Cue overlong battle between five armies for the treasure! Since when do Stephen Fry's miserable plebs constitute a fighting force? Yes, you guessed it - the Orcs almost win hands down until a drawn out fight sees their barbarian leader downed and a Dr Who arrives with the Eagles - Roman Legions - to sweep all before them (just like the ghost army in LOTR! Oh dear, this really is a fresh film! Various lines are tied up to lead onto the main book/film, except what happens to all the treasure? Terribly unsatisfactory, only illuminated by the odd bit of acting from messes Freeman and Armitage, who deserved better from this lazy, long drawn out, over hyped children's serial.",2,10,20,24 December 2014
Inception," You can fool a lot of the people most of the time!
","This film was supposed to knock my socks off! Well, I'm still wearing them, because this film was such a disappointment. I thought 'Memento' was brilliant, but 'Dark Knight' a con, although this was supposed to be a total Nolan film. It should have been his 'Heaven's Gate' ( a much better film by the way) but it has proved almost 'Titanic' (again a much better film). Indeed, the audience left the cinema asking each other 'did you enjoy it?' as if they thought it was rubbish, but had to find out whether it was OK to say it was! It was.Let's face it, the plot is little more than a pretend heist movie on a par with 'Ocean's 12.' But it is hidden away in a complicated story of dreams and dreamworlds - three levels worth with each level allowing more time in it compared to reality! Gottit? You should do because Di Caprio spends acres of screen time explaining it to the complete and utter boredom of the audience. Cinema, Doctor K - I think not. It all boils down to finding out why the hero's wife died and how are the gang going to plant an idea in the head of a major industrialist (eg Inception). Following this? As the climax boils (in an extremely prosaic dreamworld hardly worth the effort and CGI) on three different levels - one a minibus falling off a bridge (interminably in slow motion), the second Tom Hardy's screen test for the remake of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' complete with ski shooters, Blofeld's alpine fortress, and an enemy that cannot kill a hero from five yards!, and the third, a legoland where Di Caprio's wife is skulking siren-like to lure him to stay forever - the film really creaks and shows its' paucity of vision, script, characters, and downright boringness! I have to excuse some of it because I needed the loo and could not get out of my row! Yes, I had a totem which kept me firmly in reality ( I knew how long we had to go by how far the minibus had to fall!).And the plot holes - many, but the worst involved the Cillian Murphy getting killed in the second level which should have left him in mindless limbo on level 3, but he was dead there as well, while Ken Watanabe who died in level 2, became a very old man in level 3!!!! And right at the end, Cillian Murphy has been trained to resist dream thieves, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in the cabin with the gang but does not put two and two together and realise they are the real thieves having persuaded him in his dream otherwise!! Gettit? Don't bother, it was probably all Di Caprio's dream anyway - a load of old tosh that has Nolan laughing all the way to the bank, and many so-called serious critics facing the sack for lavishly overpraising a piece of mediocre tosh!!!",2,22,41,6 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Watchable but really a rerun of IronMan!
","Robert Downey jnr reprises his role of IronMan - he jokes around with sidekick, he goes off message and is an oddball with an to the future, and he flirts outrageously without any sex, and he has ludicrous fights with a surfeit of faux-bloody violence. Even the rhythm of the film is an exact replica of the aforementioned action flick - you know quiet bits and then every twenty minutes a big action set piece. It's watchable, the old London CGI is interesting, but the villain (Mark Strong as underwhelming here as in 'Robin Hood') is pathetic, the showy 'how Holmes works it out' has been done many times before, eg 'The Bone Collector,' and the love interest ho hum. But Downey and Law play well off each other and it just about rattles along. Sequel well emphasised - oh dear!",3,2,3,13 February 2011
WALLÂ·E," A refreshing surprise
","A refreshing surprise - a film that takes its own path and does not rely too heavily on clichÃ©, references and violence. The start with little dialogue is brave, the animation good, and the story gathers you in. Some cute gags about the last robot left on Earth just carrying on doing his job, until alien probes begin to look around! A touch too sentimental in parts like old time Disney, but the plot whisks along. An excellent touch is that the humans, who finally get a look in some time in, all look alike and are obese, while the robots are generally very distinguishable. The plot is the same as 'Logan's Run' and the thriller denouement is '2001' but it still does not disappoint as familiarity creeps in over the last 15 minutes. good, no very good.",7,3,6,1 October 2009
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Not As Clever As It Thinks It Is!
","A good film, a decent attempt at trying to make a 'Man In Search Of His Own Identity' movie like Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni etc did in the 60s and 70s. It does it through the painful struggles to stage a play on Broadway allied to the agonies and ego of a washed up, former superhero actor trying to go legit. The medium of the last chance for a fading thespian has been done before, but not for a while. Remember Bette Davis and Ann Baxter going head to head in the early 50s? What makes this film stand out is the artifice of the film (until the very end)apparently being shot in one long continuous take! It works brilliantly, but overpowers the film. The script is good in parts, but is repetitive and fairly mundane with little depth. Actorly tantrums and one-upmanship do not make for a two hour movie these days. The acting is good, but bound by the limits of the story, eg Edward Norton's character is real on stage but all an act off it - and we are supposed to care! The film takes pot shots at Hollywood - how brave! - but apart from repeatedly going on about cartoon superhero movies and celebrity there is little here but a moan that falls short of a rant. The 'right on' bits about the impact of social media seem arch and merely included for the movie to look relevant to today. But this film is trying to do something worthy, and everyone, except the scriptwriters, are doing their best. It is worth seeing but too high hopes and the hype will leave you flat.",6,1,6,31 January 2015
Centurion," Bloody rubbish
","A director who has some cult success with a cheap Brit horror turns to Roman history in Britannia. Is it a parable for Iraq or Afghanistan? Well, the Russian involvement maybe, but it's a cheap easy way to show a lot of blood being spilt in many differing, and often, horrific ways. No, it's not about Romans or Picts - although it's probably closer to the war Severus waged on the Picts and Caledonians around 205 AD - it's just a chase movie, with the chased getting killed at regular intervals. Presumably just like 'The Descent' even though I haven't seen it. Critics have obviously praised Director Marshall's early work for having a bit about it, and just like Tarantino after one so so movie, they cannot go back and say that he's got nothing to say and his latest movie is crap. Michael Fassbender, praised to high heaven for his portrayal of Bobby Sands, is anonymous here playing a conventional role - more disappointment for the critics. No the lost legion - the 9th Hispana - deserved better than this absolute pile of excrement. Plot useless, acting phoned in, dialogue edgily poor, and another promising Brit flick dies a death at the box office - took about ÃÂ£250,000! And people are complaining about the abolition of the UK Film Council - really, they funded this heap of rubbish!",1,25,51,1 September 2010
Prometheus," Glossy rerun of original that is very poor
","If you want exploding chests, alien pen**** penetrating human mouths, and various other third rate horror trash tricks, then this is the movie for you. A very very tired rerun of the original 'Alien' without half the spark or creepiness. In fact, the only note of tension in the whole film is whether Guy Pierce's character is going to regenerate or not, and the best moment is when Man comes face to face with his Creator (Engineer). Otherwise it is a simple story of a space exploration team coming out of hibernation to explore the potential source of the Gods who made us - cue a direct pinch from 'Stargate' with the usual idealists, pragmatists, and grasping capitalists mixed up on board. We all know horror awaits and it is delivered rather half heartedly and mostly contradictorily and in unexplained fashion - cue you get terribly bored as the film dives ever downwards in its second half. Plot holes - like why is there one of the engineers still alive? - abound, flight crews turn into planet-saving heroes, the heroine opens up her stomach in full frontal etc and we get the dreaded promise of a sequel. Sorry Ridley, I know Hartlepool can be a gray place to grow up in, but it does not excuse this poorly scripted, poorly characterised mish mash of a fifth rate horror film. And, as for the so-called big questions being asked, forget it, this is the wrong movie to try and so lazily done it insults the intelligence. Some good CGI just gets it a 2!",2,24,41,29 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Best of the bunch, but hardly Citizen Kane
","Yes, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is probably the best of the Marvel Comics adaptations, but let's not get carried away by big budget, CGI and a portentous script - it is good but not anywhere near the overpraise it has received. It does try to be a bit serious (but far too portentous and over the top 'America the Brave'), looking at post 9/11 USA nightmares; it tries to use a lot of dialogue rather than pure action ( but it is far too pompous, shallow characterisation, repetitive), but the Jesus Christ resurrection parallel makes it overblown; the action is spectacular (but has mostly been seen before), but how many times do aliens/terrorists have to run amoke on Manhattan (Avengers Assemble?)? There are the usual gaping Nolan holes in the plot (as per Inception) - why do the terrorists keep 3,000 policemen alive below ground when they merrily butcher anyone who gets in their way above ground!!!? Nolan sneaks in French Terror/Bolshevik 1917 trial of bad citizens as a warning to USA, but absolutely cops out of showing New Yorkers/Gothamites run riot in anarchy. In fact, it is rather pleasant living under the terrorists who take over Gotham City so easily after a ludicrous plot line with exploding cement and a fusion device that becomes a nuclear weapon inside ten seconds!!!! Ah well, you are bowled along at a good pace with some visual flair, good men doing decent things, and Bruce Wayne/Batman suffering enormously but recovering to lead his people back to the promised land of inequality and huge wealth for a few. The acting is rightly serious, as the script makes them feel as if this is the summit of human feeling and experience - a sort of El Cid combined with King of Kings, only it is comic book heroics with the usual failings of people doing horrendous things to one another, but two seconds later getting up and walking away! At least Christian Bale has had his deep throat rasp cured in this movie! No, an enjoyable romp that ticks a few boxes, but fades rapidly as soon as you leave the cinema, but apart from several longeurs in the sagging middle, it does entertain.",6,1,4,7 September 2012
Blade Runner," Final Cut - much better
","This is without doubt Ridley Scott's finest hour - not many of his other films come within hailing distance. It is a visual treat of incredible production design, conceptual brilliance of a dystopian future, and a triumph of pre-CGI cinematography! I would score it higher but the story and characters are firmly locked into Marlowesque territory. The scifi element is dealt with merely in the short interview between Roy and Tyrrell, and a few descriptions of off-world activity. It is obvious watching the film now that so many films have lazily copied (but not really equalled) Scott's vision. The Final Cut was better than the original cinema release (middling), but the fuss about the meaning and the ending of the movie is way way overplayed. Let's face it, it is 'Frankenstein' with Roy (The Monster) pursuing the Robot manufacturer Tyrrell (the Baron) while Deckart (Philip Marlowe) tries to track the creature down and kill it. If Deckart is a replicant, as Scott later suggest, then much of the plot, set up, and action becomes flawed and unbelievable, and the film is a ridiculous hoax. They could have left out the Unicorn symbol (rubbish) and I presume it is only in to nod at the original Dick story title. Stick to the visual element and the final redemption of Roy as he rescues Deckart at the end to prove that robots have developed their own sense of humanity. That is the payoff, not naff unicorn origamis! The acting is okay, with Ford not really able to do much (outside of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, he has looked awfully overparted with a range that would not challenge Arnie Schwartzenegger!) but grimace, and everyone else in fairly deliberate robotic mode (so you don't guess the replicants). But then Ridley Scott and actors/characterisation do not mix well, as we all know now 20 years later!",Null,1,2,26 August 2011
Thor: The Dark World," OK in parts but seen it all before
","'Thor - the dark world' has some good moments, particularly the gags and the characters of Loki and Thor himself, but most of the rest is bloated CGIsville and ham portentousness. The plot is straight out of 'Lord of the Rings.' The dark side of life portrayed by the Black Elves (very reminiscent of The Teletubbies!) are rising (originally the Universe was dark until Thor's Grandad sent them packing and brought the Light). However, the Elves' main ultimate weapon - the Aether (cue misty red smoke) - was not destroyed but buried beneath a fifties car park in East London!!!! Where's that Ring when you need it?! Thor's girlfriend (Natalie Portman - the Elves are taller than her!)discovers it and becomes a carrier - fortunately she does not suffer Gollum's fate of disfigurement. Now that would have been a plot twist! The rest of the film is the Black Elves trying to get hold of the Aether while Thor, Loki and assorted London-based Earthlings attempt to prevent them. The best bit is the relationship between Thor and Loki with some good acting from Hemsworth and Hiddlestone, but the attack on Asgard is a copy of Michael Shannon's rebellious effort on Krypton, and from then on in the plot holes get bigger and bigger. True, the destruction of Greenwich - as Thor and Chief Baddie battle it out - does not go on as long as 'Man of Steel' in New York, but is a yawnfest. Isn't it about time that audiences started to give these Comic book adaptations the b**'s rush? They are getting so similar and boring.",3,8,12,22 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Retread of previous efforts but with relentless action
","Don't get me wrong - this is an exciting movie that does not let the franchise down. But we have seen most of it before, some almost frame by frame. Putting a woman and a black male actor upfront as heroes really is tokenism in trying to make the film distinctive, because it is not. Yes, the CGI is better than some earlier efforts and it looks realistic compared to some $200M comic book adaptations around. True, the action is relentless (Mad Max has obviously started a trend - one to be regretted), and the film suffers for it. The villains are underused and really pretty pathetic - the son of Han and Leia could not frighten a kindergarten birthday party! And the Starkiller base must have had a very secretive funder over the previous decades of chaos following the death of the Emperor! Resistance and Republic - just another theme thrown away in the rush. And how does the heroine turn into a pretty potent jedi with absolutely no training?! Answers another day, I suppose. Okay, but not worth the long wait on balance!",6,7,22,5 January 2016
Godzilla," Good attempt but tries too hard
","This is a valiant attempt by Gareth Edwards to make a significant westernised 'Godzilla' movie. Much of it is good, but it is let down by trying too hard to be significant (too much of American humans saving the world as usual) and lets itself down badly by delaying the entry in full scope of the King of the Monsters himself. The bad guys - Mutos - are too derivative, less interesting to look at and wonder about, and never given a proper description of their destructive powers, and given too much screen time compared to Godzilla. The story takes a long time to wind up - the much underused Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins just have to look frighteningly surprised as creatures begin to emerge into reality. Trashing Las Vegas comes not a moment too soon, and the sub plots with the young soldier and his father play out in far too familiar ways. There are tropes from too many other movies, including US army platoons fighting aliens/monsters almost alone. Worst move of the film, Gareth, almost as bad as the Halo jump copied from 'Starship Troopers 3!' But let's get onto the good. Spectacle, some excellent CGI (especially the wreck of Janjiro power station), a very good Godzilla who moves properly, a great deal of tension and build up, and a grandstand finish (perhaps too much destruction - also a fault of 'Man of Steel'). You get swept up in it, but the faults start as soon as you start thinking about it afterwards. But it does deliver a lot of the time.",7,1,5,18 May 2014
Easy A," Slick, smart and satirical
","A teen rom com for the MTV generation, with an above average script. The story is of a girl who somewhat parallels a classic US novel of the nineteenth century - 'The Scarlet Letter.' Emma Stone in the lead (with a bright future one hopes) gets a reputation for having lost her virginity (and the rumour mill really moves into overdrive) and then proceeds to get an even worse reputation by helping losers by allowing them to claim they also had sex with her. It all gets out of hand although a stoical handsome hot guy is wandering about in the background waiting his moment. The acting is very good, the direction a little over the top and repetitive, but steady, the soundtrack helpful, and the script full of satirical comments on teens, non-judgemental parents, the internet, relationships etc. So a good hoot with a slice of American hypocrisy laced in amongst the apple pie! Hollywood might just be alive and well - this on an under $10M budget!",7,1,2,29 October 2010
The Ugly Truth," Ugly awful!
","You have to go a long way to see worse. Poorly scripted, shoddily directed, minimal plot, loses its way after twenty minutes, pretends to be grown up by using a lot of swearing, and wastes its cast. And where's the sub plot apart from the obvious girlfriend who tries to get the star actress a date? As for the se# knickers joke - you have to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Heigl plays the same part as in that awful 'knocked up' - cue gorgeous successful girl falling for dickhead (I know Butler is better looking than Rogen but the character is the same!)without really convincing us that he is worth it! A few jokes at local TV in US don't make a film, and a couple of the writers were involved in 'Legally Blonde' - you're kidding! Oh, have just seen first fifty minutes of 'The Holiday' - it bears comparison for awfulness! Only excuse I have is that I saw it on plane and missed some of the worst of the swearing!",2,5,8,5 January 2010
The Social Network," Not as good as the hype!
","In the fifties and sixties, the BBC in the UK used to produce drama documentaries - plays with deliberately no stars that were a rendition of actual events and characters, eg today's made-for-TV biopics. The scripts were fairly plodding and there were no directorial visual flourishes, but it was fair. 'The Social Network' is in this mould - pretty good but ultimately fails to deliver - except it's got Hollywood production values (and a few other sorts), a script by a crackerbarrel writer, and an auteur as director. Sorry, lads, the script, yes, has its' moments and its' flourishes, but almost completely fails to explain the motivation or characterisation of some fairly creepy people. While the direction could have been left in the hands of a second year Film School student for all the effort expended. Compare the sequences of seduction by a satanic business figure in 'Wall Street 2' - a tour de force - and the anally retentive, hero worship sequence in this picture. Fancy letting Oliver Stone outgun you, Mr Fincher!As we all know, the film is about the creation of the present day social phenomenon called 'Facebook' and its subsequent falling out between the major players leading to litigation. It's a multi-billion company, but we are not told how it makes money/its' business model, despite one of the founders - Eduardo Saverain - being portrayed as hopeless in trying to get the business off the ground by flogging advertising (this point is rammed home four times at least, but we are not told what does work!). We also never are given an explanation why Eduardo likes the eminently up-his-own ass Zuckerberg in the first place - a dimension on which the whole drama of the film depends! I do understand that the legal consequences of over-egging the script were very great and the explanations at the end are glib and suppositional, but something other than joining Harvard clubs, getting laid, and 'the family' (The Sopranos are mentioned!) as motivators is expected of a 'great' script!The acting is very good, but eventually becomes boring and one-paced as there is no development of character. We are also never told or experience what makes 'Facebook' so powerful for so many people! How can that be in a critically acclaimed film? The ending just fizzles out like most of the promised drama, and would any female want to see this bunch of nerdy geeks (I suppose Justin Timberlake might just make it!)? And as for the orgy lite dimension of rich Harvard boy clubs - strip poker where nobody gets their underwear off, and strippers who also do not get their underwear off! Really, that's the parallel of the deep-seated fault at the heart of the script and whole film - a tease that fails to show what everybody is really interested in. A terrible missed opportunity!",6,11,18,23 October 2010
Valkyrie," Brave attempt
","No spoiler required - Hitler doesn't get killed! A thriller attempt to tell the July 20 plot that succeeds in engaging one, but misses a trick when it does not portray clearly enough the all-pervading menace and danger of trying to overthrow Nazism. It's as if the script assumes that everyone remembers from their school History syllabuses the Nazis and their bad press! Character development is a little short - again it is assumed that everyone in the audience is against Hitler so no need for subtlety or variation of motive of his adversaries. Tom Cruise does a noble job of not dominating the action, while Bill Nighy acts in this as opposed to being just himself. But the endless parade of English thesps - I don't include Eddie Izzard as one! - detracts for a British audience the germanic nature of the story. I'm afraid David Bamber's Hitler(OK as a performance) is a direct crib from 'Downfall,' so why didn't Bruno Ganz do it! Kenneth Cranham as Keitel is awful, but the film does not overegg the pudding, and largely succeeds in portraying a difficult moment in time as the Nazi regime crumbles, but too many Germans watch and wait for the Allies to finish off the monster.",6,3,5,5 February 2009
The Martian," Very very ordinary and boring for long stretches
","Someone came up with the idea in Hollywood that the hopeless position of 'Apollo 13' could be crossed with the CGI/techniques of 'Gravity.' And as the story is not true we can really go to town on the jeopardy elements in space as well as on Mars. Hence we have someone left behind on the red planet with little hope of rescue, trying desperately to think of ways of staying alive - Daniel Defoe - does he still get royalties for rip offs of 'Robinson Crusoe?' For most of the time it all seems comparatively easy, and you do not believe for one minute that we are anywhere but in the desert on Earth, even Wadi Rum from 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Atmosphere is the same!!!! Work is just a matter of humping a few things, and trouble can all be fixed with white tape!!!! The middle of this film is awfully boring and totally uninteresting - drama having to be provided by painful expressions of disbelief and horror at the predicament of Matt Damon (the stranded astronaut) by Edifor and Wiig that does not really convince. Action in the last third is pure Hollywood - let's space walk without a safety rope, and we can cut our spacesuit to use pas propulsion! For most of the film you are looking and feeling with Matt Damon (not a lot as he is given little to work on), but just in case you did not get his predicament, there is a totally redundant speech by him on what he faced as the final scene! But worst of all, there is a hole in the plot so large it undermines the rickety edifice of a superficial movie completely. They leave Matt Damon because of a storm on Mars which threatens to topple the MAV (escape rocket back to orbit), and it would have done if they had not left. Guess how Matt Damon escapes the red planet? Another MAV has been sent early for a later mission and is sitting upright untouched some thousands of kilometres across the surface! Oh, really, come on Mr Scott and Hollywood that is cheating your audience. Acting is basic and perfunctory. Direction just a red shaded desert scene with endless vistas. Script needed heavy doctoring - forget the jokes, they are mere pleasantries! Overall another over-hyped film that is pretty empty and ordinary.",3,37,82,8 October 2015
Up in the Air," A grown up film at last
","Well, would you believe it? A Hollywood film that takes its' time, does not flinch from showing what it is like to have the American Dream kicked from under you, and does not have a happy ending. Um, after the absolute rubbish of 'Avatar' some one is still trying out there on the west coast. The story of a single corporate man busily maintaining his isolation and professional objectivity (Clooney) as he busily fires people very professionally as a sub contractor, is a sombre (but lightened by some comedy) theme. It harks back to Frank Capra and sixties European art-house with 'a man in search of his own identity' - indeed the final shot of Clooney standing in front of an airport departures screen is almost a replica of Marcello Mastroianni at the end of 'La Dolce Vita' staring at the huge fish on the beach. The script does not play too high but reels out comfortably. It does not quite have James Stewart or Jack Lemmon to really give it oomph, but George Clooney gives it an understated quality that works quite well. The supports are okay, but the plot for the last forty minutes as things are tied up and characters find their redemption or not feels forced and jerky. Vera Farmiga's character would seem to have as many if not more issues than Clooney's - or is the message that women in the USA can have it all - family, career and great sex on the side? But it just about keeps going, even if you feel a little cheated at the end. There's even enough for Anna Kendrick's character to semi-triumph and the 'real' unemployed to give a message of hope to Americans that all is well in the great country - when it patently isn't. As I say, after the numbing clichÃ©s of 'Avatar' and the tosh now being served up in the multiplexes, this is a refreshing and welcome movie.",8,2,5,28 January 2010
