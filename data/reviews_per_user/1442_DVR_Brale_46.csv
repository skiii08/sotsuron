The Devil's Advocate," What makes this movie very disturbing at the same time makes it amazing
","Evil promises everything but gives away nothing. This quote, which I like very much, sums up the point of The Devil's Advocate.In this movie skillful lawyer goes to New York to pursue career of his dreams. He makes many compromises with his conscience on the way and even starts to neglect his romantic relationship.It's really unbelievable that this movie isn't more popular than it is. It's got all the elements of a serious, adult thriller. It is true, however, that this is a very disturbing portrayal of someones life going down the spiral. What makes this movie great, makes this movie disturbing and vice versa.We've all seen many movies devoting to much time to unnecessary violence only to disturb you, not to utilize it so that story line actually benefits from it. However, all the violence, nudity and disturbing material in The Devil's Advocate fit nicely with the plot. I don't remember anything disturbing not being in concordance with moral of the story - that is to point out to viewer how the Evil actually operates.Now recall the book of Genesis chapter 3, verse 1: 'Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.'Many movies have portrayed Satan as an ugly, violent monster often not intelligent enough. This movie portrays the Evil one as it actually is: intelligent, subtil, patient, taunting, masquerading as the angel of light. And one more thing: He hates God. His true call is to convince people loving God does not exist.If you're looking for a movie which provocatively raises philosophical and theological questions in a way a book never could, look no further.",8,13,15,29 July 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Visually magnificent drama with complex narrative
","Most of the SF movies I've seen so far don't put enough emphasis on what an everyday life would look like in the near or far future. Blade Runner 2049 is different. Besides developing a story suitable for academic debates, Villeneuve really draws you in the futuristic world with punctilious detail. Depending on how much you're able to notice and appreciate those details will determine how much you get to enjoy the movie. And depending on how much you're able to scrutinize philosophical elements in the narrative will determine how much you appreciate it in the long run. So, if you want to get a full experience of BR 2049 you first have to carefully watch it and afterwards give your self some time and think about the story and problems it raises. That explains why there are so many cursory reviews with bad rating here on IMDb. Let's face it: this movies simply isn't made for the masses. BR 2049 is slow-paced, dark, visually absolutely stunning SF drama set in Brave New World type of setting. Story is of course connected with the original so despite others claiming otherwise, it's important that you first see the original. And that's all you have to know about it. Let me only mention that a lot of debates concerning neuroscience and what is called neurophilosophy are in front of us. That being said, this movie is only going to be more and more relevant plus we can expect more movies like this one. If you're interested in those topics, equip yourself with patience and be sure to give this movie a shot.",9,2,10,23 April 2018
Alien 3," As good as the first two Alien movies
","I don't think I ever diverged that much in opinion about a movie with IMDb reviewers or critics. This movie delivered much more than I had expected. It's no surprise that Alien 3 was received better internationally than in USA since this movie has something artistic in it, something not appreciated by American crowd. Furthermore, this movie is a perfect example of how 'fans' can help to bring a movie down: they're just not capable of appreciating something new and always think It's best to just hark back.Alien 3 can be best be described as a combination of the original Alien and milieu from Twelve Monkeys starring Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis. There are no guns here, no massive shootings, no futuristic technology, no spaceship. It's dark in here, claustrophobic, dirty.What really amazed me is how successful Fincher was in using humor to assuage such a dark world. There are really funny moments very cleverly put so that they make this dark world feel like inhabited and made by humans. Most of the people in here are prisoners who work physically demanding jobs, far away from civilization as we know it. Moreover, humor helps us to keep in mind that there prisoners are still human even when exposed to such harsh circumstances and after doing horrible crimes.Critics are right to point out how editing and cutting makes you feel confused, not knowing what's happening. Well they're right. I think that doesn't have to be necessarily a bad thing. Since there are no weapons here, all protagonists were vividly confused and very scared. These cuts put you in their position. Alien 3 really stands out from other movies from Alien series.I will conclude with recommending this movie to all of you who love dark and dystopian atmosphere even if you're not into Alien series because this is a great and bold movie.
<ul><li>- - - -</li></ul>EDIT: I've seen Assembly cut version so everything written above refers to it. It was interesting to watch making of this movie and see what happened behind closed doors and with what problems Fincher had to deal. Maybe overcoming those helped him to become a great director.",9,2,2,6 January 2019
Requiem for a Dream," Dreadful, disturbing, grievous and most serious movie with superb acting
","I've been thinking lately why is this movie named Requiem for a Dream. Now I realize: drugs end even the most beautiful dreams.All characters in this movie have something in common, apart from being addicts. That is, all of them have a dream for a better future. All of them suffer from some emotional wounds and give in only to relieve themselves, at least for a few moments. Sadly, pursuing temporary relief distracts us from dealing with real problems. Those problems continue to grow and eventually come upon us thus ending our dreams for better times. That's why Requiem for a Dream. Title suggests that we are not going to see a happy ending but a sad one put in contrast with life protagonists deep inside want to live. I still remember crying together with Sarah Goldfarb when she hugs her successful son in her beautiful red dress she wanted to fit so much into.Let me now comment on Ellen Burstyn performance. I've never seen better female performance as a leading actor. It's very unfortunate she didn't win an Oscar for this role she was nominated for. Scene where she's talking with her son about how lonely she feels is the most convincing play ever. Her face is exposed full screen for two long straight minutes. There's an interesting story accompanied with this scene. If you look it carefully, you're going to see that there is something wrong with the camera. That's because one of the camera men began to cry while filming the scene. I challenge anyone to name more convincing performance than this monologue. Really, her performance is breath taking...If Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans didn't perform excellently as well, Burstyn would have overshadowed them. Harry (Leto) and Marion (Connelly) together form a couple worth watching. Both of them had tough roles to play but succeeded in doing well. Both of them were young at the time when this movie was shot and both grew up to become great actors and were awarded with Oscar. Ellen is over eighty now and still plays regularly... Wayans was extra cool as Tyrone but nowadays takes much lesser roles. This movie wouldn't be as near as good as it is if acting wasn't superb.Requiem for a Dream was edited in a hip-hop style which may confuse some viewers. I liked it! It somehow immersed me in the world where Harry, Marion and Tyrone live. This world is extremely disturbing. That's why RfaD is not a movie I could recommend watching. For some viewers seeing it might be a terrifying and dreadful experience, especially last few scenes. I really don't recommend seeing this movie if you're under eighteen even though some recommend seeing it as an anti-drug prescription. This might be true but it's certainly true that RfaD causes anxiety.Let me conclude: RfaD is very disturbing and scary indeed. However it has a strong anti-drug message. If you're easily disturbed, seeing this one might be a bad decision. If not, Marion, Sarah, Harry and Tyrone are going to stick with you for a very long time.",9,1,2,8 September 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," Slow building & plot alternating claustrophobic bunker movie with a sloppy ending
","I've always loved movies with strong atmosphere. Three people locked together in an underground shelter is a recipe for making a movie which is going to draw you in a rather small but peculiar world.This is one if the rare non-crime movies that keep you guessing what might have happened and what's happening. No where does the plot release it's vents but on contrary it keeps building pressure.There are little if any horror elements in this movie. Those of you who want to get scared are not going to be content. Those of you looking for a tense, slow building atmosphere are going to love this one! This is primarily a mystery movie.John Goodman has done such a good job that he even succeeded in making me nervous like I was locked with him. There's nothing really strange about Howard. The conditions are guilty for making him looking wicked. Or are they?While the main premise has been greatly utilized I don't think ending was sound or in some way contributory to a plot. It's as if writers didn't know how to leave some space open for a sequel. You can enjoy this movie equally well watching it by yourself or with somebody else. Go and see it.",7,42,56,27 July 2016
It," Refreshing movie released just in the right time
","I believe many people are going to agree with me if I assert that It Follows, The Babadook and 'It' are maybe the best horror movies in the past several years. First two were dealing with pretty difficult subjects and were shot in low contrast setting. 'It' comes as refreshing. This movie can best be described as one long child nightmare filled with fantasy. It's very colorful, often funny and radiant on your imagination. Children are main protagonists but unlike in It Follows they appear much more playful and childish. If you're already familiar with S. Kings' work, settings and location will ring a bell. Everything looks as I have imagined it to be while reading his books. Small town with shady past is as authentically portrayed as it can be. When it comes to fantasy and horror, 'It' completely goes in S. Kings' fashion. He almost never gives an explanation for weird and supernatural occurrences. Things just start to happen. Exactly the same route has been taken in The Mist (2007) were monsters start to appear and a reason why is never given. Some may find this approach too simplistic but that is the main reason why his books and movies are so good. The entire focus is placed on imagination and the main goal is to make you a part of a nightmare; and you don't get an explanation for them, do ya?Everybody who found Kings' movies and books fun is surely going to enjoy this movie. I'd also recommend 'It' to those who like horror genre, especially if you're tired of heavy topics and over the top violence.",7,3,5,24 September 2017
Hereditary," Psychological and occult terror which builds and culminates at the very end
","Most of the top IMDb Hereditary reviews are sheer extravagance - reading them might leave you feeling disappointed at the end of the movie
------------What kind of movie is Hereditary? It's a movie where almost everything that happens serves as material for the final culmination. There are no particularly scary scenes until the very end; they tend to put you in a state of discomfort rather than scaring you in a classical sense. As the movie approaches final culmination you can already feel tired of being disturbed by frenzy you've seen so far. Who's going to 'enjoy' this movie? Probably everyone who's 'enjoyed' The Witch (A24 production as well) and Sinister (starring Ethan Hawke; stay away from the second part) both of which I recommend. Hereditary can even be described as a combination of the two: it has soundtrack and violence similar to Sinister and psychological terror peculiar to The Witch. As a result, Hereditary delivers both psychological terror and occult terror which don't stand separated but are interlaced. This fact is very important in creating such a sorrowful atmosphere.To be frank, there are some boring instances here and there, but I don't think they are without meaning. Critics gave this movie high rating for a reason and I think the reason is different aspects and sources of the terror being cleverly put together by those very scenes which do break the dynamic but give you reasons to think about the movie afterwards.Combination of which elements and to what proportions lead to all the tragedy and sorrow this family struggled against? The way Hereditary puts forward this question is what ultimately makes it a good movie. If you're not fainthearted and find the above stated question interesting, you might want to check it out.",6,0,1,20 June 2018
A Star Is Born," A Star is Dying
","I've gotta admit to you: I was expecting a lot from this movie since so many people had been saying it was really good. I'll say: it was really boring.Most of the movie you see Jack drinking and taking drugs and Alice going to the top and being around Jack. His drinking problem is a very important side of the movie, no doubt, but it shouldn't have become central and, sadly, only side of the movie. 'A Star is Dying' would have been a far more realistic name for this story.Music is fun and cool until around half of the movie; then it becomes boring since you see whole songs being played. So you listen to them and wait for the story to continue in the same fashion as before: Jack drinking and Ally singing. So don't expect anything you've seen in e.g. La La Land.In conclusion, A Star is Born had a potential to be really touching musical drama with music much better intertwined with the film. Unfortunately, to much drinking ruined it.",5,2,4,30 November 2018
Se7en," Philosophical inquiry about human nature packed as a criminalistic mystery thriller
","Why is Se7en so good? Well, one of the reasons is because it was directed by none other than David Fincher who is well known for his perfectionism. Other reasons include amazing cast and interesting concept with religious main premise. Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt and one I won't mention because Fincher decided to kip him as a surprise all delivered amazing performance. How can you not like Freeman's relaxed and gentlemanly attitude (he loves books) as opposed to Pitt's sort of angry and action type character (he loves chase)? Do you think that people who commit deadly sins deserve to live? Of course you do, but this serial killer doesn't. He thinks that the world is better without them. Theologically speaking, deadly sins are called deadly because they have been identified as a root cause to other sins and separateness from God. As a result, one who commits one of those, shall find nothing but darkness in his life and will eventually loose capacity to be happy. If one doesn't want to end like that (spiritual death) one has to firstly turn away from his sin, ask God for forgiveness and then expiate his sin. This serial killer is not merciful. He positions himself as a god who doesn't forgive or give chances to turn away from them. Since spiritual death is a final result from consistently committing deadly sins, this serial killer delivers physical death by murdering his victims in a way that particular sin harms them. He had given himself a right to deliver justice; but justice without love becomes cruel.After this short theological reflection let me now turn my attention to detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). As I mentioned earlier, they stand opposed but somehow complement each other. Together they discover frightening and bizarre murders and react in a way specific to them. This is important when you consider the ending. Everybody knows Se7en has one the most shocking ending ever made (other being Requiem For a Dream). Since committing deadly sins influences character as well (not only spirit), carefully watching both detectives actions ads to your understanding of Se7en. This movie is not about chase or little evidences analyzed by technology; it's about seeing people behind the mask, the way we truly are. That's at least what I think.So why did I give Se7en a symbolic seven? I don't have any particular reason. Se7en just lacks that something some other movies have. Apart from being shocking, it didn't stick with me. It's predictable as well, but it seems to me that Fincher decided to make it that way on purpose. We know what is going to happen and that gives us more 'space' to focus our attention on characters and the way they'll react and not on story itself. Soundtrack could be somewhat better as well. Se7en also lacks that noir feeling that would've made it better.So to conclude: Se7en is a shocking and cleverly made movie with great cast. Underneath the hub is a lot of material for reflection about human nature. Those of you more philosophically oriented are surely going to enjoy this one or should I say seven.",7,2,3,7 September 2016
Fury," Keeps focus almost entirely on few people thus failing to provide deeper insight to war terror
","I believe war movies are the most challenging ones to make. What other situation is so terrifying? How do you convey all the emotions one experiences during war time? Making a good war movie is such a hard task because it involves doing great camera job which is vital, developing deep characters so that viewers care about them, building a realistic world based on actual history (if the movie is WW 1 or 2) etc. But most of all, real war movie has to be disturbing just because real war is disturbing. You don't achieve that only by gore but by showing how pointless the war is. And that's not easy to do.Fury doesn't do that. It's got solid camera work, different type characters, some nice effects, in my opinion very good soundtrack. There are some scenes which bring emotion to surface. But they're done superficially. I didn't feel real terror while watching this move.Americans are as usually to powerful to stop. SS soldiers are on the other hand depicted as almost not being human. The movie really focuses on Don (Brad Pitt) and Norman (Logan Lerman). I was watching other protagonists through their point of view because two of them permeated the entire movie.In conclusion: if there were more external aspects alongside main characters, like other people's tragedies and survivals, this movie would be a lot better. But that might would've made this movie a whole lot different.If you're in for some shooting - go for it!",6,0,2,27 July 2016
Alien: Resurrection," This movie trades atmosphere for action thus ruining the experience
","It really makes me sad and disappointed to see this movie having better metascore rating than Alien 3. Fans blasted previous movie with all sorts of arguments but seem to speak more positively about this one which is, in my opinion, several levels below it.First three Alien movie have very strong atmospheric elements; they really draw into the story. This one never succeeds in doing that. Character development and slowly building scenes are traded and sacrificed for action and gore. Besides, whole thing feels very sinister and occult. It's no secret that Alien movies have something to do with eugenics (in a particular sense of creating a perfect race) which is clearly visible in this movie and Alien Covenant. While I have no problem with that topic in Alien context, I think they went a little too far with it and with sexuality in Resurrection.Concerning character development, it's done poorly compared to previous Alien movies. First three films were somehow able to develop characters without using too much words instead concentrating on movements, face expressions and similar. Resurrection protagonist, whom I almost don't even remember, say stupid and unnecessary things. Everything feels non-authentic.In conclusion, this is by far the worst Alien movie but still enjoyable as an ordinary action/horror film.",6,1,1,6 January 2019
12 Monkeys," Multiply layered masterpiece
","Who doesn't like atmospheric movies? Those that can drag you into their world and make you feel like a part of it? Atmosphere is that aspect of a movie which can make up for other ill made aspects. It's like a glue which makes entire movie experience coherent and credible.Twelve Monkeys is one of those movies. From beginning to the end it drags you every moment more and more into it's milieu. Sometimes it's a futuristic milieu and sometimes, rather most of the times, pretty ordinary 90's ambient. And still everything ordinary somehow tastes extraordinary. That's because we're following a story from Cole's (Willis) point of view. Going back to the past felt for him like being born in entirely different world. Clouds and air. People and the way they dressed and looked. Everything was different. And yet everything kinda looked so familiar. Like he had seen it before. This emotional element of somehow rediscovering this world as natural in contrast to unnatural and quaint underworld plays a pivotal role in engaging the viewer into Twelve Monkeys ambient.What else makes a good sci-fi movie? I believe one of the most important aspects is seriousness. Not that seriousness without any kind of humor, but rather that one which takes future events and the way they correlate to us today seriously. Twelve Monkeys does it both ways. Past and future are being delivered to the viewer in a somewhat cataclysmic manner. You know how everything is going to eventually end, but still believe inevitable might somehow be side moved. I won't go into much detail of how good Willis, Pitt and Stowe are. But I'll tell you that both Pitt and Willis nailed very demanding roles. As one reviewer said it, Cole experiences serious time travel side-effects which makes the entire movie look more credible. Too bad Pitt hadn't won an Oscar for this role but got it for 12 Years a Slave where he just didn't have enough opportunities to show everything he's got. Madeleine Stowe play more important role than it might seem in the beginning.I'd even say that she plays an almost central role. Not only is this movie amazing as a sci-fi movie, but it also has a very powerful romantic side as well. I'd even go so far as to say that sci-fi elements serve as means to reinforce romantic and personal struggles one faces in a world in which only some people decide 'whether something is right or wrong'.I'll finish with a short note. This is one of those movies which, if seen correctly, can make you appreciate life more. It can provide you with material for reflection in forthcoming months. Be sure to get most out of it.",9,2,3,27 April 2017
12 Angry Men," Sixty years later and still better movie hasn't been made
","I wanted to take a while before writing anything about 12 Angry Men. Before I saw this movie I had been thinking about how can a black & white movie, made in the 50's and shot almost entirely in one room, be fifth on IMDb? Now, after seeing it, I'm thinking about why is it not rated even higher. In this review I'm going to try to explain what makes this movie so brilliant. First, have you noticed how this movie feels so natural? Not even once was I feeling bored or exhausted. Everything runs so smoothly, constantly making you more interested in what had really happened. One of the factors which makes this so is interrupting serious debate with brief and sometimes longer scenes which don't contribute to understanding the topic. Nothing is omitted. This dynamic (which Hollywood nowadays doesn't utilize) serves as a mean to present that humans don't operate as computers. We are intrinsically flawed and able to enjoy, be serious or disdain certain situation. Recall, for example, scene in the bathroom, talking about sports, playing with fan, etc. This gives viewer some space and time to think about what had been said. You can make your own judgment and defragment all information. Viewer thus becomes a sort of a '13-th juror' actively participating in a conversation.Second, this movie raises serious questions about how can we know anything about historical events. How do you evaluate and interpret given evidence? There are two schools about the topic: first claims that one can never objectively construct sequence of events because of our subjective nature; second claims that we can objectively assert what really did happen. This two approaches make much sense in 12 Angry Men. Some jurors are unable to objectively asses the evidence because they are very restrained by their own feelings or prejudices. The way they interpret the material is thus very biased (Juror #8: 'It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.') The point is that every one of jurors (including the viewer) is biased but they take different approaches to the problem. This leads us to third point.Everything said above lead us naturally to the problem of jurisdictional decision making. The most important thing here is the term of reasonable doubt. Some of the jurors don't actually understand what does that mean so they can't handle the problem well. It somewhat scary thinking about how can twelve men from different backgrounds, of which some don't event understand or care about the case, make a decision about someones' life. If the juror is not convinced beyond reasonable doubt (not any doubt!), than he's obliged not to accuse defendant guilty. Reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof one has to surmount if he's to accuse someone guilty. That's an important difference between exact sciences and law approach as one of the jurors notices (Juror #12: 'Oh, come on. Nobody can know a thing like that. This isn't an exact science.') So we see jurors one by one changing their belief when their certainty drops below reasonable doubt. This takes us to the next point.Let's take a closer look on the particular order each of the jurors voted not guilty. First you have a guy who just wanted to take a closer look at the evidence. He lit a spark. Then you have an old man wanting to hear why others think the accused is guilty. One by one the change their minds. The last ones where a guy who had prejudices about 'street children' and the juror who was shouting all the time. This was done intentionally. People who had personal problems with something or someone are always hardest to engage in objective discussion about the issue. Forgiveness is a cure, not turning back on it. Nobody convinced the last juror to change his mind; he convinced himself after seeing a picture of his son. It's like his heart (not mind as with others) couldn't take it anymore. Juror before him had general prejudices. Those people can have a hard heart but are more easy to engage than those with personal problems. He realized his mistake after everyone had started to ignore him. Those with personal problems must confront them by themselves; those with prejudices must confront with others. So the conclusion is that it's harder to confront with someone whose problems lie in their heart than with those whose problems lie in their mind.Closing remarks: Table has always been an important component in our western culture. It's a place where all important decisions are made and where people get to eat and drink and know each other. That's why one the last shots is camera smoothly running over the table jurors where sitting at. Someone was there and something happened. It's a contrast to the last scene where we see Fonda leaving the building and disappearing into the crowd. Twelve men, who had never seen each other previously and don't even know each others names, with completely different backgrounds and profiles, accidentally sat together and did something important. Now they continue on, probably never seeing each other again. But table stands as a witness.There are many other elements left to be analyzed. It's better to speak about them sitting at the table discussing with other people than reading a review. I hope this general description of the movie mechanic helps someone understand what lies underneath the hood or makes her or him approach this movie with more scrutiny.",10,2,3,17 February 2017
Hostel," Hostel's primary and only goal is to disturb you using serious and the most important topic of selling human organs on the black market
","Hostel is one of the first horror movies I've seen. I was eleven at the time when it first came out. I saw it only once, ten years ago. I'll try to recollect the best I can since I don't want to see Hostel again.Hostel in fact deals with a pretty serious and hard subject - selling human organs on black market. A story goes something like this: three friends go to Slovakia only to have fun. Along that way they meet some hot girls who seem to only want to have some fun. Of course, they have another goal in mind. And there goes the horror...Hostel is not a frightful movie. It's more disturbing than actually scary. If someone is not a fond of gory movies, they can drop Hostel off their watch list. Hostel is not a gore fest movie, but scenes where people are tortured are made pretty convincing. Hostel depicts a sick world, underworld, where people are brutally tortured and killed for their organs. Few people will enjoy watching this one since it deals with the most important topic in a very brutal fashion. Those looking for some nonsensical violence and cleverly put scary ideas won't find any of those here. The closest movie to Hostel I can remember is SAW, but far less original.To conclude: There's not much left to analyze. If you asked me ten years ago if I would recommend this movie, I'd surely respond with 'yes'. Today, I really don't see why would someone watch Hostel or any of this kind of movies. Hostel is not enjoyable, scary, nor it creates tension. It uses serious topic only to disturb you; and I don't see why would anyone want to make themselves feel that way.",5,0,2,29 August 2016
Green Room," See only if you like seeing one group of people chasing the other and stay away from hype
","Since almost everybody's talking about the upsides of this movie, let me mention a couple of main downsides I found important.Green Room is a perfect example of how hype can ruin the entire movie experience. Mine expectations had been very high due to unexpectedly high critical approval and user ratings. I felt disappointed half-way through the movie.First, action is not at all fast paced or ample. From what everybody wrote, I concluded that Green Room must be something like Hardcore Henry; non stop mayhem put together nicely with music. But most of the actions is chopped and delivered in a few tense sequences. That's not necessarily bad but it surely slows everything down.Second, this movie is not even a horror. Several squeamish bursts of action don't make a horror. Atmosphere is intense as in any other action oriented thriller. When it comes to violence, I have to admit that it didn't feel extremely violent like everybody is making it to be. All of the violence is usually brief and happens as a part of some other occurrence (nothing like in SAW series).Third, don't expect good soundtrack even if you're into punk music. I looked forward to seeing a horror movie in which music may play some sort of pivotal role. Putting band on a spotlight really does seem like a good starting point. But no. A few screams now and there and that's all you're going to get.Would I recommend seeing Green Room then? Only if hype didn't already precluded you from having a realistic expectations and if you're looking for a no brain cat vs. mouse game. If you want to see something scary or intelligent, skip it and see something better.",5,2,5,24 April 2017
Midnight in Paris," Tries really hard to feel charming but doesn't come close to European cinematography
","It's unfortunate that I saw this movie after I had seen Camille Claudel (1998). As good as Americans are when it comes to special effects so are they incapable of inspiring us with European spirit. Midnight in Paris tries really hard to feel and sound charming but does so only with superficial humor. Beauty of French language doesn't stand out as it's supposed to. Characters lack depth and spirit. Relationship between Gil and Inez is so superficial that I find it hard to believe that they are engaged.What bothered me the most is the feeling that this movie trivialized the beauty of relationship instead of reinforcing it with romance which appears out of every corner of Paris. Can someone in such a bad relationship as Gil is in be as normal as he appears? In know this is just a comedy movie, but c'mon Woody - how do you expect us to take anything seriously from a couple in which partners cheat on each other with such easiness? It's as if this movie came from someone who's never been in a relationship or never thought about those matters in depth.Aside from superficiality, kudos to Owen. He's the writer who takes life as delectable and he's the reason for which this movie was amusing to me. I'm not very familiar with historical figures he hangs out with but the way they are portrayed is very pertinent to the movie: all of them are not immersed in some kind of theory but in ordinary life and are able to drink the entire cup life offers. They are not lonely geniuses nor do they come from high-class. They are as normal as most of us are. Inez is the one who comes from high-class family! She's one of those people that will eventually die without ever having lived.Midnight in Paris can make you giggle but more importantly make you think about living life with more candor.And here's what I recommend: first see this movie and then French and European classics. Midnight in Paris just can't compete with those.",7,1,2,2 July 2017
Ready Player One," Superficially made adventure with some nice action sequences
","The biggest problem this movie has is the following: it's been made for the audiences younger than twenty, but heavily relies on culture elements many in that age group won't be able to understand or notice. Acting, characters and story are forgettable - overall, they lack that characteristic Steven Spielberg charm. I didn't get drawn into the movie, didn't feel as the part of the adventure. Of course, there is some romance, but it's been done rather superficially, not surprisingly since there lacks the character development. It seems to me that story writers couldn't figure out which characters to put emphasis on and develop more fully since OASIS and real world are on screen alternately. Visual effects are among the best I've seen. If you only want to see a two hour adventure without expecting any level of sophistication, go and check it out, especially if you have 4DX cinema near you.",6,0,1,4 April 2018
Suicide Squad," Not entertaining but irritating
","I expected this to be a fun movie. Most people have found it as such. But for some reason I couldn't help myself not to yawn. Suicide Squad disappointed me in every aspect.I had seen Ayers' Fury a few days before I saw SS. I immediately realized that SS is probably going to be full of clichés just as Fury (which is a much more serious movie) is. Using clichés is the easiest way to make a two hour long movie when you have a terrible plot. Unfortunately, Ayer took this cowardly way and ruined what could've been a good movie.Nowhere was the movie even able to entertain me or make me laugh. But it did a good job when it comes to irritating me. Margot Robbie just goes all over the place. She's the bait to attract horny fifteen year old boys to see the movie. Jared Leto delivered a solid performance; but Joker he impersonates was more a metro, semi-female character than a villain. Will Smith delivered just what I expected him to deliver - a cool performance as a leader of the squad. Other characters are just forgettable.Camera work is also done poorly. A more shaky camera would've been a lot better. All the action is very generic: there are no stunts or moves we haven't seen a million times before. And this I find as the biggest knock down. Having 'cool' characters will not compensate for poor action and moves.Poorly done action, almost not existing plot, bad camera work and easily forgettable characters make a bad movie.Don't waste your time and money on this one. Ignore the hype. You're not going to see anything you haven't seen before.",4,9,19,5 August 2016
Taxi Driver," An insight into isolated deteriorating mind and your mind as well
","Here I explain what is behind TD's success as a psychological movie.Even forty years after the initial release, Taxi Drivers is still a relevant movie from which we can learn important things. TD deals with far too serious subject to be easily forgotten or neglected. Conspicuously detailing effects of loneliness, Scorsese takes us right into a milieu and mind of a person who is suffering from chronic isolation left to his deteriorating mind.So we're following a story of ex soldier, now a taxi driver working nights in New York. As he drives we see dirty streets revealed by too bright street lights with strange looking people on the sidewalks. Our driver, Travis, doesn't value this people highly; in fact, he is disgusted by everything on this streets. Every now and then we can hear him sharing his thoughts, as a narrator, a background voice, on different matters. This gives us valuable insight into his mode of thinking, current feelings and mental state. So here we have a double insight: one into Travis' mind, world of subjective; second into his everyday life, world of objective. This portrayal is done in a Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground style since this work influenced development of Travis character.Here I shall emphasize what makes this movie special. This double insight, into subjective and objective, is presented very clearly. But it is the opposite with conclusions we can draw from this insights: we can not draw clear conclusions. Travis is not flagrantly troubled. Some of his comments and actions look pretty normal and sound. For example, he is pretty slick in approaching a girl. But on the other hand, especially towards the end, we are made sure his mental state is not a normal one. And there we have it: here we can experience from the first hand what it looks like to be manipulated by someone. Furthermore, we're even put in a position to feel bad for Travis! It's easy to think of him as a hero, as final scene reveals, and as a victim of society dissolved in debauchery.Here we can see that Taxi Driver can be seen as a movie with a very specific ability: it can trick you into thinking that you're doing psychoanalysis only on Travis when in fact you're doing psychoanalysis on yourself as well! That's because you change your opinion about Travis constantly as he gets mad and thus natural question comes up: why is that? And here you're confronted with your own motives and standards.So the careful watching of the movie can really serve as a kind of mirror in which you can see some Travis' traits in yourself. Pair this with prevailing theme of loneliness and isolation and you get a movie which can have a powerful impact on the audience.Here the details of the movie and plot aren't that important because there's nothing solid to hold onto. You have to see this movie and focus on Travis, seeing how his behavior reflects his inner dynamics and hearing him read his diary. Further topics which are explored include the so called Madonna-w***e complex and superiority complex, as well as misfortunes of living in a big city. So to conclude, let me mention that photography and music strongly contribute to TD's ambient. Taken all together, TD really is a great, one of a kind movie.",9,1,1,7 August 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Contains an important message underneath all profanity and mayhem
","This is my more of a commentary on the movie rather than a review. 
Three Billboards is not about those billboards, murder of an innocent girl nor about all the mayhem we encounter throughout the movie. It is not a crime movie as IMDb tag suggests. It's a tragic drama with dark comedy elements which mainly come from one-liners. I think the way this movie ends is a witness to that. Questions like: Who was the culprit who tortured Mildred's daughter; How did Mildred's relationship with the rest of the city came to be; Did she and Dixon kill supposed rapist at the very end - this and similar question are simply of no importance. If Three Billboards had ended with bringing culprit to justice and delineated details regarding mutual detours from normal citizen relationships, we could have easily thought this was a crime movie about the torture and murder of an innocent girl. That's probably the reason why McDonagh decided to end it somewhat abruptly. I think this story is about lack of communication which can lead us to believe others are not in the same team as we are, even occupying enemy positions. Three Billboards in a funny and sad way at the same time shows how dangerous that thinking can be. Acting publicly while holding grudges cannot bring anything good. Hence I think Mildred shouldn't have put those billboards at that time - she was to hasty, not giving enough thought about the potential aftermath. Law enforcement responded to her decision to put those billboards very poorly and there you have it - havoc and anger. And we know that anger begets more anger. Despite enjoying the movie thoroughly, I think some of the scenes and profanities were a bit too quaint. I believe it could've been even better without being so overwhelmingly profane and if Mildred appeared at least a little more feminine. If you don't mind that, you're completely safe to giving it a go. ~ If you found screenwriting and dialogues interesting, check out Birdman if you haven't yet.",8,2,3,15 February 2018
Split," Heads in the right direction but doesn't fully utilize its potential
","Split is a psychological thriller, not a horror. Everything this movie delivers, together with all suspense, culminates in the final few scenes. So don't expect seeing a movie in which particular scenes alone make sense or are able to scare you. It's like a one coherent experience in which what is to happen heavily depends on what has happened. And it develops slowly.As the story continues you somehow get to know one person with many different personalities. All of them stand as characters in themselves but tell one story about a particular individual named Kevin. Kevin kidnaps three teenage girls who serve as interlocutors; they don't take pivotal role. Split is not about them and their effort to escape. This is not escape the room stuff.Seeing how many different personalities interchange in between as if they were not manifestations of a single person is what makes Split so interesting. To help you understand what may be going on inside of Kevin's head, a woman psychologist is utilized as a facilitator. So you get to see Kevin (and some of his personalities) interact with several different characters as to bring about better understanding of why kidnapping and split syndrome. Let me mention that it's not all about Kevin only as you'll get to see as the final moments approach.McAvoy deserves every single applause he had got. Even critics who didn't like the movie thought acting on his part was excellent. Three young actresses who played girls that got kidnapped did what they were supposed to do. They're not spoiled or stubborn as teens in some other horrors.I gave it a six because I found the story of 23 different personalities as almost being an excuse for horrible things. Yes, at the bottom Split deals with very difficult and important issues of mental health and wounds we get from the love ones. No matter how sad his story may be, Kevin is a deranged and mentally unstable kidnapper. There's a moment where psychologists says that people like Kevin may have unlocked secret potentials and so somehow surpassed other people. This is pure wishful thinking which Shyamalan apparently took seriously. I may be wrong, but this quaint taste is what I had been left with after seeing it. Other than that, there are several boring and unnecessary parts which should have been replaced with something more interesting. There was a plenty of material for Shyamalan to do that given this topic.So to conclude. Split is somewhat original in his attempts to deal with serious issues like mental scars, but you'll enjoy it as much as your views on this issues allow you to.",6,2,12,26 April 2017
Disturbia," Very fun and great in creating special summer feeling
","I've seen this movie a couple of days ago and it delivered exactly what I wanted to see: a relaxing and fun mystery movie in which some young people do detective business in their neighborhood. Relaxing relates to the first part of the movie while fun describes the whole experience.In the first half of the movie you get acquainted with main characters and the neighborhood they live in. I really enjoyed it since it set relaxing summer tone. Then there comes the second part where mysterious things start to happen. And that's what's so cool about this movie; it's always fun to see unexpected horrific events taking place in the regular setting, entering into and dwelling in ordinary, not being main occupation and starting point. Horror is thus subsumed in the tone set by the first part and gets its flavor from it.Furthermore, there's a linear progress in terror - it starts benign, builds slowly by adding more elements which raise suspicion and then suddenly bursts. This terror is not characterized by macabre tone or gruesome imagery but rather builds tension and makes things more mysterious until the very end.All in all, this is a very fun movie to watch in the evening by yourself or with friends!P.S. As I was writing this review, for some reason I just couldn't get another movie out of my head: The Goonies (1985) directed by Steven Spielberg. Then I found out that Spielberg was executive producer of this movie. There are no words that can describe feeling Disturbia creates better then this connection.",7,1,1,21 January 2019
Dunkirk," Horrific event without horror
","First and foremost, Dunkirk is PG-13 movie. There's almost no blood, sweat and real war horrors in it. What we're basically seeing is a sort of a documentary. Dunkirk's primary goal is making you aware of in how difficult situation British and French soldiers were.That means that there's little dialogue in the movie. No personal story is embedded in it. But what is really strange is that there is not so much action neither. Action is distributed throughout the movie and always comes as a climax to previous developments. That's why you can hear silent but noticeable 'tika-taka' sound throughout almost the entire movie. Secondly, Dunkirk is a very tense and loud experience. Story itself never rushes but steadily grows until it bursts. I believe emphasizing that effect is the reason why Nolan decided to tell the story in a non-linear fashion from three different perspectives; that way he can constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. If that weren't so, Dunkirk would frankly be a boring movie.All in all, if you're tired of violence, superficiality and too much talking but love tense story-line, Dunkrik is spot on. As for the war movie veterans: you may find it a bit unconvincing. It's still worth giving it a shot.",7,6,10,23 July 2017
Aliens," Aliens has the greatest atmosphere which stays with you for a very long time
","Whenever I think of Aliens I immediately recollect and go back to the early 2000s when I first saw it. I was maybe seven or eight years old at the time. The atmosphere of Aliens captured me so much that it doesn't let me go to this very day. For a kid I myself was back then, Aliens was just another movie I had seen on TV. I didn't have any standards for what makes a great movie - I only liked it very, very much. Little did I know I would years later discover that Aliens won two Oscars and is one of the highest rated movies ever, being at great 65-th place on IMDb.Aliens is may all time favorite movie. No other movie did I and do I enjoy watching so much. James Cameron was able to create such a captivating atmosphere! Who would've thought back then that James Cameron would go on to make Terminator 2: The Judgment Day, Titanic and Avatar all of which immerse you in with its story and world? Is seems that James Cameron is an all time master when it comes to creating a milieu which blends all movie elements together and hence drags you in making you forget about time and problems.Aliens was made in 1986., so it's special effects (which won him Oscar, both for visual and audio effects which means they were amazing thirty years ago) can't measure up to nowadays standards; but that doesn't even matter! They did their job very well and provided finishing touch in Aliens space-ship world and aliens themselves. Anything more would've ruined what's far more important than SE since SE usually highlight only themselves and can drag you away from the rest of the movie. What more can you ask for when you've got the coolest guns (Private Vasquez anyone?) and the coolest aliens ever!? Not to mention the coolest female protagonist to this day to hit the screens, Ripley.Aliens is more action oriented than its predecessor which centers more on being suspense. If somebody would've told me today that movie I like went more action packed I would immediately postulate that it then must loose something to its atmosphere. I would've been so wrong if I made that statement about Aliens. Here, action is so well distributed throughout the movie that it not even once occupies a substantial amount of time or takes away from suspense. Although there's a lot of action, Aliens is still not an action movie; like IMDb suggests it's a sci-fi horror adventure with shootings as a flavor.Let me now briefly turn my attention to protagonists. Sigourney Weaver played Ripley in every Alien movie and was accompanied with beautiful Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection. Sigourney delivered very strong performance of a very tough Ripley in each and every movie in Alien series. That's how female protagonist should look like: reasonable, courageous and cooperative. Unfortunately, thirty years later all main female stars look like Rey from Star Wars VII: arrogant, non-cooperative, too powerful etc. Blame feminist movement for not having another Ripley! Everything I have to say about Ripley can be stated with: the greatest female movie hero ever. When it comes to other crew members I remember private Hudson played by always easily recognizable Bill Paxton whom I've recently seen starring in Frailty. He's on Terminator 1 and Titanic as well. After Ripley, however, pvt. Vasquez (Janette Goldstein) is my favorite crew member. Just look at her red rag and woodland cameo pants together with tank-top! And oh men, just look at the weapon she's carrying! Goldstein is a blast and plays minor roles in Terminator 2 and Titanic as well. Alien queen can be seen as a standalone character as well. Just wait till you see her. Newt (Carrie Henn), a child stuck on board, just makes you feel warm around your heart. I'm so glad Cameron decided to make a child as a crew member as well since she by her own presence forces all other crew members to show their easy and gentle side. Henn was ten at the time. Now she forty, married with children. Time flies...Aliens has it all: a beautiful, real women protagonist with great crew members and chemistry among them. Even today very good SE, both visual and sound. Tense atmosphere with perfectly distributed action. Horror elements which blend with sci-fi environment. Story which keeps the movie rolling. The coolest aliens ever. Everything is very finely mixed thus summoning milieu which may just stay with you for a very long time.",10,1,6,3 September 2016
It Follows," 'The Shining' + 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' = 'It Follows'
","What a dichotomy between professional critics and general audience. I'm starting to think professional critics exist for a reason - they surely provide much deeper insight to this movie than almost anyone commenting 'It Follows''message boards.As I was reading message boards I quickly realized a few people came to know what 'It' really presents. This is a horror movie which, if watched superficially, doesn't give much impression. This is not 'SAW' type of a movie. This is more like Kubrick's 'The Shining' masterpiece which had a major impact on director David Robert Mitchell in making of 'It Follows'.So if you were able to enjoy and more importantly understand 'The Shining' you're be able to enjoy 'It Follows'. This is primarily a psychological horror movie.So what is the point of the movie? What does 'It' represent? If you want to figure that on you own, stop reading now. 'It' is the metaphor for emotional scars caused by family and sexual partners. 'It' is not a super-natural entity but a real emotional struggle which exists solely inside someone's heart and mind. How do you make a movie when you want to bring closer all the ugly pain which intoxicates us the from inside and keeps attacking like a monster almost never fading out? You make a super-natural surreal mystery movie which focuses more on giving you chills and making you feeling really unpleasant than making you jump.And that's why critics are right: 'It Follows' is exceedingly dreadful experience. Distorted 90's synthesizer music ads much to the dreadful ambient. Soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard. Camera work and all other gimmicks, including acting, are on the expected level for a two million dollar budget movie. But these are really not important - music, concept and ambient is what furnishes unpleasant feelings and makes 'It Follows' a decent 'Nightmare on Elm Street' plus 'The Shining' spin-off.In conclusion: this movie is a valuable contribution to discussion on how sexual relationships can bring about bad feelings. If you're looking for a quaint and disturbing movie experience which covers a most serious topic, there you have it. Don't read message boards and don't take rating seriously. It might steer you away from a gem.",8,5,7,9 August 2016
Get Out," Creeps slowly and bursts formidably
","I have to be honest with you: when I first saw how good approval this movie had got I immediately thought that must be due to both actor and producer being black. I was wrong. Get Out is one the best horror movies in the last decade standing alongside with It Follows and The Babadook who have got over eighty Metascore rating as well which is very rare for a horror movie to have.So we are following an interracial couple visiting her rich (white) parents. Chris (her boyfriend) is a photographer and a very down-to-earth guy who may feel, well, a bit awkward surrounded by a bunch of rich white people. From the moment they arrive things look kinda shady. Nothing in particular prone to much suspect, but that gut feeling tells you that this family, least said, might not be the healthiest one. Creating this quaint ambient is what Get Out does the best. Not only that, but Jordan Peele even managed to fully utilize this mystery elements by creating few very eerie and unpredictable plot twists.Story itself isn't much of a big deal but does what is supposed to do: it creeps slowly and bursts formidably. Hence, Get Out is not fast paced (like Green Room) but rather makes you think about what is going on here. Different relationship which characters form with each other are worth noticing too. It is truly formidable to have people who you trust turn their back on you in most terrible way. Chris is experiencing snippets of this all the time but may as well think he is the problem. Just wait till you see the grand finale with this aspect!It is always dangerous to combine serious horror/mystery/thriller with humor because it might create a conflict between these two contrary sides. Get Out breaks the 'monotony of tension' by introducing a character who doesn't occupy much time not undermines basic genre and manages to somehow 'reset' the atmosphere by breaking it with humor; the mystery side then takes the lead and begins to glue the atmosphere back together, this time even stronger until everything bursts due to pressure. We've seen some basic mechanism which Peele utilized so let me immediately conclude. Get Out is a serious candidate for the best horror movie of the last decade or so. All the elements stick together because there is a strong atmosphere which serves as a glue. It is scary and funny. Get out of here and see it!",8,10,18,10 May 2017
Drive," Character oriented psychological neo-noir slow burn criminal drama with romance as underpin
","This movie is not about cars and driving. It's about something in man's nature which makes him susceptible to downfall to darkness and violence. That downfall can lead to problems with ones identity and so we're symbolically never told what is the name of our main protagonist since names can carry meanings. He is simply 'driver' who wears a famous scorpion jacket which is a substitute for a name the meaning of which we have yet to discover and verify.So we follow a driver that looks and behaves as a pretty normal guy who, inter alia, works as a getaway driver for criminals. He doesn't carry a gun or participate in heists but rather only drives criminals to a safe zone. We see him working in the introductory scene and later very rarely. What we see for the rest of the movie is how this 'slight' involvement in criminal activities affects him and people around him.Tone of the movie is neo-noir, a mixture of Lynchian dialogues and Fincher's darkish colors. Both of these are important. Since driver doesn't speak much you have to read his face and manoeuvres to try to understand what he thinks and how he feels. Besides, remember that he sometimes wears a jacket with a famous large scorpion sign on his back which has an important meaning and role. Concerning the overall dark and sometimes very violent milieu, I came to see that it's not gratuitous. It's role is to horrify you for the sake of better understanding of driver's character and decisions he makes. Violence first occurrence splits the movie into two parts which in turn adds to sharper contrast between amiable driver we got to know and his dark side. And that leads to greater shock value depending on the image of driver you had created throughout the first half. That shock can be pretty effective and lead you to reevalute your assessment especially if you had put driver's involvement with bad guys in second plan and put his tenderness first. Ultimately. I'd say Drive is a character oriented psychological neo-noir slow burn criminal drama with romance as underpin.Furthermore, there are other two things worth mentioning: soundtrack and camera angles. First really stands out and even plays a role because sometimes words used in a song depict directors intentions. Second is harder to notice at first but I urge you to take a look at YouTube analysis for better insights which will certainly make you appreciate Drive more and maybe make you watch it more than once. The point is that camera angles used in different situations reinforce a particular aspect of driver's character, e.g. low shots making him look superior and dominating.When we take everything together, Drive turns out to be a pretty solid and serious movie about driving forces behind some man's actions. If you're looking for a slow and more or less sophisticated multi-genre journey into darkness and violence, you've come to the right place.",8,2,3,8 February 2019
8 Mile," 'It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin''
","Once again I'm not able to write an objective review. I've been listening to Eminem since I was twelve. Many of his lyrics are stored right in my brain. His Infinite from 1996. is what made me a hip-hop fan even to this day.This autobiographical music drama is going to exhilarate Em's fans as well as hip-hop fans. Some others may find this movie boring or even ridiculous. When it comes to acting Eminem did a pretty good job for a rapper. I remember him speaking how hard he had worked in order to impersonate B-Rabbit. He had very little sleep (maybe few hours a day), took sleeping pills, wrote lyrics on set in spare time, had to drive long mileage to his place and back to the set. His fans know him well: if he's passionate about something he'll act almost like an addict.Other B-Rabbit's crew members did a solid job in acting. They were fun to watch and looked like they knew each other for years; even his opponents! I can only imagine Em's fans seeing B-Rabbit (Eminem) going toe-to-toe in a rap battle with Lil' Tic (Proof, R.I.P.) who was Eminem's best friend and amazing hype man. His fans know Proof's death almost ruined Em's career and sadly almost ended his life. Seeing them on stage, years after Proof passed away, makes me melancholic about early 2000's when Dre, D12 and Em swept the whole world with funky and violent Slim Shady as a leader. Look at his raw energy when he performed Square Dance (his concert intro theme) on Anger Management Tour 2002! You can clearly see the difference now without Proof. Back to the movie.When I was a teenage boy I almost fell in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy, R.I.P.). She was just to cute and cool! That short haired blonde girl played B-Rabbits girlfriend and did it amazingly; who can forget her cool, mellow swagger? Kim Basinger played Stephanie Smith, Em's mother he wrote so much about. She played his mother exactly as I had seen her from Em's songs. He's now sorry for writing 'Cleaning Out My Closet' and 'no more plays that song on shows and cringes every time it's on the radio' (Headlights ft. Nate Ruess). Michael Shannon (now starring in Midnight Special, 2016.) played Greg Buehl, his mother's boyfriend for whom B-Rabbit sings 'He's tapping my mom and we're almost the same age'. In reality, Michale is two years younger that Marshall.Now the music for which 8 mile won an Oscar. Opening scene hi-hats from Mobb Deep's Shook Ones pt.2 stick with me permanently. Feel Me Flow played by Naughty by Nature as well. What about Outkast's Players Ball, The Pharcyde's Runnin', Wu Tang Clan's C.R.E.A.M, Biggie's Juicy and many others? Not to mention first hip-hop song ever to win Academy Awards - Lose Yourself. 8 mile's soundtrack will delight all hip-hop fans and make them nod their heads.Story itself will be very familiar to those listening to Em. It's truly inspiring and in that 'stands head, shoulders and heart above other movies made that year' as Joe Morgenstern from Wall Street Journal notes. It's a story about passion for something. And that's Em's life story. Now, fourteen years after movie was made, Eminem's made such success and has won so many prizes that's it very hard to list all of them. Wikipedia notes he won 155 prizes and was nominated for 311 on them. He's won 15 Grammy awards and was nominated for 43 more. Sold more than 120 million albums. He's now 44 and still doesn't look like giving up or doing something else.In conclusion: 8 mile is a modern poetry in motion for which hip-hop fans will forever be grateful. Great punch lines and multies in wintry 1995. Detroit? You've gotta love it.",10,1,3,14 August 2016
Black Hawk Down," Almost completely action oriented war movie with amazing camera work but little elements which go beyond immediate battleground
","I've almost forgotten how patriotic Americans are before seeing Black Hawk Down again. There's almost no scene where natives are being portrayed as human beings. And that's my main concern with this movie. I think real war horror would have felt much better if killings of all those thousands and thousand of natives brought more emotion. Instead, this movie has a great replay-ability because it's fun and cool. Other than that, everything else is very fine; be it production, sound design, effects etc. I have to mention amazingly done camera work; camera is very dynamic and shaky hence putting you straight into the combat. Bad camera work was my main problem with David Ayer's Fury. So to conclude the first part: this movie is not similar to Schindler's List, but is more like Saving Private Ryan with almost non-stop action.Let me remind you that Ridley Scot produced Blade Runner (1982) and directed Alien (1979). Blade Runner was nominated for special effects and Alien won one for special effects. It's no wonder than that BHD feels so great and fast paced. If only I had seen it in the cinema! Acting performance was convincing and solid be it American soldiers or Somali people. In my opinion latter ones out-casted American soldiers. Their role was to play savages and they did a great job. And no matter what other claim, this dichotomy of savage-soldier is pretty obvious.I think directing and producing war movies is the toughest of all genres. Here you stand in front of a phenomenon which is much larger than anything else one person can comprehend. All those tears and pains, angers and reliefs, all those 'quite human' reactions and behavior has to somehow be presented to a viewer. I don't think BHD does that very good. I love, for example, scenes where American soldiers joke around in their base just before leaving for battleground. But this alone is just not enough. There's a scene where and old man bears a dead child in his arms in the territory where bullets fly around. All those attempts to present real war horror where overshadowed with focusing to much attention on one side only. Yes, I know plot was written to tell a story about those 123 American soldiers who had to fight someone else's war, but ten minutes would've been enough to make this much more emotional movie.In conclusion: if you're in for a lot of action accompanied by amazing camera work that will make you feel like a comrade, you won't find few movies as good as BHD. If you're looking for true war horror which goes beyond battleground, look for something else.",7,0,1,7 October 2016
Silence," Gives a deeper insight about gruelling problems Christian community faced but with personal walk in faith as well
","This is not a standard review but rather a reflection about the movie.-------------------At first I was a little dubious about Silence. I thought it would portray Catholics in a fashionable and biased way. So to begin with, Scorsese most certainly has not done that. Both Japanese and Christians are presented in an honest and engaging way. Apart from being shot beautifully, Silence raises very difficult and important theological questions. It is not only about persecution and evangelism but intrinsic religious emotion and relationship with Christ each individual grows in in his own heart. Scorsese struggled with religion throughout his life. Silence completes his religious trilogy. He was raised as a Christian and now at the age of 75 finally makes a movie he wanted to make for 25 years. This explains why Silence is permeated with personal struggle priests encounter in their missionary work in contrast to community problems Japanese Christians face.The main question Silence raises that I have identified is the following: Can you commit apostasy and still be a faithful Christian? It's a more difficult question than I thought it was. Christ clearly said: 'But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God.' (Lk 12, 9) On the other side, one may even bear martyrdom for his own faith, but what if others have to bear martyrdom for *your* faith? Is it then possible to commit apostasy on the outside only for the sake of others and stay true to Christ in the inside? What about martyrs then? Would there even be a Christian faith if everybody just committed apostasy and bore Christ only within without any external sings? I don't think Silence gives you answers to this and other questions but instead it confronts you with them in an unnerving way. And that is a good thing. If you decide to watch Silence, take into account deep personal issues it develops and reflect upon them within the silence of your heart. See it with proper attitude and think about it with forbearance afterwards. You might benefit more that you think.",8,0,1,25 March 2017
Midsommar," Few words of advice
","The aim of this short text is to give you some insights before you see the movie so you know to which elements you have to pay special attention.
-----------
It's rather difficult to write something specific and sensible about this movie. We see a group of young people coming to Sweden to witness some local community festivities. After being initially struck by paradise looking nature and hospitality of the locals, they begin to witness some of their weird and scary customs. And then we go...Almost entire movie happens during the day. There are no jump-scares. Nobody is coming after somebody. So I wouldn't describe this movie as a horror but rather as a psychological terror movie. And here's the reason why: Midsommar is successful in creating an atmosphere of distrust between the protagonists which makes us feel like not knowing who's going to do what and how. That's the exact reason why Midsommar makes us feel distressed.On the one side we have a pagan cult with whom we get acquainted as the movie rolls. On the other side we have a group of young people obviously shattered by life tragedies and mutual problems. Former represents a united community, later just a make-believe community. This is important to stress out since the director said in an interview that this is essentially a break-up movie (breaking up with someone is an act of bringing to an end community of two). That means that we shouldn't focus too much on the cult itself but on the protagonist's desires and reasons why. Why did each one in particular decide to go to Sweden? What were they looking for? How did this peculiar Swedish surrounding manage to bring forth their true faces? This movies isn't about providing us with psychological description of cult behavior but psychological description of our behavior, double-standards and hypocrisy.You may feel about the cult one way or the other but its purpose is in essence an instrumental one. And no matter how ugly they become, we can't doubt that they really believe in what they do. So it's important not to become to occupied with their rituals during watching of the movie. I'll conclude with some questions and tips which you can keep on your mind while watching the movie:<ul><li>pay the closest attention to Dani</li><li>keep in mind her family tragedy and think about how that affects her presence (movie will notice you to keep that in mind with few flashbacks)</li><li>think about Dani's relationship with Christian; this is very important as you'll clearly see in the final scenes</li><li>ask yourself if this pagan cult is group's enemy</li><li>try to answer what were their motives for going to Sweden in the first place</li><li>how this peculiar setting brought about their conformity and behavior?</li></ul>I hope these question help you during watching of the movie and thinking about it!",6,2,5,5 August 2019
La La Land," Perfect movie to watch with you partner
","I never thought I'd pay to watch a romantic musical, but as I began to listen to jazz I gave it a shot. Movie immediately starts with dancing and singing and so sets the tone for developing romantic narrative. If you're a jazz fan or like it, I'm sure you're going to enjoy La La Land even though plot is very simple and a bit girly. Emma and Ryan delivered good performances (their dancing and singing wasn't that good) but the main reason this movie is so enjoyable are amazingly chosen and arranged filming locations. La La Lands is split into four parts each representing one season (winter, spring, summer, fall); something like in Requiem for a Dream. Each part has its own ambient (coupled with appropriate music) which is made so well that sometimes I almost felt like I was there since those moments evoked some of my romantic experiences.There's no violence, coursing, drugs, sex and other garbage Hollywood is permeated with nowadays. That's why La La Land can give you that nice feeling of being dragged into another world (into La La Land) like you'd feel when you were a child. It's almost like a fairy-tale. And all that beauty was made with a small budget! My final recommendation is that you go to see this movie with your partner or date. Trust me, that will add even more to an already amazing movie.",8,1,9,10 January 2017
Sinister," Sinister has a context in which it's horror elements can add to each other and thus accelerate you into terror
","I still remember seeing Sinister four years later after it hit the cinema. And I don't think I'm ever going to forget that day I went to see it. This is the first and only movie I almost quit watching half-way through (if you ignore Sinister 2 which is second worse horror movie I've ever seen, right behind Deliver Us From Evil).Let me immediately emphasize what exactly made Sinister such a frightening experience for me. It is soundtrack. Sinister has the scariest soundtrack I've ever heard. It blends so well and so naturally with the movie in a way that it makes all the scary moments even more scary and horrible. Take a look at, for example, Sleepy Time '98. Don't tell me this music alone doesn't make you nervous.If you combine really creepy soundtrack with disturbing and mysterious snuff videotapes, which permeate the entire movie and go one by one not even allowing you to recover from the previous, then you have a movie which accelerates you into horror. I remember thus reaching a tipping point where I wanted to exit the cinema because tension seemed to grow exponentially. It does and it doesn't stop until the very end. If you've seen the original Paranormal Activity (2007) then you sort of know what awaits you.So, I've asked myself how come Sinister utilizes this simple concept so well and it's sequel, while using the same strategy, fails miserably? Yes, original Sinister has far better soundtrack and a little better snuff movies, but that's not enough to make such a big difference. The explanation lies in utilizing different sub-genre: original Sinister is a mystery horror; sequel doesn't have a strong mystery side but replaces it with a romantic side story. Sinister is so scary because it has a certain framework in which his horror elements make sense and can fully develop. Sinister 2 just tosses snuff videotapes into us as if they alone are enough to make you uncomfortable.Chemistry between family members is far, far more convincing in original sinister then the sequel. Ethan Hawk has been nominated for two more Oscars after playing Ellison Oswalt in Sinister. James Ransone played deputy in the original, but became the main star in the sequel! Some critics blabbered about Ethan Hawk's performance not being convincing. He was solid; nothing more and nothing else.To conclude: There is nothing original about Sinister horror fans hadn't seen before. There are some clichés as well. But Sinister manages to create an ambient in which it's horror elements can add to each other and so accelerate you into terror. So don't buy it from critics: Sinister is not about story or actor's performance. It's about making you more nervous and agitated with each one of it's flicks. That is if you don't find the main premise repulsive. If you can bare it to the end, not quitting like I almost did, you'll be in for an interesting ending.",7,1,1,27 August 2016
Life Is Beautiful," Not everyday but true hero on screen
","Guido is a hero on a whole another level compared to usual heroes. He does not have any superpowers, he is not handsome, he is not rich or famous. What he can offer is sacrificing himself without ever showing he is barring anything. Humor and smile are his weapons. He doesn't want to defeat anybody or inflict someone with harm. He is father and husband first and foremost.Dora didn't have to go to the camp. She is a hero on a whole another level compared to usual heroes. She wants to share terror and grief with her husband. Separated by walls and guards - it doesn't matter. What matters is going through suffering with her family. Even going to death.La vita e bella is one of those rare movies which put ordinary but virtuous people on spotlight they deserve. It reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird which shows father taking care of his children as well. The difference is that Guido does it in dreadful conditions while Atticus does it in everyday life. One is no hero over the other. Both of them decided to protect their children so they can have a nice childhood. What can be more heroic than that? Benigni was really able to deliver Mediterranean charm in authentic way not only through architecture or masses of people but through series of goofs and conversations. This is something Hollywood can only dream of achieving. They may be way ahead of Europeans when it comes to implementing technology and effects but are way behind with portraying usual human life as it is without any make-up.A friend of mine called this movie 'the saddest of all comedies'. It is a comedy put amidst terrible war. There is no gore or persuasive violence here - only innocent family barring together what never should have happened it the first place. Seeing them together can make you think about all unsung heroes who gave their lives so other can live without demanding any recognition let alone award. There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. See it on screen.",10,0,2,12 March 2017
Groundhog Day," Atmospheric to the max!
","I've always appreciated and valued atmosphere in movies, video games, music or you name it over other elements. Those elements certainly contribute to overall impression but without glue, which is atmosphere, can't make a good movie only by themselves.Imagine a charming, snowy little city crowded with charming people. Add three main protagonists with different characters. Spice it up with romance elements and direct the whole thing into delivering a strong existential message in a funny and entertaining way. There you have it: Groundhog Day.The main reason why I liked this movie so much is because it brilliantly balances between being serious and amusing. It can make you think about most pertinent questions to us in general as well as more private ones; it can make you giggle. It's not as if some scenes are funny while other dead serious. Writers of this masterpiece where somehow able to make every scene contain both sides. It's as if you were laughing and thinking about the matter at the same time.Let me finish with a philosophical thought. One who is able to sanctify even the worse can fully enjoy the best. If you want to learn how to do that you might check out Groundhog Day.",9,1,2,10 February 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," Beauty, goodness and truth make a masterpiece
","I remember crying first time I saw It's a Wonderful Life. I remember crying n-th time when I saw It's a Wonderful Life. The only movie that made me and makes me cry, not because it's sad but because it's wonderful, is this movie. Every now and than when I'm feeling anxious or depressed I turn to the final scene of this wonderful movie only to remind myself of what in this short life really matters. People around us, friends and community, give value to our life. Every life matters because everyone has something unique to share with this world. If I were never born, world would be ripped off something unique. We have to learn how to appreciate everything that has been granted to us, even the most little things.Those were lessons It's a Wonderful Life thought me and reminds me every time I see it. Every movie which is somehow able to make you a better person deserves a ten. That's the whole point of art. Art is not a purpose in itself, but is an instrument which aims to help us better understand ourselves and the world around us. Real art can't be separated from goodness and truth. No matter how technically brilliant a piece of art may be, it still serves no purpose if it drags us away from truth. And if it has capacity to make us better as man, then it's rightfully called a piece of art. I think It's a Wonderful Life does exactly that: in a subtle and heartwarming way makes you a better man by telling you something about this world and that is that this world needs you and that in long term makes sense to fight for it.Given that, I'm not going to write anything about acting, directing or similar. Those technical skills from my standpoint are now not worth analyzing even though all of those are really good (five Oscar nominations, including best movie and best director). What matters are values and heartwarming atmosphere. I'm going to conclude with the following remark: ordinary people are very often very extraordinary.",10,1,3,7 September 2016
Joker," Great social commentary with dangerous content
","You don't get to see this type of movie very often in theaters nowadays. And seeing almost 2,000 reviews two days after the movie had landed seems to support that opinion. What's the hype really about?Here you have a tough movie detailing the life of a mentally unstable person living in a collapsing society. Does that seem like a movie which can create buzz? That looks, at least to me, like a movie made for narrower audience. But once you combine this setting with the Joker persona, you have something extraordinary with capacity to start debate and controversy. And we can ask ourselves why is that? Is it only because this movie hit cinemas at the right time detailing delicate themes of modern era? Or is there something peculiar in combining Joker and prevailing illness and loneliness?Many people have already rightly pointed out similarities between Joker and Scorsese's Taxi Driver. In both cases we are following stories of mentally sick man surrounded by awful conditions. Manner in which the topic is dealt with is similar as well: very graphic and open. But here similarities stop. These are two very different movies having totally different objectives.First, Taxi Driver elaborates on a guy having some sort of superiority complex and problematic, if not even sick, approach to women (madonna-wh**e complex from Freudian psychology). Joker gives us insight into a person who has been bullied, underestimated and made use off his entire life. Plus, everybody knows who Joker really is. He's crazy, enigmatic, smart and influential.This knowledge takes us additionally into entirely different direction since in Taxi Driver we couldn't really tell with high confidence what's going to happen with Travis. That's the brilliance of Taxi Driver. It tricks you and makes you guess since Travis seems to think and act pretty sound but still showing signs of deteriorating mind. Brilliance of Joker is that the guy who is to become Joker, *undoubtedly* mentally unstable and violent, doesn't trick us like Travis but makes us sympathize showing his side of the story.Joker is thus more than a story about an underdog. I'd say, contrary to popular opinion, that Joker is more a social commentary than a character study. For a movie to be a character study we'd have to see more description of characters inner dynamics (Travis writing his diaries in Taxi Driver). Besides, Joker is who he is because he is socially very relevant. He's got followers and has become an idea. What we're really witnessing is *not* underdog becoming a winner but society collapsing and loosing its way. Joker is a winner only because society became a loser.So there's really nothing to admire about Joker. I personally look at him as a sign of what might happen to a society of individuals in which:'Everybody yells and screams to each other. Nobody is civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. 'And that is why I see this movie as a great social commentary, especially during times in which entire world has been struck by tragedies, horrors and mutual distrust.",8,5,8,5 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," There is no single movie like Birdman - creativity and masterpiece at it's finest
","This is not going to be a classical review but the explanation of the movie from how I see it.When I first saw it I... Got blown away. Totally. I don't remember I had ever had such fun before.It's easiest to start with music so lets start with it. You'll remember that most of Birdman's soundtrack is only percussion. I asked myself why did Innaritu go with such simplistic music. If we understand Birdman as a satire to modern Hollywood and audiences, answer sprungs up. And it's this: modern audiences often take soundtrack for granted. People don't know how music really is important to the movie. We see only actors and CGI effects not appreciating all the time, effort and money it took in order for soundtrack to be made. Do you remember we actually see guy playing percussion (main theme) in two occasions? That strongly emphasizes my point: there IS someone working really hard in order to make soundtrack; but that person remains behind the curtain. His talents are not vividly shown on screen and are hence harder to appreciate. So, Innaritu decided to go mostly only with percussion because he wanted us to know that even the most basic music requires real talent and work, let alone sophisticated orchestral music.OK, so I've understood Birdman as a satire to modern Hollywood and audiences. Let's analyze a few quotes from the movie to back this up. We'll all agree that Ema Stone shined as Sam. But what exactly is Sam's role in the movie? She says to her father in one scene and I quote: 'You hate bloggers. You make fun of Twitter. You don't even have a Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't exist. (...) It's not important. You're not important.' She's the one who thinks that being popular is what really matters. Her father had devoted himself to making a theater show which can't be popular as modern movies are; nevertheless, his show is no less art than any movie is. She represents new, modern audiences who sincerely believe number of Twitter followers or likes is a measure of quality. Let's now turn to one of the most important scenes which will shine much more light to the point I'm trying to convey.So Riggan goes out and his bathrobe gets stuck. He can't come in or pull it out. So what does he do? He goes to his own show almost completely naked in order to act. What was he supposed to do? He's been working for this so hard! But as he walks on the streets of NYC more and more people start to take photos and videos of him. Ooo yeah, they're enjoying this so much! Much more than they would enjoy his show. His daughter Sam later tells him that he's made it. She has made social media accounts for him. Now he has thousand of followers and millions of YouTube views. That's what people want and that's what they enjoy! He has now climbed back to a level of fame he enjoyed when he was young. How crazy and fun you have to be it to walk the streets like that?! Oh, if they only knew the half of it...But now, after that public stunt which Riggan didn't want in the first place comes the central scene - a conversation with a movie critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan). She says that she will destroy his show although she hadn't seen it. When Riggan asks why, she responds: 'You're no actor, you're a celebrity. Let's be clear on that. I'm gonna kill your play.' How many movie critics in reality review movies not objectively but with prejudices? She doesn't know he didn't do that public stunt on purpose but nevertheless doesn't even bother asking him about it. And there you have the dichotomy: people and his daughter on the one hand appreciate him but critics on the other hand don't. But that's tragicomic since he's not responsible for the fondness or hate! And furthermore Riggan doesn't care for the social media crowd but cares for what critics have to say. If they only knew the half of it...And finally we arrive to a moment when out of nowhere a bird-like robot arrives and starts to destroy the city and kill people. Why, for God's sake, did Innaritu make that scene? Is it somehow beneficial to the story? No. Birdman doesn't have a story in a classical sense. It gives a glimpse into a world Riggan and his co-workers live in. The reason why Innaritu made that scene was because that's exactly what audience wants - action and mayhem. Not story; not philosophy; not some peculiar Shakespearean bullshit. We want action and cool stunts! Demolition! A moment before (or later; I can't remember) that scene we can see some homeless guy quoting Shakespeare. But people pass him by like he's not there. This two scenes put together form a nice contrast on audience and cinema matter.This movie was shoot to look like one uninterrupted scene. That's because this way movie becomes very fast paced and very entertaining. All the acting is superb. Camera work is amazing. Birdman won an Oscar for cinematography as well. And so we come to and end of this short analysis. I've analyzed only a few scenes in order to show from which framework should Birdman be seen - it's a satire to modern Hollywood and audience. And unbelievably clever one. And I've not even scratched the surface of it. There are so many clever little things put to it that make Birdman so thoroughly enjoyable. But I'll leave interpretation of those to your own reason and imagination.If you've decided not to watch Birdman because it seemed obnoxious from the beginning, you've made the wrong decision. Don't expect anything and you'll see how good 'The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' is.",10,4,8,16 August 2016
Mother!," Inimitable and highly symbolic movie made for a particular thinking audience
","Firstly, Mother! is not a horror movie. That tag should be removed. A lot of people went to see a horror movie and left the cinema halfway through disappointed. This mistake has as a consequence many people rating it irrationally low. It's difficult to specify Mother! genre exactly but it can be described as a highly symbolic and disturbing mystery drama. That symbolism is not of David Lynch's style as it appears much more ominous. It's sufficient to read some reviews here on IMDb to see how polarizing this movie is. We can argue about it as much as we want and still fail to understand it properly. But here I propose there may not even be one proper way of putting it together. Therefore I believe this film can be approached from many different angles, interpreted quite differently and that you can still benefit from watching it no matter how you did that. Most of us can at least agree that there are multiple layers surrounding Mother! despite having opposite impressions about it.Still, this is not a movie I would generally recommend to watch. It's not mainstream but has been made for a particular audience, I myself am a member of, who don't mind waiting, sometimes a lot, for a movie to develop. People who liked it probably sincerely enjoy giving a meaning to symbols afterwards and reconciling apparent contradictions. Besides that, most importantly, they can come to grips with shocking scenes and story. The point is not to get overwhelmed by shocking material but read through it. If you don't share these characteristics, it's highly likely that you'll walk away from it disappointed, shocked and maybe even disgusted. If you do fall in to this category, be ready for a roller-coaster, especially towards the end! Mother! has been made of two parts: first part is mysterious and murky, second very thrilling and shocking. At first those two don't even seem to be connected and it's even pretty easy to neglect and forget the first part because it is much more tranquil than the second. Still, both are important to process if you want to get the full picture. I recommend that you pay utter attention in the first hour or so, so you don't get caught completely of guard later.I'll immediately cut to the conclusion because this movie begs for a classical review not to be written: Mother! is one of a kind experience that certain people, tired of nonsensical action and drama, with good 'movie digesting system' are going to be thankful for.",8,1,4,22 October 2017
Casino," Committed to details, incessantly told story and superb acting
","I find it strange how few people mentioned love and marriage when writing about this movie. I think mixing these two with criminals running the business is a combination which makes Casino what it is - a movie with unbelievably smoothly told story which covers many aspects of running the business but personal life as well. That is important since it's not sheer incompetence which brought this guys down; it's lust and dishonest in their personal sphere, especially Sam's unhappy marriage. That's why this is the very first line in the movie: 'When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.' That, and other few lines, immediately set the tone and give us the key for proper understanding of the movie.On to the acting. De Niro performing Ace has now become my favorite performance. He's totally convincing in distancing himself from mob guys and positioning as someone how knows the 'know-how'. He isn't a street gangster but a handicapper given a casino to run. That's also important because Casino is, in contrast to Goodfellas, a movie about guys higher in mafia hierarchy. It's sad to see De Niro now starring in movies 'Dirty Grandpa' alike. Joe Pesci in funny and intimidating, almost psychotic. Sharon Stone really did deliver once in a lifetime execution. Accompanied with other great cast members, Casino feels and runs like a quasi-documentary; it's convincing and realistic.To make it short, Scorsese managed to re-tell a multiply layered story based on actual events and give a good insight on how Las Vegas works. I'd recommend you to check out real characters and actual events after you see the movie to broaden your scope and realize with what commitment to details was Casino made.",10,2,5,4 August 2017
Life," Life is short so don't waste it on Life
","--- Read this if you're looking for a non-traditional rant only ---I had seen on trivia that this movie is inspired by the original Alien (1979). Immediately I thought Life has to have strong atmospheric element to it; characters which form a real team; scenes which require a bit of maturity and patience from viewer as to allow plot to develop more fully, etc.There's nothing of that sort here. I feel uncomfortable writing Alien and Life in the same sentence (there it goes). Life is not even a horror. I'm usually easily scared but haven't find even one second of this movie scary; or entertaining. I would not even call it science-fiction since only reasonable science in here is scientific terms protagonists use repetitively in order to sound sophisticated when in reality all six of them are a shame to every astronaut who has ever lived.All of you who have already seen at least one great sci-fi movie have nothing to look for here. Those who haven't... well, you have nothing to look forward here as well. But what is Life's ultimate purpose? Thousands of philosophers tried to answer this one... Seriously, this movie's only goal is to make you feel awestruck about how amazing modern science is. And I believe most of us are already sick with it.OK, so Life fails when it comes to making you scared or interested but instead fills you with scientific gibberish it presents. Can Life then make you feel sad at least? Unfortunately, yes. I say unfortunately because I felt sad for wasting money and time on this.Unlike in Alien, this star beast is a seventh passenger not worthy of being inspired by the classic. Ignore it and continue on with your life.",3,11,25,29 March 2017
Deadpool," Combining brutal material with childish humor yields a fun movie which is going to irritate more serious among you
","When a friend of mine first invited me to see Deadpool my expectations were quite low: I had known nothing about Deadpool and expected to see a classical super hero movie suitable for all ages which I usually don't enjoy. Little did I know Deadpool was a full blown comedy super hero movie made for mature audiences.Watching Deadpool 4DX was amazing experience. A scene where Deadpool jumps from bridge into a car was one of the most entertaining movie experience I've ever had! If only the rest of the movie was this good... if you're still somehow able to see it 4DX, don't miss the chance.Deadpol is very bloody with a lot of violence and mayhem. Language used is too obscene for my taste. Many conversations and scenes are very childish. The whole movie is very immature. Deadpool is going to strongly entertain younger audiences. So yes, Deadpool is pretty bold and quaint experiment: you have brutal violence combined with childish humor. For it's authors audacity I give it a seven. Objectively, it's more of a six.Still, Deadpool's delivery is pretty homogeneous. All the violence and mayhem fit nicely within the context fostered by Deadpool's character. Ryan Reynolds is the guy! He delivered much, much better performance than in Self/less. Morena Baccarin played Vanessa, Deadpool's girlfriend. And when I say she's Deadpool's girlfriend, I mean she IS Deadpool's girlfriend. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. Let me mention that soundtrack plays a somewhat important role (Deadpool loves good music!) - producers picked good hits which contribute to milieu. Wham! If you're in for some non sensible crude humor and brutal violence, you'll surely have fun. Just don't forget not to bring your kids with you! 'Witness the beginning of a happy ending'.",7,6,15,11 August 2016
Click," Profound and entertaining
","Rarely do I see a comedy which becomes better and better towards the end. Click is one of those rare movie since it puts a lot of emphasis on the moral of the story. Somewhere halfway through the movie director decided to make a cut and alongside comedy elements include existential motives and he's done that pretty well. Rarely you see a movie which combines deep questions and pure comedy because you need an inspiring and original screenplay to achieve that.Michael Newman, a workaholic architect, gets his hands on a remote which allows him to fast forward any part of his life he wishes to. He usually puts work over family and has to make certain compromises. Now he doesn't have to hustle anymore. As the movie proceeds we start to see how badly things turn out for him. Not because of circumstances which are out of his control but because of decisions he alone and only he had made. Placing emphasis on that dimension is what makes this movie surprisingly good. That approach is surely going to make you question, at least for a moment, what are your life's priorities and how is you life going to eventually end if you keep making the same decisions.Adam Sandler is everything you expect him to be. It's refreshing to see Kate Beckisnale playing a wife and a mother. It think she's the major reason for charm this movie has. Cristopher Walken plays Morty; I'd call him 'angel the scientist'. You can also see young Jonah Hill before he became this famous! This crew definitely managed to create charming and relaxed atmosphere. Let me conclude: if you're only looking for a good laugh, you'll find it here. If you're looking for a motivation and a strong personal message, you'll find it here as well. Don't miss getting a good laugh and lesson at the same time!P.S. I'd strongly recommend seeing The Family Man (2000) starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni if you want to see a similar movie. It's as good as it gets.",9,0,0,7 July 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Generic, repetitive and forgettable
","Don't believe the hype. John Wick: Chapter 2 is not as nearly as good as almost everyone is portraying it to be. It's a generic movie with a dumb story line. Action is very repetitive - I got full-fed with it after seeing first two action scenes. Best this movie has to offer is close combat, toe-to-toe fight. John employs a lot of jujitsu. Of course he can handle fifty heavy armed marksman with only a pistol. Imagine living in a world without police and emotional guilt of any kind. That's a John Wick's world; a dream-world of any teenager. Nobody in John Wick 2 displays any other emotion other than desire to kill. This makes acting non-impressive, characters forgettable and generic.And why does almost every location look like a pagan temple? Why does every character look like a brainwashed pagan high-priest? Soundtrack doesn't help it neither; it makes everything feel more unnatural. This is an R rated movie made for 10 year old's.If you've already seen the original, you won't see anything you haven't seen before. If you haven't seen it, ignore the second part and see the original.",5,289,521,25 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," War movie which emphasizes virtues pertinent to our existence
","First and foremost, let me cut to the chase and say that Hacksaw Ridge deserves your attention if you like Saving Private Ryan for example. This movie, in contrast to David Ayers Fury, makes you dwell into real war horror. That means this movie is violent. And it's really, really violent. For those more squeamish among you all I can say is that you turn your head away from the screen from time to time. Hacksaw Ridge is split into two parts. The fist one gives you a background story about main protagonist; his childhood, family, love, joining US military and troubles he encountered there because of his religious convictions. The second part realistically depicts battleground. There's a galore of close combat scenes so all of you who enjoy great camera work and like war movies are going to appreciate Gibson's effort to portray war as realistically as possible.If you want to make the most out of this movie, I'd recommend you to keep in mind that Gibson is a Catholic. This I'm mentioning because religion is pertinent to the entire movie; to the first as well as to the second part. This is a history based war movie about highest ordained Conscientious Objector hero but it's ultimate goal is not war itself but the glory of God. For those of you who are Christians, Hacksaw Ridge is going to remind you that there is nothing God can't handle or is difficult for Him. Desmond Doss is a true hero 'without spandex' but God even more if I may say so. I'm sure Desmond would disagree giving ALL the credits to God. And last but not less important: take a look at the budget this movie had and production companies involved. There are no big names there and budget is pretty modest for a war movie. In an age where imaginary characters dressed in spandex set in imaginary world are admired and where God is almost never publicly mentioned, let alone praised, Gibson had the courage to finish a movie which emphasizes values pertinent to our existence: modesty, humbleness, sacrifice, courage, being caring with women and so on. Mel, thank you!",8,3,8,1 December 2016
Alien: Covenant," Bizarre, occult and filled with sophistry
","Is Ridley Scott one of those people who believes pronouncing complex words alone can yield something reasonable? Probably. Alien: Covenant is up-to-the-top filled with nonsensical quasi-scientific, religious and cultural gibberish. Those apparently sophisticated conversations are on display from the very beginning to the very end.First two Alien movies were sci-fi horror in their core; mysterious and unnerving. There is no single scene in Covenant which could justify it as a horror. Yes, there are few unnecessary bloody alien births; and that's it. Young audiences are turned on to everything which has 'horror' written on it and very naive in their perception of it. So the only reason why 'horror' tag is put on it's IMDb page is to attract those ignorant of early Alien movies.Covenant is a drama with many occult elements. It's no secret that Ridely Scott always used many religious elements in his movies (Alien series as well), but this one is over the top. Even one of the trailers has been given the title 'Last Supper' (take a look at the picture no. 66 on Covenant's IMDb page and tell me you can't recognize something familiar at first glance). That's not strange given the information that Covenant is largely influenced by H.R. Giger's work. But to saturate the entire movie with eugenics and some kind of religious nonsense says something about Ridely Scott: he's no longer interested in making movies for the sake of the audiences. He went in purely ideological way and used 'Alien' as means to it. Or is he being used by Hollywood?It's unnecessary to mention that production quality generally is really good. That's Ridley's field and there he knows what he's doing. But how is it possible that the original alien monster looks much better than this CGI alien? At least there are a couple of really promising scenes. Unfortunately, all of them are cut short with Ridley's strange need to keep the sophistry rolling. What about crew members? I don't recall seeing more stupid and incompetent group of people. If you've seen Daniel Espinosa's 'Life' you know what I'm saying. These top scientists and engineers literally defy all principles of common sense and logic. There's even a Christian on board! Too bad he behaves like a zealot and quotes Jesus out of every context imaginable.
