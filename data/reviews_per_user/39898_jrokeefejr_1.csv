Come and See," what students think
","Students in my sophomore English class at Pueblo Magnet High School in Tucson, Arizona, have just watched this movie as part of a classroom assignment. They are now writing an essay comparing 'Come and See' to the book 'Night' by Elie Wiesel.In short, both book and movie are about teenage boys who go through horrific ordeals during WWII. Both have many of the same themes, including racism, hope, transformation, loss of innocence, death, fire, premonitions, historical accuracy, point of view, revenge, family, religion, symbolism and irony.Just as the book commanded students' interest, 'Come and See' was spellbinding. The images are powerful. Indeed, I consulted with others before deciding to show this movie even though it probably would be rated PG-13 in this country. And although some scenes are graphic, the movie is terrifying because of what's left to the imagination. I think 'Come and See' has indelibly stamped the evil of war on students' minds.After showing some scenes a second time, I had students rate this movie. A total of 82 students voted, giving the movie nearly an '8'. I'm now looking forward to reading their essays to learn more about their opinions and insights about this astounding movie.",8,1,1,17 November 2006
