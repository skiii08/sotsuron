Alien 3," Alien 3 is cannon to me
","I used to hate this sequel as a kid, it felt off compared to the first two. Almost like a step backwards. As an adult having just watched it again (special edition) I think its the only logical conclusion. Ripley's story is a tragic one but, there is an easy to oversee bright side to her death. She essentially saved all of humanity by self sacrifice, not a bad ending if you ask me. The biggest problem people seem to have is Hicks and Newt being killed off without so much as one line of dialogue. Thinking about it now if Ripley's fate is to die, then her leaving behind Hicks and especially Newt is also depressing. I like to either end the franchise with Aliens or Alien 3 but after that it gets ridiculous. To keep the franchise going they didn't need to bring Ripley back they could have written a story about Weiland Yutani sending a ship to find the original planet these aliens came from. Honestly I like the mystery of their origins, make up my own reasons for the derelict ship from the first movie. Directing style and cinematography is another thing that changes with many franchises and its not always a bad thing. It gives each film its own fingerprint and keeps them interesting. Opinion, Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 are all I need to feel I have a complete story.",8,4,4,3 June 2017
