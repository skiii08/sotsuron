The Incredible Hulk," In your face Ang Lee! Incredible Hulk is 9/10
","The Hulk finally gets some respect! After the disappointment of 'Hulk (2003)' all of us die-hard-Hulk-fans lost hope of seeing a fine version of the green behemoth. Personally, I always supported a Hulk sequel, of course, ignoring Lee's whacky version. A reboot, The Incredible Hulk is plagued with a solid story, believable dialogues, flawless performances and over-the-top CGI. With a villainous enemy such as Emil Blonsky turned into an Abomination, Bruce Banner will have to either get rid of the beast within him, or embrace it and become a hero. Marvel did it again! With a lot more action, amazing VFX and a brutal final battle, Hulk will surely smash to success. Norton, Leterrier and Marvel have created an outstanding odyssey that pays tribute to one of the greatest, most famous comic books ever. With 'The Incredible Hulk' and 'Iron Man' out there, The Avengers are practically assembled!",9,2,6,13 June 2008
