Walk the Line," He sounds like Johhny Cash...so what.
","OK let me start this review off saying that the performances by the two leads were excellent, and they got the sound of the music down, which was wasn't easy to do considering they did all of their own singing. However, once I got over that fact (and it didn't take me that long since there is lots of singing in the movie) I wasn't too impressed. The plot in my opinion is pretty boring, especially considering the run time of nearly 2 and a half hours. It basically follows the standard rock star story of break out success followed by dysfunction at home, womanizing, and of course booze and drugs. How will this one end? Will Cash sober up and get the girl just in time for the happy Hollywood ending? I'm not gonna say, you'll just have to see it for yourself. *wink* Whether this movie portrays the life and times of Johnny Cash accurately I can't say, since I'm not really a fan of his. And in fact I will probably never be able to say, because 'Walk the Line' doesn't make me interested enough to find out. I'd recommend this movie for fans of Johhny Cash (obviously) and for people interested in that genre of music in general. 'Walk the Line' is full of singing and I imagine if this style of music was my cup of tea I'd be giving this movie a better rating but as stands a 5-6 is the best I can do. What more can I say, I realize the actors are delivering on their end, but the story and really the title character himself give me little reason to care. All and all another critically overrated movie with a recycled plot and a tedious run time.",5,3,13,20 November 2005
Akira," Good movie even for non-anime fans
","I myself am not a fan of anime.  I think the closest I got to watching anime on a regular basis was watching the cartoon Voltron as a kid in the 80s.  Back then though everything was just a cartoon and who drew it really didn't matter.  Anyways, I rented Akira because I have heard a lot about it. I rented it and was pleasently surprised.  I thought that while it was one of those films that was heavily influenced by the style of Blade Runner, the story itself was different and it had a great visual style.  I think the action was excellent (for a cartoon) and the scenes were really memorable. I can't say that I would rent more anime movies because of it, but I'm definetly more open to the idea that cartoons can be entertaining to adults. Rent it if you are interested in sci-fi/action or want to see something we a great 'look' to it.

Batman Returns," Ehhh it was OK
","I find it hilarious that some people call this (and I'm not joking here) 'a 10' and 'the best movie ever made'. Please. Now while that may not be the majority of people, it still seems pretty silly to me how one could think that. I guess if you really like Tim Burton you might say something like that, but he has made better movies. Anyway I digress.I saw this on TV today for the first time in about 10 years and remembered how disappointed I was when it came out. I'll grant Burton an eye for the visuals, and would agree that his Batman movies have the best looking Gotham City and have the best Batman (Keaton). However, in this second installment things went a downhill for me. First of all Batman himself is given a back seat and instead we are forced to deal with Devito's Penguin. Once again the most gullible citizens ever are lead to believe that this clearly insane or at least odd and disturbing character would make a good mayor, kind of like they were tricked into believe The Joker was an 'okay guy' in the first one. Also the needlessly dark touchs like the Penguins plan to kill all the first born sons of Gotham don't work for me. Also some of the stuff comes off as just tacky like the little penguins with rockets attached to their backs or the henchmen dressed up as clowns (didn't we already have a clown in the first one?). The ending is pretty anti-climactic as well and overall it isn't all that entertaining. I think that I actually got more enjoyment out of Batman Forever then I did out of this one (though I think this movie is technically better made). In conclusion this movie isn't the worst movie ever, and has some good moments and an excellent visual style that really resonates the world of Batman. However, some stupid plot points and needlessly dark/bizarre elements keep me from really liking it. If you are a fan of Tim Burton's work you will probably find something you like here. Even a Batman fan can find some good stuff as well. But just because there were worse Batman (and comic book movies in general) made after this doesn't necessarily make this a good let alone great movie. If you really like Batman read the comics books.Zoopansick",5,20,39,16 September 2004
My Neighbor Totoro," I dare your five-year old not to be bored
","This is supposedly one of the 'Great Movies' according to Roger Ebert...My tone in the previous sentence should suffice for my review, but I feel like more needs to be said. My Neighbor Totoro isn't offensive, obnoxious, disturbing, annoying, or irritating in any way. And as Ebert continually points out in his review, it doesn't fall in line with a lot of clich√©s that are prevalent in American cartoons in terms of characterization or plot-line. This may all be true; but it doesn't make up for it's fatal flaw...it's boring. It's really really, boring. There is hardly any plot other then these 2 girls hanging around their house out in the country side. The title character makes his first appearance 30 minutes in, and only a couple of times after that. He doesn't do much either. In his debut scene he sleeps and yawns...how appropriate. Later he does some other stuff but it's not too exciting and perhaps only mildly so compared to the doldrum of the girls lives. I wasn't 'enchanted', the world didn't seem that magical to me, and with the lack of any compelling plot I couldn't help but once again become baffled by the godly praise for this movie. The animation is OK but don't see why Miyazaki's work is considered to be THAT much better then everyone else's. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to understand why. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to love this movie. I can think of no other reason why. Granted, I'm 23 and cartoons don't hold the same appeal as they did 15 years ago. But that being said, I can't see myself even sitting through this 15 years ago. And as an adult, it doesn't seem to hold much value. There is no plot, the writing is forgettable, and I don't find it's artistic value to be any higher then that of any other anime. Bottom line, if you are an anime fan, you aren't even reading this because you own My Neighboro Totoro on DVD and are probably waiting for the special edition. However, if you are checking up on one of the 'Great Movies' or if you a parent and want to show your kid something, I can't recommend it to you on either level.",3,24,78,21 May 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," In like a lion out like a lamb
","What a letdown.  When I first heard about the Matrix 2 and 3 I was appropriately excited and even after the second movie I was still looking forward to part 3 (albeit less then before).  But after seeing Revolutions, I (like many other posters) am glad the series is over.  I knew when I was watching it I didn't like it as much and though it kept my interest in the action scenes, the rest of the movie was nothing special.  I think there are several reasons why this movie was worse then the others and this is what I came up with...1)Boring characters: In the original Matrix, Neo was a much more interesting character.  He was the everyman who was put in an extraordinary situation and had to learn to cope with the fact that he may be humanities only hope in a world he knows nothing about.  By the second one and definetly in the third one he is just a boring monotone character who says stuff like 'It ends tonight' and 'I know what I must do'.  Pretty much lines that explain the action and do little to flesh out the character (a sign of poor writing).  He isn't a charismatic hero nor is he really awe-inspiring (as he is to the other characters).  Trinity and all of the other humans are just as lifeless.  I didn't really care about them or their fate and the interesting characters from Reloaded like the Merovingian and Persephone make a meaningless appearance.2)Pointless scenes: The whole train station scene is entirely unnecesary and the characters in it.  The Indian couple and their girl and the Train master (or whatever he's called) add nothing to the plot and force the audience to listen to this bs diatribe about karma (which I guess is proven by this movie because while we got the good in part 1, we get the bad now in part 3).  They also could have left the S&M club scene out as well, and the only reason the characters went there was to get Neo out of the stupid train station (which was pointless itself).  The plot itself was extremely linear and the characters moved from point a to b to c (and all the while explaining their movements 'We have to get back to Zion' 'I must go to the surface', this crap would have been okay if there was some flavor to their dialogue but it was all stuff like that).3)That's how it ends?: Ok so let me get this straight.  Neo sacrifices himself a la' christ to save his people and destroy smith, therefore ensuring the machines wont kill the remainder of humanity.  The problem I have with this is that the machines don't kill the people.  It seems inconsistent with their character to just stop because they 'made a deal with neo'.  They are MACHINES!  They have no sense of loyalty or honor. The machines came out on top if you think about it.  Neo and Smith are dead and the city is left defenseless, so why shouldn't the machines whipe out the people?  The humans could only mean trouble for them in the future so why leave them?  My answer is the studio answer.  They left them alive so if they wanted to make a 4th movie they could still have both the machines and the people alive and bring neo back with some sort of resurrection (if he is dead, which i am assuming).  This ending also reinforces the belief that they were just trying to end the whole the movie and didn't really think about being consistent with the prior motivations of the machines.4)Focus away from the Matrix itself:  This is something else I noticed and I think contribued greatly to my lukewarm reception of the third one.  The most interesting part of the matrix movies to me (and I suspect many others) was the whole digital world of the matrix itself, where the laws of nature can be bent etc.  Even the second one had some cool stuff in the Matrix like the freeway chase (the twins were cool) and the Merovingian but in this one the Matrix is in the background.  What's in the foreground is the boring 'real world' with it's flat characters and more familar post-apocalyptic setting.  The only reason they go in the Matrix this time is the train station scene (which in my opinion unnecesarilly complicates rather then enriches the matrix universe) and the fight scenes between Neo and Smith (which we have seen before in both movies).5)Action masquerading as philosophy:  I think of this movie a lot like I think of Fight Club in the respect that it is primarily an action movie (and that is the main selling point of it) but it has some 'deep' questions thrown in.  So while that it may have more depth then your average Vin Diesel action flick, in the end it's about as deep as Star Wars.  What people most enjoy about the Matrix is the action and all of the 'big ideas' thrown in there are sometimes intriuging but mainly serve as a back drop for the movie and are often muddled together.  I think it's just a ridiculous defense for people to claim that the only reason someone didn't like the Matrix Revolutions or Fight Club or one of these other modern 'thinking-man's' action movies is because they are too stupid to get it. I hesitate to even use this example because it may make me look pretentious but just compare this film to a Bergman movie like Persona or the Seventh Seal or any movie for that matter that seriously asks philosophical questions.  Those films are far more interesting on that level and make the matrix look juvenille by comparisson.  Now I like action movies as much as the next guy, in fact Hard-Boiled (which is all guns and no brains) is one of my all time favorites.  But I don't like it when people hold up movies like The Matrix Revolutions as examples of philosophical cinema, and chastise the people who don't like it as being stupid or 'unable to grasp the concepts'.6)The little things: In most movies there are these little things that you either forgive and dismiss (because you are having a good time) or bug you, when you aren't.  I listed a few above (the train station, pointless characters etc.) and now I'll list a few more just for fun.  I found it ridiculous and perhaps inconsistent with the second movie (haven't checked this, nor do I really care to) that Zion had no 'EMT devices' or whatever they are called.  I was led to believe by the second movie that there would be at least some ships hanging around the city and that only a few went out to look for Morpheus and the gang.  Anyway my grievance is that if they can make these EMT things and put them on all their ships why cant they have like 1 or 2 back at the base and just use it when all the Squid Machines come pouring in.  Yeah it knocked out their defenses, but they could just use it again when the second round of machines came in.  Besides their defenses sucked in the big picture and if the machines just ran right at all the mech guys with the guns right away instead of flying around in patterns and getting shot at the battle would have been much quicker.  I guess though that I'm glad they didn't use common sense cause that would have eliminated the movies best scene, but still it kind of bugs me in retrospect. Another thing was the music.  I read this comment from someone else (forget who, but good idea) and it seems to make sense to me.  The music in the first 2 (especially in the 2nd) was this cool kind of techno stuff that worked really well within the world of the matrix and the action scenes in general. In this one we had this more orchestral sound and in my opinion it wasnt consistent and didnt feel as right in a Matrix movie.  Now i recognize that this is really minor but I think it subtley attributed to taking away the 'cool factor' that the other two films had and I think that the techno stuff is really well suited for the Matrix.Anyway that's pretty much it.  And while this review sounds and is highly critical, it is so only because the previous two especially the first left me with high expectations and were really good (the first excellent) sci-fi action films.  Having seen lots of these types of movies I also conceed that the special effects were top notch and the action scenes were still pretty cool.  I'm giving it a 6/10 and it is definety worth the price of admission for fans of the genre but I don't think it is a 'must see' for casual fans to which the films weaknesses may be more apparent.

Apocalypse Now," The best movie I've ever seen?
","Well maybe not the best movie I have seen but it's in my Top 10 for sure. I think it's one of those rare films that is better then the book (Heart of Darkness which is of course different).  A lot of people debate whether it's a 'war movie' I take the position that it's a war movie but that's only part of it.  I think calling it only a 'war movie' is taking away from how great this movie is.  It doesn't just have the simple 'war is hell' message that many war films have.  It asks more piercing questions about human nature and character.  It is drama, war, action, art, and manages to be entertaining as well as thought provoking.  Even if the ideas don't grab you there are 3 things you cannot deny of this movie. 1)the acting is all top-notch  2)the cinematography is some of the best ever 3)it is well written.  If you didn't like it or think you 'got it' the first time, go back again it's well worth another trip up the river.  Afterall this film's quality pretty much terminates all others...with extreme prejudice.

Collateral," Good, but got a little off track at the end
","(spoilers herein) I just saw Collateral tonight and thought it was pretty good. I especially liked Tom Cruise doing what he does best (being cool). I thought the story was pretty interesting, even though I kind of guessed what case the witnesses were from and where the film was headed. There is also some good black humor mixed in with the killings that keep things really entertaining. There were definitely some moments that seemed a 'little too convenient' like the people in the 'elevator' or the very fact that Jada Pinkett Smith and Tom Cruise use the same cab right after each other. Still those are only minor problems. My biggest problem and the thing that kept me from giving this movie a higher rating (gave it a 7, which translates to like ***/**** on my scale), was in fact the ending. Things just got too outlandish for me here. First of all max crashes the cab doing like 80 and Vincent is virtually unharmed (even without his setabelt on) and is able to get up like 30 seconds after the crash and book it down the street. Then when he gets into the office building where his final target is, he stupidly wastes time turning off the buildings power, which IN FACT gives his victim an unnecessary edge. At this point it became obvious how things were going to turn out and that the movie didn't really have the balls to follow through with what it set up in the first hour and a half. I wish they would have had the guts to keep things going as they did earlier and work within the limits for the characters set up. Before the final shoot out Cruise warns Foxx that 'this is what I do for a living' which if it were true the scared cabby would be dead instead of the professional killer who up until that point should excellent marksmenship. What Cruis should have said is 'this is what happens at the end of 99% of all movies'...the bad guy dies and the good guy gets the girl. Still as an overall experience I found the movie to be entertaining with strong performances all around and having an engaging story.Zoopansick",7,0,0,12 August 2004
Ratatouille," Vastly overrated: Poor characterization, unfunny, and boring
","Spoilers...First it isn't funny, for adults or kids. I especially think kids would be bored watching this movie, it has a mundane setting and characters. I think it tries too hard to try and put adult humor in the film (and not succeeding) at the expense of leaving out stuff for kids. I would have been more forgiving if it was goofier and aimed at a younger audience, but as it stands. I can't help thinking how bored I was now as an adult watching it and how much more I would have been bored if I was watching it 15-20 years ago.The characters in the movie lack distinct personalities, especially the supporting cast. There is a scene in the movie where Collete is showing Linguini around the kitchen and tells him a little about all the other cooks. Beyond the 1 or 2 line oddly dark description of these characters there is nothing in the rest of the movie that makes them distinct. They are just the guys in the background and effectively are scenery instead of amusing or funny little characters. Much the same can be said about the rats who are just cartoon clich√©s who have very little to do.The aforementioned Collete is a totally unbelievable character who is just there to be the love interest. When she first converses with Linguini she kind of blows her lid and almost stabs him with butcher knives while delivering some out of place speech about how she is the only woman in the kitchen. Then like a day or 2 later Linguini out of no where confesses his love to her and she kisses him right back. How did that happen? Is there any build up or reason for either character to love the other. I'm especially mystified as to why Collete's character, given her personality would be attracted to the dim witted Linguini. If this weren't an animated movie this particular relationship would be critically torn to shreds. But because it's animated, check that computer animated it isn't given a second thought. This is the definition of HORRIBLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. This is poor writing that operates only on the clich√©d level that states there needs to be a smart independent female love interest for the generic often dumb male lead.However I wouldn't say this is the worst bit of characterization in the film. That award falls to Gousteau. The deceased yet omnipresent chef whose message of 'Everyone can cook' not only inspires Patton Oswalts' rat character but also provides 'the meaning' or message of the film. Too bad that Gousteau's death totally undermines the entire point of the movie(!!!) Gousteau is established early in the movie as a jovial chef who loved to cook and firmly believed that 'everyone can cook' and to be great you have to take chances and be creative. So one day the obligatory villain food critic comes to his restaurant with the intention of writing a bad review (since it is clear he is a snob and hates the notion that 'anyone can do it'). Gousteau then DIES because the review was so bad and his restaurant goes from a 5 star to a 4 star. WHAT!?! That is totally contrary to the message of the film...which is provided by GOUSTEAU HIMSELF! Gousteau should be the LAST character in the movie to be negatively effected by a bad review. He shouldn't care if his restaurant is only 4 stars; throughout the entire film his philosophy of cooking and good natured message of 'anyone can do it' is hammered home. On an interpritive level his death completely undermines the message of the film. His death suggests that it actually does matter what other people think of you and not everyone can cook. Furthermore it suggests that Gousteau himself doesn't even believe that and his motivations aren't just cooking because he loves it. Of course over the rest of the movie the complete opposite is said and shown through the development of the plot. The result is that Gousteau's death is merely a plot contrivance which has 2 purposes. First (of course) to set up the plot with Linguini going to the restaurant and second to introduce the critic as a villain. Oh, but then at the end the critic is so moved by the food that he gives the restaurant a great review. Once again a character is betrayed by Gousteau's death at the beginning of the film. Early in the movie it was established that the critic was determined to give the restaurant a bad review based upon the sole reason that he hated what Gousteau was preaching. Now all of the sudden he is affected by the actual quality of the food and is going to give the restaurant a good review? I guess no one has ever made great food that reminded him of his childhood before if that was all it took to make his character to an abrupt 180. Whatever. I can't say I didn't see that one coming, and like I said before it isn't the worst butchering of a character in this movie.So basically Ratatouille is a bunch of unfunny, bland, lethally hypocritical characters cooking and talking about cooking in a restaurant in France. Oh and it's boring. But because it's computer animated it gets not only a pass but is lauded for being great. IF any of these elements were in a live action movie they would be criticized. The plot which betrays severely several of the characters (Collete romance, the villainous critic's motives, and of course Gousteau dying), the predictable outcome in all regards, the lack of jokes for kids or adults are all forgiven/forgotten. If you do decide to watch it try to look at it with a critical eye and try to look beyond the impressive computer animation.",4,5,11,10 March 2008
Aliens," One of the best 5 sci-fi/action movies ever!
","This movie shows what is possible with a good director for a sci-fi movie. Under Cameron's direction this film creates an entirely unique feel from the first one (which comes off as more of a horror suspense film) while remaining creepy.  Aliens is one of the best action movies ever made, and there are several reasons for that.  The first is that it takes time to build up to any action at all, and by the time it does you actually have some feelings for the characters.  I think when the first action scene does come as an audience member you actually feel the desperation of the marines as they get ambushed by the aliens.  The audience actually hates the Paul Reiser character too, and more geniuenly then they do the usual bad guy.  He is slime and people love it when he finally gets what he deserves.  In my opinion most sci-fi films fail because the audience (especially a modern cynical audience) doesn't suspend their beliefs and won't accept spaceships and monsters etc.  But Aliens is one of those rare few that people accept. The characters are developed and human and the aliens themselves look real and believable.  The action is well paced and once it gets going it really moves.  I think this movie is really a blast the first time you see it, because you don't know who is gonna make it out, or what's gonna happen next (though I'm sure many suspected Weaver to survive).  I think the first movie set the stage for that unexpected element, but this one delievers a totally different and in my opinion better experience than the first.  If you like sci-fi or even just action movies this one isn't to be missed.  It's highly influential in both genres and ranks in the top 5 in both, or at least in my opinion.

Alien vs. Predator," It was good for a bad movie.
","This is one of those movies that gets worse the more that I think about it, so the trick is not to think about it. I gave it a 5/10 because while it kept me entertained (for the most part) there was some really stupid stuff in it; and I was laughing (along with the audience) at stuff we weren't supposed to be laughing at. I don't think anyone kept a straight face when the lady uses the Aliens head as a shield (!) or the explanation of how the Predators brought civilization to the world. One could go on for days about the inaccuracies and pure ludicrousness of such a premise, but it would be largely a waste of time (in one regard though I think the movie is asking for it since this historical premise is integral to the 'plot', well what there is of a plot). I can't believe how many '10s' this movie got either. People on this site are so easy to please, if they like it, it most likely gets a 10 and if they don't it gets a '1'. This movie is nothing special and a far cry from Alien, Aliens, and the first Predator. The original Alien is such an original film and a touchstone for the Sci-Fi genre, in a way its kind of pathetic to see it come to this. On the other hand I liked AVP (as the cool people call it) better then the disappoint Alien3, the totally unnecessary Resurrection, and the largely forgettable Predator 2 (except I remember the Sega game cause it was really really hard). As mindless entertainment its fairly decent and this will be good for drunk college kids to see. With its anemically short run-time and now standard action and CGI it will largely be a forgotten film and to be rented much less frequently then Alien 1 and 2. If you are fans of the series I'd recommend seeing it, but with low expectations. If you think for a second this will be as good as Aliens then you are sorely mistaken.

The Terminal," The epitome of a fake Hollywood movie
","If you ever want to see an example of what modern independent film makers point to when they talk about superficial and false Hollywood movies see The Terminal. The Terminal is a highly implausible and manufactured story of this guy stuck in a New York Air Port for God only knows how long. This movie presents the audience with a series of unreal characters and situations and tries to pass it off as drama or romance. Consider the character that Stanley Tucci plays; why does he hate Victor Navorski so much? Is he really jeopardizing his chance to move up in the ranks? Is he even that annoying? It's really none of those reasons, the only reason he hates him is because the movie requires a villain. Just like the movie requires a stupid romance based on chance meetings. The Catherine Zeta Jones character is really pathetic too. She complains about being forced to wait for this guy for 7 years and being a stewardess for 20 years. Well it's her own fault. She choose to have an adulteress affair with a married man, and chose to keep waiting on him (here's a tip girls, if you have been going out with a married guy for more then 5 years and he hasn't left his wife yet, he isn't going to and you are getting played). I guess I can forgive her being a stupid character, because guess what that's not even the dumbest romance in the movie. That dubious honor goes to the one because the cute girl at the passport approval desk and the Hispanic guy who drives the food cart. In this whirlwind romance the guy wants to ask her out but is afraid to (ok nothing too out of the ordinary yet)...so he asks this guy from eastern Europe who has been stuck in the airport (and who he hardly knows) to find stuff out about her so that they can fall in love. The girl apparently just as stupid gives Tom Hanks all sorts of information and then without ever meeting the guy agrees to marry him after Tom Hanks gives her a ring. I don't know about you all but if I was working a desk job somewhere and some guy from Eastern Europe (or from anywhere really) starts asking me questions about myself and then one day gives me a ring and asks me to marry this other guy who I have never seen before in my life, I would have to respectfully decline. Along with this romance the movie has other stupid characters including this old Indian janitor (and just between you and me I wanted to see him get deported, and if Spielberg had any balls left show the 7-7 prison cell that old fart would be living in for the remainder of his days). The reason Tom Hanks came to America is a mystery (and I won't spoil it for you) but it's really stupid and definitely a movie contrivance. There are far more ridiculously implausible scenes in the movie, and none of which are very funny or heart warming. The Terminal is a movie with a ridiculous plot that could be found in a movie from the 20s or 30s without the charm. It's hard to believe that the guy who brought us such films as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Schindler's List is reduced to this.",3,1,3,27 June 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," If you can say overrated, I can say Shawshank Redemption
","In the long and storied history of cinema, there have always been those films, which are undoubtly overrated.  However, none before and none since have been more overrated then The Shawshank Redemption.  While the Shawshank Redemption is not a waste of your viewing times by any means, it is not the pinnacle of film making.  The performances are good, especially Freeman, but I'm not too high on the way the plot works out.  It doesn't really break any new ground, a man is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit(Wow, that's new!!), and learns to cope with his new circumstances, while befriending the prison veterans.  While the audience learns a valuable lesson about the determination and courage of the human spirit!  I don't know about you all, but when Robbins escapes from prison during a dramatic thunderstorm, there were more then a few tears coming down my face.  When I see something like this rated in the top 10 films of the 1990s let alone of all time, I have to wonder about people's taste in general.  The message of the movie isn't incredibly powerful nor is the plot.  How can anyone consciously say this movie was the best ever?  It boggles my mind, but I have a few theories.  First this movie is recent enough and shown on TNT enough (like 5 times a month), that alot of people have seen it more then once.  Younger people (I'm talking teens and twenties), who haven't seen many Dramas let alone the real 'great' movies, will say this is the best. If you ask this same demographic what is the best comedy of all time, they are likely to say something like Happy Gilmore (which Caddyshack blows out of the water for best golf comedy).  These are the kinds of people giving Shawshank it's highest praise, these people are sadly my generation.",6,9,22,15 November 2001
Fantastic Four," I give it a Fantastic 4...out of 10
","What a waste of 10 bucks. I didn't expect much from this movie and it did not disappoint. I was at least hoping for some cool fight scenes with all the powers if nothing else. Well guess what there wasn't really any fighting, except for the 5-10 minute thing at the end, which was fairly anti-climactic (in my opinion). In an age where it seems almost every other movie is based on a comic book this one is pretty weak. Especially compared to the vastly superior Batman Begins that came out this summer. In that movie there was an actual plot and the characters were much more defined. Here the characters were all 2D and there wasn't really a plot at all. I didn't buy 1)How they all became celebrity heroes after saving a few guys from a problem which was largely the Thing's doing. What was he doing on the bridge anyway? The writing wasn't really that good and while this movie wasn't painful to sit through, and was fairly short, it managed to be even more transparent then Jessica Alba. I guess the Special Effects were OK, but now adays when ever movie has special effects they don't seem as special as they did, say a decade ago when T2 and Jurrassic Park came out. If you want to see a comic book movie see Batman or rent one of the Spiderman or X-Men movies. If you want to see a boring pointless movie with almost no action go see Fantastic Four.",3,6,12,10 July 2005
