It," What was that ?
","NO tension, NO context, a sort of a backstory the least you can say about it is BAD, with personal issues for each character just sprinkled over a rushed script to show some kind of character diversity and convince us that 'those kids are not the same'. You spend the entire movie trying to understand the reason why all these random and non-frightening things are happening, but the only thing you get is moments of basically staring at the WB man of 2017 doing things that make no sense and don't move the plot forward. Add to that the almost comical portrayal of numerous stereotypes and a way over the top exaggeration of the kids' authority and critical thinking. And yeah, it's not scary.",2,0,0,1 January 2018
