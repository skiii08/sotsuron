Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So It Begins...
","First,let me start by saying that I have seen all the movies in the Star Wars Series.I have to say George Lucas did not disappoint with this movie.The other two movies were great also. The Phantom Menace was a very good beginning to a very well written series.I also want to comment on the last two movies very briefly before I get to what I thought of the Phantom Menace.I have to say that I love Revenge of the Sith.It is one of my favorite Star Wars movies next to original series Episodes IV,V,And VI. I also liked AOTC a lot,none of the movies disappointed me. So now,I will get to what I thought about the Phantom Menace: Firstly,I thought that all the performances of the main cast were especially good.I liked Natalie Portman as (Queen Padme Amidala)and I also liked Pernilla August as (Shme Skywalker,Anakin's Mother).I also want to comment on Liam Neeson's role as Qui-Gon Jinn he was very good as Obi-Wan's Jedi Master,I also liked Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi,Qui-Gon Jinn's young headstrong Jedi apprentice,however he really didn't have that much to do in TPM but when he did it was big.Ewan McGregors role in the next two movies was a lot larger. He had a lot more to do and say,his action scenes were outstanding!!I also thought that the Supporting cast did very well.I liked the artistry of the planets such as Tatoonie,Naboo and Corusant. I really liked the underwater city that is on Naboo.On Naboo the character of Jar Jar Binks is introduced,I thought that he was funny and I don't understand why people hated him so much.Well they didn't have to worry about it because he wasn't really on the screen that much in AOTC&ROTS.You also see the creation of C-Threepio by a young Anakin played by newcomer Jake Lloyd.You also get to see how C-Threepio and R2-D2 got together. You also get to see Anakin the pilot start to emerge in this movie.The movie shows what it was like before the empire was formed and also how Senator Palpatine(Darth Sidious,Emperor)Ian McDiarmid came to power and also what kind of people Luke and Leia's parents were.(Padme and Anakin) Ian McDiarmid played the role of the evil emperor(Senator Palpatine)flawlessly.It is the introduction of the Republic,'The Jedi'The Sith' and other characters that will make up the Star Wars universe and it also introduces the Trade Federation.I just want to make a quick comment on the young actor that they got to play Anakin.Jake Lloyd was very good as Anakin Skywalker.After all(Darth Vader)had to start off as an innocent child like anyone else.I don't know why everyone was so critical of the actor,I mean give me a break he is a 'kid' after all,give him a chance I am sure that as he gets older he will get better as an actor.I liked when it was time for Young Anakin to leave Tatoonie it really was bittersweet.He is upset that he is leaving his mother but he tells her that he will be back for her.However,as you will see when he does finally go back for her it is already to late.I thought those scenes were very powerful.You will see his anger start to emerge at what has happened to his mother but that scene is in the next movie(AOTC).You will see his anger and his conflicting emotions come to a head in the last movie(ROTS).You also see a little bit of the dark side start to emerge in Anakin in (AOTC).Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn meets the young Anakin Skywalker and he feels that he is destined for great things.I also liked the pod-race scenes,it was exciting and the effects were great.The special effects in this movie were very good and they are even better in the next two movies.The Phantom Menace is also the beginning of the love story between Anakin and Padme.It develops in to something really big in AOTC.The costumes in all of the movies were fantastic.Trisha Biggar is a great costume designer.The music in all of the Star Wars movies is great.John William's is a fantastic composer.George Lucas really did really well by getting him to do the musical scores for all of his movies.I liked the music in all of the movies especially the 'Duel of Fates and Anakin's theme',I also liked Anakin and Padme's love theme in the second movie it was beautiful. I also liked the revised version of'Duel of Fate' which became the newer version the'Battle of the Heroes'in Revenge of the Sith,the climatic light saber duel between Anakin And Obi-Wan.The light saber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul was great, then you had the duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul which were both outstanding.I also feel that Darth Maul was the ultimate Sith Lord next to the Emperor and of course Darth Vader.Darth Maul really should have been on the screen more then he was.I was rooting for the Jedi to win every time of course.Finally,I think George Lucas did really well for this movie and he is under-appreciated.When are the critics going to wake up and give this Director,Producer the recognition that he so richly deserves.Good start for the lead in movie to the next two movies.Keep up the good work,George.THE FORCE IS INDEED VERY STRONG WITH THIS SERIES.I love all the movies,I will never get tired of watching them.",9,9,12,21 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It really was a great movie
","I really liked this movie. Hayden Christensen,Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman,Samuel L.Jackson,Christopher Lee and the rest of the cast were exceptional in this movie.Hayden Christensen was very good in his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker. I love him in the role he really was meant to play this part.Geoge Lucas and the other head honchos on this movie really made the best choice by casting him.They also did really good with the other actors that they cast in the movies.Attack of the clones really is the beginning of the love-story between Anakin and Padme.The lightsaber duels in this movie were fantastic. I really do recommend that anyone that has not seen this movie to do so I am sure you would not be disappointed.The story really was well put together.The bottom line is that it was a really good movie,in my opinion at least. I am biased though because I really like the series.I have all the movies and I never get tired of watching them.",9,0,1,19 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Saved the best for last
","I have to disagree on some of the comments that other IMDb users made.Did they see the same movie that everyone else saw. At the peoples choice award show this year George Lucas got the award for having the best movie of 2005.I guess all the people that enjoyed Star Wars Episode III-Revenge of the sith were nuts for picking this movie to win. However,everyone is entitled to there own opinion no matter how wrong they may be,that being said this is what I thought of Revenge of the Sith. Hayden Christensen gave a great performance as Anakin Skywalker,By the way he was in fact nominated for two different awards for Shattered Glass,He didn't win but that doesn't mean he can not act because he very much can act.You can really see how he starts to turn to the dark side,his turn to the dark-side did start in Attack of the Clones after the death of his mother.In Revenge of the Sith Senator Palpatine easily manipulates Anakin's thoughts on the Jedi,he is also afraid that he will lose his beloved Padme. Senator Palpatine basically tells him that he can help him save Padme's life.After some key scenes in the movie some of Anakin's actions do haunt him.He knows after one scene in particular that he has done the wrong thing.Senator Palpatine uses this to his advantage and Anakin is basically lost to the Jedi at this point. I thought the lightsaber battles in the movie were exceptional.The last couple of scenes in Revenge of the Sith were in my opinion very strong and emotional especially the scenes with Obi-Wan and Anakin and also the Scenes with Obi-Wan and Padme.The scenes with Anakin and Padme was also very strong.Samuel L.Jackson's role as Mace Windu was fantastic. His scenes with Anakin,Obi-Wan and (darth sidious) Senator Palpatine were exceptional.The lightsaber duel was heart-stopping.Natalie Portman is an exceptional actress George Lucas really hit the mark by casting her in this role. He also did really good by casting the rest of the actors that he did for this movie.I really do think that he saved the best for last.One can only hope that some where down the line he will think of doing episodes 7,8,and 9 which would have Han Solo and Princess Leia's children in the main plot line.I mean does anyone really think that a 'new Sith Lord' would not be born just because Darth Vader died and the emperor was destroyed.I for one do not,I also say that the Jedi live on through Han Solo and princess Leia's children.I thought the plot of the movie was great.The acting was right on,the action never really stopped for a second and the story really was well put together.I just really liked the movie everything about it was great.George Lucas really hit the jackpot with this series.I hope it really didn't end with the last movie.",10,2,4,20 February 2006
