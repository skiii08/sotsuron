Ford v Ferrari," A shot of adrenaline during the action scenes
","Bale's performance was great as always, he always brings magic to every character but I also enjoyed Matt Damon's role as Carrol Shelby as well.
The final race was incredible and shout out to everyone that was involved in the making of this movie. Miles looking in the mirror and seeing that no one was even close to him was very beautiful. Great character shift when Ken (a self centered prick) decided to slow down so that he could cross the finish line with his teammate.
Props to the writers for adapting a screenplay for this film. I bet it wasn't easy trying to make a movie about racing cars but also have a lot of character development.",8,1,4,14 March 2020
Hereditary," What is there left to be said
","So Hereditary. I've seen this film a handful of times by now and each time I seem to be finding more and more detail throughout the background. The name Ari Aster speaks for itself and he is one fine up and coming film maker.
As a horror movie enthusiast, trails seem to be the death of a movie for me. If i am interested in a film I tend to watch the trailers over and over again to the point where I could theoretically map out the entire movie. But with Hereditary, each chapter offers something way off from what I though was about to happen. Each scene offers something for the audience to grasp at and boy did it deliver.
More on the movie. I LOVE the Kubrick like use of the camera and the style in which we follow the characters from one room to the next; it's very satisfying to watch. The use of darkness really helps seal in the dread of this family as one by one they are being 'sacrificed'. The scene with Charlie (you know the one) was unexpected, like I kept thinking to myself 'no she's going to be alright, theres no way THAT just happened', and then two shots later we see the aftermath; brilliant. The scariest scene to me was when Annie (the mom) was chasing Peter (the son) up the stairs and into the attic. First of all, Annie came out of nowhere from the shadows of the living room (which might i add, was surrounded by naked people) and started running down Peter. He somehow evades her and closes the attic door behind him. And here's the scariest part, we heard something banging over and over and it cuts to Annie banging her head on the attic door like an 90's metal guitarist. On top of that a few scenes later, we hear some sort of crunching/slushing noise. The camera pans up from Peter and it's Annie floating from the ceiling and working on beheading herself with a piano wire. She starts off slow and works the wire back and forth faster and faster (meanwhile Peter jumps out of the window lol) until her head completely falls off and we hear a thud. That final 10-15 minutes are some of the most intense and horrifyingly graphic piece of cinema I have ever witness and I watch a lot of horror movies.
I cannot rave about this movie enough and I wish horror was more mainstream and appeal to a wider audience.
With that being said, it's a damn shame and a travesty that Toni Collette did not get an Oscar nomination from her terrific acting in this. Her screaming, 'I JUST WANT TO DIE', hit real deep in me. This is one of the greatest horror achievement this decade and I would even spread it out to this century.
Overall, this is a must see film regardless of genre and has a ton of rewatchable factors. There is so much detail that you miss the first time (or first several times) you see it and it doesn't get old.",8,0,0,6 April 2020
Train to Busan," Good not great
","One of my favorite zombie movie, though parts of it was very predictable. I went into it blind with very little expectation but enjoyed the rollercoaster I was strapped on to.
The characters were okay. I know they were trying to invest a lot of dialogue to keep you emotionally attached to each death but I wasn't feeling it. The hobo guy should've died a long time ago but they kept him around so that there would be someone to save the pregnant women and the kid. The dads death at the end felt forced and was completely unnecessary. He only died for dramatic effect purposes.
I did like one character though, the train conductor. He was always cool, calm, and collective. He tried to save as many people as he could but that ultimately lead to his demise.
It's a good movie but not something I would watch again any time soon.
Though I am intrigue to see how Train to Busan part 2 will unfold.",6,3,5,8 September 2019
Knives Out," Donuts and donut holes
","I never knew how much I needed to hear Daniel Craig talk in a southern accent. Him talking about donut holes inside of donuts was a much needed comic relief in such an entertaining movie. There were very few moments, that I could remember, that were slow; every scene I felt like something important was being said or done.
I was truly waiting for the twist when Harlan would jump out at the end and reveal that this was just another game to see who was worthy of this inheritance; but I like this ending better.
My favorite scene was the police chase when Ransom was telling Marta to step on it and it zooms in on the speedometer barely cracking 50 or 60 mph.
Overall, A great movie and very entertaining from start to finish.",9,2,4,14 March 2020
Taxi Driver," One of the best film from the 1970s'
","Martin Scorsese's great social commentary on the effects of loneliness and being disconnected from other people.
Robert De Niro was brilliant in how he's able to make the audience feel for Travis. We feel happy for him when he gets the girl, we cringe when he takes her to the adult theater, we feel helpless when he plans to kill the pimp.
There were a lot of metaphors and symbolisms in this movie that will certainly render a second viewing to fully appreciate.",8,1,3,12 September 2019
Toy Story 4," Good
","I grew up with Toy Story and seeing this chapter of my life close is both daunting and tranquil.
Although this is not my favorite movie of the franchise, it was still emotional to watch, with Woody leaving with Bo Peep and handing over this badge. It just feels right. Through the first 3 movies, Woody was always looking out for the other toys and desire to please Andy, he never did anything fulfilling for himself. This movie was about Woody and his search for his missing void and that shows, with what little screen time the other toys had but that's okay.
Sporky was such a hassle to have around (lol), with him always calling himself trash and trying to kill himself.
Gabby Gabby's arch was evil and sad but I'm glad they didn't make her the villain. She was also trying to please her human, ala Woody and Andy, that she was willing to do anything to fill that hole in the heart. She just went about it in the wrong way.
Overall, I enjoyed the film and hope they make a 5th because I need an ending for Buzz. He was basically pushed aside the entire movie until the very end and that's just not good enough for me.",8,0,0,21 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino at his finest
","It's nice for a change to sit in a theater and watch an original movie, this one is special in particular because there isn't a definitive plot to follow. We're just on a journey in a life of a has been actor and his stunt double.
By far some of the best acting I've seen Leo and Brad in.
This movie is funny, violent, and suspenseful. The scene at the ranch with Brad was one of the most intense moments I've in a theater in a long time. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time and couldn't look away. If Tarantino wanted to make a horror movie as his final film, I would be first in line to see it.
I was very unexpected that the Manson murders would be the funniest scene. When Rick pulled out the flamethrower from his shed, I was crying because I was laughing so hard.
This is what movies should be about and this is how Quentin makes his movies; his way and how he wants it to be.",9,7,11,8 September 2019
1917," Good cinematography; okay plot
","I loved the use of the 'one shot' effect; I remember seeing for the first time in Birdman. The cinematography was amazing and credit to Roger Deakins and his crew but the screen play was really lacking in a lot of places. I never really got pulled into the screenplay; I just knew that the protagonist needed to deliver a message. Overall, a good movie but I felt Sam Mendes could've added a little more to it.",7,0,0,14 March 2020
Midsommar," Love it
","This movie is about the importance of grievance and having the people you love and care about grieving with you. You must be allowed to heal and have the support of others to help you heal. That's what the cult was to Dani. Dani seeing the other women crying with her helped her realize that she is better off living in this life and leaving behind her old self.
The scene on the cliff really gets you clinching.
I read that during the writing of this movie, Ari was going through a tough breakup, hence, the festival and killings/sacrifice.",7,0,4,8 September 2019
Rosemary's Baby," Errie
","I watched this classic for the first time the other day and I have to say that this movie still holds up. It's eerie and creepy from the opening shot; the dreams were David Lynch/ Twin Peaks-like. The whole entire film was a slow burn to the end.
The ending is so good, the reveal that her son is a demon is everything and more; everyone yelling 'hail satan' is too funny.
The chase sequence was so intense and suspenseful. When Rosemary locks the door and goes to use the phone and two gentleman walk pass the doorway, I felt so helpless for her. The fact that her husband, doctor, and everyone around her has been gas lighting her felt so horrifying.
Overall, I really enjoyed the film and I really thought that I wouldn't have. The music was good and the character development was very good. I'm curious about how people from around that time reacted to the satanism. There's a lot of things from Rosemary's Baby that remind me of Hereditary.P.S. HAIL SATAN!",8,1,1,15 April 2020
Joker," It more than surpass the hype it was given
","Joaquin Phoenix with a Jake Gyllenhaal Nightcrawler-esqe performance. The way he's able to make you feel uncomfortable and anxious with just his facial expression and mannerisms was incredible. The uncontrollable laughter was painful (in a good way) to watch.
I saw it opening day but waited to do a review until I got to see it again; and boy was it worth a second viewing. All the little details about Arthur's neighbor/girlfriend was right in front of us the whole time.
I do however, feel for Jared Leto. He's going to be remembered as the 'd a m a g e d' Joker in between Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix.
Great movie and totally deserving of all the praise it's getting.Also, I love the way Joker says 'Mur-RAY'.",9,2,3,16 November 2019
Parasite," SO GOOD!
","Although Bong Joon-Ho's American movies have been subpar, his Korean movies still continue to be must see, especially on the big screen. His direction and attention to detail is something to marvel at. Every scene has a plethora of minuscule features hidden in plain sight of the background, which most certainly was not put there by accident. If you have seen Joon-Ho's other film, you would know that Bong punctiliously puts all of these portend in the back drop of his scripts.
Honestly, this is one the few movies in a long time that I can appreciate the emotions it put me through after watching it. I can't stop thinking about all the excitement, agony, disturbance, turmoil, and sorrow that was brought upon me. Bong did a tremendous job creating the atmosphere with the music and complexity of his characters. It certainly deserves the Palme d'Or (I haven't seen The Lighthouse yet) and all the praise that comes with it. I hope Parasite gets an Oscar nomination for best picture but I'm most certain it won't because it's an international film (bunch of cowards).
This film is a great social commentary of the economic gap between the rich vs. the poor (a common theme for Korean movies). At the beginning, the Kim family seems to be like hearted and content on being good people. Later on, after making money beyond their wildest dream, they slowly started to change. For example, before when the drunken guy was peeing in front of their house, they were content on keeping to themselves and let him be. After the money had been rolling in, they decided that they had enough 'status' to throw water at the drunken guy and kicked him out. Not to mention that they were willing to kill the maid and her husband just so they can keep their image.
My favorite scene is when the sister is sitting on top of the flooding toilet smoking a cigarette. For some reason that scene just resonates with me. She had been putting on this act for so long and just found out that her home had been flooded. Her home, the place where she can drop her act and truly be herself is now gone. So she sits there on top of a toilet that's now bursting with back flow of fecal matter and septic waste. She takes a puff from a lit cigarette in between her fingers hoping that for just one minute she can drop her guard.
The dad tearing up as he carries what little belong he has left from his flooded home was my second favorite scene of the film. He had for the longest time, wanted the rich home and forgot where he came from and what a home is to him.
From what I just said above, I feel like an unspoken character in this movie is the rich house. Everybody strives to get to the house for no other reason than their selfish greed and appraisal for a higher status. The basement is where you can go and hide to get away from your mistakes. The son, after he gets out of the hospital, went back to the house to check on, I presume, the girl. They are all drawn to the place.
As a cinephile, I was pleased to go into this blind. The less you know, the better and the more suspense you will feel. There are so many layers that keeps getting uncovered at each act. The twist and turns in the third act is worth the price of admission alone.
The only drawback I have for the US release is, the film was very limited in my area. It wasn't too bad for me but from what I read, other people said that the closest theater playing Parasite for them was over 50 miles away. I know that not a lot of Americans care for foreign films, but you are really doing yourself a disservice by demarcating yourself and not seeing it.",10,4,10,26 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Loved how that captured how silly Nazi ideology is.
",I loved how silly this movie was but at the same time the sad scenes are really touching. I mean the way the close up of Rosie's shoes was revealed was heartbreaking. Everyone was well cast and really played it well. With that being said we needed more Yorki; he was such an adorable character and was just going along with what everyone was telling him to do.,8,0,2,14 March 2020
What We Do in the Shadows," Heard about this film and decided to watch it. So funny!
","Taika Waititi is great in the movie and has yet to make a film that I won't watch.
I absolutely love the premise of this film; just a bunch of vampires living in a flat together.
Stu was a great side character and I read that Stu is an actually IT on the set of the movie that didn't realize that his screen time was going to be in the final cut, which makes his character all the better.
I feel bad for Peter though, he didn't have to go out like that.
Also, BAT FIGHT!",7,0,0,12 September 2019
Da 5 Bloods," What an appropriate movie for this political climate
","Spike Lee could not have released this film at a more appropriate time given the protest that's currently happening.
If the Oscars were happening this year I would put my money on Delroy Lindo winning the best actor award. He was amazing in this and his acting and Spike Lee's direction was so good. Especially the scene when he goes off on his own in the jungle and was talking to himself.
What a rollercoaster this was. From the beginning they are all hugging and having fun at the club but it gets more and more grim from there.
My favorite scene was when they were on the boat going past all the shops and Paul gets offered a chicken. The tension was insane and the series of emotions that Paul and the seller goes through was intense. Paul went from simply saying 'no' to saying racial slur to crying and admitting that he's been seeing ghost to getting everyone together.
I didn't really like how predictable some of the scenes were. When they introduced Hedy, I knew that the land mines were going to come up later down the road. Speaking of that, Eddies death was so expected; when they showed a wide shot to Eddie walking backwards away from the group, I 100% knew he was going to blow up. At the same time, I didn't expect Spike to show us the aftermath of the land mine explosion.
I love the fact that Spike Lee didn't use deaging in the flash back scenes. I feel that having the present day Blood in the flash back was a great use of how memory works; you always picture you current self in old memories. Also, because Norman died, they all never got to see him grow old so he is always young to them.
The scene that got me feeling emotional was when Paul sees Stormin' Norman's ghost one last time and Norman tells Paul that his death was an accident, it wasn't Paul's fault and he forgives him.
All in all, another great film by Spike Lee and the timing could not be more perfect for it's release. The ending with the gold being donated to great causes like children disabilities and Black Lives Matter was very sweet.",7,5,10,17 June 2020
