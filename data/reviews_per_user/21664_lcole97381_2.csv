The Ring," The Scariest PG-13 movie I have ever seen
","After seeing this movie, I got the chills for weeks. And that's saying something because it was rated PG-13. The story line was spectacular about a girl who was murdered by a mother and used a video tape to get her revenge on society. You don't pay much attention to the acting in this film. Naomi Watt's son in the movie was very creepy however and he really stood out in my mind. The creepiest and positively the coolest aspect of this movie was the contents of the video tape like a woman brushing her hair, a ladder and a girl in a mirror. Only the ring can make the nicest things seem so horrifying. The girl popping out of the video tape and the phone ringing saying 'seven days' helped the movie a lot too. The very beginning and the very end were the coolest parts of the movie. The only downside to this movie was that the entire movie wasn't plain horror and suspense. A lot of the movie consists of boring dialogue, but when the movie is over, I guarantee you won't even remember these stretches.",8,3,5,31 July 2005
Spider-Man 2," Not nearly as good as the original
","i don't care how much the critics loved this movie. I for one did not. If you like mushy, gushy romance chick flicks, this movie is perfect for you. If you like Spider-Man, than 1 is the perfect flick for you. This was a major disappointment for three reasons. One; Alfred Molina stunk. Unlike Willen Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Doc Oc was not by any means a threat to Spiderman or a formidable adversary. He wasn't even really evil! Two; aside from the scene where Spider-man battles Doc Oc on the train, there was no action at all in this film. This movie is just about how Peter Parker can't handle the pressure of being Spiderman and Peter Parker, and Spiderman is screwing up his love affair with Mary Jane. No action in that. Three; the question that has been on our mind for a long time after the first movie was this: What would Harry Osbourne do to Spiderman if he got him in his clutches? What has he do when he gets him? He let's him go. It's was unbelievable. The acting was fine with the exception of Alfred Molina, but you don't look for acting in an action movie. You look for action! This movie did not supply us with that and that's why it didn't do it for me.",4,3,6,31 July 2005
