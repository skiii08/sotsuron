Casablanca," On my very short list of must sees
","Casablanca has every right to be considered amongst the best ever made because of its timelessness. As noted in another comment, Casablanca remains as complex, funny, romantic, and full of suspense as it did when it first graced the silver screen nearly 60 years ago. I recommend it often, and rarely do my friends not thoroughly enjoy the film, despite the fact that most of my friends and I were not born until 35 years after it was written. Those few that didn't like it simply don't like anything in black and white, which is their loss I suppose (the colorized version, to be frank, sucks). In short, if you enjoy movies and can stand B&W, then you should watch this film. Even if you don't like most B&W films you should watch it; odds are you'll like this one.",10,1,1,15 June 1999
Citizen Kane," The greatest American tragedy
","Although Kane did not top my personal list (it lost a photo finish to Casablanca), it is easy for me to see how it tops so many others. Although its technical aspects have long since been surpassed, you must remember that, like any great piece of art, Kane cannot be removed from its place in time. It is not terribly difficult to create a fake Picasso, for example, but the original has value because of the vision of the artist, not the brush strokes themselves. Welles was certainly not lacking in vison for Kane. What further separates Kane from the pack is its strong acting and great tragedy; that of a man that achieved great wealth, power, and fame, was destroyed by it and on his deathbed yearns for the simple life of his youth that was later denied to him.",10,1,2,15 June 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Wow! I'm not alone!
","After looking at some of the other comments, I am relieved to find out that I am not the only person that does not worship this movie. Yes, the D-Day invasion scenes were great and Tom Hanks was up to form, but the middle of the movie was so schmaltzy that I really couldn't get into it. Frankly, I resented the fact that they thought that my emotions could be manipulated by the cliched characters and sentimental dialogue that dominated the middle of the movie. Although my opinion appears to be in the minority, it is reassuring to know that there are a fair number of people who share it. Final analysis: 4/10 Watch first 1/2 hour or so and skip the rest.",4,1,2,15 June 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Plot too thin
","I'm afraid that I must join the chorus of those that question the placement of this movie at the top of the rankings. Although I enjoy the movie a great deal, it is mainly because of the superb job done by the actors, especially the leads. Without that, I don't think the movie would have amounted to much, because the plot is relatively thin; wide swaths could have been cut from the film and no one would have noticed. Take the library Andy built. It did not advance the basic plot at all, as with other scenes. You could argue that it was precisely these small events that made the film good, and I would agree. But that's my point:there wasn't really anything tying the movie together other than our sympathy for the characters. While well developed characters are a central part of any good movie, there should still be something driving the action other than our sympathy for them; i.e. some sort of chain of events that drives the action independently of the characters. To everyone who thinks this is the best movie ever, I invite you to watch a couple films from the top 5 of the AFI list. You can argue about the AFI's placement all day, but all of the top 5 are better rounded films than Shawshank. If you still feel Shawshank is better than the rest, more power to you.",7,0,0,15 June 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Script Editor, Where Art Thou?
","While I have enjoyed all of the Coens' brothers previous works, I have to say that this movie is probably one of worst films I saw this year, if only because I had such respect for their previous works that I went in with high expectations. The problem as I see it is that the script was trying too hard. There are far too many scenes in the movie that do nothing to advance the story but simply exist to cause a recollection of Homer's work. Whole subplots could have been excised from the script, most notably the sirens subplot, which ended with the characters in exactly the same spot as they had been before but left the audience some 10-15 minutes older. Same goes with the Babyface subplot, or the Cyclops. At least one of these 3 should have been cut from the script and the minutes added to the other subplots. Instead, the Coens include all three and meander between these scenes like a bad sitcom. The Coens strong point, the creation of quirky characters, is also sadly lacking in this feature. What made Lebowski work is that you knew where the characters were coming from. Same goes for Fargo, Hudsucker, Raising Arizona, etc. The audience came to know and love the characters' quirks, and the Coens were able to let their quirks drive the movies. In Oh Brother, however, the audience is never really allowed to see what makes the characters work, and so the plot has to drive the movie. As I noted previously, this made the movie utterly unsuccessful because of the overloaded script. On the whole, I would give this movie only 3/10, only because of the music and because one of Babyface's lynchers yelled 'Cow Killer!' as if this were his greatest crime.",4,1,1,24 January 2001
