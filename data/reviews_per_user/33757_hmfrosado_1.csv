Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," He was making fun of one country, but not kazakhstan
","Do you think really that he was making fun of the glorious nation of kazakhstan ? humm i don't think so. Lets see: 1 - The scene about the stupid American drunk young generation who think women are lesser life forms and so on and so on...2 - Rodeo conversation trying to demonstrate the interior of America, yes the dumb and stupid one, who think America is the center of universe and we have to get rid of 'the bad guys'... i mean 'the rest of the word' 3 - The good family American way of life, with all the manners and thoughts that they have all the wisdom to teach other how to behave... when in the night the same ones go to night clubs and put some ornamentation to their wifes and husbands...4 - All the fanatism with the religion was a clear message by 'Borat' that exists worst religious fanatism in USA that in other country in the world.5 - The idea of aiming a dream all made of plastic and cilicone i think was the main message to the American people. Please change your way of life and give more importance to things that really matter.It was a very very intelligent movie.",9,5,16,10 December 2006
