Insidious: Chapter 2," Meh... not that great
","The first movie ended with Elise dying, presumably killed by Josh, and this one this movie starts off with the ramifications. The good news is that the son is no longer possessed, but the bad news is that Josh now probably is (by a different demon). The family moves into yet another new house, but Rene once again starts seeing spooky images and entities. This time it seems to be Josh who is possessed, as he now starts exhibiting strange behavior. Josh's mother hire Tucker and Specs, the paranormal investigators from the first movie, as well as investigator Carl, to investigate the circumstances of Elises' death. Once again we learn that demons are to blame. I think to plot from this movie is too similar to the first one. There also aren't as many real scares this time, most of them are just cheap. Also, my biggest complaint of the first movie was that the last act was boring and dragged on too long, and that kind of happens here, but thankfully its shorter this time and the climax is a bit more exciting. The story is just plain confusing at times, like how the humans enter and exit the Further(the spirit world). I also thought Tucker and Specs were really annoying characters.The good things are that we get more of Joshs' backstory this time to explain how he got possessed. We learn more about the spirit world, too. The scares that do work are really effective, so at least there's that.Insidious 2 is nice if you are a horror fan, but those who liked the 1st will probably be underwhelmed by this.",5,0,0,16 February 2014
Iron Man 3," Better than 2, about the same as 1
","I have never really been a big Iron Man fan, and I thought the first movie was just fine, and the second was very hit-and- miss, with more misses than hits. This movie was overall better than 2. Robert Downey Jr. once again returns as Tony Stark with even more cool gadgets for his iron man suits. This movie takes place after the Avengers and there are a few flashbacks referencing it from Tony's PTSD.The villain this time is the Mandarin, a violent world-threatening terrorist, played by Ben Kinglsey. Without giving too much away, he targets Tony and makes his life miserable. I actually though the Mandarin was a weak villain though. Some people may not like what they end up doing with him either. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle return as Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. War Machine returns and is also now called Iron Patriot. I liked both characters more in this movie than the other 2 and they have more important roles here. Pepper is in the first act, then disappears for a long time, then returns in the third act and I like what they did with her character. The movie is the darkest in tone of the trilogy, because of how Tony's world falls apart around him, but there is still a lot of funny dialogue and banter between characters, like in the other 2. A lot of this movie concerns Tony Stark only, not Iron Man. But the good thing is that Tony is not a total jerk like in the previous movie, he actually has a heart and tries to connect with people and help save the day.A few complaints I have are that the movie lags a bit in the middle, but not to a crawling pace. War Machine/Iron Patriot makes a few appearances but barely does anything. There are several plot twists in this movie, some I liked, some I didn't, like what they did with the Mandarin. The weapons that the Mandarin creates are completely unrealistic to me and seem like they belong in an entirely different movie. Also, he 3d was just OK, but not quite as good as I expected.Overall the movie works. It's a good summer film (taking place at Christmas) and mostly delivers what it promises. If you liked the second one then you'll definitely like this one.",7,1,5,3 May 2013
Life of Pi," Great survival story with beautiful 3D
","This movie was better than I thought, not just because of the 3D, but because it's the story of a boy's heartfelt story of survival. After his family decides to move their zoo from India to North America, a terrible storm capsizes their ship. The boy, named Pi (short for Piscine, which is French for pool),finds himself awash on a lifeboat with a giant Bengal tiger. Pi must not only learn to survive at sea, but keep himself from being eaten! The story is told through flashbacks given by an adult Pi, played by Irrfan Khan, as he recalls his tale to a journalist who wants to write about him, played by Rafe Spall. Teenage Pi is played by Suraj Sharma and he gives a very convincing performance of a boy who has lost everything, but still hopes to survive. There are also flashbacks of Pi's boyhood as he finds enlightenment with various religions and discovers love for the first time. You learn a lot about this boy's background before the main story actually happens. Visually, this is one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. Right from the beginning, the opening shots of the various animals at the zoo are shot beautifully. The 3D is also very effective. The shipwreck scene, which is quite long, was amazing to behold, with the water effects and animals floating. The Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker, is mostly CGI, but at times he looked so real and so up close that my hairs stood up. There are also other impressive scenes involving luminous jellyfish and agile flying fish.The movie has several spiritual messages, due to Pi's multi-religious lifestyle, and that may turn off some viewers. The ending may also confuse viewers (I was left scratching my head for a while), but these are the only real flaws I find with the movie. Pi's story of survival is very engaging and beautiful to look at. I think Ang Lee has created his best film yet.",9,2,5,23 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Yeah, it sounds clich√©, but the book was better.
","Since this is the 7th movie in the series, you pretty much have to be caught up by this point because it gets right into the plot without explaining much, but that's simply because it would take too much time. After just reading the book for the second time, I can safely say that I would have been mostly lost if I hadn't read it.The movie's pacing is all over the place. The first third has a very brisk pace, but then it slows down a LOT in the middle, but to be fair that's how it went in the book too. Then it finally starts to pick up again near the end. This is also, put simply, a road movie with Harry, Ron, and Hermione out to find the remaining horcruxes, while camping in many different locations and getting themselves in one situation after another. Some of these situations were pretty downplayed compared to the book, but some, such as the Malfoy manor scene were handled much better.What more can you say about Harry, Ron, and Hermione at this point? This movie is all about them, more than any of the other movies. However, this does give them nice moments of character development. Of course many other characters make appearances, but they are only around for 1 or 2 scenes.The film has a dark and tight feel to it. Many scenes are filmed very up close and some are so dark I could barely see what's going on, which took a lot of impact out of those scenes (you think they would use that Lumos spell more often). However the set pieces, such as the forest, for the most part look nice.This is not my favorite movie in the series. It fact it might not even make the top 3, but still it could be worse. I'm just glad I read the book first.",5,2,2,26 August 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," More modern update is not exactly a good thing
","A reboot only 5 years after the previous movie? Seems a bit odd. This movie has all new actors and retells the story of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman. This time he is played by Andrew Garfield, and he really plays up the emo teen angle. He acts like a jerk and talks back to his aunt and uncle. To me that got annoying fast.Instead of Mary Jane, we get Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone. I liked her for the most part and Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard. I thought the lizard looked downright weird with the blatant CGI. Also the motivation that turned him evil was kind of hard to buy.The scenes with Peter coming into his powers are pretty amusing. Also his romance with Gwen was very convincing. What I didn't like was his attitude, he's a lot more jerkish and self-centered then the comedian hero we're used to. He doesn't get a lot of funny lines and acts like an idiot through most of it.The action, including the climax battle, is good but not great. It's pretty standard superhero fare these days. Overall the worst of the 4 movies so far, and die hard fans probably won't like it.",5,1,3,2 February 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Fun adventure with some good laughs.
","First of all, I saw this is 2d, which slightly dampened the experience because I could tell that some sequences were shot for 3d. I also saw it at 24 fps, and it looked beautiful so no complaints there.As a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this movie is very light and fanciful, especially in the beginning. Some parts are very similar to Fellowship, with some familiar locations fans will enjoy. The beginning when the dwarfs all arrive at Bag End had me laughing quite a bit. However, it is quite a while before Bilbo actually leaves the Shire on his adventure, and this attributes to he movies length of 170 mins.Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are both great as Bilbo and Gandalf. Ian seems like he never left Gandalf and slipped right back into his wizard boots. The dwarfs are all given their own personalities, although some more than others, and they all help Bilbo out a lot. They give some great comedy relief too. Visually the movie looks great. The Shire is as beautiful as ever, as is Rivendell. Everyone's heard that Gollum is in here, and he has one extended scene that is probably my favorite in the whole movie. There is also a fantastic escape sequence near the end. My only real complaints are the movie's length and a couple of sevens that seemed unnecessary. At 170 mins. you will need to set aside an entire afternoon to go see it. But I still had a lot of fun with it. It might be a little to violent for young kids, but any other age should enjoy it.",8,4,12,22 December 2012
Insidious," Pretty scary and petty fun, but not perfect
","We have a nice quiet family living in a nice house. All of a sudden the oldest son gets possessed by a demon. He starts seeing horrific visions and soon they start showing up in the house. This results in a lot of jump scares. Some are scary, but some are really cheap, like the house alarm. Anyway the parents seek help from a group of exorcists to help free the boy from possession. This movie has a lot of effective imagery. The demons look really strange, especially when they're out in the real world. The move does go a little over the top with scare chords and hammy acting, but this is probably deliberate. The exorcism scene is the best scene in the whole movie. It is very intense and dark (literally) and memorable.My problem with the movie is the last act, which gets very slow and almost turns into a completely different movie. The atmosphere changes completely and it pretty much becomes a haunted house ride that drags on for a long time. Also, random things happen at times for no reason other than to scare you. These things brought the movie down a bit.Overall, a good movie if your looking for a few good scares. But don't get dragged down by the bad ending.",7,0,1,13 February 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Very pleasantly surprised
","This movie was simply wonderful. We finally see he series come to an end, and boy does it go out with a bang! We get way more action here than in the previous movie, and it moves at a much quicker pace (which is how the book goes too). Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally stop camping in the woods and return to Hogwarts, and the battle ensues with Voldemort and his army almost immediately after. A few things happen in the movie before this, but the movie really starts at Hogwarts. In the book, Harry was absent from most of the battle, but here we get to see extensive footage of it and Hogwarts gets torn up! The special effects here are the best they've ever looked, and the powerful score is very effective at playing you to root for Harry and his friends. And yes, several main characters do die.My only real complaints of the movie were that Voldemort is a bit over the top, and some characters don't get nearly enough screen time. Also, the epilogue feels a bit rushed in order to end the movie in a timely manner. These are mostly forgivable though.This ties for the 3rd movie as my favorite in the series. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all very well-acted, the action is great, the score is beautiful, and I was engaged the whole time. This movie is one of the best ways to kill an afternoon.",9,0,1,7 September 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The silver medal of the trilogy
","First off, I LOVED the first movie, it was fun and fun to look at. Then the second movie came and I HATED it. It took everything great about the first one and flipped it on its shiny metal ass. I gotta say that this movie is marginally better than 2, but still nowhere near 1.You don't need to know the plot here because it barely exists anyway.There are a lot of annoying characters, both human and robot, that deliver bad performances and really bad jokes. In fact the first hour is full of these bad jokes. The first action scene is really boring and forgettable. How could they screw up Optimus fighting a giant driller worm? The first hour is boring and almost a completely different movie with hardly any robots or action. Instead, we get Shia LaBeouf trying to find a job and please his new impossibly hot girlfriend in a painfully long and unnecessary sequence. You can almost skip that entire part.Thankfully, the move gets much better in the second half, where a HUGE battle takes place in Chicago. The effects and the set pieces look amazing here. This is where you gotta give credit to Michael Bay. The robot fights are also filmed better here than in the other two movies. Two scenes get special mention: the highway chase involving Decepticons and the skyscraper. Those scenes are really intense and fun to watch. Like I said the entire second half is pretty much one big prolonged battle scene. It has some great moments, but some are filmed poorly or just plain long. Also the movie ends very abruptly, with about 30 seconds of aftermath.Put simply, the movie is pretty bad overall. Most characters are annoying, the writing is bad and the jokes are horrible. The robots and other CGI look great, but they cannot cover up the flaws. Only the second half is worth watching.",3,4,7,9 June 2013
