Casablanca," Why it's so great...
","Here's my humble breakdown of the elements that make this film so uncannily wonderful:1) The Story.  It's filled with memorable characters, exotic settings, and heroic adventure. (And a classic love story.)2) The Cast.  You've got the most charming anti-hero ever, one of Hollywood's most mystically beautiful actresses, and several of the best character actors ever to appear on-screen.3) The Screenplay.  So compact ... so economical ... so effective.4) 'As Time Goes By.'  Come on, do I have to spell that out?",10,0,0,22 August 2001
Top Secret!," Just some examples...
","I've seen this movie a dozen times, and the cow wearing boots still makes me chuckle.Also, the introduction to Deja Vu. ('Have we not met before?') And the scale model of the castle. And the bit with the giant phone.The list goes on and on.",10,0,1,22 August 2001
Braveheart," Cheesy and ham-fisted
","This film is like a three-hour ad for Mel Gibson. It's pretty good on the technical front: the battles are great, the costumes are neat, and the pictures are stunning (or at least interesting.) But the script is so thoughtless, so blatantly Hollywood-ized, that it's impossible to take any of it seriously. Unfortunately, the actors play it like friggin' Shakespeare. The script is transparent as it divides characters into heroes and villains, then divides them again into superheroes and supervillains. And the 'dramatic' moments (such as 'They'll never take...our FREEDOM!' or 'Every man dies, not every man truly lives') feel phony and jingoistic. Mel Gibson isn't made to play superheroes. His persona is a balance between heroic bravado and self-deprecating charm. In a movie this melodramatic, he feels totally false and out of place.",4,3,6,22 August 2001
