The Blair Witch Project," Gimicky
","Let me sum up the whole movie for you. Some kids go into the woods to shoot a documentary and they die. That is the whole movie. Now just because a movie has this plot does not mean it will be bad because most horror movies have fairly simplistic plots and I like good horror movies. I will get this out of the way right now, I am 15 and if you are going to be the d*ck head who will not take my review seriously simply based on my age just go away. First of all, this movie is not nearly as 'innovative' as so many people say. Cannibal Holocaust, The Texas Chainsaw massacre, and every film from the Dogme '95 movement used this sort of camera work to give the films a realistic feel. The real brilliance came from the marketing campaign because at the time of the film's release many people believed that this was an actual documentary and IMDb even said that the actors were dead, so many moviegoers were obviously scared even before they went to the theaters. The main problem is actually that this feels too much like a realistic paranormal documentary because this means we don't get to know very much about the characters, so now that we know these aren't real people we don't have much reason to care about them. Finally my biggest gripe is that nothing happens. There are no scares until the end and the only build up we get are a few interesting (yes, I said something positive) interviews with the people of the town this takes place in, so we have very little reason to suspect that the Blair Witch is real. I realize that this was scary back in the day with all of the build up and I don't want to destroy your good memories or viewing experience if the effect still remains with you. I just want to explain that in all honesty this movie has aged poorly and is on my sh*t list.",1,2,4,5 August 2014
Man of Steel," Zack Snyder tries to make a Nolan movie.
","Who the hell thought this was a good idea? Why would you team up Christopher Nolan, one of the greatest filmmakers alive, with a pretentious and incompetent Michael Bay clone like Zack Snyder. The characters are all bland and superman is a hypocrite. 'I don't mind destroying all of these buildings full of people, but I'll cry like a little b*tch when I kill this genocidal maniac'. Once again name a character with more than one personality trait. We are also treated to some nice anti eugenics propaganda which uses the old eugenics=Hitler argument basically. I know I am lingering on this, but Zodd is not three dimensional because his reasons for doing what he does are so weak. The film also like to throw random thought-provoking things at us. People on Krypton had no free will now go think about the nature of free will even though this has nothing to do with the plot. The conversations and flash backs which make up most of the movie are boring because the characters are too bland to care about. There are also a ton of plot holes. Please fanboys explain why Lois Lane was let on the ship. Product placement is everywhere and it is annoying and obvious. There is very little action in this movie, and the one good action scene we get is ruined by the idiotic decision to use shaky cam.",1,2,7,12 August 2014
The Village," Some merit, but not much.
","This was a film with a lot of potential, but it was just bogged down with problems. The music was a mixed bag because some of it was actually quite nice while other parts of the soundtrack were just cringe worthy. The acting is just bad even from some of the amazing actors this film received. It just felt like the film makers went with the first take and the actors weren't given enough time to get used to the style of speaking that was used in this film, although towards the end it seemed like some actors began to settle into their roles. The camera work was very competent and I really liked the look of the village. The characters had potential, but they weren't really given enough time to develop and they didn't really work off of each other very well. Nothing really scared me in the film because we never saw anyone actually get hurt, so the creatures never gave the illusion of being a threat. The motives of the elders and the way the society in the film works do bring up some interesting questions, but it just doesn't warrant an entire film being mad, and other films have touched on similar themes.",3,1,4,11 August 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Is 'hipstery' a word
","I hope 'hipstery' is a word because that would be the perfect adjective to describe this film. I will say that the cinematography, acting, and the overall look of the film were nice, but that doesn't make it worth watching. Now I'm not going to pull out that stupid argument that the audience is made up of pedophiles because I know some decent people who like this film. First of all, this film does not take place in any sort of reality that is relatable because the people take several things way more seriously than any sane person would in real life, all of the characters do and say things that no human being does or says (no they are not just being quirky), and apparently shock therapy is considered acceptable in this world. Also, this film isn't funny. Wes Anderson was clearly going for that awkward sort of humor, but it doesn't work because that sort of humor has to be relatable and this film takes place on some other planet. A great example of this kind of humor working is in the series 'Chobits'. Yes, Wes Anderson could not making a film as relatable as a show about a horny college kid who finds a sexy humanoid computer on the side of the road. The characters are boring. Seriously name one character with more than one personality trait. The whole thing just felt like a test to see if anyone would be brave enough to stand up to the majority and call this thing out for the pretentious waste of time that it is.",1,28,55,11 August 2014
The Matrix," Some good ideas, some bad ideas, and horribly executed
","Now let me start out by saying I have seen two movies by the Wachowski brothers 'The Matrix' and 'Speed racer'. While in my opinion these films were both bad I am still willing to give 'Cloud Atlas' and 'Bound' a chance, but the subject of this review is 'The Matrix'. Now I will start out by saying the acting is just okay. Keanu Reeves' puts his one talent, looking very confused, to work quite nicely, so I can't believe the original consideration for this role was Will Smith. The rest of the cast does okay, but they don't have much to work with. Seriously, name one personality trait of any character. It's difficult isn't it? By the way I don't mean what the character does I mean what are they like. Next, I am sure the action was cool at the time, but there actually isn't much action. The one good action scene was lifted straight from the movie 'blade' and bullet time was actually invented by the brilliant director Yasuomi Umetsu, just watch 'Kite' and you will know what I mean. Plus the bullet time doesn't make the action any more exciting it's just there to look cool. The philosophy is somewhat interesting until you learn that it was all basically lifted from the film 'Ghost in the Shell'. In fact now that I think about it everything in this movie is like 'Ghost in the shell' the visuals, the story, the totalitarian, but somewhat Utopian society, all of it. I could go on about the countless plot holes and everything else that is wrong with this mess, but I'm done for today.",1,9,26,19 July 2014
