First Man," Surprisingly ready to suggest that the mission WAS greater than the men
","While Damien Chazelle's 'First Man' is definitely an interesting and even important film - as befits its 'anniversary' status, it may not quite be the film most were expecting. This has its good and bad sides - good, because a straight telling of the true-life experience might have lacked depth and artistic merit (which the movie has); bad, because this presentation does not do 'First Man' Neil Armstrong many favours, and appears to do 'second man' 'Buzz' Aldrin almost none at all!As rendered here by Ryan Gosling, Armstrong is naturally and understandably overwhelmed by the death from cancer of his young daughter Karen, which is portrayed close to the start of the film (the very start features Armstrong in a semi-disastrous X-15 mission).These two plot items are salutary in themselves, reminding us that cutting-edge high-tech of the late 60s (yes, I remember that quite well, kid though I was) was hardly good enough for space travel and not good enough to cure many (even most) diseases. And - as we are regularly reminded - it was far, far below the tech present today in one's mobile phone! The dialogue also comes back twice to the matter of the relatively limited interval in years that separated first aviation of any kind and travel to the moon. (We of course know, with some discomfort, that it was two awful wars which propelled that development along).Anyway, what happens to Armstrong does not quite make him a bad husband to wife Janet (an entirely Americanised and 60s-ised Claire Foy) or a bad father to two remaining kids, but it does make him look sullen, moody, difficult and reticent - to the point where he rarely gives a straight or meaningful answer to any question, be this posed by family or NASA. As a result, Neil 'one small step' Armstrong is muted as a hero. And, as noted above, Aldrin (in the hands of Corey Stoll) is made to look grasping and cruelly/crassly over-competitive, albeit transformed rather magically when finally on the July 1969 mission.And so to the mission, which does gain effective presentation here, including with the various mishaps and problems that preceded it. Kennedy is shown telling us how we do this because it is hard, not easy ... and indeed it looks it. Above all, we are left convinced that these really were three guys sitting cramped up, cooped up, above a giant bomb. We do get more than a hint of the discomfort and the ever-present danger, and in this dimension almost as much is achieved as with 'Gravity' - with the difference that here we are referring to real-life science and technology and engineering.The 'Last Man' on the moon was Eugene Cernan, and he was there just 3 and a half years after Armstrong and co., in December 1972. This bizarre reality is the backdrop to 'First Man', and makes the work more thought-provoking than it even deserves to be. The technology of the late 1960s and early 1970s was indeed strained to its limits (one reason why conspiracy theorists doubt the veracity - though there is no hint of that in 'First Man', thankfully); and hundreds of thousands of people made the amazing missions happen. The world gasped at them, while the astronauts doubtless breathed many a sigh of relief. Heroes they were, carrying the torch for many of us. But just part of a larger team, and - in this take at least - by no means the real-life 'supermen' we thought they were. The movie is likewise less gung-ho than we might have imagined, and the pleasing soundtrack from Justin Hurwitz is mostly more thoughtful and delicate than triumphalist.Such are the achievements of 'First Man', and they have changed a little my perspective on an event of key significance in my life, given the landing coinciding with my 5th birthday. I'm grateful for that, and doff my cap to Chazelle and writer Josh Singer for it.",8,0,0,17 August 2019
10 Cloverfield Lane," WOW! Remember what films were supposed to be like? You soon will!
","As usual taking advantage of cheap Wednesday tickets, I relaxed in a not-very-full cinema to first enjoy the trailer for the long-awaited follow-up to 'Independence Day' - a film I really loved. Hence I'm awaiting stage 2 with considerable anticipation - though also a bit of trepidation. I say this to make it clear that I've nothing whatever against many big-budget, special effects-packed films. But take away a zero or more from that and you get the intelligent and tense gem that is 'Cloverfield Lane 10'.Normally I like including spoiling aspects, as it makes for a more fun analysis of a film, but here I'm deliberately a bit more circumspect. There is a lot to be enjoyed here, and more when one knows less...This film is a little bit like two films tacked together, and it's paradoxical that you surely can 'see the join', almost glaringly so. Yet there would be limited satisfaction without both aspects. So that's the first bit of 'edge'. The second - huge - bit comes with our 3 heroes stuck in a bunker which one is the brains behind and a total control freak clearly a bit unhinged, one is the builder of, but otherwise a bit ineffectual, and one is off the street completely; there entirely by chance. This gives the perfect frame for the 'relevant knowledge and insight' that are a huge part of this film.How bad really is the catastrophe they've gone underground to escape? Is there one at all? We are kept guessing, and the man with the fullest insight, holding most of the cards, is farmer-survivalist and ex US Navy man Howard. That's the part taken by John Goodman, and boy does he ever earn his fee! Personally, I've never seen him do better. The other (younger and less able) guy down there below ground is Emmett (played by John Gallagher Jr). With the best will in the world, this is not an especially demanding part, but it's very necessary in the context of the film, as we are made to realise extremely vividly.Then our female lead is Michelle, sumptuously rendered by the excellent Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Now, by the second scene we are alerted to the fact that Michelle is a very nice-looking young woman. But she's not maybe quite a beauty queen, let's say. BUT... But... in Winstead's hands she comes over as such a resourceful, determined, gutsy person, almost a force of nature, that the more feisty and capable she becomes, the more sexy she appears! What a woman! It's really an impressive and superb transformation, but it's by no means the film's only one. Goodman's Howard goes up and down in our estimation like a yo-yo and it's great work. And when our triangle of characters get a bit settled in, and begin to mellow and get used to each other a little, it is quite surprising how tangibly and desperately we out here in the cinema are willing them on to make a go of it. And in this ocean of seriousness there are some remarkable lighter moments, when it really does look as if they might be able to ride out the storm for the 1-2 years Howard thinks it's going to take...How three mismatched losers become winners and try to work together despite huge tension in the air... It's elemental, focused, claustrophobic, interesting, exciting, unpredictable film-making from Dan Trachtenberg and the writers. So much nuance, fear and, yes, fun out of apparently so little! There are numerous scares along the way, but a lot more besides about human nature; and also plenty of subliminal stuff about the true meaning of freedom and security.As I've mentioned, we do get a reasonable number of answers after our patient wait (and even a beautiful and touching vignette of humankind-and-nature stuff much appreciated). So - thank goodness - the 'leave them wanting more' approach that many Directors seem to regard as art (rather than the torture and frustration it often appears to the audience) was eschewed. But - guess what? I STILL wanted more. They could have added another 20 to the 103 we got and it would have been all to the good. Ah well, nothing is quite perfect, but Cloverfield Lane comes pretty close as a piece of the film-maker's art.For sci fi fans it's a must-see of hugely effective minimalism, but I would hazard a guess there's many a 'normal person' out there who would also appreciate this piece of crisp, well-acted, hyper-tense drama.Very well done!",10,7,14,11 May 2016
Se7en," Uncomfortably convention-defying psychological thriller
","This high-class thriller from David Fincher is well done, tense and rather gory; and achieves a great deal with its high-quality camera-work, primarily (though not quite solely) in hammering home the overriding message over a great chunk of the film that New York is the New Sodom and Gomorrah and possibly even Hell on Earth. It rains there and is grey all the time, plenty of sin is committed, and even formerly-good people are ground down by it, turned to evil or at best becoming apathetic as the only other possible defence. This kind of apathy is also at least to some extent afflicting our key character, William Somerset, a detective on the verge of retiring played by Morgan Freeman. Nevertheless, this character is not especially popular among fellow cops, given that he asks more questions than they do, is more thoughtful (and far better-read), and he still tries that bit harder.Still less jaded and jaundiced is what will soon come to be Somerset's new partner, if only for a short period, the newly-arrived Detective Mills, as played by Brad Pitt, who has decided to bring with him from upstate a couple of dogs and a still-untainted wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. They are now living in an apartment they were conned into buying by being invited to view and visit between the times at which Subway trains go thundering by, shaking the dwelling to its very foundations.Rather quickly, Somerset and Mills come up against a methodically cunning and well-read psychopathic killer bent on putting paid to NY's sinners, turning their sins against them in the grossest and most sadistic of ways, but also in a manner that he considers entirely right and appropriate. While 5 sins are demonstrated and avenged in the Big Apple, the last two shift out to a quite non-New York-looking out-of-town locality, in which the Sun is suddenly shining. This seems a somewhat surprising tactic, given what had gone before. What is more (and unlike in most films of this kind you have ever seen) the last part takes place with the killer in handcuffs in front of our eyes, and thus revealed to us as 'John Doe' (yes, really), played in the slightly spaced-out way that only Kevin Spacey can quite manage. Furthermore, the detectives and forensic guys have already taken we the audience on a tour through Doe's roomy if cluttered and weirder-than-weird apartment, hence that traditional element of such films we already have well behind us.While much or most of the story summed up as above may sound a bit fantastic, enigmatic, apocalyptic horror-like or even sci fi-ish in tone, the greater part of the film looks (pretty much or at least ostensibly) like a conventional enough cop movie-cum-crime shocker, which leaves the in-your-face ending more of a surprise. In fact, 'surprise' is the wrong word, since we might indeed have anticipated what we get, but presumably just felt that no film maker is actually going to do this to us ... and then he does.This defying of convention established for hundreds of movies of this kind over decades has an amazingly disarming effect, and one is left a little speechless. This is only delivered more strongly by (Freeman's exquisite acting of) Somerset's behaviour at this point. Suffice it to say that the usual circumstance of the villain realising 'it's all over' is UTTERLY turned on its head here.BUT...while this approach may indeed seem shocking, innovative and even high art, the impact is so great that it does actually spoil the film a bit, at least for this very seasoned cinema-goer and film-watcher. A spring pulled beyond its ability to rebound ceases to function as a spring, and maybe here we have destroyed the cop-thriller genre by stretching it too far out of shape. Personally speaking, I found myself asking what the point of what had gone before had really been, especially where certain slightly-less-grim scenes had been concerned. Added to that is the uncomfortable idea - put into words by Doe himself - that he is somehow fighting back against omnipresent sin and evil (of course by doing still-greater evil himself). While I am usually pretty merciless with spoilers, I have - as is pretty clear - eschewed giving too much away here, because those with a reasonably strong stomach are certainly advised to give this film a go, in the unlikely event that anybody interested out there has not already done so. But the piece 'only' gets a 9 here from me, because maybe there are some things you just can't do with a film genre, at least without having to pay some price for doing so...",9,2,3,24 October 2016
Darkest Hour," Huge success for Oldman ... with more than a little help from dear Winston
","And so to Joe Wright and Anthony McCarten's much-vaunted and Oscar-rewarded 'Darkest Hour', which I caught up with after so much had already been said about it, on IMDb and elsewhere.The first thing worth noting is that this is a Churchill film and a wartime Britain film more than it is a war film. It covers just a small part of the entire conflict, and shows even that in vignette form. The most compelling of these concerns the late May 1940 'Defence of Calais', which I must confess I had not even heard of. Many thanks to the makers for raising this issue, though slightly less praise for their take on it, given that Wikipedia tells us that: a) this was a British-French operation, b) although it did cost 300 British lives (+200 wounded) that was out of 4000, so this was NOT quite a suicidal bloodbath, c) 3500 Brits were captured, along with many thousands of French, and d) a few British troops were actually rescued from the port. In any case, Calais may have achieved - at least in part - the mission Churchill had for it, and that is a fascinating and profoundly heroic story that must be recalled. Dunkirk is shown as a single (not especially convincing) scene, though its success (and Winston's success therein) is of course referred to.So otherwise, we are down to a film about wartime Britain, whose ordinary people and at-times humdrum way of life are lionised, as they were in other recent offerings like 'Their Finest'. This stands in clear opposition to the portrayal of aristocratic types like Chamberlain and Halifax, who are seen here intent on suing for peace with Hitler, in the face of what they deem certain defeat and an unwinnable situation.We must be careful with our reception of these portrayals (ordinary Brits then were of course at times rude, selfish, cowardly, profiteering and full of moans, and some even went on strike). Yet it is now impossible for many of us to remain dry-eyed when we have the ordinary people of 1940 shown to us, and more so when we imagine the contrast between them and the part-complicit, part-enslaved folk of Nazi Germany. History must have its way - and from the perspective of 2018, every single man, woman and child in the wartime UK was just simply a hero doing his or her bit. End of.That said, this film's pressing (and actually fully justified) need to somehow symbolise the circumventing of slimy politicians and other layers of authority to expose the visceral (guts-dominated) link between Churchill and the mass of the British people comes close to derailing the whole effort, with a Tube-train scene so incongruous and near-embarrassing that one has to 'close one's eyes and think of England' in order to bat on with the piece at all! Of course, the effort to swallow this heavy touch of the naff is well rewarded! And so to Churchill, and a Gary Oldman portrayal that obviously rises above all else here. Nevertheless, Kristin Scott Thomas does well (as she always does) in the role of wife Clemmie, while Ben Mendelsohn offers an impressively conviction performance as King George VI. A couple of scenes of the unlikely and at-first-awkward pairing between the King and Winston really hit home, and are both highly informative and deeply touching.But Oldman's Churchill is memorable in the truest sense, since one comes back to it repeatedly in the days after the cinema visit. It is not quite mimicry (of the voice, for example), and indeed it offers a touch of what we have not seen before - an at times rather tongue-tied, spluttery and undecided Winston, soused in alcohol and veiled in cigar smoke, oldish and even a touch confused. And, needless to say, and as the star freely admitted, the Oldman performance here, and indeed 'Darkest Hour' as a whole, would not be what it is if Churchill had not been the man HE was. His simply endless list of pithy quotes finds quite rich reflection in the film, and we do indeed see a not-much-liked man of battered reputation who now begins taking brilliant decisions and does indeed 'mobilise the English language and send it into battle'. When our hero really needs to be eloquent he can be so, and when he needs to be sober he is. He is supremely literate, cultured yet crude, vigorous and impetuous, childish and supremely mature. As in life, so here, he cries at the terrible decisions he must take, yet takes them just the same. Oldman offers us all of this, and somehow hints at background and depth he does not even present or protray. He embodies so surprisingly much of the Churchill we have read about. You know, the bricklaying historian, the experienced soldier and former POW, the Nobel Prizewinning writer, the racconteur, the painter of paintings, the loyal and loving husband, dumb school pupil and near-genius, the boy neglected by both parents, the son of a dissatisfied (and syphilis-crazed) father, the Tory (but also defecting to the Liberals) toff who could never be loved by ordinary people yet was (until 1945 when he suddenly wasn't), the maker of bad or controversial decisions and the greatest hero we have ever produced. The man who saved civilisation from unutterable evil.We have already seen countless portrayals of Churchill, and all have added something to our understanding of this impossible, wonderful man. But none have quite managed what Gary Oldman has managed ... of course with a great deal of help from Winston himself.",10,0,5,1 April 2018
The Maze Runner," Faithful to its own logic, at times intriguing, ultimately disappointing
","Let us begin by noting that there is good acting to be had here in this youthful cast, not least from Dylan O'Brian, whose character Thomas fetches up in an ostensibly well-provided-for and even kind of idyllic 'don't rock the boat and you'll be OK' world operating in accordance with its own set of internal rules, as well as - in effect - as a prison, given the external conditioning associated with gigantic walls and the imposing and unconquerable maze that exists beyond them. We the audience get increasing insights into this strange place at more or less the same time as an initially-disorientated Thomas does, and all is well done, intriguing and quite acceptable. The film effects seeking to persuade us that a gigantic (and nocturnally-mobile) maze could be built and could be defended by revolting biomechanical spider-like creatures are also good enough to serve their purpose. Hence so far, so good, and we immediately feel shades of some kind of hybrid between 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Cube'. And although the cast is young enough, the makers are surprisingly un-squeamish about having them killed off in various ways. Alas, problems begin to appear, for characters and sceptical viewer alike, as too many questions of the 'Why?' kind begin to be asked! Interestingly (and I really mean that), the character of Gally - played by Britain's Will Poulter with an American accent - actually DOESN'T want to question too much, taking a kind of 'out of the frying pan into the fire' view, whereby the existence he's got for himself seems likely to be better than, not only life in the maze, but also life in the world of before and beyond. And it is with that kind of stuff that the snags with this film really begin. We are shown how new arrivals are disorientated, not even remembering their names for a day or so, and so we could live with the idea that they don't know too much about that before and beyond. They see what they have around them, and don't question because they don't remember anything - better or worse. Right? Wrong! As the film moves on, it becomes increasingly - embarrassingly - apparent that some gaps may actually reflect failures on the part of the film-makers to care enough to cover for all those awkward questions. Good-value as ever, Thomas Brodie-Sangster plays the bright second-in-command kind of kid called Newt, and in this case a British actor remains British, but nobody thinks to ask why that should be, when everyone else (even Will Poulter) is a Yank. Then suddenly a particularly youthful kid called Chuck (again well enough played, this time by Blake Cooper) mentions his parents, so then we ask why no kid at any point previously had mentioned parents, or questioned the fact that - for some reason - they had been separated from their parents. Surely the kids would have been far less content with the society they had built had they in fact been fully aware that they once lived elsewhere, had parents, and so on? The same applies to the abrupt appearance of a one-and-only female in their society, which does not create the kind of ructions one might have expected among hundreds of young males. While they in no way lament the lack of girls earlier, at the moment one arrives, the boys are fully aware that she is a girl. While there is some truth in the idea that 'one does not miss what one has never had', it seems that they DID have some awareness that females of the species exist, yet ran a society of several years' standing well enough without them. This 'selective memory loss' plot device seems very selective indeed, and seems to be covering a multitude of sins here, leaving the whole effect profoundly unsatisfying in comparison with, say, the Star Trek Next Generation episode 'Conundrum' - in which the crew re-establish their identities, and their relative positions in the hierarchy, having indeed suffered near-total memory loss. If 'The Maze Runner' fails to match up to episode 114 of 'STTNG' (made in 1992) then we begin to wonder what we are doing watching it. As if all that were not enough, there is the certain expectation on the part of the film-goer (if not necessarily the sci-fi series watcher) that, having invested a couple of hours in a film, one will finish the thing enlightened and satisfied and having had a well-rounded experience. Suffice it to say that the ending ensures that this is no way the case with 'The Maze Runner', and unfairly so in my view, even allowing for 'part 2', which we 'only' had to wait a year for...",7,0,0,9 January 2016
Passengers," Simple/simplistic or fundamental/elemental? For me, the latter!
","This film from Director Morten Tyldum has quite a lot going for it. First and foremost, it is incredibly bold in its envisioning of the future, with spacecraft travelling to the stars on missions extending in length to centuries. (in this scenario, Arcturus, at 36.7 light years away from Earth, is a point closer to the beginning of the journey to 'Homestead II' than the end; with a close pass of that star being used to further accelerate the truly gigantic vessel, the Avalon). Not the slightest hint of how we got to that from our present primitive, first-toe-in-the-water stage is given here, and that is surprisingly refreshing: we may simply take for granted that this kind of technological level has been reached somehow, and go on and 'enjoy the show'.I certainly did! While the most recent Star Trek movie, 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar' all set high standards for imagining vessels and worlds into existence, 'Passengers' takes the prize for me; the ship is simply exquisite, but also surprisingly 'realistic' and believable. Inside, it is sumptuous, full of hi-tech ready to serve; but that comes at a price - the more you pay, the better standard you get. Shades of the Titanic, but - although our great vessel does indeed sustain a serious collision that injects some edge into the story from the very outset - all is at first subsumed by a rather light touch, as the commercial side of this venture is made abundantly clear.This then is no Star Trek-like exploration, no military/public-sector mission, no last attempt of human civilisation to escape the Earth and save itself for posterity. Rrather, it is a paid (basically one-way) passage to a new world, whereby 200+ crew serve 5000+ passengers/colonists/upper-class economic migrants, but all are in suspended animation for just about the entire journey.All, that is, except for one unlucky guy Jim (a very good part for Chris Pratt), who is awakened from stasis by the aforementioned collision and proceeds to ponder/despair on how he is going to manage for decades with only machines of various degrees of sophistication for company. The latter reach their peak in (the top half of) barman Arthur (Arthur in Avalon - get it?), as very well-played by Welshman Michael Sheen. Sweetly, various systems on the ship also feature the British voice of Emma Clarke - art imitating life, as Emma also voices the London Underground, and - to the best of my knowledge - also many lifts (elevators) around the world.Hence the 'canvas' against which the main drama plays out is huge and stark, but in other places also rich and entertaining.Now set that against a surprisingly simple storyline that nevertheless has a very great deal of meaning to offer. There is a definite hint of The Bible in here, as our lonely Adam in his Paradise needs an Eve, and he commits a kind of 'original sin' to get one (in the pleasant enough shape of Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence)). Not too many more clues from me over that, but let us say that we get to think about many issues of basic human need and loneliness, and what these things can justify. This occupies much of the film, as does a rather beautiful (and at times erotic enough) on-and-off love affair between the stars (in every sense of the term).Eventually, briefly, our two humans are joined by a third. But for a lot of the time, it's just the two of them, with hopes, ambitions and memories, and of course with Arthur the android, who is a great deal better than a laptop, but can't quite bridge that gap to full humanity.Given that we also have several sub-stories about the desire to hand-make things in a ship that repairs and maintains itself (or at least should do), the desire to bring untidy nature into these rather clinical commercial and entirely human-oriented surroundings, and of course a main plot line about those same surroundings gradually deteriorating into a death trap, there is a lot said here about loneliness, love, meaning, need, sacrifice, devotion ... and basically what is superficial in our lives and what isn't.The film's very final plot device is justified artistically, and quite moving, even if it resembles the beginning in deliberately dodging a number of difficult and complex moral/ethical (and also intellectual) questions. This 'less is more' approach is interesting, and all the more so when we note that some moral and intellectual issues ARE addressed in detail here, while others are skimmed over. Since I normally 'demand' an entirely cohesive scenario with no plot holes, I surprise myself by noting how much of a virtue the approach taken by 'Passsengers' actually turns out to be. It evokes an idea of 'Impressionism' that goes a long way to confirming the status of this particular film as a piece of art. It also suggests that the makers are firmly in charge of their film, and know what they want/choose - and do not want/choose - to achieve with it (actually a rarer commodity than it would seem these days, given certain recent, utterly-chaotic sci fi efforts on the big screen also reviewed by me!) This is then what I personally have been looking and hoping for for some while: sci fi in a spectacular, at times stunning, setting, but with heart and brain alike in very much the right place.",9,4,6,11 January 2017
About Time," Nice rom-com with somewhat flawed sci-fi
","Assuming you're a fan, and assuming therefore that you for example regard 'Love, Actually' as overall the greatest romantic comedy ever made (I do), then you're going to go into this 6-year-old movie happy to find another piece of ultra-British work from Writer-Director Richard Curtis. And from the off, you're going to be happy to find - once again with Curtis - a diverse collection of great British music in there, and scenes of an incredibly photogenic and sympathetic London, as well as a simply-gorgeous Cornwall (how blessed might a country be to boast both within its borders, as separated by a journey of 4 or 5 hours?)Most likely, a typical viewer will also find the core-pairing here, of Canadian Rachel McAdams and Irishman Domhnall Gleeson as Mary and Tim, pretty irresistible; and be more than content to find a supporting cast including both Bill Nighy (as Tim's dad) and Tom Hollander, with a very creditable Lydia Wilson as Tim's sister, and with small parts for Margot Robbie, Tom Hughes and even Richard Griffiths and Richard E. Grant.More dubious is the 'complication' of the basic love story with an ability of Tim's (shared with his dad) to time travel. And here we see done less well and less convincingly what was done very well indeed (if darkly and scarily) in 'The Butterfly Effect'; or else to massive comedic and feelgood efect in 'Back to the Future'. Tim's dad tells him there are certain 'rules' that come with this ability, yet every analyst online I've seen believes these rules are flouted in various ways, and that was absolutely also my conclusion.Whether a film can survive that would seem a good question, but of course this movie does...It's not without it's gravitas, as Tim does indeed resemble the Ashton Kutcher part in 'Butterfly' in having to make some difficult choices as he strives to use his gift to make things better or put them right in semi-godlike fashion. However, while all may be fair in love and war, Tim's desire to successfully improve his 'first time' with Mary is not a matter of life and death and IS (as some reviewers have wisely noted) a kind of sexual exploitation of a beloved partner, in which - admittedly - she benefits by getting a better version of the coitus each time, but is only aware of one (the final) time - while he basically has a repeat randy sex and lust fest with the girl he does genuinely love, but also clearly lusts after. It's dubious to say the least.Indeed, this huge and potentially very serious part of Tim's life is kept entirely secret from Mary throughout the tale - an unustainable situation, especially in a marriage and life that purports to be as close as theirs is. Ironically, Tim's sister does learn his secret, which makes what is - in a sense - 'perpetrated against' Mary look even worse.(Fairly) obviously, 'About Time' still has enough going for it to satisfy most viewers and to leave a mostly warm feeling. However, any deeper analysis will leave the piece looking a bit threadbare. A pity in that sense, so it's more a 7.5 than an 8, but OK.",8,1,1,28 July 2019
Youth," Great visual and auditory experience with interesting and novel fusion of Continental and Anglosphere film-making
","As I indicate in the summary title, this is on the one hand a profoundly 'Continental'-style film, even up to the Swiss mountain setting; and so it is full of intriguing and at times gorgeous visual impression, enigmatic happenings that pass over into the surreal from time to time, and such an overwhelming desire to be 'meaningful' that it may readily be accused of straying into over-analysis. Great Polish Director Krzysztof Kieslowski - who also came close to the above threshold, but somehow still stayed successfully below it - once noted that film was not an especially useful medium for telling stories, illustrating this by asking how many minutes (hours?) of film you would need to convey one line from a book: 'he gradually came to see her less and less often, and eventually stopped seeing her altogether'. In similar vein, a sparser way of dealing with issues raised in the film 'Youth' could theoretically be reduced to a single, 8-verse Louis Daniel Brodsky poem, or even simply to its ever-memorable title 'If Youth Knew and Age Could' (admittedly said originally by a 16th-century Frenchman, and also later by Sigmund Freud). However, ... and this a big 'However', the cast and acting of this film give it a British feel, or at least a trans-Atlantic one given the partnership of the film's key senior citizens, Brit Sir Michael Caine and Yank Harvey Keitel. While the latter actor has always been a firm favourite of this reviewer, the former has seemed a bit of an acquired taste. But with this film the acquisition process is complete. For me this would be Sir Michael's greatest ever performance, even if it is - in essence - just more of Michael Caine, albeit now Michael Caine as senior statesman of the film world, here beautifully devoid of any hint of that old, class-related 'chip on the shoulder'. Here he finds a niche, and his straightforward understatement conveys ideally the version of growing old that says 'I've kinda had enough really, given what life has thrown at me, but I'm accepting because there's absolutely nothing I can - or even want to - do about it'. This contrasts ideally with the more driven and up-beat Keitel as Caine's best friend and regular holiday companion. Indeed, the pair are 'almost related' given that the daughter of Caine's character (an effective Rachel Weisz) has married the son of Keitel's, giving the film one of its several intriguing-enough plot devices. Both of these key male characters are artists - Caine a famous and sophisticated conductor and musician, and Keitel a prolific and sassy film-maker. Both are in essence past it, though the Caine character has no doubt about that, while the Keitel character has difficulties with the concept. As the film progresses, the two deal with these circumstances in quite contrasting ways (I'll write no more on that). On the way, there are numerous interesting and touching (and occasionally hotly erotic, farcical or shocking) juxtapositions of youth being able to but not yet knowing, and old age knowing but (largely if not wholly) not being able to - in the sublimely beautiful, yet above all staid and ordered and 'safe', setting of a posh if oldie-worldie Swiss hotel for the very well-heeled. Overall, this film verges on the pretentious, and certainly would pass the boundary were it not for the Brits and Americans to drag it back down to Earth. But this makes for a rather new approach that in my view works quite nicely. The two key actors move us without even trying too hard, simply because they are now old men, let's face it. But the pairing is an extremely effective and convincing and joyous one. However, those choosing to see this film might wish to have at least hinted to them that a very great deal of the success here depends on its very last, closing scene - a profound and extremely powerful contrast with the rest of the film, if also a natural consequence of it, and one that will prove truly breathtaking for at least some of those who watch it - a real treat in store for the patient...",8,3,10,26 September 2015
The Book Thief," Immaculate film-making
","Well worthy of being watched in a pair with 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' (which is perhaps even a greater and deeper, if more harrowing film), 'The Book Thief' tells us more about that hitherto rather rare being, the on-screen 'good German'. Here several appear, only to be dispatched into the embrace of Death (in fact a key character in the film, played by Roger Allam, who also narrates) - most likely by a British bomb. Like 'The Boy...', this film also reminds us that, while kids did indeed have to grow up fast in Hitler's Germany, that did not mean that there was no such thing as a childhood at all. The heroine in the film - an extremely sweet and persuasive Sophie Nelisse as Liesel - would like finally to have a childhood, having seen her brother die at the time when she was being given away - for her own safety - by her communist mother. And coming to a smallish Bavaria-like town, she now has the chance to do this, in the care of doting foster father Hans and ostensibly-severe foster mother Rosa, conveyed splendidly as characters (almost by underacting) by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. As is noted in the film itself, these main three characters are at the outset of their time together ordinary in the extreme, itself an extraordinary thing in Nazi Germany! Later the tension goes up a notch or two as they devote many months to the concealment of a young Jewish man (a fine role for Ben Schnetzer), as 'Papa' makes good his promise to help out the family of the fellow soldier who saved his life during World War I (shades here of yet another fine film, by the way, this time one originating as a play, rather than a book, i.e. 'Good' of 2008, starring Viggo Mortensen). In 'The Book Thief', a number of profound and often moving insights are to be gained through a repeated focus on the relevance and importance of words and books, hence the title. This is all the more relevant given that a key way in which Liesel's young life is (sort of) put back on track is through her painstaking learning to read in the company of stepfather Hans. Like several successful films, this one has a story set slightly on the margins of huge events, being in this way left free to make its points without too much of the clutter that inevitably impacts upon more 'epic' productions. Doubtless the book on which the film was based was good too, but that is not for me to say, given that I have not read it. The film tells a super story, is well-acted, full of truth and enlightenment, and is extremely nicely made. If one really wanted to say something about English with strong German accents interspersed with an occasional 'ja', 'nein' or 'und' one could do so, but for me that would be pointless pedantry. To not get at least some worthwhile and enlightening experience out of this touching and meaningful film is tantamount to having a heart of stone...",9,0,0,5 December 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," As good as you might expect, but...
","A small town (especially a small town in America) is a specific place, and British-Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh takes full advantage of this in his renowned and much-awarded 'Three Billboards...' However, Ebbing, Missouri does not exist, and McDonagh actually went a long way from Missouri to film in Sylva, North Carolina, where the population is apparently about 2600. That begins to tell you something about this movie, but back - for now - to the concept of everybody knowing everybody else, being at school with them, raised with them, knowing their strengths and weaknesses, family background and everything else. And McDonagh's awareness of this and his ability to build it into his film is where the brilliance shones through. 'Three Billboards' repeatedly gains a description as part 'dark comedy' that was hard for this reviewer to discern at all, but is moreover a disappointing oversimplification. For the joy here is not an amazing Francis McDormand as Mildred Hayes being perpetually (and non-comedically) rude and violent and unpleasant and at times near-psychopathic to the cops in her town (perhaps somewhat justifiably, but anyway); but rather the way that she at times shows sympathy for them, and even in fact teams up with them. This is not especially funny either, but is just how it would be. Pure hate can't work/be sustained in a town of 2600, where people have put up with each others' good and bad for years. So if something new-bad-shocking happens something has to give so that a new balance can talk hold in the community, and it is McDonagh's genius to be able to portray that, as well as McDormand's huge skill to ensure the tough-as-old-boots facade slip just occasionally. Of course both director and lead star are helped out greatly with this by SUPERB work by Woody Harrelson as the Police Chief, and Sam Rockwell and Zeljko Ivanek as other cops. Peter Dinklage is also interesting in his role, who is a pretty blameless character surrounded by people who are certainly to be blamed for what they have done.And that brings me to the downsides here - and the more you think about them, the more they get to you. It is no secret/not much of a spoiler to mention that Mildred is a heroine because she has been terribly wronged and permanently wounded by the loss of her daughter in awful circumstances, and the failure of the Police to do much about it; but her behaviour at worst is unheroic in the extreme (also occasionally unrealistic); while the person she holds most responsible - Harrelson's Willoughby - emerges repeatedly as heroic. This is a classy twist, and within the bounds of acceptability. In contrast, a willingness to forgive the Sam Rockwell character for some greater good IS indeed potentially realistic in a small-town context, but it's also PLAIN WRONG. We are looking in on the world of Ebbing from the outside, and we know that there is bad stuff going on there, and we can only be uncomfortable with any accommodation of that.Which brings me to the most telling point. I believe I am not the only person in the world to have come to this film considering it was basically a true story. But it isn't. The best we can say is that it resembles the story of James Fulton - the FATHER of murder victim Kathy Page, and the funder of billboards and signs condemning police in Vidor, Texas. Now Kathy suffered a very unpleasant death, but it seems the yet-more-far-reaching perversion and unpleasantness surrounding the death of our movie's victim Angela Hayes is basically out of the heads of the makers. It is therefore their (ir)responsibility to depict a crime that is presumably not inconceivable, but beyond the capacity of my mind to conceive of. Presumably pretty much every other audience member for 'Three Billboards' is in the same boat.For me that takes the edge off this film, brilliant though it indeed is - hence the 8, rather than the 10.",8,0,1,21 July 2018
The Revenant," What for?
","Yet another (3-) Academy Award-winning effort not really seeming to deserve all the praise, and certainly not worth all the fuss.There are repeated examples of arrogance and disdain for the audience on display here from the inexplicably-Oscar-winning Director Alejandro Inarritu, as well as co-writer Mark L. Smith, and that begins with the decision to adopt straight the title Michael Punke chose for his 2002 novel. No, a 'revenant' is not somebody seeking revenge, but is a kind of an unkillable zombie figure, returned but no longer really alive, which presumably fits rather well with the behaviour of our (real-life-historical-figure) hero Hugh Class (1783-1833), as played by an Oscar-winning Leonardo DiCaprio.If there is a message to this film it is that life in the 1820s wilderness of North America was incredibly rough and tough...There, I've said it, and it took me one sentence. In the film, the makers devote the best part of two and a half hours to hammering this well-known message home to us, in the process allowing Leo to rasp, groan, moan, gasp, whine and creak at least a thousand times. Other cast members have it far from easy also, but most matter little here compared with the star.Intriguingly, though, when Glass first enters a river in spate formed by melting snow and ice he for once does not gasp at all...I write 'wilderness of North America', because it is several hours before we finally hear that our story takes place somewhere near the Yellowstone River, and that narrows things down to North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. It finishes at Fort Kiowa which is in turn in South Dakota.I only know it is the 1820s because I read it online, while the makers do not bother to tell us this, nor do they bother with much scene-setting, for example to explain why somebody not obviously in uniform is referred to as 'Captain' and appears to be in a position to give military-style orders. There are French-speakers and Brits out there, but we're not sure how or why. All are fur-trappers, and in fact Wikipedia tells us readily enough that Glass was part of General Ashley's Rocky Mountain Fur Company expedition of 1823, which was indeed attacked by Arikara/Ree people native to North Dakota by that time close to extinction. The sad truth is that this genuine story seems far more interesting than the film, which does indeed push Glass's real-life survival so far that it regularly looks implausible, even though it did actually happen.Art refusing to imitate life, as it were...The makers' determination to press home the 'incredibly tough' conditions referred to above is so strong that they refuse to let the sun shine for about 95% of the film, with all being white or dull grey, or in the twilight/dark or in blizzards. This is not possible in real life (and all the more so when snow at times seems to be melting), but since there are various dark and deceitful deeds afoot from the human cast (to say nothing of dangerous animals), we must watch a dowdy film that is heavy on the eye, despite being set in places that - for all their dangers and discomforts - are rightly known for their incredible beauty. Emmanuel Lubezki got a cinematography Oscar for his work here, and there ARE some fine shots of rivers flowing as and where they want to, but I can get those on a nature film (in which, as a bonus, the sun is allowed to shine from time to time).On the (futher) minus side, 'The Revenant' features a number of moments of - rather incomprehensible and not properly pursued - Native American spiritual elements. Then there are bison herds on the move with wolves waiting to pick off the weak and various more-or-less intriguing mountain-men 'survival tips'; but a great many of these (indeed far more) could be enjoyed (in the truest sense of that word) in, for example, 'Dances with Wolves' a film with very serious themes (from 1863) and plenty of awfully negative behaviour on display, but one which did not fear depicting beauty ... and sunshine, and did have its story to tell. The same could really be said of 'True Grit' - one heck of a story probably set in the 1840s, and even 'The Searchers' (again hugely strong on plot and acting) - which depicted events from 1868.Perhaps (Presumably?) those behind 'The Revenant' would regard the above films as examples of hopelessly old-fashioned and clichéd beginning-middle-end storytelling, unlike their own piece, which pretty much jumps into existence out of the void with its large-scale Indian attack, and then proceeds with a 'survival and revenge' plot against a background that has scarcely been set up at all, and with characters that we must perforce 'catch up with' having never been introduced...While I would certainly not dismiss my time spent with 'The Revenant' as wasted, and cannot therefore suggest to anyone that they not give it a try, I do go away from it with a sense of being far, far less enlightened or elevated (let alone entertained) than I ought to have been, especially in the case of a film that the Academy clearly adored!",6,0,0,13 March 2017
Bridge of Spies," Exquisitely acted and authentic-looking Cold War drama
","If the basis of a good film is a good story, then it shouldn't be too difficult to make a success out of the real-life (1962) exchange of (British-born) Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for American spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers and American student Frederic Pryor, all the more so given the background of the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the events leading to Abel's capture in a 'Reds Under the Bed'-obsessed 1957 America.But 'Bridge of Spies' does not make it very clear that its real-life events cover a 5-year period, and maybe that is as it should be. This is a film, when all is said and done, and it is as a film that it should or must be judged. Who knows if Rudolf Abel was as likable as Mark Rylance makes him out to be? Intuitively that would seem pretty unlikely. And indeed perhaps even Tom Hanks's lawyer for Abel's defence - James B. Donovan - was not quite the ideally noble character we see.It matters not in the work of art that is this film.The ever-so-slightly Nixon-like Hanks looks like he's been extracted physically from 1957, and indeed immaculate authenticity of US setting is a hallmark of the film. And - having been born in Poland in 1959 - Janusz Kaminski on camera needs no lessons in how to make the Eastern European scenes look as they should. Thomas Newman's score adds greatly to the effect, and there are enough 2015 nuances in plot-lines and script to hint to us (I think rightly) that the division of the then world into US angels and Soviet devils was almost but not quite that.Indeed, a joy of the film (if not for the first time in cinema history) is the way it depicts (again one assumes realistically) the way in which East and West did have to find some ways at least of 'getting on', even if only for pragmatic reasons, and - let's face it - to ensure that the bombs were not actually dropped, in spite of all the rhetoric. They were not, so somehow it worked...While supporting cast members like Alan Alda, Scott Shepherd, Sebastian Koch, Peter McRobbie (in an excellent cameo as Allen Dulles) and especially Mikhail Gorevoy (as the KGB man) all do great things in parts that paint in that authentic background, this is ultimately the film of the Rylance-Hanks pairing, and this is inspiring and interesting, and offers the chance for a surprising amount of wit and wisdom, and indeed warmth.Indeed, this film has a particular cosy feel about it, which scarcely seems warranted - given the circumstances - but is quite tangible and imparts huge watchability to the movie. Not for a moment do things drag.Ultimately, that enigmatic 'cosiness' presumably boils down to the fact that the Donovan we follow is left much to his own devices as he moves from East to West and back again, is regularly in danger (indeed even in his own home in America), is playing a potentially risky game of high stakes with very big fish indeed, but manages to do so successfully by simply doing his (lawyer's) job as best he can in a circumstance in which his 'best' is pretty darned good. He somehow keeps himself out of danger, and although he is sharp and even at times wily, he is most of all just dogged; and he keeps (or chooses to keep) things clean, simple and straight when all those around him seek to make them dirty, devious and complicated. Given that the key concept in the whole film (put into words by Abel) is that here is a man who always stands up again no matter how many times, and no matter how hard, he is knocked down, that cohesively whole image is indeed conveyed by the film, and it comes over as remarkably refreshing, and surprisingly convincing.Those interested in the truth behind the story are encouraged to read about it at length, but that should definitely be done after the film has been seen and judged (and enjoyed) on its own merits, which are as a very impressive and enjoyable piece of art.",9,1,2,17 October 2016
Disturbia," Nice mix of lighter and darker aspects makes this competent enough
","DJ Caruso has made one or two big films, but here he is back in 2007 making an early contact with a still-youthful but certainly competent Shia LaBeouf playing a kid disturbed into violence and anti-social tendences and general wasting by the death of his father in a car accident. A measure of sympathy from the Judge over the misdemeanours perpetrated by Kale (yes he is named after cabbage, for some reason) leads to a situation in which he is tagged and left under house arrest.It's fun to see how he tries to adjust to this, but the more-fastidious viewer is going to suffer greatly from the mess and chaos into which his premises descend rapidly. It all looks rather like lightish teen fare at this point, and all the more so as a family with a daughter more or less Kale's age moves in next door. She's Ashley (played by an extremely lovely Sarah Roemer), and there's many a guilty film-watcher out here who might sympathise just a little with the anyway-awkward-and-now-housebound, bored-out-of-his-skull Kale, for finding it impossible to leave the binoculars alone under such circumstances!As we know, voyeurs always see something they don't want to in the end, and this movie is no exception. But it's one heck of a vicariously-enjoyed, wish-fulfilling twist in the meantime when Ashley does not write Kale off as a perverted loser when she finally meets him, but rather flirts just a little, and even joins in with the spying on the neighbours engaged in by Kale and his friend Ronnie (well done by Aaron Yoo). Implausible as it may be, this plot twist is GLORIOUS, and the chemistry and then love that blooms between the unlikely pair will be a delight for many a viewer in a kind of sighing 'if only' sort of way.The fact that one of the neighbours is doing something really nasty comes as no real surprise here, and the tension ratchets up in more or less predictable fashion; but it lurches into quite-satisfying if grisly surrealism when we finally get to see (albeit only impressionistically) the house conversions that Mr Turner (played by David Morse) has carried out to better allow for his sick psychopathic interests. At that point, an ordinary house seems to have corridors and basements that go on for miles, including an unexplained pool of water existing below it all!Mostly, this film under Caruso knows how to mix its laughs, thrills, lighter and darker sides, so it's no surprise that some comparisons with Hitchcock have been made. Nothing too terrible gets seen, yet the atmosphere is certainly disturbing, as the title suggests. Of course, in the end 'Disturbia' is nothing too special, but certainly not a waste of time either, and it's quite clear why it made itself a reasonable profit on a relatively modest outlay as on the whole it's well enough done.",8,0,1,8 June 2019
Dunkirk," Strives successfully for grimly realistic portrayal of war, but still leaves 'the Dunkirk Spirit' strengthened
","We watched Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk' as maybe the only Brits in a cinema in a country for which consequences and memories of 'the War' are different. For them this was another WW2 depiction, for us an examination, not just of the reality of war, but also of a British legend, and Britishness itself. There were fewer tears in surrounding eyes than in mine.For 'Dunkirk' is indeed a moving experience, but also - rightly - a powerful, shocking one - so much so that I felt moist eyes might give way to a full-scale blub even 10 minutes on from the credits. Few films achieve such a two-level emotional impact.'Dunkirk' is epic in spite of itself, but this is no 'The Longest Day'. But then the latter was portraying an advance towards victory, while Dunkirk was - as Churchill noted - a severe defeat - and equipment-less retreat - that made any subsequent victory look far less plausible. In the film, we are reminded of the toughly correct decision to hold back some ships and planes ... in anticipation of the next blow.Yet - again unavoidably - Nolan's presentation captures the spontaneous (and hyper-British) emergence of feelings of pride and joy and relief at being reunited, in some sense 'safe' with 'our boys' on our beautiful and (comparatively) tranquil island once again. The end segments of the film are done perfectly - all is understated, entirely unjingoistic, deeply affecting as a visceral solidarity suffuses us, even as the returnees themselves feel unsure of themselves.The main body of 'Dunkirk' resembles that ending in being 'of few words', as Nolan intended, but also differs. Patriotism is pared down, nuanced, mostly down to vaguely 'running commentary'-like remarks from Sir Mark Rylance in his role as a captain of one of those little ships, 'Mr Dawson' - as based on a figure whose taped voice lives on at the Imperial War Museum. While a 1930s boat is filmed, it WAS NOT a Dunkirk participant, though other shown vessels WERE. Dawson's voyage crystallises the 'sea' component of a 'land, sea and air' configuration that Nolan deploys, to hint at what the British Army was doing on land, the RAF in the air, and the Royal Navy plus other craft (800 in all, with up to 60 apparently portrayed in the film) on those 25-odd miles of sea separating a Bosch-like vision of hell from 'home'. We are warned at the outset that these stories run to different time-frames, but enigmatic information given so soon will probably go unabsorbed by most. In fact, the RAF chunk actually (faithfully) reflects a 1-hour mission, while Dawson is taking a day to cross the Channel, and the lads are at Dunkirk for a week...This 'separation by elements' at least might seem clear-cut, but is not, as the different media and forces keep interacting, with this just adding to the sense of fluidity ... and chaos. Nowhere is really safe; water might seem better than an exposed beach, but is cold, can even burn and can fill a cosy dry place in seconds; bullets enter boats stuck on land; ships and soldiers fire at planes; planes strafe ships and soldiers; planes come down on sea or land; soldiers walk into water, come back out and then wade in again... Given the nearly-340,000 rescued in real life, as set against the few thousands that died, Nolan's film might seems a bit death-obsessed; but what we see - perhaps more than in any other war film - is how random choices, attempts to 'beat the system', just being in the wrong place, can mean death, while others live on in chance fashion. As the above sentence hints, plenty of less-than-noble behaviour is shown. There's some Army-Navy solidarity, but we also watch ratings abandon ship while soldiers are stuck below. There is also Army-Airforce resentment ('Where were you?', asks a young soldier - well the RAF had indeed been there (flying 2739 fighter sorties over 9 days), and the film makes their risks and sacrifices clear - with real planes used in the film-making; and history tells that 106 of those precious assets were lost (to 262 enemy aircraft)). There is even tension between soldiers of different units, as well as an incident in which a panicked soldier (accidentally) kills a civilian, etc.A counterbalance here is Sir Kenneth Branagh's mostly cool and gritty 'Commander Bolton' character, alluding to real-life hero James Clouston - a Canadian-born RN Officer and 'Pier-Master', who indeed spent days on 'the Mole'. Hopefully, the Branagh portrayal also pays homage to Clouston's boss, Capt. Tennant, who patrolled the beach with his megaphone for days (and perhaps even to the great Admiral Ramsay, in overall charge of the Naval operation then, as also at D Day). Notwithstanding 'the Little Ships', Dunkirk was a Royal Navy show, God bless it...Indeed, one is overall swept up by a growing wonder at Operation Dynamo, in spite of the many smaller-scale ugly incidents depicted. The desperation, lack of thought, inability to see the big picture and sheer fear that overcome young and often inexperienced military personnel at the given moment are made clear, and we in our comfortable cinema seats must be ready to forgive. Cleverly, the Rylance character (for noble enough reasons) also consciously overlooks misconduct he's seen, in order to start building the Dunkirk legend. And, even if we do know how selfishly and crudely certain individuals behaved at given moments, doesn't that merely offer enrichment in terms of truth and reality? Hence Nolan's great achievement with 'Dunkirk' would seem to be to offer realism of setting and equipment and behaviour in his vignettes, to shock and move us more than ever before with the manmade debacle that was Dunkirk; and yet to leave us more convinced than ever as to the manmade miracle.",9,6,11,29 July 2017
Now You See Me," Fast, fresh and fun
","As a person with a lifelong distaste for the pointlessness and immorality of films lauding the actions of criminals and con-artists, I had a very bad sinking feeling for the first couple of minutes of this film. But somehow I stuck with it, and in fact had a great (unexpectedly great) deal of fun with 'Now You See Me'. I have never been to an illusionists' show and am never likely to. But if you're going to do it, do it big, and we the film audience get an impressively tangible sense of the awesome scale and complexity of the illusions being performed here by 'The Four Horsemen' (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher and Franco). Given that they are at once the controllers and the controlled, these key characters come over surprisingly sympathetically and are pleasant to watch - especially in the early and middle stages of the film. The debunker is played by Morgan Freeman (great as ever), but the sparks of screen presence fair fly in the short scenes he gets to play with Michael Caine. The Mark Ruffalo character and the FBI side of the film are obviously necessary to it, but seem to add relatively little to the enjoyment, while the addition of the Interpol agent in the admittedly delightful form of Melanie Laurent (who also acts well enough) is nevertheless puzzling at many moments. To be honest, I was not a huge fan of the ending either, but that was a few minutes in a couple of slick and spellbinding hours that do what a film ought to do (even in a genre such as this which is definitely an acquired taste for this reviewer).",9,0,1,18 January 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Charms and moves ... but often in ways unintended
","British Harry Potter-directing veteran David Yates now teams up with J.K. Rowling with the ostensible key aim of taking Harry Potter fans back in time (to the 1920s) and across the ocean to New York. This would seem like major wish-fulfilment for aficionados interested in how the wizard world integrated (or failed to integrate) with that of the muggles (then and there referred to as No-Majs - abbreviated 'no magics') in another place in a former time. This leaves us largely free of cross-references to Britain's wizarding world already well known to us, except for single mentions of Hogwarts and Dumbledore, a brief appearance of 'our' Minister of Magic in America, a brief if important reference to a member of the LeStrange family, and development of information on magical species that did appear or were mentioned in the Potter novels and films. Obviously add to that the key importance attached to wizards Grindelwald and star-of-this-story Newt Scamander, as here played somewhat idiosyncratically (if of course ultra-Britishly) by Eddie Redmayne. In Redmayne's hands, Scamander is a slightly uneasy mix of absent-minded and capable, clever and inexperienced, attractive and oafish. The perfomance is OK, but looks a bit uneven. Certainly, his character needs to be reined in by someone, as indeed it is - very beneficially, by 3 characters - as the film develops (see below). The huge question here, then - and actually a very significant one from the point of view of enjoying the movie - is how one approaches 'Fantastic Beasts'. Just what kind of mindset should the viewer adopt as he or she gets comfortable in the armchair?For me, this does not fully work as 'another Potter-like wizard movie', and I'll say that straight out, for any benefit to others that statement may have.Given that the main storyline here (magicked up from no real basis in Rowling's book) does NOT actually hinge upon Scamander's attempts to recapture animals of varying degrees of wackiness or cuteness that have escaped from his suitcase, I did - I must admit - let much of this (relatively time-consuming and centre-stage) aspect of the film wash over me. Surprising, given that the Rowling book was about that, but naturally you can't make a film out of an encylopaedic bestiary...! At some level the film work with the magical creatures is of course beautifully done, but it integrates with the NY surroundings better in some cases (as when an Erumpent goes to the Central Park Zoo looking for potential mates among rhinos and hippos), worse in others (as a 'Niffler' grabs jewels and coins from stores and banks). Presumably, it is a kind of kiddy-fare, though it must be said that Fantastic Beasts is NOT especially a child's film other than in this aspect. One thing I did like about these chunks of the film was the Redmayne-Scamander conservation message, which is not overdone, but done... As ever in the Potter universe, an intriguing aspect is the co-existence of the magical and normal worlds, and the Big Apple take on this is quite spectacular. However, it must be said that the recreation of 1920s NY is magic in and of itself - something to be absolutely lapped up and appreciated by anyone willing to distance themselves a little from the 'Potter' content of the movie. Likewise, an effortless and yet tour-de-force performance as an ordinary (if perhaps atypically kind, decent, patient and well-meaning) New Yorker is put in by Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski. In portraying this Polish-origin would-be baker of Polish-style paczki donuts. Fogler does not put a foot wrong in a performance as someone who accepts and then comes to relish the magic he is suddenly exposed to in his hitherto tough and humdrum life. It's a pleasure to watch him, and only magnified when he rather quickly becomes a subject of love interest for the overwhelmingly kind, mind-reading witch Queenie Goldstein, as played with absolutely aplomb by Alison Sudol, who looks a pretty picture in her 1920s outfits. Queenie is way out of Jacob's league in terms of looks, but she grows to love him anyway, and this sweet pairing is a highlight of the film. Since Queenie's older and more serious sister Tina (played nicely if with restraint by British actress Katherine Waterston) rather rapidly forms a pair - of sorts - with Redmayne's Scamander, we have the 2 pairings that are the strength of the film, one might even say irrespective of various other more or less-relevant scenes and plots that come along. At some level, this is then a two-charming-couples-in-New-York-in-the-Twenties movie, which provided this viewer with considerable satisfaction in and of itself, and - while that was most likely not the makers' intention - it works, so why knock it?Jon Voight is in there but doesn't do much, in a section of plotting that scarcely gels with the rest of the film. Colin Farrell does play a key role and does pretty well, as does Ezra Miller as a disturbed young wizard suppressing his wizard-uality (yes, it's that kind of reference) and causing death and destruction as a result. The closing scenes of the wizards' repair and restoration by magic of all that destruction brings the old city and lives of its inhabitants back to centre stage, and it was for me a profoundly and surprisingly moving experience to see things put to rights, in the company of stirring and touching music from the ever-reliable James Newton Howard.Overall, I enjoyed 'Fantastic Beasts...', but seemingly for various eclectic reasons that won't necessarily appeal to those seeking to take this 'next JK Rowling adapation' straight, at completely face value.",8,1,1,10 March 2018
Jackie," A shocked and appalled widow in a shocked and appalled nation
","First to say what the rather play-like 'Jackie' from Chilean Director Pablo Larrain IS NOT. It is not the full story of its heroine, whose life extended from 1929 to 1994 and DID continue in some fashion after JFK's death. It is not the story of her husband either - while his death almost entirely dominates the piece, he appears in acted form for just a matter of seconds. This film is not even a retelling of the assassination or the circumstances behind it, though these are, it is true, hinted at.What we do have here - for a start - is a bit of an explanation of one of the rawest, most shocking and heart-rending real-life sequences ever filmed - you remember that bit where the First Lady, having at first somehow cuddled her husband, then suddenly starts standing up in the open limo and scrabbling about for something on the trunk part of the car (what we in Britain would call the boot)? For a lengthy first part of the film, Jackie (as played by Natalie Portman) is still covered with her husband's blood, and we see her numbness, anger and embitterment played out step by step in the hours after the assassination, but also in a colder, more contemplative, more calculating, but still angry version, as she is interviewed some time after by a journalist (here played by Billy Crudup). The Crudup-Portman cat-and-mouse interaction in the course of this interview (in part based on a real one) is quite electric, and contrasts with the step-by-step scenes from history in which our star feels abruptly and awkwardly eclipsed by Lyndon and Ladybird Johnson, and tos and fros with the ideas regarding just how stately - or safely dull - the funeral should be. Just how many different emotions must the First Lady have felt at that time? A plethora - and this is made divertingly clear here. We in fact also see a third version of our lead character, as she appears in a sweeter, more naive version showing TV viewers around the White House when everything was still looking normal and OK.It is true that Portman produces some kind of near-mimicked version of Jackie, which I know has proved annoying to many, but for me was entirely OK. Indeed a strong performance. A few other actors have interesting/telling parts to play here, and notably Peter Sarsgaard as Bobby Kennedy and John Hurt as the family priest.So why else to watch this film? Well, those who want to get a full-life view of Jackie Kennedy Onassis will get nowhere with this work, so this is not the motivation. But for me there is a powerful and genuine reason. As the film makes plain (and all the more so as it lacks the warts-and-all portrayal of JFK that we now know), the assassination, its circumstances and all that came after were a violation of the mandate given to Kennedy by the American people, who never got to see how his full term (conceivably also a second term) would be. They were denied this by a crude, brutal act that created a perhaps-unwarranted legend (Kennedy was elected by 49.7% of the vote on a 62.8% turnout - so nothing special at all). But of course it was utterly wrong, a violation, a breach of the most precious contract between leader and people. And the shock and fear and disgust America rightly felt is what this film has to convey, also through Jackie herself, and that is something worthwhile, something that should forever be recalled.A new generation should watch to learn of those awful days, those with longer memories should watch to be reminded just how dreadful historical events prone to fading with time actually were.",9,0,0,21 November 2017
Yesterday," Good idea, but tangibly under-implemented
","The last time Richard Curtis played with sci fi, the result was 'About Time' (2013) - a reasonably good and cohesive film, if one that played fast and loose with the old-fashioned 'rules' of time travel - despite key characters (played by Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson) maintaining within the world of the film itself that such rules did exist...Fast forward 6 years, and we have Curtis, Tim Bevan and the Working Title gang, plus Danny Boyle and Jack Barth - and in all of that sea of talent we out here all know for sure that - as a timeline episode of 'Dr Who' or 'Star Trek', say, this same story would most likely have looked more polished and sharper, and even meant more, precisely because the sci-fi lovers there would have known how to extract most from a 'reorganised time stream' story.For yes - as a great many people know - 'Yesterday' asks us to envisage a world in which some cosmic event that briefly puts the lights out globally re-rigs our history in such a way that the group 'The Beatles' somehow never got together, and nobody is any the wiser about that sad fact - except our hero Jack (Himesh Patel) and two other people, one of whom is a Russian and the other a Liverpool lass played to very good if brief effect by the ever-reliable Sarah Lancashire.As the film develops, we in the audience learn along with Jack (in a pretty humorous way) that 4 other key phenomena we know about from our world never made it into existence in the alternate reality that is now being lived by the film characters (but no spoilers offered here on that).Now sci-fi purists who watch will notice that only one of these 4 has any closer (also quite witty) link with the non-emergence of The Beatles, while the other 3 would - under the strict rules of traditional sc fi - have required re-rigging at several other points in history, some even quite far back. This 'eclectic mix' hardly holds up for a purist, but then 'Yesterday' is not a sci-fi film, even if it might have done better had it been so.The key storyline it does have still has a great deal going for it, and the true (momentary) magic of this film - that we can share vicariously - comes with our empathising with people who first hear those glorious fusions of melodies and lyrics the 'Fab Four' came up with, often adding that extreme dose of down-to-Earth melancholy. In our own lives, we doubtless happened upon these hits step by step, from an early age, so the power is diminished thanks to the gradual nature of our acquaintanceship. But just imagine if we were all fully-fledged adults and then were exposed to 'Eleanor Rigby' and 'The Winding Road' and 'Let it Be' all at once for absolutely the first time. This the film invites us to imagine, and for brief moments at least a true lump is brought to our throats by it.Beyond that, we could for example ponder on:
<ul><li>how a non-charismatic person would fare singing the great songs? (hinted at in the film)</li><li>how the songs would succeed/not succeed if first introduced 50 years later than they were 'supposed to'? (barely hinted at in the film)</li><li>how the songs might prove unsuitable for our delicate 21st-century sensibilities? (hinted at in the film)</li><li>how the songs might flop if they came into existence with no cultural context, and hence no particular meaning to the person presenting them? (hinted at - as Jack is an Asian from rural Suffolk, who has no link with Strawberry Fields and so on)</li><li>how suspicious the world might be of someone producing all of that without any great talent or creative struggle? (hinted at in the film)</li></ul>Ironically, these are the kind of ideas that come to my mind in the aftermath of seeing the film, but they are my thoughts provoked by the film, rather than notions present (or at least fully-developed) in the film itself - a sure sign that not enough creativity was really shown.And interesting (not by pure chance) that Ed Sheeran features - quite effectively. For we might really question whether a world that had never contained The Beatles would even be ready for Ed and his ballady style. That also seems quite a worthwhile question.To be honest, Himesh Patel in the role of an average performer playing down his role all the time at moments perhaps unfortunately begs the question whether the actor himself is really up to this part. And - since we know Lily James can do great things - her also less-large-than-life character seems to be making a trend out of the whole 'let's not get too excited here' vibe, and that's a pity.Ironically, 'Yesterday' often seems to play best as an 'odd goings on in rural Suffolk' kind of piece, in this way harking back to 'Whisky Galore', 'The Titfield Thunderbolt', 'Passport to Pimlico' and other gently whimsical British offerings of the Ealing Comedy kind. So the fact that this film's universe extends to LA and Moscow looks a little incrongruous, even as these locations are theoretically necessary for the plot development.The idea that the non-existence of 'The Beatles' would not necessarily denote the non-existence of individual band members was one that sci-fi fans could see from miles off, and happily it was one the makers ran with to good effect. Surprising, then, that it was ultimately a lookalike of the late Lennon that we got to meet, rather than the very much alive and kicking in real life Sir Paul or Sir Ringo. Neither actually made it into the film, and maybe that's just as well ... or maybe it's not.The fact that somebody had this great idea, and that it was given some measure of power in the movie is still something we can be grateful for. But many of us out here are aware how key points that needed making, or could have been made, in the context, were not - and that's a saddish waste of a great opportunity.",6,0,1,16 November 2019
Independence Day," 23 years old and looking splendid...
","Unlike his 2016 ID:Resurgence, which can pretty much be dismissed without a second thought, Roland Emmerich's original is a triumphalist triumph of epic film-making, with gung-ho David Arnold music to match. Although 150 minutes long, it is in many ways an economically-made yet attractively-filmed movie, passing smoothly and logically (but also at times with pleasant eccentricity) from scene to scene; and all the time looking plausible (at the military and government levels), while playing successfully with emotions of fear, shock, sadness, patriotism, stoicism, wit and indeed enigma.Not much is wasted here, very few scenes indeed fall down, and a great many have become iconic, not just for this movie, but in the whole history of cinema. One knows those images or vignettes are coming, yet they continue to give pleasure, and have not lost their edge. There are no dud characters here, and many are a joy to see in action, all the more so as unlikely combinations of characters come together.To look at 'Independence Day' as it should be looked at is to see an antidote - or better a mirror image - of 'Close Encounters'. While the latter is clearly the more cerebral movie, ID also does its bit of emulation by following logical if strange paths of the stories of individuals, many of whom resemble Richard Dreyfuss's Roy Neary in being able to penetrate the top-secret military and scientific stuff, opening the movie up, though of course exposing those featuring to fear and misery, as opposed to the mix of awe and wonder that Spielberg had to offer back in 1977. But the universe is a big place, and if aliens exist at all, perhaps they will indeed be the locust-like lifeforms Bill Pullman's President Whitmore tells us about.While Pullman is not a great actor, he does quite well enough in this role, while the Smith-Goldblum pairing is again iconic, robust and witty, as is the father-and-son provided by Goldblum and Judd Hirsch. James Rebhorn and Robert Loggia are perfect in their top-politician and top-military roles respectively, while Randy Quaid gets his character just right, as of course does Brent Spiner as the slightly whacko Doctor Okun. Adam Baldwin showed early promise in uniform as Major Mitchell, and Harvey Fierstein also offers his part with a nice mix of humour and poignancy. The female leads are perhaps weaker, though with Vivica Fox convincing most.Many at the time dismissed ID as an effects movie of little import, but ironically the chance to compare with ID:Resurgence all those years later makes it abundantly clear what a surfeit of CGI can do to render a film meaningless. In contrast, the original 'Independence Day' plays a military battle story straight and really seems to offer a tangible hint of what the dread event of alien invasion might look like; and it's authentically scary and awesome, and far from just throwaway death and destruction (unlike the tragically weak 2016 effort). To my mind, this kind of invasion is (thankfully) something that's never going to happen, but recall how mainstream physicists do actually see life as a relatively likely outcome out there in the universe (even as biologists, ecologists and geologists feel that planets with any life are going to be excruciatingly few and far between). Which means that a species gearing its whole way of life to moving from one to another exploiting resources look all the more plausible...",10,3,6,17 June 2019
The Butterfly Effect," Solid sci-fi premise, but certainly at times a hammer to crack a nut
","Films about 'putting right' the time stream are not exactly a rarity, so many may ask whether resort to a 2004 movie makes any sense.My answer would be yes, but there are a couple of powerful provisos. On the plus side, this film from Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber takes the genre as far as it can reasonably be taken, as we get to see a great many alternative scenarios for the life of our hero Evan (that's a pretty effective Ashton Kutcher in the adult version, but also two other pretty good child actors) plus his mother and the people around him. So if you want to follow through these kinds of thought experiments in detail (for reasons best known to yourself!), you'll probably never get a better and fuller chance than with this movie...And a few of those versions of the lives lived even have moments of humour or at least black comedy about them. But this is not the typical case, as most are pretty serious; and indeed this film has to go into deeply awful and dark stuff in order to present its key idea. For Evan has a motivation to rework his life because at at least 3 moments along the track things happened that were so bad that the effort and risk of the reworking are made to seem worthwhile. There is logic to that, but it makes for grim and uncomfortable watching indeed.Surprising then that we have room for quite a strong romantic story, in which the lovely Kayleigh (that's Amy Smart in the adult version at least) has fortunes going up and down like a yo-yo depending on which line Evan has managed to tweak.And if the main moral here (of solely academic relevance, naturally) is that each reworked timeline has its winners and losers and trying to make things better very often makes them worse, the subsidiary emotion is one familiar to most of us about the what-ifs of love and relationships, which primarily resolves itself into Byron's famously bleak quote: 'of all the words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these - it might have been'. Tennyson springs equally to mind, with the question 'Tis better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all'. As noted, these are suprisingly deep and compelling emotions for a film that also dwells upon child molestation, psychopathy, murder, cancer, father-son murder, betrayal and a great many other heavy topics.But all for the sake of suggesting to us that the dye is not cast on anybody's life, with things always having a range of alternative directions to follow, rather than just one (even if the same points may be reached along several parallel paths).So there we are - it seems very much like a hammer to crack a nut, given the vicarious (and quite genuinely tangble) horror and disgust we may experience here at times, even as we have the occasional smile, and certainly feel pangs of romantic longing.Is it just exploitation, in the end?I say no, as somehow for me this still makes for good storytelling and film-making, but surely a fine line has been trodden here...Any film that features an Oasis track must have its merits, and here we have the telling words of 'Stop crying your heart out' to mull on as the final credits roll. And when they do, I for one feel I've had a powerful and meaningful experience. Hence any slight doubts are erased by 98% at least (though not 100%).",9,0,1,17 May 2019
No Country for Old Men," Huge on atmosphere, shock and style ... but at times lightweight on the details
","The Coen Brothers' 2007 movie, based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, is first and foremost an atmospheric take on life in Texas - as a state bordering Mexico - in 1980 (for some not especially clear reason). In this sense, it is is a bit disappointing that much of the filming is done in New Mexico. Nevertheless, the scenes of wilderness here are amazing, and we are left in no doubt that this is indeed a wild place - beautiful in the natural sense, but hideous and primitive in the sense of what man here is prepared to do to fellow man (or woman).This is a hard, gory, merciless piece of work, and a show absolutely stolen by its hardest and most merciless character - a sadistic, psychopathic contract killer called Anton Chigurh played with verve by Javier Bardem. He's cold, calculating, clever, literal, polite, dutiful (as he sees it) and more than ready to play games to make his potential or actual victims sweat. He's also got at least two weapons of choice, and that's another of his hallmarks. Obviously, there's no joy in this Bardem performance, but there is a great deal of brilliance. Now the absolutely astronomical body count that Chigurh builds up is shocking, but also increasingly unrealistic-looking, and this is is a surprise in such a gritty movie. Likewise, when Llewelyn Moss - a bit of a cardboard-cutout character played by Josh Brolin - first comes across the deadly drug-gang shootout that has the potential to make him fabulously rich if he's got the guts for it - he has no water to offer a rapidly-succumbing but still surviving Mexican victim. He's an experienced hunter and tracker out on foot in tractless Texan desert with no water? Come off it ! He then wakes up in the night hours later - and sets off with a huge container of said water out of some feeling of guilt or misplaced sense of duty...COME OFF IT !!!! Similarly, the larger-than-life Carson Wells - another character superbly and attractively played by Woody Harrelson - though apparently another experienced and slick killer who mainly differs from Chigurh in having a sense of humour and being rather more merciful - ends up far out of his depth in a way that is surprising ... and thus refreshing in a movie, but also profoundly unlikely. And since the tough-as-old-boots Moss also loses his life when lapsing momentarily into an interest in beer and a woman who is prepared to supply it to him, the merciless and also casual disposal of characters who do or do not put up a fight is a major (interesting and telling) feature of this film, and that's heartless and shocking (and hence good film-making), but maybe not QUITE authentic...Coming to this a second time now, I was also surprised that the 'Tommy Lee Jones' movie of my memory actually features the actor playing (VERY well) a rather ineffectual role as Sherrif Ed Tom Bell. He's here to make it clear how everything in the crime prevention and detection world has gone to the dogs - presumably he is one of the Old Men for which this is now no country, and when he says he just does not understand criminal motives any more, we entirely understand him. Interestingly, one of his colleagues tries to persuade him that early 20th-century Texas was just as random and lawless, and we're frankly not convinced by that thesis, even if we recognise that there must have been a period - in the '50s say - when these frontier parts reached a peak of civilisation. But, bright and experienced (and unintentionally funny) though he is, Ed Tom regularly cuts himself out of possibilities for investigation, fails to save key characters, and ends up in docile retirement having either messed up or been passive.I do really like 'No Country for Old Men' as a stunning, chilling piece of moviemaking; but it is a kind of an impressionist vision of manmade hell amidst stunning natural beauty. And, like any work of Impressionist art, it's actually just a load of old disordered splodges if looked at from too close up...",8,0,0,28 August 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Bizarre, intelligent, good-looking, witty and poignant 'cartoon' that isn't...
","At some point in Wes Anderson's 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' - when you get past the shock or surprise of the strength in depth that is the stellar cast present here (often only briefly) - you'll realise that you are watching a movie whose look, brilliance, storyline and way of highlighting things most likely owes more to the cartoon than film-making.And of course the cartoon emerged out of history to allow people to say strong things about the world and what is wrong with it in a funnier, perhaps lighter way.This piece is no exception, but it's a flawed masterpiece - as so many are. In the first place, it takes the risk - a serious one - that many a viewer is REALLY going to say 'why should I care?' And this is a danger that arises as easily 70 minutes in as at the start. The film is so surreal and so much of a pastiche that again and again one is tempted not to care. What held me in for the duration was the AMAZING visual side and the obvious fact that somebody in there was actually trying VERY hard with all this.But - BE WARNED - you'll probably ONLY get your deepest feelings about this work a few minutes before the credits roll, and that's a mean way to treat an audience. Big SPOILER then, for the sake of encouragement - if you're like me, you'll suddenly realise (if the title doesn't make it clear) that you have been watching some kind of extended metaphor for the cruel things that happened to the Eastern Bloc from the 1930s through to the 1980s. And indeed those final credits roll - paradoxically - to an AMAZING Russian balalaika theme tune from a very gifted Alecandre Desplat.You might need this injection of depth from me, because at first glance the eccentric and overtly-'meaningless' story presented about employees in a hotel of fading glory (at moments facing challenges of war and oppression) will look sharp and funny-ish, but in the end also dullish. And at times just too incongruous to live with. Who knows if we are looking for any 'reality' in this movie? But if we are, then the delicacy and elegance and fastidiousness of Ralph Fiennes's starring character M. Gustave DO NOT correlate with his frequent resort to four-letter words. The 1930s were not like and a character such as his was not like that. And so this looks like an absolute own-goal from the makers, or indeed like a deliberate attempt to repeatedly shock us out of taking this thing seriously or treating it as anything other than an artificial arena.Don't know about others, but I (probably) don't actually come to a film to be slapped in the face repeatedly. This work seeks annoyingly often to bury sentiment under crude farce, even though it's ultimate goal is actually really and truly a sentimental one. Why do that? It looks awfully like deliberately hurting your own fans and followers...For all that, 'Hotel' may offer you an experience you've rarely had elsewhere (conceivably a bit in, say 'The Lady Vanishes' (1938)). Some may even concede that they've NEVER seen anything quite like it.And there must be SOME merit in that...!",8,0,0,22 April 2020
The Favourite," Heartless and facetious hijacking of British history...
","Those watching extra materials on the DVD of 'The Favourite' from Greek-born (British-resident) Director Yorgos Lanthimos will be supplied with a breathtakingly honest if impertinent/arrogant vision of how the Director and others involved sought deliberately to cock a snook at/play fast and loose with costume drama as a genre ... and in the process British history.This 'reimagining' (NOT 'like a BBC production' - as one of those featured facetiously put it) is EXACTLY what Lanthimos, Australian writer Tony McNamara and others achieved, but I had to watch the film to appreciate their 'success', which is an acquired taste I ultimately failed to acquire. Interesting also the way in which the treatment of Anne and her reign here in some sense parallel that meted out to Victoria and HER reign in 'Victoria and Abdul'. A person who didn't know better would be inclined to wonder if there is a deliberate attempt to (try and) besmirch the reputations of our Queens, by way of sledgehammer ridicule.Thanks to this review, others will have - should they choose - a better idea of what they are letting themselves in for by electing to watch 'The Favourite', in advance of actually parting with their hard-earned cash.While the camerawork (under Irishman Robbie Ryan) at times achieves artistry, the bullseye lens of which the makers are so proud bored and confused this viewer, if only serving to emphasise the deliberate effort made here not to lionise the past, and not to make history look attractive, or even especially real.Fair enough (and indeed I have an imagination, am not a prude and do value diversity), but...While the Hatfield House principal setting is such a rewarding location that it often achieves a satisfying 'Dutch Interior' type feel (in spite of everything), much effort is made by one and all to ensure that this setting is steeped in a huge variety of offputting visual and audio stimuli assailing the watcher of the film. Wounds, ulcers, foul language, blood, vomit, toilet habits, oral sex, rape, mud, drunkenness, capriciousness, hitting, shouting, overindulgence, silly foppishness, humiliation of people and cruelty to animals are all on display.Now those who know their history will be under no illusions that past times were crude in their way, and by no means obviously more 'elegant' than the times we live in today. There was anyway still - in the early 18th century - a kind of understandable reaction to Puritanism of the 17th.It is also more than conceivable that Queen Anne (here played by Olivia Colman) did indeed have a fully-fledged lesbian relationship with her favourite, the Duchess of Marlborough (a strong role for Rachel Weisz). Likewise Sarah's (aristocratic, but on hard times) cousin Abigail Masham (nee Hill) (played here by American actress Emma Stone with a faultless accent) really did exist, and really was another favourite of Her Majesty. So much of what is portrayed in the all-female triangle here might indeed have happened.And men really were foppish back then.But...In the first place, Anne had tremendous health and other difficulties in her life, and while these are portrayed in near-excruciating detail, this is deliberately done callously and heartlessly - to the extent that I felt moved, and sorry for Anne, just once - at the moment when she took the rabbits from the cages and let them run around, making it clear that they were in some way substitutes for her 17 lost children. The makers claim that there IS sympathy for Her Majesty in their 'black comedy' film, but I searched long and hard for the sympathy and found it only this once. (I also looked for the comedy, and found that elusive too). But anyway, it is true, painstaking genius of a kind to expunge all other sympathy for a sympathetic figure from a 2-hour movie.Anne deserves a better, kinder fate than this!A similar kind of process afflicts the portrayal of my country - the United Kingdom - a polity that actually came into being during the reign of Queen Anne, as conceivably the most earth-shatteringly important 'invention' in the whole history of human civilisation. This does not appear in the film, and while the 'glories' of Marlborough's victories in Europe cannot be ignored by it, they are also to some extent belittled and ridiculed, and that is fair enough. While those wars resulted in the construction of Blenheim Palace (a topic that does briefly make its appearance), and while that had a little bit to do with the coming into existence centuries later of one Winston Churchill, they need not concern us unduly in 2019.Mores seriously, there is not a hint here of the country of creative genius and scientific and artistic assertiveness that was beginning to take shape during Anne's reign. There was a kind of mini Golden Age in those 12 years - as historians doing their own reassessment of history are increasingly telling us; and any form of even minimally straight or fair presentation of that truth strays so far from the intentions of this film's makers that there is obviously no chance that they would even allude to it.Call that a pity if you will, call it an oversight, or elect to reinterpret the word 'reimagining' as deliberate/cunning/manipulative/heavy-handed misrepresentation. It's your free choice as a viewer - actual or potential - to do that.",3,3,7,14 November 2019
Good Will Hunting," Inspired genius ABSOLUTELY worth revisiting in 2019 - COMPULSORY for first-timers
","This is a stunningly good bit of Damon-Affleck co-writing from an astonishing 22 years ago), directed by Gus Van Sant and offering outstanding roles, not only to the aforementioned pair (who absolutely shine together), but also to Minnie Driver, plus Stellan Sktarsgard and Robin Williams (another amazing pairing).What good did we do to deserve this feast of talent? For the ears in particular, as FANTASTIC, deep, meaningful, powerful dialogue pours out of the mouths of the stars.Ironically, when I first watched this - not too long after it was made - I felt annoyed and exasperated with Damon's character Will Hunting (hence the clever nature of the title). I just got fed up with someone that gave so little back to (or actively abused and rejected) 4+ great (if of course quite flawed) human beings who were prepared to devote so much time and unrewarding effort.This time round I'm more charitable. Will is a genius that leaves supervising Prof. Lambeau (Skarsgard) in awe, jealous, admiring, and above all immensely frustrated. For Will comes from absolutely the wrong side of the tracks, and yet is a mathematical genius the likes of which Harvard/MIT have never seen, yet is listless and aimless and drifting over to the bad instead of the good, because of fearful psychological experiences from childhood that psychiatrist Dr Maguire (Williams) seeks to help him with, mostly to no avail.So Lambeau has his academic and other reasons for going the extra mile, the latter's old schoolmate Maguire has his occupational commitment (though both are strained to and beyond the limit by their pupil-patient), but the Minnie Driver part (Skylar) just has her love for Will - and his throwing that back in his face hurts us even more than the other rejections. Seemingly most complacent and non-judgmental is Will's co-worker on the construction site and drinking and free-time buddy Chuckie (Affleck), who ultimately stops being easy-going when he shakes Will by saying that his non-gifted, worker pals EXPECT Will to make what he can of talents they would give anything to have.All the interactions here are exquisitely, searingly well-observed and magnificently well-written, but the genuineness of the Affleck-Damon dialogues are the ones that hit home most of all, reminding us of the remarkable kindness and insight and true understanding that can at times exist in real life among ostensibly non-intellectual, tough-exteriored working-class men.For most of the movie, it seems that none of these helpful and well-meaning interventions is going to cut any ice; and indeed the happy ending may look a bit too cute. However, we would have found the whole thing very tough-going without it.In any case, the film is indeed an almost excruciatingly erudite work of intense meaningfulness and genius, and a no-possible-shirking must-see for those who haven't.",10,2,3,29 September 2019
A Quiet Place," Nice idea, but not too satisfying, unfortunately
","If John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place' has any impact on you, it will probably be to make you realise how much noise you make all the time, given that the trick here is a dystopian Earth invaded by aliens that are blind, but with a very acute sense of hearing. That's an interesting (but NOT breathtaking or awe-inspiring) after-watch conclusion for a watcher to draw, from a film that builds on such a sound biological idea with reasonably good sci-fi credentials, yet doesn't seem able to engage us too much with it.The fact that the piece is (inevitably) somewhat free of dialogue is part of that - and I suppose it's sociologically worth finding out that - left with so little to say - our four key characters played by Emily Blunt, John Krasinski himself, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe come over as bland and not even especially sympathetic.But then if I want sociological discoveries I'll read a textbook...Lovers of dystopian sci fi will know that the setup of the dystopia can be critical to our 'enjoyment'. Here we don't know much about what happened (we start on day 89, I believe), and we maybe don't feel too convinced about a world that still supplies its (few?) survivors with a measure of hi-tech, food, shelter and even a kind of normal life ... except that you can't make any noise at all (except when you sometimes can a little bit, as we see in later bits of the film). Protection from aliens presumably does not involve closing doors (as they might squeak), so the residence of our Abbott family seems ludicrously underdefended by the standards of any dystopia you can think of. And somehow that still fails to ring trueAnd since the aliens can be killed in various ways, the might of the world's armed forces might not really have been so readily overwhelmed, don't we think? I do.At moments, there are clever ideas here, while at times the need to not make any noise when people would naturally make a lot verges on the sadistic. But 'A Quiet Place' is not too scary, not quite as subtle as it believes, and ultimately not too impressive, where it really, really ought to be, given its quite strong idea. A pity.",7,0,1,28 August 2018
The Game," Still an effective and enjoyable watch, with Douglas in his prime
","Today I dug out the video (not DVD) collection as a kind of challenge to myself, had my attention drawn to the 1997 movie 'The Game' from David Fincher (who has since gone on to several other good things), and gave the cassette a whirl through the machine for only the second time in its existence.Doubtless we've got used to Michael Douglas doing this kind of thing but here in 'The Game' he is in - shall we say - his 'middle period', and the film very largely hangs on what he can bring to it - which is plenty. His character Nicholas Van Orton goes a little past cliche, which is nice. Although he's an investment banker (which goes without saying, I guess), and although he's doubtless good at what he does, there's actually a good dose of clumsiness, fear and self-doubt - even self-loathing - just below the surface here, as well as plenty of loneliness right on the surface; yet when things go off the rails (as they regularly do in a Michael Douglas film) he's not THAT effective, but actually a bit of stumblebum.This does much to endear him to us.The plot is well into the realms of fantasy - and you'd do VERY well to ignore the more-thoughtful morality side - but somehow it's darned good - even 21 years down the line. Carried out with conviction and seeking out what are (apparently) a host of great San Francisco locations most (though crucially not all) of which are definitely on the wrong side of the tracks; it proves great fun (especially as we in the audience get all the benefits of what happens here without having to take on ANY of the risks). In that way it gets to be quite a rollercoaster ride, with moments of comedy and thrills and spills all thrown in).Interesting how times change - in a more recent film we would surely have expected more from 'Christine' (a fascinating enough character played here by Deborah Kara Unger) - in this respect some of our wishes go rather unfulfilled! Even Sean Penn doesn't do that much, though he's OK when on-screen. Personally, I've always had a soft spot for 'the' character that James Rebhorn plays, so that's a reward for me at least, as he gets quite a bit of screentime.But in the end it's mainly down to Douglas as Van Orton, and this is not entirely by chance given the nature of the film, which can be watched and enjoyed with no problem whatever in 2018.",9,1,3,29 July 2018
Unknown," Stylish thriller that holds its own pretty well
","While the stunts, chases, fights and so on that pepper Jaume Collet-Serra's 'Unknown' seem at times to push credibility to and beyond its limits, it transpires that they do not do so quite as much as we at first think, for this complex thriller story mostly hangs together well enough, if one is patient enough to wait for the twist in the tale to appear. There have been no shortage of 'respectable guy goes to a foreign city and forgets who he is' kind of movies, and they are mostly worth a watch. But here an extremely intricate setup is involved, and mostly it's interesting and fun to see how it can possibly all work out...With that, a lot hangs on how credible Liam Neeson can seem as Dr Martin Harris ... and not Dr Martin Harris. Mostly Neeson seems up to the job, but if his character is to reform, the love and support of a good woman (at last) is a necessity, and a lovely (in every sense) Diane Kruger here comes over very well indeed as 'Gina', an immigrant from somewhere to the east whose non-legal status in Berlin has given her some of the experience needed to 'keep up' when Harris's life gets VERY complicated. Two other huge presences in the film are a spellbindingly-good Bruno Ganz as an ex-Stasi man (where we of course know that there can never be such a thing as an ex-Stasi man), and Frank Langella, who - as usual - puts in a great performance, this time as the coolly-likable-yet-horrible Rodney Cole.For me, a further star of the film is the (to me quite familiar) city of Berlin itself - tamed maybe, compared with its former status, but still giving the impression that anything just might happen there. Playing a key role is the Hotel Adlon Kempinski, just a stone's throw from the Brandenburg Gate, which has seen it's fair share of history (though what we see now is mostly the 1997 rebuild). There are plenty of other settings too, sumptuous or downmarket, and all help contribute to the tangible atmosphere that does quite a lot to make up for other, occasionally over-the-top elements.Overall, then, an intriguing and satisfying watch with a couple of very good parts well played to savour.",8,0,0,19 March 2017
Ex Machina," Thought-provoking (at times mind-blowing) look at upcoming AI from the perspective of an erotic Turing Test
","British Director Alex Garland's splendid, compelling, well-acted, well-put-together, cerebral and erotically-charged film sees a somewhat-geeky Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) travel to a remote stronghold where the ultimate boss of the online-search company he works for, the enigmatic Nathan (Oscar Isaac), has been developing artificial intelligence to the point where he believes he can be victorious when exposing his guest to the Turing Test.That is to say that Nathan believes Caleb's interaction with the peak-achievement (so far) robot Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) will prove so convincing that he will no longer feel he is interacting with a machine. Hence the title, and a number of philosophical discussions about artificial intelligence which all seem timely enough.Wonderfully, all of this 'artificial' stuff takes place in sterile-ish built surroundings set in the midst of immaculate natural beauty (the bits that aren't filmed at Pinewood near London are done in Norway). Nathan takes Caleb out to see meltwater running spectacularly down forested slopes from blue-ice glaciers, and the views are at moments divine. Perhaps we are meant to be tempted back to the wonderful nature that surrounds us and where we belong, along with cousin bird and cousin tree and cousin moss? Surely these are places where DNA-free AI constructs may not feel at home and do not belong? Yet soon enough we are back in the well-protected high-tech confines of Nathan's spectacular home-cum-lab, with nobody for company expect Ava, and of course the gorgeous Japanese serving girl Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who does not even speak...I watch the film (for the second time, though the first time at home) at a time when news items about sex robots (and indeed about human beings' willingness to interact with them) are all the rage, and indeed there is that strong erotic side to Caleb's repeat encounters with Ava. To add to the challenge, Nathan has ensured that Ava is visibly still a robot, given that numerous parts of her are see-through, with flashing lights and very visibly machine parts, even if ones on a super-high technological level. In the midst of all of this artificiality, Nathan carefully informs Caleb that 'key parts' of Ava do actually work! But Ava's robotly wiles are far from crudely sexual, and it rather rapidly becomes apparent to the viewer (and certainly to any viewer capable of fancying women) that Caleb is not the only one taking the Turing Test!!! When Caleb meets her, the seductively-voiced Ada (shades of Scarlett Johansson in 'Her', by the way) is a mind-blowing mix of innocent and sophisticated, open and conspiratorial. She throws back questions at her questioner, is coquettish, but is also devoted, exclusive, interested and interesting-cum-intriguing-cum-fascinating.Pretty soon Caleb cannot stop thinking about her, and many of us out here in audience-land are not far behind him! It's weird how it happens, but it happens...There's a key point in the film where Nathan reveals that he has actually designed Ava having first taken a look at Caleb's online history of watching porn, so he has a head start (if you'll pardon the expression) in knowing what's going to be attractive to his visitor.But that of course brings us to an 'electrically' fascinating juxtaposition of circumstances. Something of a loner (indeed inevitably so given his lack of family), Caleb is more than ready to 'interact' (shall we say) with real women portrayed on what is actually a 2D screen. Now he's got a real-life interaction, not with a real woman, admittedly, but with somebody who nevertheless has plenty of time for him, takes an interest, is flirty but also (apparently) sincere, needy, keen to please him even by coming up with a high-class drawing of his face...Given that kind of choice, it's really no contest, is it? Needless to say, Ava is a tricky customer indeed, far more subtle and devious than we may imagine, but - to the shame of this watcher at least - she remains an alluring figure even when her desire for self-preservation brings her to the point of violent attacks committed pseudo-innocently, and certainly entirely without emotion.A scary prospect indeed, hence the film's regular references to Oppenheimer's feelings about his bomb as a new kind of weapon that changes everything, and indeed the musical reference to OMD's hit 'Enola Gay' (this being the name of the USAF bomber that dropped the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima).Doubtless, we guilty filmgoers who fancy Ava something rotten are going to excuse ourselves by saying that we all the time know in our heart of hearts that it's actually Alicia Vikander, a flesh-and-blood actress and an extremely good-looking one at that.Yeah, right!",10,1,3,25 October 2017
Hidden Figures," Excellent, beautifully acted and thought-provoking
","In 'Hidden Figures' we have a case of a book only just predating the film thereof (both are from 2016). Bearing in mind the huge story here, this can come as no real surprise ... unlike the 'dynamite' content - entirely unknown to just about all of us, I suspect, devotees of NASA missions as we may have been. Author Margot Lee Shetterly is a 'child of NASA' (born 1969), as her dad worked there, while her mother lectured at Hampton, and so she is steeped in the tradition and has her point to make. It needs making (just as the similar point in 'The Butler' from 2013 needed making).And so to Theodore Melfi's film, in which the abiding image is of some of the 1961 rooms at Langley, Virginia, being full of almost clone-like white guys in white shirts and ties and badges (the kind I dreamed of being when growing up); while others are full of colourfully-attired women whose skin is black. Like everything else in the then Virginia, this is segregated, and these visuals achieve much before we even get to the dialogue and plot.Some movement between the two sets of rooms (separated by hundreds of yards) is now beginning, thanks to our story's three (real-life) heroes Katherine Goble (the former child prodigy but now widowed mother of 3 number-cruncher or 'computer'); Dorothy Vaughan (a fellow 'computer', who supervises the others but is unable to gain official recognition of the fact, and who also takes an interest in Fortran (invented 1957), as well as the new IBMs that have just reached NASA); and Mary Jackson (another 'computer' who wants to break new ground in all directions by becoming an engineer).These three characters are played, respectively, by Taraji Henson, the Oscar-nominated Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe, and it's fair to say they act their hearts out, impressing as not-nerdy-at-all scientific and engineering types. The portrayals are a warm, touching, impressive, amusing delight.Over on 'the white side', our players include Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Kevin Costner - as Vivian Mitchell, Paul Stafford and Al Harrison, respectively. There's also a tiny-but-key role for Olek Krupa as Karl Zielinski (real-life Kazimierz Czarnecki), who has a superb line to deliver about being 'a Polish Jew', and escapee of the Holocaust. He is among the 'bridge-builders' and stereotype-breakers, as - ultimately - is Costner, who (again) takes to a 1960s role as if made for it. Harrison is a sympathetic figure, even if he effectively tells his staff to abandon family life for the duration (the upcoming mission being John Glenn's 'Friendship 7' flight of February 1962).Mitchell and Stafford are stiff, mostly unyielding characters, and - appropriately - Jim Parsons does not quite leave Sheldon Cooper behind. In fact, even these 'progress' gradually. Anyway, they are not obviously evil, but they are remarkably ready to accept the obscenity-absurdity of Katherine having to run to the 'coloured' toilet back in her original place of work, and to use a separate kettle. Doubtless, these are Americans who share their country's strong Christian tradition, but forget how all men are brothers in the eyes of the Lord; and who of course believe in 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness', yet are prepared to live in a system that forgets that too.Those are powerful, unsettling, Orwellian thoughts.Tellingly, when Harrison begins to break down the barriers (even literally, in a scene whose historical accuracy one somewhat doubts), it is not because he's seen the light, but simply, pragmatically, because it's going to be more efficient in helping get the job done. Perhaps that's an OK reason, given the sheer bizarre stupidity of what they've become stuck with.Thanks to changes that Harrison and others made at NASA, and thanks to the mostly well-sensed and portrayed patriotic and scientific success that Glenn's flight (and then the Apollo missions) represented, the film is 'feelgood' - and all the more so with the typical end-of-biopic comparisons of acted and real-life versions, complete with short biographical notes. Katherine is romanced successfully by Korea veteran Col. Jim Johnson (played by Mahershala Ali, with his usual integrity and dignity). Johnson reveals that his parents had been married 52 years, but we learn at the end that Katherine's own marriage had reached 59 years, and that she received various honours ... from Pres. Obama ... in 2015/2016. Each snippet here is telling.Which brings me to a further key thought I found myself thinking, though I do not know if it was what the makers intended. Triumphant as the film may be, it was not plain sailing after 1961, was it? With - literally - one exception, the black people portrayed in 'Hidden Figures' are mostly free of the disillusionment-cum-surliness they might rightly feel. They are wearily accepting, but also hard-working, patriotic and middle-class-aspiring, 'normal', and as devotedly interested in space as their white counterparts, and of course (more than) a match for them in intellect and ability, if not opportunity.This somehow suggests that everything was still to play for in 1961 - an era perhaps looking 'nicer than ours', even if saddled with that outrageous and hideous segregation. I found myself encouraged to imagine steps seen in the film being taken more fully, firmly and quickly, more widely. To imagine more white people like Harrison bringing down barriers (even for just pragmatic reasons). Had those things happened, might America not have avoided decades more of not-dissipating African-American bitterness, resentfulness, ghettoisation, anger, crime, drugs and imprisonment? Maybe not, but maybe yes...That's a surprising take-home message from such a fine, often enjoyable and mostly inspiring film, but it's certainly one I got...",9,2,9,16 March 2017
Event Horizon," Poor man's hybrid of 'Solaris' and 'Alien' - unpleasant when not being unsatisfying
","I strangely failed to catch up with British Director Paul Anderson's sci-fi movie 'Event Horizon' until 20 years after it was made. And now I think I understand why, as this piece does not please the viewer as well as it might. This is a more intriguing failing than it might seem, given quite-adequate special effects on the spacecraft in orbit around Neptune (certainly so for 1997), a pretty reasonable cast (Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs to name but four) and a creepy-enough core plot idea (with a nicely enigmatic little twist at the end).Admittedly, quite a bit of the dialogue here is hammy, the theme music is simply a mistake, the plot realisation is at times predictable, and quite often members of the 'Lewis & Clark' crew seem to act in slightly unlikely ways (the traditional sin of withholding information from Captain and crew being quite well at work here at regular intervals, for example).But does even this list of misdemeanours account for what happens with this film? I'm not quite sure.What is interesting is that the Neill character Dr William Weir sums up the evil of Hell by reference to eternal chaos and - surprisingly - the film offers up a little slice of that chaos, and it's not pleasant. And, while unpleasantness is not necessarily a crime in a film, or indeed in any other piece of art, the turnoffs here somehow just seem to outweigh any possible rewards of watching, even in a whole that comes in at just 96 minutes.",6,2,3,25 July 2017
World Trade Center," Actually a profoundly moving vignette helping with focus on a story too big to ever tell
","I watched this for the first time nine years on from its year of production and nearly 14 on from the actual event. Happily, I turned to the IMDb reviews only after seeing the film, and find it surprising how much negativity there is around. The destruction of the World Trade Centre is obviously too big a story to tell in any single film, and it is also a story that should not be told in that way - in a non-documentary film - ever. But that does not mean that the event should not be dealt with at all, and here the focus is primarily on a rescue - one of the very few, and the rescuers - of which there were very, very many, including the rather incongruous bunch presented in this (true-story) film. The fact that the act of terror took most of its victims outright in a variety of more or less horrible ways does not mean that we 'crow' or paint a ludicrously optimistic picture if we focus in one film on people who were actually rescued. Nor does it mean that we paint an unsubtle, gung-ho picture if we view recreations of the work of the hundreds (thousands?) who risked their lives (and very definitely their health, given the severe pollution on site) in the desperate hope that more might be extracted from the rubble. Indeed, to me this was not a particularly jingoistic presentation (and one would not particularly expect one from Oliver Stone). But it is moving and does inspire patriotism for humanity, as opposed to merely the United States. This is inevitable, natural and right, given that these are recreations of real events, and happily full of the weird, chancy, ad hoc, eclectic features that real-life events almost always present. Ultimately, then, a true story is told in a moving way (how could it be otherwise, given the circumstances?), and there is no reason I can see to dismiss this film (as so many have seemed to) as exploitative, over-emotional, over-patriotic or too inclined to focus on the few survivors, or anything else. This is a story worth telling, needing telling, and I did still feel enlightened further as regards the catastrophic and barbarous September 11 events. These cannot be bad things...",8,3,5,27 June 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Must look 'squeezed' to those who love the books, and probably even to others...
","(Even) people who are basically supportive of the whole Potter concept who return to this film 12 years down the line may perhaps feel a little justified in asking quite what all the fuss was about! And a reasonable answer would probably be that the films garnered the praise - and earned the huge sums - they did back then, because they followed hot on the heels of the books, of which each successive film version had inevitably to be more and more of a fragmentary representation of what the author wrote (which also in fact began to be inspired by the on-screen characters in some amazing synergy).This two-hour movie really offers just a flavour of what is in the brick of a book whose title it shares, and quite a bit of the fun goes out in that way (notably much of the aspect dealing with day-to-day schooling in Hogwarts). Admittedly, this is now a changed school for young wizards, and class-act Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge does her stuff pretty well.In contrast, the non-actor status of many portraying students is (now at least) all too clear, though we are inclined to forgive them this, I feel. People who CAN act like Maggie Smith, Robert Hardy and (an almost-overacting) Alan Rickman get remarkably little screentime, while Gary Oldman (in his last appearance as Sirius Black) does himself no particular favours. Ditto Michael Gambon.Robbie Coltrane is pretty invisible this time, as the butchered-story film offers Hagrid little to do; though a few people on screen for just a few minutes do make their mark, notably Jason Isaacs as Malfoy senior (Junior appears for just a few seconds) and Helena Bonham-Carter as Bellatrix, as well as (on the good side) Evanna Lynch as a superb Luna Lovegood and Natalia Tena as Tonks.The cinematic presentation of Hogwarts does not have much new to offer in 'Phoenix' (indeed it all seems far more impressionistic than in previous instalments); but it has to be admitted that there remains a massive gulp of pride for Brits as we are reminded in 2 awe-insipring London skyline flying scenes that Hogwarts is in our country. The juxtaposition of Muggle and wizarding worlds was always a joy of Rowling's presentation (as of course were the starts of each volume with the Dursleys so sadly butchered in most of the films, though here extended a little thanks to the need to present the reasonably impressive dementor attack on the odious - but here slightly more sympathetic - Dudley, played by Harry Melling).The presentation of the Ministry of Magic is also quite awesome, most especially when it reappears in the final battle scenes that at last seem to leave the more-pedestrian behind and give us some genuine excitement and wonder.Fred and George's bye-bye to Hogwarts - accompanied by a brief burst of amazingly motivating music from Nicholas Hooper - is the true joyous highlight of the film, though even that seems like it might have been just a bit squeezed, 'in order to fit it in'.As a standalone movie, David Yates's 'Order of the Phoenix' movie cannot be said to deserve too many laurels. As part of the series it of course has its place, and as visual tribute to one instalment of a genuinely world-beating and unique series of novels for kids of all ages it does better. But, money-spinners as they may be, these movies must with the benefit of hindsight be deemed to play second fiddle to the immaculately-plotted and wittily-authored Rowling books. Those who have still not read the latter are definitely advised to reserve a couple of months and indulge...",7,0,0,10 July 2019
Woman in Gold," Compelling, convincing presentation of a shockingly-irresistible true story
","Lovers of the art that is film sometimes tend (or even wish) to play down the irreducible fact that 'having a good story to tell' is part of the deal.In 'Woman in Gold' from British Director Simon Curtis, the story resembles that of several family histories present in the superb genealogy documentary 'Who do You Think You Are?' in that we move backwards and forwards - in just a step or two - from the world we know (Los Angeles and Vienna in the 1990s and early 2000s) to the world of a 1938 Austria in which people line the streets to welcome and cheer on Hitler's Anschluss and watch enthusiastically as poor Jews in the streets have their pigtails and beards cut off for humiliation purposes.And, while much of the Fuhrer's Berlin was pounded to rubble, in parts of Vienna you actually can go back to blocks of flats once inhabited by Jewish people the Nazis exterminated.Here a splendid Helen Mirren portrays Maria Altmann, who could also (though was in fact phobically reluctant to) go back to her childhood home in Vienna seized without mercy and never returned. At an early stage, Mirren's Altmann reminds us that 50 years is not actually that long a period...In fact, Maria's life stood out just a little from those of celebrities featured in 'Who do You Think You Are?' in that she was among several members of her family to survive the Holocaust - as opposed to the typical situation of being the only one, or at least a descendant of the only one. While Jews rich and poor died, Maria's family had been very well-to-do, and her sugar-manufacturing uncle was astute and influential enough to get out of Vienna quickly. But naturally enough, he had limited capacity to take away property including the titular subject of this movie, the Gustav Klimt painting of Maria's Aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, which the Austrian state 'acquired' smoothly enough post-War (as the country began the process of portraying itself as a victim of Hitler's aggression); this work of art resembling so many others in having been stolen by the Nazis from Jews they were about to cart off and kill.Ironically, perhaps, Klimt was not a particular favourite for the Nazis, being regarded as at least semi-'degenerate'. Had it been fully so the painting might have been summarily destroyed. Equally, had it been fully acceptable, it would doubtless have left Vienna for the Fatherland rapidly enough, as did several other treasures of Maria's family.And so to the main story, in which Ryan Reynolds plays lawyer Randy Schoenberg - a junior branch of a family also in Maria's circle of Austrian-Jewish escapees, and in fact a grandson of the famous Arnold - a composer unreservedly deemed 'degenerate' by the Nazis, who escaped to the US as early as in 1934, only dying in LA in 1951.In the film - as in life - it is Randy's job to persuade the Austrian authorities - and above all people - that art acquired in the above way cannot in good conscience go on hanging on the walls of the Belvedere Gallery as 'Austria's Mona Lisa'.Sounds reasonable enough, right? Well, in fact, Maria and Randy had a 6-year legal battle on their hands which faced stubborn resistance from Austria. Revindication had only come on to the agenda at all thanks to a 1998 Act pushed for by Nazi-hunter journalist Hubertus Czernin - as superbly played in the film by Daniel Bruhl.It would be easy to imagine that a story of this kind cannot be messed up in film form, but that would be too optimistic. Many such films are indeed messed up, for example by caricature good guys and bad guys speaking English 'viz a strong Jarman exent'. Here authentic German is resorted to and everything looks and feels right (which in the context of the story sometimes means 'very wrong'). Mirren does her job well, naturally, but her pairing with Reynolds is excellent and the development of Maria and Randy's relationship also a joy. When Bruhl joins them from time to time it just gets even better.On the whole, the film is also understated, which here is good. But it gives us a hint of the richness of the Jewish culture in old Vienna - most especially when Maria's wedding is portrayed - and this is as fascinating as it is moving and tragic, given the infinite evil soon deployed against it.In essence, then, a remarkable and important story recreated perfectly.It's a story all need to know, with an ending of victory and a hint of happiness, albeit muted - as Mirren's Altmann makes clear. But this educational process is also a great cinematic experience - a must-watch indeed.",10,1,3,14 November 2017
Limitless," Mostly unlikeable, occasionally interesting thriller of very mixed messages
","A guy takes an illicit drug because of its helpful effects, and risks continuing doing so even though EVERYBODY else around him doing the same is becoming disabled and dying. And guess what? He gets away with it, comes off it gently in time, continues to benefit long term and seems set fair to lead a really great life for ever and ever.At my age I can fairly claim to be immune to that kind of message, but can we say with hand on heart that everybody else is? That's how we start and finish in describing Neil Burger's 'Limitless', but we might also add in the way our hero (played well enough by Bradley Cooper) pays the price for his habit by getting mixed up with some very risky criminals, as well as with big-business type Carl Van Loon (whose name maybe says quite a bit, as this is a driven character for whom profit and takeovers are literally everything). The Van Loon character is played by Robert De Niro, who towers over this film, giving a hugely impressive and enjoyable portrayal (assuming of course that this is not just De Niro being De Niro).This is a strange film for several more reasons. In the first place, it starts off using a storytelling technique that is increasingly abandoned as the story unfolds. This looks like it might endanger the film as a cohesive whole, but somehow does not do so - so a few points for that.The other issue - in fact of key relevance - is that this is another of those 'let's use 100% of our brains and not just 10 or 20% or whatever it is' films, yet one that has no sci fi pretensions whatever (hence some contrast with, say, 'Lucy'). Ironically, this leaves us much more squarely with the film about the world of business and how drugs might help in that world that I described at the outset - a pretty dark and dubious concept in a piece of work that does have its better moments, even a few that are momentarily thought-provoking. But mostly it's just a kind of adventure thriller that raises questions other than the ones it perhaps intended to.",6,0,0,15 March 2016
Sicario," Taut, simple-ish but realistic-looking thriller with very downbeat message
","As a huge Emily Blunt fan with enthusiasm extending somewhat beyond the purely rational, I was somewhat surprised to see her (in the role of the FBI's Kate Macer) handing over control of the plot - and hence the starring role - on at least two occasions in 'Sicario' - in an interesting enough technique and one we get to see deployed surprisingly rarely in films. Still, Emily does not disappoint in her role, though Benicio del Toro as Alejandro certainly has a mountain of screen presence, and his part differs from hers in remaining competent at all times, while Macer is in truth out of her depth as she joins a combined-agencies anti-drugs operation (initially detailed quite well and - one would feel - extremely realistically, but later assuming more of a 'sketchy' look). A further co-star here is Josh Brolin, who sadly comes up with the distinctly irritating character of Matt Graver (CIA). Nevertheless, one is more than tempted to believe that those with 'the A' can indeed be like this, so presumably it's only reasonable.The plot here is a relatively straightforward one, which the above mini-description goes a long way towards encapsulating; but the 'fun' here, while it lasts, lies in the depiction of some very 'interesting' relationships on and around the US-Mexican border (at times well or even stunningly presented by aerial shots and so on). Indeed, how could this border be other than a star of the film in its own right - given the truth about the circumstances of the neighbouring El Paso (Texas) and Ciudad Juarez (Mexico)? For there they sit, with normal-ish, civilised life on one side of the border and anarchy and misery and mass murder on the other. Art of course imitates life here, as documentaries like Simon Reeve's excellent 'Tropic of Cancer' and the superb 'Toughest Place to be a Nurse' (both HUGELY to be recommended, by the way) have covered this ground in reality, and indeed Sicario's fictionalised version cannot top those real-life stories, though we do at least know how authentic and impressive (impressively scary) the former looks.This film does no favours to Mexico as a tourist destination or in any other light, but it throws up the expected number of questions about what methods are justified and who are really the good guys - indeed it probably asks more questions even than we anticipate (not least in a very interesting vignette starring Julio Cedillo). Real answers seem few and far between, however, and the fact that this is now 'the way of the world' hardly seems satisfactory, all the more so given the potential sentence-ending of 'and forever will be'... We know this is a war that is not being won, and we can scarcely extract much satisfaction from the idea that 'desperate situations call for desperate measures'. Naturally, our Emily stays on the right side of that kind of line - pretty much; but then she is told in no uncertain terms what we the viewers have already come to appreciate (perhaps even shockingly, given our experiences of supremely self-assured Blunt characters, such as the one in 'Edge of Tomorrow') - that here is someone whose methods fail and are out-of-date, a fish out of water (as indeed anybody interested in traditional, transparent procedures would now seem to be). And that is a far from pretty thought.Overall, then, this film offers up an appropriate degree of tension, looks mostly authentic, and leaves one feeling both alarmed and miserable. Job well done, then, Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Taylor Sheridan, but in no way is this any kind of pleasure watching.Worthwhile it probably will be, however, and much recommended for that reason...",8,0,0,1 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Atmospheric take on early-1960s America, with an aquatic 'monster' thrown in
","Most likely you're going to be needing 123 minutes - if not a whole lot longer - to work out if there's anything great about Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water'. But I gave the film that much time and ultimately choose not to regret that.Remember 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon'? That 1954 movie in which an expedition up the Amazon encounters said creature, which at one point cavorts aquatically with (an unknowing) Kay Lawrence as portrayed by a pretty good-looking Julie Adams in a swimsuit (as well as by her stunt double Ginger Stanley)?Well fast-forward to 2017 (or slow-forward to 1962 in the movie's own terms) and that creature is back, captured, enchained and being looked upon as a potential 'asset' for the US military that the Reds (who REALLY ARE under American beds, as well as in Cuba) would also like to get their hands on, or at least spirit away from the Yanks. But gone is that pretty gorgeous Julie Adams, and in her place Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito - a cleaner at the Baltimore-based research facility that's carrying out research (aka torture) on 'The Beast'. Now the film is ostensibly steadfast in reminding us that there is no 'Beauty' to match with that, as Elisa is (made to seem) plain and dowdy, lacking male company (other than the apartment-sharing fatherlike-figure called 'Giles' (played by Richard Jenkins) who emerges as repressed-gay), and she's also mute! Yet, in the first of many strong-contrast elements that this film throws at us - from the very first scene(!) - Elisa goes home and reveals (several times) a sensuous-enough body, and it is made clear to us in no uncertain terms that Elisa has a determined (and increasingly imaginitive) interest in matters (hetero)sexual, up to and including inter-species! This is something refreshing in a movie, and the makers allow Hawkins to make an impression with it, though the boundaries of good taste are several times being probed.Indeed, whimsical as this piece may at times seem, this is no kiddy-flick whatsoever, but actually grim, gory and upsetting in several places. This begs a strong question as to who this film is for, and answers come there few. Nevertheless, 'The Shape of Water' resembles a slew of recent films in regarding the early 60s as now-fair game for 'historical' movie-making, and no expense is spared here to portray the several different worlds converging that America of that era represented. First recall how it had been in January 1961 that outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower had warned against the military-industrial complex ... only for that complex to seem so very much needed just a year later in the context of Cuba. Here the military-industrial complex dominates the film as Elisa works for it, as does her colleague Zelda (in another classy performance from Octavia Spencer that again sees her up against scientist guys in white coats, or short-sleeved white shirts with badges hanging from the pockets, as well as guys in sharp suits and Sinatra-type hats who are basically secret agents - as exemplified by Michael Shannon's character Richard Strickland. Now Elisa and Zelda are good people, if poor-ish, and they live in surroundings that owe more to the '40s than the '60s. Elisa gets what joy she can from the fantasy musicals that play in the cinema beneath her apartment. In contrast, bad-guy Strickland and his family live in the bright, shiny, heavily-advertised world that is promised to all of America, but is actually available to his kind, as when he enters an automobile showroom and drives off straight away in a teal-coloured Cadillac. And that, in a nutshell, is this movie's actually-controversial and subversive and accurate-looking portrayal of the apparent wealth and clean-cut, all American joys of the 1960s, as laced with the fake world of Hollywood, a good dose of hypocrisy of other kinds on many levels, the arms race, the threat of the bomb and the red menace, and the scarcely-suppressed evil and gainsaying of liberty that the military-industrial complex, CIA and so on were able to generate against that background. In short, many of the same extremely-contrasting elements and aspects that one can find described tellingly (if also wittily) in a book like Bill Bryson's much-to-be-recommended 'The LIfe and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid'. If you buy into that kind of multi-stranded world of a 1960s America not at all what it seems to be on the surface, you may end up seeing more here than just a lame-ish monster movie; instead finding something at once chilling and atmospheric and far more authentic then it ostensibly purports to be.",8,3,6,1 July 2018
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Develops from not much into a superbly-portrayed near-masterpiece
","First a word of warning: my experience of the start of this film from British Director Mike Newell was of it looking rather trite and simplistic, even possibly as if made for children! It was surprisingly offputting, and I never expected that I would end up viewing the piece in such glowing terms. But I indeed did, and found myself both moved and elated by the quality of the work as it progressed towards its conclusion - so please stick with this, do not write it off, as your temporary forbearance will be rewarded!While the unfolding mystery plot is ultimately strong and compelling enough, my feeling would be that the movie develops as it does because of pretty-attractive filming, inspired acting giving us characters we quickly come to love; and the way it exposes a series of well-acted and meaningful relationships between people who mostly need each other because of the various traumas they have experienced and the yawning gaps that have been left in their lives as a result.The linchpin to that is the beautiful Lily James's character Juliet Ashton.However, the film is mainly 1946 Britain (and its recently liberated island of Guernsey just off the French coast), and a key - at times glaring - first contrast is between the Brits and a gung-ho, competent, well-off and keen-to-party American called Markham (Glen Powell), for whom the impressive WW2 victory is most tangible and least muted. The others (non-Americans) naturally have quieter celebrations, if any at all in the case of the specific Guernsey experience, but their needs and passions are greater.But, when Juliet gives up on her engagement with 'Mark' - as she clearly requires something more complex and nuanced, less free of darker issues - Powell joins his fellow cast members in acting this just right, and indeed with almost painful authenticity.Writer Juliet has a superbly portrayed relationship with her gay publisher friend Sidney, and that's all credit to Matthew Goode, who is perhaps playing his 'usual role' in some way, but who absolutely brings his warm and kindly character to life. Sidney's gay, but loves Juliet clearly and profoundly (as many of us on this side of the screen can fully understand!); and it's a touching and nuanced performance.Juliet's increasingly passionate interactions by letter and then in real life with Dawsey (Dutch actor Michiel Huisman) is also done well, with tangible chemistry on offer. But James also has a fine scene in bed (though not in THAT way) with newfound friend Isola (Katherine Parkinson); and this is also a tremendously well-acted and meaningful exchange based around strong sympathy staying just the right side of pity.It hardly needs saying that Tom Courtenay is great in his role - as postmaster and another member of the titular Society, while another beauty in the shape of Jessica Brown Findlay also does HER key (and tragic) character full justice.While I cannot claim to be a huge Penelope Wilton fan, I think it must also be said that she acts here as powerfully well as we have ever seen her do.And if all that wealth were not enough, there are also a couple of good roles for child actors, whose on-screen circumstances move us very readily indeed.Overall, the story is meaningful and strong emotionally, and the skill is first to have found a way to sum up so neatly (all aspects of) the trial the Channel Islands went through; and secondly to give us a simple cathartic medium (via books and poetry) that brings together and heals strong characters whose traumas run deep.A thought here would be that countries like Poland or even France would regard the stories on show as so entirely familiar (if still agoinising) that they come close to the typical. The skill with 'The Guernsey Society' is the way we up the ante by this being that same kind of story within the British experience (not least because some Channel Islanders - children in particular - evacuated to Britain, while others did not). Our victory was a proud and moving one, our liberation of the chunk of our land that was occupied (inevitably, but in some sense to our shame) means yet more in that context.Ultimately, there should not be a dry eye in the house for both reasons of British patriotism, and because of the emtional reinterpretation of what the term 'family' may come to mean, not least in the context of timeless British literary classics that shape who we are and bring us through hard times.A patriotic film them, moving, meaningful and quite beautifully portrayed.",9,0,0,1 November 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Enigmatic take on the subject, done with some style
","As with the recent 'Mummy'-genre reboots, Jordan Vogt-Roberts's 'Kong: Skull Island' obviously has a number of 'King Kong' predecessors (even extending to the rival 'Mighty Joe Young' - also out in two versions). In each of these, the theme of the monumental, potentially-aggressive simian possessed of a conscience, capable of love (even lust) for human females and attacked by an actually-even-more-merciless human species looms large. The 2017 work is no exception, but here the (really) great ape takes more of a back seat than we've ever seen before. Somewhat surprising, given that this is theoretically the hero of the movie! Ultimately, those electing to watch a 'Kong' movie do so to imagine an unknown world of wonder still present on our own planet (a la 'Lost World' or even 'Jurassic Park'), so atmosphere is everything. The idea that Kong is lord of all he surveys, lives alongside somewhat cowed - indeed often terrified (but also at times terrifying) - people who worship him and enjoy his protection are further aspects.In this instalment (which juggles with all of the above staples, but modifies the balance between them), we have (I think cleverly) moved forward from the early part of the 20th century to the 70s - and hence to the end of the Vietnam War and to the beginning of remote sensing by satellite. Any more-recent reference to lost worlds on our planet would stretch credibility too far, but the 1970s idea works well.The film has a very strong 'Nam vibe, but also one connected with World War II and the parallels and differences between the two. This is a great success, and indeed the film from the opening sequences (cleverly including speeches from successive US Presidents) through to the arrival at the titular 'Skull Island' are to my mind exceptionally atmospheric and good. The build-up of tension is palpable, but the military and military-civilian authenticity also wins the viewer over. The same could be said of the moving closing sequence (leaving aside the final, post-film sequence leading us on to the 'thrilling' next film).The island itself looks breathtaking, and really and truly filmed in Vietnam, which is a beautiful aspect of the film in and of itself. The wider-ecosystem portrayal here has a touch of class (not least in a sequence that sees helicopter and dragonfly nicely juxtaposed). But dragonflies are the least of our worries as the fauna here is an eclectic mix of giant beasts from past, present and the wilder imagination of the makers. Ecology and animal-behaviour considerations are not absent, though, as there's competition, camouflage and new imagined ecological niches on show. It's quite creepy at times (though cannot top the Jack Black/Adrien Brody film of 2005), and, needless to say, all of these living things are after our interloper-Americans from both the military and big business and the American state (as played, inter alia, by a gorgeous and sympathy-inducing Brie Larson, a sadly-somewhat-absent John Goodman, and a slightly-crazed Samuel L. Jackson - doing his thing as well as ever). There's also a token Brit (actually in many ways the star of the piece) in the shape of SAS-man Captain James Conrad (well-enough portrayed by Tom Hiddleston).When animal fights human it's impressive (and at times very fast-moving indeed), and there's ultimately also a rather convincing-looking Kong-versus-reptile scene in the arena of a valley surrounded by hills that harks right back to the original 'King Kong'. Kong is again a man in a gorilla suit, and there's no getting away from that fact - hence perhaps the desire to keep Kong a bit in the background for much of the movie? Overall, the somewhat-untidy effect is for several themes and aims of the movie to be slightly cobbled together. Occasionally it seems underwhelming or over-familiar, but I say this as someone who has 5 decades behind him. Those coming to this kind of thing for the first time will have far added value.In any case, there are at least some things about 'Skull Island' that are really praiseworthy, while the rest of the movie more-or-less does the job as intended. An interesting-looking sequel seems to be in the offing as well.",8,1,1,21 October 2017
Arrival," At-times innovative take on a 'first contact' ... but not as subtle as it thinks it is
","As the title suggests, 'Arrival' is sci-fi (based on a Ted Chiang book not called 'Arrival'), ostensibly about the arrival of enigmatic alien spacecraft and ensuing attempts to communicate. It is from French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, and one can sense an intense ('non-American') desire here to prove that a subtly cerebral approach can outperform a big-bucks SFX-dominated alien movie. Given my panning of emptily-whizz-bang new 'Star Wars' and 'Independence Day' movies, I was ready to believe. But...The film starts OK with a hyper-minimalist but genuinely affecting encapsulation of reaction to the appearance of 12 alien craft around the world. This works, and is tense, impressive and fun.Alas, audience doubt begins as Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) first meets our hero - linguist Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams). Whitaker normally grabs a movie and dominates with his great abilities and presence, but here he largely fails, delivering terse (sometimes witty) Colonel-type lines that do not really need his skills. He is mainly background. Indeed, in 'Arrival', EVERYBODY is background to Banks, including (virtually) the only other key character - astrophysicist Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner).The fact that our two boffins are only at doctoral level is telling. And a further sign of slapdash (reason for doubt as to quality in depth) appears as the first Banks-Weber meeting ends, and the former warns the latter against cooperation with another linguist, on the basis that the latter mistranslated a word from Sanskrit! Given a US military seeking out the greatest experts to deal with the biggest issue ever faced, we in the real world would be WAY beyond mistranslations of single words from a language in which Sir William Jones was an expert back in the 18th century!And that typifies 'Arrival'. Superficially, it's straining its sinews to be clever and nuanced, but it just isn't, because 'defence in depth' is lacking.If a film eschews big-bucks effects for intellect, then brain there needs to be. Here the story focuses down to the team making linguistic contact - leaving some viewers secretly longing to see the growing fear and chaos which 'Arrival' summarises through TV news feeds, as well as (just) one aerial shot implying that millions have dropped everything to drive to Montana for a peep.The focusing in goes so far in fact that only Banks matters, with other support characters - even Donnelly - in the shade. This is amazing in a two-hour film, but also cheap and actually unsubtle, and one-dimensional. Nothing of the kind could be said of that (early) special-effects-fest 'Close Encounters', which remains impressive and extremely moving, including - indeed especially - for scientists. If you push beyond the first Richard Dreyfuss-type story, 'Close Encounters' has layer after layer of realistic-looking scientific approach to the events portrayed. Under Spielberg, people who look like a genuine team of experts from every field are shown as well-prepared, doing things real experts would do. Everybody has a task, and performs said task faithfully and tellingly - whether centre-stage or in the wings.In 'Arrival', the minutes pass, and yet the support team remain unknown and mainly stereotypical, and (mostly) seem to be doing irrational things, or nothing at all!As 'Close Encounters' shows, the very idea that aliens would choose Earth, and make it here FUNDAMENTALLY undermines the non-communication plot. They would have monitored our broadcasts, and gone online on closer arrival. Inability to speak would not prevent understanding. In Spielberg's magnum opus, hand signals, music and a simple form of mind control helped. In 'Arrival' in contrast, the aliens' fiendishly complicated language has to be decoded by Banks, and this marks a high-point of the film ... for those accepting the need for translation. But these aliens also turn out to have mind control, so why all the messing about? It's just not logical...On the plus side, Banks's insight into the culture and motivations of the heptapod aliens is cleverer stuff. But it's her solo effort that has got us there, and that is not realistic.Thankfully, the film ends with its audience gaining adequate insight into various things that have gone before, with the character of Gen. Shang coming to the fore. Like '2012' (an effects-rich film, certainly, but also self-believing and pretty cohesive), 'Arrival' reminds us that cooperation with China is make or break now, and that's interesting, Indeed, when Shang emerges from the background, we have a VERY powerful (if so-brief) contribution from Tzi Ma to enjoy. The (very) ending here has some clout, and is moving, given that it also addresses the family circumstances of the main character(s). This IS the subtle part tacked on to several hours of less-than-adequate alien stuff. But can that really be justified? Indeed, if the family-oriented ending is moving, the rest of 'Arrival' is mainly emotion-free, and certainly joyless, unlike 'Close Encounters' or 'Star Trek: First Contact'. There is tension/fear, puzzlement and (occasionally) mission, but no real hint at the wonder of what is happening, right up there with the risk. This is a flawed lack of realism, given that devoted exobiologists and others would do the job, but also find it supremely meaningful.With its strongish ending and an at-moments interesting work on efforts to understand a language, 'Arrival' is not without pluses; but it could have done better. What is more, 'Star Trek' and even 'Dr Who' have dealt regularly with communication issues/barriers vis-a-vis aliens, and these short-episode shows HAVE managed to pose more interesting questions, and achieve loftier intellectual heights, than 'Arrival', for all its pretensions. That should raise an alarm for both those who want to be subtle in sci-fi and those who want to dazzle us with effects. There is ALREADY a successful middle-course out there. People have ALREADY combined intellect and spectacle in alien-focused sci-fi - even back in the 70s.Can today's film makers not match that?",6,2,11,17 November 2016
The Water Diviner," Very effective juxtaposition of emotions in a visually captivating piece of very good story-telling
","Perhaps it is not a huge achievement to make a good film out of spectacular locations, one of the most notorious battles in history (and the First World War in general), and the histories of Australia and post-WWI Turkey, but - hey - half the battle in the film industry is finding the kernel of a new good story for a movie and actually going on to make something out of it. Notwithstanding the issues of flawed detail that experts rightly take note of, this is a gritty film that looks and feels right, offers an appropriate range of emotions and settings (both domestic and a million miles from domestic), and acknowledges the truth that Turkey in 1919 was an extremely 'fascinating' place to be. The opportunity to contrast the existence of a small-time farmer from the Outback with the life and culture of a huge city straddling two continents that had half a million inhabitants by AD600 is not lost. There is also a refreshing honesty as regards the balancing of enmity and reconciliation in the wake of a battle that cost the lives of seven times as many defending Turks as attacking Australians and New Zealanders. If there is a flaw here, it is the renewed attempt to portray the Brits (with one noble and notable exception) as starchy, out of touch sticklers quite distinct from the matey and down-to-earth Aussies. This is the kind of thing we have seen far, far too often before, and it is well past its sell-by date. With this proviso, this (British) reviewer was impressed and moved by the beauty, authenticity and simple power of this well-done and mostly well-acted piece of work. Yilmaz Erdogan as the senior Turkish officer and would-be pioneer of Turkish nationalism is the undoubted star of the piece, but Crowe, Kurylenko, Courtney and Yilmaz all give us our money's worth, as does the entirely convincing boy-actor Dylan Georgiades.",9,2,5,19 December 2015
Signs," (Double) storytelling at the level of immaculate genius
","The Shyamalan 'not quite what it seems to be' film par excellence, and excellence is indeed on show here. There is a huge matter of import to be conveyed by the film, and every scene from start to finish contributes smoothly and richly to that overall effect, whether it be a subtle or overt one, eccentric, scary, engaging, humorous or deeply moving (and all of these states of mind and emotion are to be found in abundance). Furthermore, every cast member from youngest to oldest seems to display conviction, an unusual and tangible awareness that what they have to do in the film will help add up to something amazing.A taut alien invasion story is told here in minimalist, no-waste fashion, at first hand through the experiences of small-town, Corn Belt America, and more globally through sparing use of the old TV broadcast dodge; but there is also a wider battle for the soul and spirit of the film's chief hero, Graham Hess, portrayed by Mel Gibson. Interestingly, then, it is not the Gibson performance that stands out most (fine though it is), but those of supporting cast Joaquin Phoenix (as Graham's live-in younger brother Merill), Shyamalan himself, Rory Culkin (as the son of the family), and my personal favourite, Cherry Jones as Officer Caroline Paski, who contributes far, far more than her number of lines might suggest.Perhaps it matters little whether we can or cannot accept that the painful, stupid or trivial things all around us might add up to more than the sum of their parts. It is enough that someone is bold enough to produce a piece of true art in which that possibility is taken so fully and so beautifully to its logical limits. It is a fine and wondrous thing to behold.It seems unlikely that anyone who wanted to has yet to see this film, and it is clear that not everybody 'sees' it when they see it, as it were. Equally, there may be some people out there still labouring under the misapprehension that this is just sci fi (assuming of course that any sci fi is 'just sci fi'). But given how any true science fiction fan will have to regard a plot twist about the alien's unpleasant experiences on Earth as ludicrous, that merely goes to demonstrate that alien invasion is not the film's primary purpose, and that nothing in this world can be quite perfect. Nevertheless, for this reviewer, this in some ways modest offering ought surely to rank as one of history's finest ever films. And yes, I really do mean it!",10,2,6,20 February 2016
Lucy," Patchy mix of the sublime and the ridiculous
","Donkey's years ago, 'Star Trek' began to deal with the issues and significance and consequences of omnipotent beings, and also with normal human beings who became all-powerful. The theme was then returned to repeatedly, given the endless interest displayed by the various reincarnations of ST in what it means to be human, and what the limits and defining characteristics of humanity are. And maybe the effects were creaky at times, but this was Star Trek, so the subject was always handled with sensitivity, seriousness, integrity and as much intelligence as the 1960s (and then later decades) could muster.So can Luc Besson's 2014 offering 'Lucy' do better in any way? Those watching the first 20 minutes or so of this film - and very possibly giving up on it - might well offer a resounding 'no'. For a long time we are not going anywhere much, and are also getting repeated (distracting and annoying) cut-aways to documentary scenes apparently designed to indicate to us what mood is being conveyed by the main current of the film. Thanks a lot for the help with that! Any shreds of plot there might otherwise be are formulaic and unappealing in the extreme, all the more so given an absurd and very out-of-place inclination to imply that there might be something vaguely funny or light-hearted somewhere in the midst of all the violence...However, those sticking with the piece to the bitter end might be a little more hesitant to write off or condemn, for there is a moment when the titular lead character (played with cool sexiness by Scarlett Johnansson) begins to get a handle on the powers she is acquiring (in the most bizarre of ways) and does what any frightened and overwhelmed girl would do, and calls mum. In that moment, the film finally offers some first more-cerebral and meaningful antidote to the routine gangster offering of astronomical body count that has gone before.In fact, the bodies keep piling up to the very end of the film, but after the above scene we have (somewhat) more interesting topics to deal with anyway, and the remainder of the plot (such as it is) - beyond what is happening inside our charismatic heroine - takes a very firm second place.Morgan Freeman as a scientific expert (or rather hypothesiser) regarding the unused capacity of the human brain helps us cope with the enormity of the developing sci-fi concept, but sadly only a little. Unlike the makers of Star Trek and their characters, the writers on 'Lucy' do their great co-starring actor no favours at all by foisting many a line of highly unscientific mumbo-jumbo into his mouth, and it will not take more than a high-school pupil to realise that he is not making any kind of sense, try as he might to impart the necessary mix of humanity and gravitas into the role. And that is a pity - given that this is something rather easy to get right - I could readily have done the job myself for a few quid. Not bad compared with the film's (estimated) $40m budget.Given this accumulation of faults and failings, I am forced to interrogate myself as to why I watched on - all the more so given that the mainline setting of the film is mostly supremely predictable and lacklustre. For this sci-fi fan of very long standing, the only plausible explanation can be empathy with the nicely-rendered Lucy, and the metamorphosis she is going through.If one really did begin to develop supreme powers, before becoming irrevocably jaded with everything one would of course want to go back in time to see the Flatiron building go up in early New York, would of course want to encounter a tyrannosaurus, and meet (touch fingers a la Sistine Chapel with) Australopithecus afarensis, of which the most famous specimen is of course that other 'Lucy'. And naturally, you would want to see the native Americans living in their pristine lands, and then go back and see the Earth created and the first life emerge. And you would of course try to relive all the dearest and most meaningful memories that you know are locked up in their somewhere, but are still beyond the reach of your puny capacity to bring them kicking and screaming back to the surface.And these are the spellbinding glimpses of increasingly godlike powers that Luc Besson 'gets right', and is imaginative and courageous enough to offer us movingly and realistically towards the end of his extremely flawed film. For this viewer at least, it's somehow enough to rescue the work from the trash where it would otherwise most assuredly belong...",7,2,3,21 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nothing new under several suns
","Spoiler warning (of a kind) - this is a fairly spectacular film... And it offers a salutary lesson in the fact that, these days at least, we out here in audience-land are expecting far more than just that. To the best of my knowledge, my dictionary has separate entries under the terms 'pay homage' and repeat', yet the makers of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' don't seem to realise that, or at least they are very confused as regards what they want to achieve. A long time ago in a galaxy far away some rebellious types were attacking a lethal weapon being manned by some pretty fascist-type rotters, and here we are again doing the (self-) same thing again 38 years later. The plot would be predictable and nuance-free even for those who weren't around to fill cinema seats in 1977, but this is a copy even to the extent that the good-guy pilots enter that structural groove in the surface of the rotters' planet-cum-vessel, except that this time they do it very briefly and far less spectacularly than they did all that time ago! It's as if the makers felt embarrassed to really do this, but just could not help themselves. The real joys of the original 'Star Wars' were 1) the ramshackle, Heath Robinson look of anything not in the hands of the bad guys, 2) the panoply of robots, machine-like creatures, creature-like machines and creatures and 3) the imagined planets, be they the deserty one, the frozen one, the jungle one and so on. Happily, all three of these features are present once again, but - although effects have obviously moved on - it is hard to say that the achievement is greater in 2016. Certainly the new 'weird creatures in the bar' effort does not better the 'Cantina Band' scene of old, which was also interesting musically. In turn, the dull and at times wearisome message of the original Star Wars - that new technology is bad, while old-fashioned mysterious powers are divine, and cobbled-together stuff is OK, has sadly not been diluted by the passing of the decades. And, while Max von Sydow has the clout to satisfy our unassuaged appetite for the late, great Alec Guinness, he has far too little to say or do in this movie (another mistaken piece of homage-paying). The new Vader-types are not a patch on the original, and the chief rotters do not have the power to charm and repel at one and the same time that Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin had back then, irrespective of how few lines he actually got to utter. Otherwise, the scenes from within the enemy's control room are the spitting image of those from 1977. And this brings us to the last suite of wrong assumptions made in this film. When the late and lamented Leonard Nimoy as Spock pulled down his hood and revealed his identity in a new Star Trek movie, we the audience mostly had a genuine lump in our throats, for ST inspires, not just some kind of a shallow teen crush, but genuine love and devoted affection. In contrast, when Luke Skywalker pulls back his hood in this movie, the underwhelming nature of the revelation is palpable, and made all the more so by the fact that the character cannot even bring himself to say anything! With the best will in the world, Mark Hamill was not a titan of the screen, nor Carrie Fisher, for that matter. So bringing them back so we can all say 'aaah' does not work as effectively as the makers would like to hope. Harrison Ford's Han Solo was the sarcastic and unwilling one who went around scowling with a kind of walking fireside rug as a sidekick - and all of those things remain true, but Ford at least has a degree of magnetism that allows him to dominate certain scenes - and in a few ways the personality of his character HAS modified a bit. Our two new heroes who both get to 'feel the Force' are actually interesting enough, and display a degree of chemistry, so all credit to Brits John Boyega and Daisy Ridley for giving us something new to deal with, and a modicum of interesting storyline given his change of heart and side and her reluctance to get involved overwhelmed by the need to do so. They are easy on the eye also, and many parts of the film are of course good to look at - at times even truly exquisite! But then, nobody ever (in 1977 or 2016) accused the Star Wars series of being short on clever design ideas. A hint of new plot would be nice, though.",6,9,22,20 January 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Completes the trilogy in fine style
","The fact that this film has over 3000 reviews speaks volumes, and it is hard to know what to add that might not already have been said.Unlike at the time of release, we now have the luxury of lining up the three parts of the film and watching them through. While this is hard to achieve at one sitting, a 'watchathon' with some breaks still does the job as it was meant to be done - with the necessary continuity.The first thing to note after that is that this is not our world.While at the very start of 'The Hobbit' (the book), JRR Tolkien seems to toy with the suggestion that the people ('men') in his book are like us, while hobbits are small beings that hide away from the likes of us, he clearly drops this concept further on in the same book, let alone in LOTR.So Tolkien's achievement - and the challenge for Peter Jackson - was to put on screen a whole new world in which we are observers, but not in any even remote sense participants. This is of some relevance, given the detachment needed to see the pure evil of Sauron for what it is, to go along with orcs and others being irredeemable cannon-fodder, and to accept the immortality of elves and the lengthy lifespans of the other species on show here (let alone the presence of a host of other beasts more or less supernatural and otherwise implausible).This is precisely what Jackson does achieve, and it is a triumph.And since LOTR is a portrayal of a last stand of 'the West', it is somehow fitting and touching that the 3 films are primarily the achievement of a mix of New Zealanders, Australians, Brits and Americans; and it might reasonably be argued that, whatever the cultural future of our world, 'the West' (and even perhaps its Anglo-Saxon sub-component) reached some kind of artistic zenith in this simply outstanding epic.Given that LOTR screenings overlapped with those of (the very British if American-funded) Harry Potter, these were rich times indeed for lovers of lengthy literary sagas entirely incapable of being turned into films and yet somehow being turned into films, even with some aplomb. They were also 'rich' in the literal sense, given the unparalleled, if deserved, lucrativeness of both of these genres.But LOTR still stands a little above even this high-class fray, and most especially on its design side. The presentations of the civilisations and architecture and art and clothing of the Shire, of Rohan, of Gondor, of the Elves, of the Dwarfs and of Mordor are outstanding and indeed near-miraculous (as literally they need to be). The level of detail is just mind-blowing and at times gulp-making in its audacity, love and care.One sign of the alien-ness of Middle Earth, in the books and now also on film, is the way it defies time-period classification. While The Shire might even look 18th-century, Minas Tirith seems more like Mediaeval times and the Riders of Rohan even somehow late Dark Ages...Again while Hobbiton would seem familiar (to Britons especially) and has a measure of technological development, a rather Star-Warslike twist (though Middle Earth of course came first!!!) has all remaining technology in the hands of the bad guys and compiled together with magic (either that of Saruman or that of Sauron). This effect from the books also makes it through to the screen...Tolkien reflected these differences in having Baggins and co. talk in rather everyday language about things like pocket handkerchiefs, umbrellas, hedge-cutting and dishcloths (and even tobacco), while the speech of Galadriel, Elrond, Denethor and so on is far more lofty and high-register. Again the film deals with this, though to the extent that actors occasionally look a little uncomfortable delivering their lines. Frodo-Sam-Gollum interactions (for Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and an ecstatically-good Andy Serkis) are at their best when tinged with grumpiness or humour (references to 'fish and chips' most especially), but they come close to indigestible overdose (as well as perhaps a touch of homoeroticism?) when turning to subjects more wistful.Admittedly, the lack of American accents in both Frodo and Sam is an achievement not equalled in most previous films, though it maybe happens at some cost to the delivery not apparent when native Brit Ian Holm offers his splendid portrayal of the ageing if ring-preserved Uncle Bilbo.Interestingly, Gandalf (here played memorably by Sir Ian McKellen) bridges these two worlds (as in the books), being a bringer of fireworks from The Shire's point of view, while also being a mighty wizard monarch in the story's later stages. He talks appropriately for both of these worlds! Minor issues like the above with the lines matter not to the great (and quite regularly tear-inducing) sweep of the tale; and to the joy of seeing many characters like Elrond, Theoden, Denethor, Aragorn, Arwen and Galadriel made convincing on-screen flesh thanks (respectively) to Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill, John Noble, Viggo Mortensen (special plaudits to him), Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett.Normally, a galaxy of stars such as this might overwhelm a film, but such is the epic scale of these movies that they represent just tiny parts of a whole presented with such great wisdom against spectacular New Zealand backgrounds. These locations were the choice of genius, and genius makes its presence felt regularly enough here. Of course, that is the genius of Tolkien, but it is also the genius of Jackson and (immense) team, who never pretended they could convey every element of a story running into thousands of pages, but nevertheless surpass themselves in managing to achieve so very much.Those lucky enough to have never seen these films are thus advised to do so, whether or not fantasy is normally their kind of thing.",10,0,0,10 December 2017
Godzilla," Remarkably effective...
","British Director Gareth Edwards (veteran of the SUPERB 2010 film 'Monsters') steps in for this umpteenth Godzilla reboot, which offers an interesting mix of grand-scale (pretty realistic-looking and flag-waving) military involvement and at times rather surreal or impressionist-looking monster scenes. Given that Godzilla is (in line with tradition) a guy in a monster suit (that's TJ Storm), that seems wise.Godzilla's enemy is the radiation-loving MUTO creature (in fact two of them, with babies set to hatch at any moment), and here we presumably resort to other techniques to screen these flying-swimming-walking and on-fire creatures never fully identifiable at any point in the two hours, but looking a tad like a more robotised version of the arachnids in 'Starship Troopers'.Anyway, Godzilla is a hero figure (breathing blue fire), who - true to the original concept - (eventually) rids the world of those pesky bugs. Crediting him with 'saving San Francsico' seems to be going a bit far, since he destroyed almost as much Frisco infrastructure as his enemies during the course of their fight!While the detonation of a nuclear bomb just a few miles offshore is ridiculously under-emphasised in terms of its effects, the story is mostly followed logically otherwise (to the extent that the main concept can ever be logical), and deftness of directoral touch is to be witnessed at many moments in the film.
Perhaps unfairly - but also in the interests of authenticity - every reference is made here to real-life destructive events like Chernobyl, the tsunami in Japan, Fukushima, and 9/11; and this stokes up the impact considerably. This also means eccentric moments and weird juxtapositions of the intact and non-intact that such scenarios really do denote.Perhaps rightly, actors are not too important to this story, though the most familiar faces are Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche (sacrificing husband and wife in the context of the movie's leeeeeeeengthy scene-setting phase), as well as Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins; and all do what they have to do well enough. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is rather there but not there...But mostly this is a disaster+monster movie handled well, taking its time to a surprising (and mostly telling) degree, with a lot happening out in the dark and in the depths or in the distance, and assuming the necessary creepiness that that entails.Scary it aint, but atmospheric certainly yes...",9,0,3,29 July 2019
Life," Does so many things right, and yet...
","On a clinical, objective level, Daniel Espinosa's 'Life' can easily be regarded as one of the most proficient pieces of sci-fi ever made. A story set in the International Space Station mimics that environment and equals (if not exceeds) 'Gravity' in allowing us to feel we are really out there in space. It's immaculate and at times awe-inspiring. Beyond that, the spoiler warning is on here anyway, but it is probably no secret to anybody (not least given the title), that this film introduces us to a life form from Mars and has sought - and truly managed - to offer a more convincing portrayal of same than has EVER been achieved on screen before.So far, so good, but the above use of the words 'clinical', 'objective' and 'immaculate' is not random, for somehow the above virtues cannot overcome a degree of disengagement that the viewer (well this viewer at least) seems to feel. And this happens in spite of an entirely plausible and well-thought-through storyline.The first problem, then, is that 'Life' comes on the scene, not as the first, but as maybe the eighth movie concerning hostile (Martian) alien life-forms brought onto a space station or base. And however slick it may be, that means going over ground that is somewhat familiar by now.The second problem is the ironic fact that at times this work looks too much like a space mission (and hence not like a movie). Ironic that authenticity might be a bit of a turnoff, but here it works that way. It's hard to recall a film in which Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal get to look like extras, but here that is so. That ensures that less-well-known actors actually do better here. Brit Ariyon Bakare and Brit/Swede Rebecca Ferguson appear (movingly for we British audience-members) with Union Flags on their uniforms, while Hiroyuki Sanada has the Rising Sun on his, and Olga Dykhovichnaya the Russian flag on hers. Perhaps we don't have such great expectations of these lesser stars and so on the whole they don't disappoint. But ultimately it may just be that we out here in audience-land are now too spoilt and too jaded to welcome this efficient and occasionally inspired piece of work as we really ought to.A pity then, and all the more so since one of the goals of the film - rightly enough - was to force us to contemplate what might ACTUALLY happen were life ever to be found somewhere else in the Solar System.Given all of the potential positives, it is the genuine hope of this reviewer that younger watchers at least will find this ultimately solid piece of work a bright, shiny and thought-provoking revelation as it has every right to be. But for we over-50s, neither superb effects nor reasonable plausibility can overcome that certain sense of deja vu.",6,0,1,13 October 2017
Green Book," Most of what you could ever want in a film
","When Viggo Mortensen in the role of heavy-set hustler Tony Vallelonga acts as driver and minder for highly-gifted if somewhat effete pianist Dr Don Shirley (here played to a tee by the ever-dependable but ever-better Mahershala Ali), the gorgeous, gigantic blue Cadillac with its radio and all still manages to overheat once and get a flat one other time, and its wipers don't work too well. Likewise, the gorgeous American landscape in this 'road movie' set in 1962 is tilled by black farmworkers not looking a whole lot different from their slave ancestors a century before. And then there is the titular 'Green Book' (of clubs, hotels, garages, barbers' shops, beauty parlours, etc.) that in its oh-so-tasteful and user-friendly way provides handy hints to Americans of colour - needless to say the (real-life) book calls them 'N**ro Motorists' - how to get the most of their tourism in the southern states ... without there being any tensions.Just three of the ways (there are many more) in which Peter Farrelly's 'Green Book' follows what are almost companion movies like 'Hidden Figures' and 'The Butler' (or indeed even 'The Shape of Water') in exploring that now-exotic world of an all-powerful 1960s America with its ostensibly slick, wealthy, consumer-friendly lifestyle hosting within it a tumour of nastiness that is as malign (and HUGE) as it is absurd.Don Shirley is inded gifted, and applauded wherever he goes, yet he has to use a different toilet and stay in different motels (just as the 'computers' in 'Hidden Figures' were trusted with sustaining America's cutting edge space-effort for NASA, while also having to use a separate kettle from their white - and at times professionally inferior - colleagues).So there is anger and disdain for that world in this film, even as its beauty and elegance are put on full show. But - wonderfully - it is neither in-your-face or overdone; but is rather evinced (mostly) far more effectively in mini-scenes and dialogues more or less erudite and often warm and witty between the two key characters.How on Earth anyone could have foreseen the slim, bright-eyed Mortensen being made over into a somewhat overweight, and not-too-bright (though at times canny) middle-aged Italian-American is beyond me. This is the antithesis of Aragorn (or indeed of John Halder in the great play-turned film 'Good').But it's just SUPERB anyway...Of course, this story is interesting (and portrayed spellbindingly) in part because Tony is less wealthy, less clever, less pretty-much-everything than Don, but because the latter keeps being brought low by the world around him (and occasionally by his own pretty-understandable lapses of various kinds), the characters equalise ... and hit it off better and better in an amazing way that history records as a true event. (At this point, care might be taken, as I know already that some criticise the presentation of this story for being not as true-to-life as it might be. Fair comment, but this film is a wonderful work of art anyway).At one point, the above effect is made clear in a heated 'race to the bottom' dialogue between the two that Shirley wins with a statement to the effect that he is not black enough or white enough or man enough to be anybody at all...It's as somehow beautiful as it is devasating and heartfelt.Given that this is also (almost too good to be true in being) a 'driving home for Christmas' story, there is a slightly implausible but also wonderful ending that speaks volumes in its mini-attempt at Jewish-Italian-Black reconciliation, but the sour aftertaste (the same one as with 'Hidden Figures') is the real-life awareness that reconciliatory steps of this kind were too few and far between, and have perhaps continued to be so.Yet the overall effect of the film remains a warm one, if one of undulled core message, and that is a great trick for Farrelly and the two remarkably good key actors to pull off. All credit to them.",10,1,3,16 February 2019
Annihilation," Only dubiously a 'cult classic'
","Considering both his screenplays (Never Let Me Go - to name but one work of genius), and his directoral achievements on the exquisitely-good 'Ex Machina', Brit Alex Garland is a person whose work can never be sniffed at. Here with 'Annihilation' he's giving - quite pretty and indeed at-times atmospheric - effect to a work by Jeff VanderMeer. So maybe the latter bears some of the blame for a story that, despite its intellectual pretensions, still looks wafer-thin in parts.To cut that longish story short, and to spoil it greatly, there's a strange alien force that's already taken over a chunk of the USA, bringing a far-reaching, mutation-induced reworking of terrestrial biology in its wake. It is spreading, can be stopped by nothing and has put a sticky end to any who have attempted to explore inside the zone it occupies, of the so-called 'Shimmer'. Yet when last survivor of an implausibly all-female team of scientists Lena (played by Natalie Portman) finally reaches the zone's epicentre, one phosphorus grenade is all she needs to finish off the whole phenomenon!Yet nobody thought to call in the United States Air Force, which currently has 1840 fighter planes looking around for just this kind of task...How could a film trying so very hard fall at such a ludicrously low fence?
Is art really more important than content?
Is sci fi content to live without the sci?Given that Lena is a biologist like myself, I both empathise with and envy her when she first gets the chance to try and make head or tail of the new biology she encounters in the zone - and here the film (all too briefly) reaches its zenith of (scientific) innovation. But despite a reference to hox genes, and one or two other bits and pieces, this work is never more than superfically valid as biological sci fi, despite the moments when the effects look impressive. A crocodile with shark's teeth and a 'bear' that isn't one don't give us too much for our money, though the plant life has a slightly better look about it.Frankly, Portman is only barely able to carry this off anyway, but the plot comes to such a crunch ultimately that one does tend to end a watch of this film with a big Why? And while 'Annihilation' probably fares slightly better than that other arty piece of science fiction of recent times 'Arrival', ultimately it smacks of much the same faux-portentous atmosphere, and that ain't good.In contrast, another piece of British eco-sci fi that explores similar themes to 'Annihilation' is Gareth Edwards's 'Monsters' made 8 years earlier - on a shoestring. And for me the latter is the far better film, much to be recommended. Alternatively, if it's people gradually going crazy in the face of weird natural/supernatural phenomena that you crave, well you've got things like 'YellowBrickRoad', 'Cube', 'Triangle' and many other pretty-ingenious quality movies to choose from.",7,1,3,12 April 2019
Spectre," Visually immaculate lowest common denominator of Bond
","After the (relative) subtlety and sophistication of 'Skyfall', we are back here to a largely non-nuanced Bond stripped back to the bare essentials. For this (re)viewer - who first saw the memorable Donald Pleasance and Charles Gray versions of Blofeld in early-70s cinema re-showings of 'You Only Live Twice' and 'Diamonds are Forever' respectively - there is NOTHING new here among the clichéd lines delivered by most of the characters, with the possible exception of Max Denbigh or 'C' - the new head of the Joint Security Services (played in the manner we might expect by Andrew Scott), who is bent on ushering in the brave new world of electronic intelligence-gathering at the expense of all other forms of espionage (double-Os not excepted). And here we come to the way in which 'Spectre' seeks to emulate earlier Bond outings in proving that the genre moves with the times (even if that actually undermines its own pertinence). Indeed, this has always been ironic given that James Bond continues to serve Her Majesty as he did in the Cold War 1950s and is therefore by definition liable to be trapped in some kind of time-warp. The Denbigh character would have a tough and somehow melancholy message (about old-style and new-style intelligence work) to convey to audience and Bond alike, whether or not he was actually working for Blofeld and Spectre, so it seems rather a pity that this 'obvious' (and highly implausible) plot twist was resorted to. The film would have said more without it. But then, this is a film of unsophisticated plot in which the descriptors 'obvious' and 'implausible' vie for attention in one's head during the entire 150 minutes! Which inevitably brings us to the question of: why bother? For the younger viewer there is less of a dilemma - if the genre remains relatively unfamiliar, then enjoy Bond in all his/its incredible (in every sense of the word) glory. For those who have been through the mill for a year or two as I have, and seen pretty much every Bond at one time or another, the treats remaining perhaps lie mainly in the gorgeous filming of the whole 'Spectre' spectacle. This time as ever - but perhaps more than ever - this is simply a smoothly beautiful thing to watch, location-wise and in terms of the actual shots. Then there is Daniel Craig, who may or may not deliver lines with conviction, but does have a certain something, a genuine screen presence. His relationship with the Lea Seydoux character Madeleine Swann is also sweet as much as sexy, and rather nicely done. There are also certain special feelings or emotions raised by this film for the more veteran audience-member: if Bond seems somehow irrelevant in 2015, then the filmmakers absolutely do not shy away from that conclusion. Packaged together with 'Skyfall', 'Spectre' seems to be telling us that we need to finally understand what has made James Bond tick at the deepest level, given that this is his swan-song after all these long years. And there is no doubt that one leaves the cinema with some kind of profound and surprisingly tangible nostalgia that it was clearly one of the intentions of the makers of this film to imbue. And yet for this reviewer at least there is also the one abiding feeling amazingly present at a strength undiminished since those first childhood trips of the 1970s - that in my deepest and remotest of fantasies, I would love to be James Bond!!! Perhaps that goes for pretty much everyone who leaves the cinema, and perhaps that is no small film-making achievement in and of itself?",8,0,5,27 November 2015
Moon," Solid if sad sci fi
","In this basically-British (and quite cerebral) film from son of the late David Bowie, Duncan Jones, it's 2035, and some technological process has allowed Earth's energy (and climate?) problems to be resolved by the simple expedient of crushing up the Moon's surface to obtain Helium-3 for fuel. You may think it best not to ask too many questions about the plausibility of that, but in fact you're wrong - it's a real possibility readily findable on the European Space Agency website. Asking questions about the morality of that - in terms of how we treat other worlds - might be a slightly different matter...Anyway, the Moon of that future, less-troubled Earth remains a remote, lonely and occasionally hostile place (though mostly just dull), yet for some apparently implausible reason they've (which means a giant mining consortium has) decided to make it a one-man-run operation. One says 'apparently implausible', since in fact the concern (called Lunar Industries) has got things very well worked out indeed - down to a fine art in fact. And just how that all works out is the gradual process of discovery engaged in by our hero 'Sam', played in a not-especially-appealing but very realistic way by Sam Rockwell, and of course witnessed by we viewers. Needless to say, in this out of sight and out of mind kind of place, there is every possible opportunity to raise business efficiency and to cut business costs...Without giving very much more away, the aforesaid discovery process is a somewhat sad, depressing and shocking affair, so this film is definitely light on laughs. But it is well done, and raises quite a few questions. (Not least a nagging, if perverse and unwelcome feeling appearing hours later that just conceivably there might be a grain of sympathy for the company's rational, pragmatic solution)!Part of the pleasure here lies in the interaction between Sam and the robot GERTY (played by Kevin Spacey in typically dour and enigmatic style). There's a definite air of (HAL-like) menace about GERTY, yet Sam's life is in its (his?) hands, and those famous Laws of Robotics kick in as they should to ensure that GERTY enlightens Sam - or keeps him in the dark - in line with (a robotic conscience's view of) what's in his best interest. For much of the time, GERTY - notwithstanding a status as a 'company man' - is the best and only friend Sam has got, and the robot actually proves its worth, time and again - and it's quite touching.There are several other moving moments in what is ultimately a dark and rather understated piece, but one which achieves a look of plausibility and authenticity. One could never say it was fun to get through, but there are nevertheless compensations. In particular, one can at no point say that: 'that's just stupid'. It really isn't that kind of film, and very welcome for that...",8,1,2,20 March 2016
Her," Certainly a worthwhile piece of reflective sci fi, though hard to say quite why!
","Spike Jonze's 2013 movie 'Her' hit the headlines when it successfully chimed with the inner desires of about a quarter of the planet by allowing its hero character Theodore Twombly (played with aplomb by Joaquin Phoenix) to reach some kind of highly-intimate climactic state in bed, with the eponymous 'Her', i.e. Samantha, as played - or rather voiced - by Scarlett Johansson. And this short fragment is certainly the film's highlight, an erotic enough experience, but also a moment of joy and sweetness, in that it represents the culmination of a first phase in which the personable, intelligent, super-competent but highly-inexperienced Samantha pursues her self-awareness, and gets an ever-clearer version of her needs, in the close company of Phoenix's world-weary (and remarkably Leonard Hofstadter-like) Twombly.The elephant in this room, and doubtless no secret even among those who have not yet seen the film, is that Samantha is an AI construct, a so-called OS1 operating system whose primary original task - of sorting out Twombly's life on the organisational side - brings out the need for romantic love buried inside him, if obscured by lingering warm-cum-bitter feelings for his beautiful,near-perfect childhood sweetheart and later bride Catherine (played by Rooney Mara). Theodore's real-life relationship with Catherine had everything going for it (so much so indeed that neither spouse is particularly keen to move on to the concrete step of divorce), yet it just didn't work out, and the two end up annoying each other more and more, in spite of the love and compatibility. This is, let's face it, an all-too-familiar real-life circumstance, and one that all of us would benefit from analysing and understanding better.Samantha, in turn, ticks Theodore's boxes because she is calm, attentive, caring, helpful, non-pushy, curious, witty, warm and kind. She's there when needed, but not all the time. Perhaps, then, it's all just a bit too convenient? But it's also an increasingly popular option, as the film makes clear as people in general get their OS1s, while the marriage of close friends of Theodore's also succumb to the attendant temptations.This is then a world slightly into the future, but doing nothing more than exaggerating tendencies we already see. Automation and robotisation seem to have taken away quite a few old-fashioned jobs, so Theodore's circles are in design and media, and - crucially enough for the film - he himself is in the hit profession of writing skillful letters in line with client instructions that help with the (fake) perfecting of interpersonal relationships of various different kinds. Theodore is of course adept at his job, thinking through the most perfect ways of pleasing letter-recipients. At the same time, he is everyman and no man, neither exactly young nor old, not ugly or very handsome, doing little between work and home, living mostly in a nostalgic past but also succumbing to shallow temptations of instant erotic online gratification with others that his world has brought to (sometimes perverted) perfection, but which our world is already experiencing in more primitive form.This all gives the watcher a great deal to think about, and it is highly likely that the mind-content in the hours and days that follow the film will actually be RICHER than that on offer in the film itself.Nevertheless, the above description is by no means the end of what's on offer here as - needless to say - our 'Lucy'-like Scarlett goes on growing. At this point, I will hold off with the spoilers (notwithstanding the warning above), but suffice it to say that the ever-glass-half-empty Theodore can't really stay fully happy in the face of Samantha's aforesaid mix of ever-growing intelligence and awareness and non-corporeality.Perhaps his heart was always going to be broken (again)? Perhaps everybody's would be in the same circumstances? Perhaps he could and should have made his marriage work? Perhaps he should opt for another real-life woman in the shape of the neighbour and friend, now estranged from her husband - or even a blind date played by Olivia Wilde that he is content to reject! These are just a few of the many questions the film asks, before bringing us to a one-way-street ending that is left a bit ambiguous, but actually seems clear-cut enough...Apart from at the one aforesaid moment when other, more base emotions take hold, 'Her' is basically a poignant and sad film, of mixed - perhaps even confused - message. What I took out of it most was something worth taking, I believe, that most of us have relationships that DID NOT appear by chance and that probably have sifted through a large number of suitability/compatibility filters before we even meet, let alone get together. Hence, to be brutally honest, the chances of us finding something (long-term) better if we ditch (or let die a slow death) what we've got are small indeed. Fantasy is just great, beguilingly perfect, but in the end it is just that, and probably it leaves us more alone than ever, if we embrace it.",9,1,1,24 June 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Amazing, magnificent, wonderful, harrowing, beautiful - choose your adjective!
","Mel Gibson has put together what is basically an Australian film, revealing in the extra materials that he is looking for heightened truth to achieve clarity. And indeed, everything here is writ large - from the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains (or convincing Australian substitutes thereof), to the awe-inspiring wonder and purity of the love interest in the film between Desmond Doss (as superbly played by Brit Andrew Garfield) and Dorothy Schutte (played with total commitment by a simply exquisite Teresa Palmer), to the spectacle of the drunken-aggressive-shellshocked apparently-hopeless WWI veteran that is Doss's father stepping back into uniform and pulling himself together to save his son from court-martial; and through to some of the strongest and most trully appalling battle scenes you have ever seen - in what is an amazing and shocking contrast with the earlier part of the film, if only a confirmation of the message about war Doss received from his broken father (here played wonderfully by Hugo Weaving). And yet, as the credits approach and we see the real-life versions of the characters portrayed in the film, we know that truth is indeed being presented here, a truth that committed Christian Gibson is trying to tell us is also the truth of God - and 7th Day Adventist-conscientious objector Doss would certainly have no doubt about that; and he went to Okinawa refusing to fight or touch a weapon, yet determined to be with his comrades in the absolute heat of battle, and to save lives - which he did indeed do, again and again and again and again. Seeing the recreation of the Hacksaw Ridge slaughter one might anticipate that literally nobody could get out alive, and - since not every battlefield was fortunate enough to have had its Desmond Doss - a further behind-the-scenes star of this film is of course the one called 'Enola Gay' - somewhat sad (if inevitable) to think of that given the bravery and heroism in the midst of the slaughter, but slaughter it undoubtedly was. Ultimately, intolerable slaughter.Needless to say, the portrayal of Doss's military training is an uncomfortable one for the viewer, yet there are truly magnificent scenes when Officers, Sergeants and men first begin to get an inkling of the man of true, stubbornly steadfast conviction they are dealing with. The way the behaviour begins slightly to change in the direction of first admiration is immaculate acting in and of itself, most especially from Vince Vaughn as Sgt. Howell. Yes, really, this is that Vince Vaughn, and what he produces here is an absolute peak of achievement.Once again, 'Hacksaw Ridge' draws inspiration (potentially even divine inspiration) from its utterly amazing subject-matter. Perhaps it would indeed be difficult to make a bad film out of this story. But in the hands of Gibson, some really great actors and special effects guys absolutely going above and beyond anything you can think of, this film is a moving, awe-inspiring, shocking TRIUMPH. Required viewing, if far from easy to view!",10,2,3,3 August 2018
Me Before You," Worthwhile, moving film with much more edge than it may first seem to have
","Reasonably, this film (based on Jojo Moyes's book and screenplay) is indeed 'romantic drama' more than 'rom-com', which is not to deny its comedic elements. But all should know that there is a powerful, demanding current capturing this film, which draws in part on the case of disabled British rugby player Daniel James and the question of his parents being charged for accompanying him to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic (in the end they were not). In the (full) cinema I was in, there really were few dry eyes in the house. I'll concede that mine stayed dry (not always the case), though I still find the piece affecting and thought-provoking and unquestionably worth seeing.2 big questions concerned Emilia Clarke's chances of getting beyond (and above) Danaerys, and Sam Claflin's ability to portray someone who combines near-total physical disability with marked vulnerability to infection - the double whammy that convinces our hero that his life really and truly and literally is not worth living.To my mind, both questions can be answered affirmatively.Claflin's character Will Traynor is good-looking, rich and still influential. He has a commanding personality (if mostly initially grumpy and arrogant), a sharp mind and a capacity to develop Clarke's character Lou(isa) ... Clark (yes, really). That begs A LOT of questions (not sidestepped) about the contribution he can still make, not least because he has support (moral and financial) from loving and well-to-do parents - nicely done by Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. And of course not least because he makes Lou Clark love him, even though she at first has a relationshp with Patrick (played by Matthew Lewis), which is not getting very far, but is genuine, affectionate and definitely physical, if also sustained by Clark's decency and supportive nature. Patrick is by no means a failure (he's been Entrepreneur of the Year). He's a bit dull, but not stupid or unkind, and of course he's a triathlon-type athlete. Yet he can't quite offer Lou what Traynor can (a huge and demanding thought in itself).And Emilia Clarke does indeed offer a convincing and often-touching portrayal of that growing love (as mirrored in her character's personal development in terms of interests and style and maturity - though emphatically not basic kindness, decency, humility and optimism with life, given that this is manifest from the outset and never wavers).This is actually then a demanding role. So much emphasis is placed on Clark's eccentric dress sense that one might start to write her off as a bit oafish. But that does not pan out. Clark is (over-?) loyal to her family, helping out financially, and so taking jobs below her potential. But she does what she does with conviction and optimism, puts all her heart and soul into each of her jobs, and she does know who she is. Hence her metamorphosis in the film adds new dimensions, but not at the expense of the old ones.Emilia Clarke is great at all this, and she proves well able to portray inner beauty increasingly augmented by outward beauty in the more conventional sense; and when Clark looks at - and touches - her nearly immobile charge, an audience-member not made of stone is going to feel the power of the affection, and also the restraint associated with the inevitable non-physicality and asymmetry of the bond.At at least one point in the film a comparison with Stephen Hawking is made, and this is not an idle one. There are also references to 'My Left Foot' and that film's real-life Irish hero Christy Brown. Hawking steadily lost abilities, yet espoused technology to fight back and contribute. He wanted to understand the universe, and he has lived longer than anyone else ever with his disease. Christy Brown taught himself to do great and wonderful things with the limb he could still control (hence the title of the story). At first glance, Traynor has fewer aces than Brown (whose story in fact ended unhappily with his death aged 49 in 1981), though more than Hawking (whose amazing story continues). Yet Traynor wants out and is committed to that idea with a devotedness that even Clark's love cannot shift.In spite of the chocolate-box pretty Pembrokeshire, Buckinghamshire and Mediterranean locations, this is not forgettable movie-candy. One does indeed return to the subject. And the person I saw it with came back at me a while after with the suggestion that Traynor and Clark could have married, had a kid (not necessarily even adopted?), and been worthwhile and useful and good parents making a contribution to the next generation, all the more so given further years of support from his parents and also her family (portrayed sympathetically enough by the familiar Brendan Coyle, Samantha Spiro and Jenna Coleman). And while that would have involved sacrifice and risk (given Traynor's endless susceptibility to disease that would presumably have done for him soon enough), it would have left a legacy.There's really no answer to that, given that Traynor chooses to eschew such options; and - as the film emphasises again and again - that's his sovereign decision in regard to his life. One gets the feeling that Clark's mother would not accept that choice, but the other characters come round to the idea - with great reluctance, but nevertheless.This is then a modern and radical film in a pretty and often traditional setting, but - as the above, nuanced references in it make clear - it is not judge and jury, at least not 100%. That role therefore falls to us, and this is as always a precious thing a (better) film can offer its audience.",8,6,7,30 June 2016
The Martian," Courageously gimmick-free and measured look at deep-space exploration
","Given the ambition of the 'Star Trek' universe and other film and TV space genres, sci-fi fans may well need pinching from time to time if they are to recall correctly that no human being has yet been further than 401,000 km from the Earth, while Mars lies out there at a minimum distance of 55 MILLION km. Thus - in real life - even unmanned missions to our external neighbour continue to push our species to the limits of its abilities. The fact that that might be a shame, given humankind's basic drive to explore, and the way that our species really might unify to swing behind such an effort are clearly among the aims of this film, whose mainly-supportive portrayal of the space agencies and what they stand for is nevertheless (one feels rightly) an eclectic mix of the awe-inspiring and the Heath Robinson. This is a film that clearly qualifies as sci-fi in some way, but is nevertheless no 'Mission to Mars' or 'Red Planet'. Rather this is a space-mission story told straight, relying a lot on technological details, and (mostly) accurately encapsulating some of the real-life difficulties that operating manned missions at the limits of our range might really bring; and even slowing the pace at many points to strengthen our awareness of those distances, and the loneliness and apparent helplessness they denote. Ridley Scott's love of detail comes into its own in such a context, while Matt Damon handles the starring role well enough, injecting the sceptical and humorous notes we have come to expect from real-life astronauts, as well as the toughness and resourcefulness. The Mars his character has reached is as staggeringly impressive and beautiful as it is utterly hostile, yet still - in some way at least, as 'The Martian' makes clear - 'out there waiting for us', should we prove up to the challenge of near-limitless flexibility and adaptability.",8,4,11,7 October 2015
