Kill Bill: Vol. 2," slow, overrated
","too slow and pretentious. there are some awesome scenes--the training scenes, the trailer fight, anytime uma drives a car, and when she busts out of the grave. but the ending was weak. i don't care about all the hip insight quentin has about superman or whatever else he had carradine talk about for the last 30 or 45 minutes that that scene dragged on for. these hip pop culture speeches are out of date--they were cool ten years ago. i just wanted to see a f***ing no holds bars brain splitting sword fight on the beach under the moonlight. that would have redeemed the whole series to a 10 level. quentin needs to quit f***ing his ego and just make a straight up, unpretentious kick arse movie like good, bad, ugly. and pop culture has been skullf***ing him for so long that its time to look for something new.",5,3,6,29 April 2006
Silent Hill," Terrible
","Saw this opening night screening. Way too long, made no sense, used video game logic the entire time, stupid characters (expect for the slight lesbian tension between the main girl and the cop--that was cool). Had some cool visuals but honestly who cares you can see that now in any video game. They could have done a thousand times better by trimming out half the plot points and almost all the monsters (what the hell were they). And don't tell me--oh but all that stuff was in the video game, so it has to be in the movie. The story should have been strong enough to stand on its own and be entertaining/thrilling for someone like me who has never played SH.The audience laughed more than they felt any kind of shock or horror. Someone needs to curb these idiots from trying to make VG movies.",4,5,16,22 April 2006
