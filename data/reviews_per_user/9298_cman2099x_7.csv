Vertigo," Hitchcock's Best
","Although it is not as stylish as PSYCHO, or as fun as NORTH BY NORTHWEST, this is Hitchcock's best picture. It is deeper than almost any other film ever made, and is complimented by an incredibly good Bernard Hermann score and great acting by James Stewart. However, I have one question: In the first 45 minutes or so in the movie, right when James Stewart is first hired to follow Kim Novak's character, who is it that he sees in the window of the old hotel? I have watched the film many times and have not been able to figure that part out. Anyway, this is a masterpiece on many levels.",10,4,5,18 June 2003
Fight Club," Flawed
","I belive that this is a film that speaks out against anarchy. Yet to a large portion of this films audience, teenagers, it does not get that message across. Most high-schoolers leave this film only remembering the insane ramblings of the god-like Brad Pitt character Tyler Durden. In that sense, this film contradicts itself. Also, I did not find this film enjoyable. Not the first time a watched it, not the second time and not the third time. Sure, I laughed a couple times and some of the fight scenes were cool, but those aspects did not make up for this cluttered picture. Plus the CG cinematography was very out of place, as it is in Fincher's superior piece, PANIC ROOM.",3,1,4,18 May 2002
Citizen Kane," Greatest Film Ever? Yes.
","CITIZEN KANE is not only what I consider the finest piece of cinema ever created, but is one of my personal favorites to watch multiple times. After you get over the fact that 'Rosebud' means nothing, you can enjoy the best cinematography ever captured. Okay, so you're not into the visual aspects of movies? Than you should enjoy the convoluted story-telling, as out-of-order as new independent-style films like PULP FICTION, and MEMENTO. The acting in this film is great (especially Joseph Cotten) and I enjoy the fact that Orson Wells was making fun of William Randolph Hearst (even though only a few parts of this film are based on Hearst's life). I can't understand how people can't admire, if not like this film. By the way, I'm in high school.",10,1,3,17 May 2002
The Birth of a Nation," Racist Yet Important
","If you do not believe that THE BIRTH OF A NATION is extremely prejudice, you are dead wrong. Similarly, if you do not believe that THE BIRTH OF A NATION virtually invented film grammar, you are dead wrong (at the very least, this picture was the most influencial film on other early film makers). There were many great moments in this film, but the idea that one white man could fight of about a half dozen men in blackface is crazy. Nevertheless, this was a milestone in history.",Null,0,2,18 May 2002
We Were Soldiers," Pretty Bad
","WE WERE SOLDIERS, as an idea, holds a lot of potential: A non-political film about the Vietnam War starring Mel Gibson. Not bad. But the film turned out as bad as it could. There were cliches after cliches found in this film, and the two montages (telegram and photograph) were horrible. Not only that, but this picture made out that the Vietcong were the military powerhouse getting their butts kicked, not the other way around which is how it was. Although I liked almost ever war movie I've seen, I despise this one.",Null,0,1,18 May 2002
Snatch," Good but Annoying
","True, SNATCH does have the wittiest situations and dialog since PULP FICTION. But even that cannot hide the fact that this film looks like a pop music video. I absolutely hated the editing style that gave us the fast motion and the idiotic introduction of every single character. And the style of narrative was a rip off of GOODFELLAS. Brad Pitt was funny, though.",4,5,12,17 May 2002
Shrek," Funniest Cartoon Ever
","There are only about 3 animated flicks that I enjoy. Of those 3, I like SHREK the best (the other 2 are FANTASIA and ROBIN HOOD). The CG for this movie was fantastic, and Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy were at the top of there game. I'm going to go beyond calling this the most hilarious animated feature, but I think this is one of the funniest films that I have seen. Ever.",9,0,1,18 May 2002
