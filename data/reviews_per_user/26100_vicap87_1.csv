Casablanca," When movies were movies.
","Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors that could say more with a look than a screenwriter could fit on three pages of a script. I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining.",10,2,3,25 August 2013
