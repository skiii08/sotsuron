Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar-Jar Binks ruined it.
","Sorry, but I'll never see this film again because of that ridiculous character, Jar-Jar Binks.  He was unnecessary.  He brought this film down to a grade-school level, when it should have been at least on a teen-age level! So frustrating!  The rest of the film was good.  Take Jar-Jar out and I'd rate it a 7.",3,1,2,10 January 2002
