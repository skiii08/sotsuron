The Incredible Hulk," Freakin' Awesome!
","Just got out of an afternoon screening and I must say I was blown away. The whole movie just rocks. I'm an Edward Norton fan, I must admit, which helped to appreciate his performance, which was akin to the TV series and he plays a fugitive on the run with deftness.The best thing about this movie was that it never once gets boring. The Hulk makes an appearance pretty soon after the opening credits (which gives us a backstory) and it's all action from then on. Don't get me wrong, there is story, but this is the ultimate in fan service, because it is a comic-book movie first and foremost and the action completely rocks.There is a very long fight scene at the end which warrants mention because of its sheer awesomeness (it never gets dull). Much better than Transformers in my opinion because Michael Bay isn't directing it and putting his brand of overthetopness on it.Tim Roth does an excellent job as Emil Blonsky/Abomination and the other actors (William Hurt and Liv Tyler) are adequate.Go and see this movie for yourself. Along with Iron Man, this movie makes it Marvel's year. I won't say 'Forget about the Dark Knight', because I'm sure that'll do Batman justice, but make sure you don't go past this re-imagining of The Incredible Hulk. It is simply awesome.",10,5,11,12 June 2008
Memento," Great thriller that gets better every time it's watched...
","It's not the ending that twists in this movie, but the outset itself is a feint within a feint within a feint - leading the viewer along the path to vengeance from the outset of the action - it's a unique vision, but the characters and director do it great justice. Christopher Nolan is just brilliant in the way he paces this movie, the scene transitions mean that the audience is up-to-date with the story as it goes, and the ending, the fascinating climax of what and why help drive this story into 'classic' status.I watched this movie recently on the advice of others, and I found that it was more than they had said it was - I'm very critical of most movies, and have found this to be right up in my top ten.Accordingly, I'm giving it 10 out of 10. I recommend it to ANYONE. Again, however, if you watch it and don't like it, that's too bad.Cheers!",10,0,3,11 April 2006
Justice League," A truly abysmal movie
","CONTAINS SPOILERSWhat a horrible piece of garbage this movie was. I watched it last night and almost cringed immediately with the terrible line 'the whip compels you to tell the truth'... Urgh...So much is wrong with this movie, it's hard to begin. Superman is hardly in it, the villain is just pathetic, the acting is wooden and the effects are pathetic.I knew going into the movie that there was going to be some funny looking CGI on Superman's upper lip. Little did I know that the CGI department was entirely made-up of kids doing their work-experience and rushing to get the project done in a hurry. Actually, that sums up the whole movie - it felt rushed. There were bits missing to the story that were something that you could feel - it was tonally all-over-the-place, with Snyderisms and Wheldonisms not cohesively offsetting one another. Add to the fact that they introduced and then proceeded to play out the baddie in one movie (forgiving that Steppenwolfe was alluded to in a deleted scene in BvS), then you have a hodgepodge of a movie which undoes all the good work that Wonder Woman did earlier in the year. Yes, it really is that bad. Aquaman IS a dude-bro. Cyborg is a lifeless, terrible character with an actor who can't act and Flash is all-over-the-place, a terrible take on the character who amounts to so little as to be almost inconsequential to the outcome of the film. The best moment in the entire films is when Superman nearly hits him in a fit of rage. I was praying for him to connect, as it would have turned the flash into a puff of fine red mist, which would have made this interminable film interesting for a second. Indeed, a weak-point in the earlier movies, Superman doesn't get enough screen-time here, and he clearly outshines the other characters to a degree which renders them pretty much useless. Batman basically whinges about being old the whole time and nearly dies after one punch from the man-of-steel, which is actually pretty damn fair enough.To say that they failed here would be an understatement. This movie is a catastrophic failure, on every conceivable level. There is no redeeming quality to it, it puts the superhero mega-team movies back by six years, it is so much less than the Avengers which came out in 2012, remember... That movie had a lot of back-story going into it, and its payoff was worth it. This movie is a rushed, waste of time and money. I really don't like writing negative reviews, I loved the Punisher for its brutality and take on the character. That took some time to put together and it shows in a very binge-worthy story. This movie, however, is rushed to the point that every aspect of it feels shoehorned in. As for the flowers springing from the roots that have been spread by the Unity (stupid name by the way), they are clearly going to spread poisonous gas and kill everyone. What a dumb thing to do at the end...I hated this movie. 1 star.",1,8,20,25 November 2017
