Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad George
",Only one problem with this film; George seems to think that just because he owns ILM he should use CGI to the max. The battle at the end between the Gungans and the Droids looks like a computer game. Apart from that it was excellent and I've already seen it twice since it came out last week,Null,0,0,21 July 1999
