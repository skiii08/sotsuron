Casablanca," Perhaps the Most Powerful scene ever
","Casablanca is a film which must be seen in context. It was made in 1942 at the height of the war, and many of the film's actors are actual refugees. As for real heartfelt film emotion, I will take the scene with the dueling anthems of Germany and France against any other. The scene captures the humanity of hope and pride. It is a symbol of the never say die attitude which would help to win the war (which in '42 was very much in question). The scene is among the greatest artistic achievements of the 20th century.",10,1,1,22 July 1999
