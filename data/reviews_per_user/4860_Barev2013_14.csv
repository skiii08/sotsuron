The Monuments Men," Not exactly Monumental but Worth a watch
","George Clooney's Monuments Men, Has been universally savaged in the German press (which I read regularly -- mainly the feulliton and kultur pages -- five daily newpapers!) -- and all Germans I have talked with about it personally, disliked it on various 'film critical' grounds ~ typical clever comment: 'CLooney is a better actor than a director' ~ ho- ho, Now ain't that clever... But, I liked it -- not as any profound oeuvre du cinema, but as straight forward Hollywood star entertainment about a very interesting subject -- period -- With good period reconstruction to boot. It's a typical sincere Clooneyesque attempt to make a 'meaningful picture' for the general public and simultaneously inform about a little known sideline story of WW II --- namely, the plundering of classic art by the Nazi pigwigs -- not that this subject hasn't been taken up before in other films -- but it nevertheless remains little known -- Okay, this is nowhere near the level of Clooney's study of E.R. Murrow 'Good night and good luck' (Very well directed and acted!) -- but it isn't bad and it is a well structured piece of WW II entertainment in which you get to see a lot of familiar quality actors like John Goodman and Bill Murray in unfamiliar roles, plus, the WW II military costumery -- the period reconstruction, etc. With which I happen to very familiar, was very well done --so, in general : A Pretty good piece of historical entertainment .... In this writer's humble opinion, what the Germans really didn't like about this picture is the fact that it once again reminds the massive international public which is the automatic following of George Clooney, about just one more aspect of the collective criminality of the German People during those years ... I am sure that many Germans who on the surface dis-identify with the Nazis still, deep down, feel that Germany was 'entitled' to the spoils of war after the humiliation of Versailles, 1919 -- in other words -- ahem, ahem -- and mind you, I like this country and have numerous personal friendships with all kinds of Germans - - I am convinced that a bit of admiration for Hitler and latent Naziism still lurks in the collective subconscious of this proud Merkelian nation -- including in the minds of many who are truly anti-Nazi and ashamed of how the Nazis besmirched the reputation of this country forever, in spite of Goethe, Beethoven, Wagner (!!) and all those other Geniuses who gave Germany such a high international rating ...prior to WW II -- The operative factor in terms of Collective Mentality -- is -- collective SHAME! .. And corresponding painful guilt feelings that need to be washed away! The Germans -- at least any German who has a shred of a conscience (gewissen) -- cannot help but feel some kind of shame deep down, because many Young Germans alive and active today in the New Germany -- still have -- like it or not --- grandfathers, grand- uncles, grand aunts and etcetera -- some of THEM -- still alive and kicking -- who were Concentration Camp guards and overseers, and Einsatz Gruppen members (common soldiers whose job it was to follow the main Wehrmacht east and 'mop up after them' ) -- by simply mass murdering every Jew they could find -- old men women and children -- and these were ordinary Germans -- bank tellers and grocery store clerks in everyday life -- who willingly signed up for mass murder of innocent civilians even if they were not exactly card carrying Nazis. --- --- The bottom line is that a certain Nazi mentality is deeply embedded in the collective German mind, even today, although most good Germans would hate to admit it -- but it comes out indirectly, when the mass of Germans, whether film critics directly in print, or regular film goers who just love American movies -- feel a necessity ~~ yes, I would call it a necessity -- to condemn a movie like 'Monuments Men' on (ahem) technical grounds ... When what they are really condemning is the constant reminders of the unbelievably gigantic crimes of their Immediate ancestors -- while not one word is ever said about the actual plundering their uncles and grandfathers committed in the name of The Greater Glory of Deutschland Über Alles ... And that's mah rooling -- Judge Roy Beane, Berlin. Feb. 21. 2014",7,0,0,7 December 2014
In Bruges," Spellbinding Breathtaker in Beautiful Belgian city
","The 'Titanic' international film festival, Budapest's new 'tough guy on the block' and the only real rival to the annual Hungarian Film Week (Magyar Filmszmele) for the attention of the large film buff community here, closed shop on April 13, 2009, with the screening of a spellbinding new Irish thriller 'In Bruges', and a closing gala party that lasted far into the night.The closing film 'In Bruges' was another eye-opener. Directed by Martin McDonagh and set almost entirely in the beautiful Belgian canal city of Bruges, this is one where it's hard to tell whether it's a violent comedy, or a spoof on violence, or a comical violence film about two hard-boiled Irish hit men on the lam in Belgium. Our hero, handsome Irish charmer Colin Farrell, sporting a heavy growth of five-o'clock shadow throughout and constantly lamenting the fact that he accidentally killed a little boy, is not above punching out a lady in a restaurant or karate chopping a poor midget who gets on his nerves -other than that he's quite lovable. Ralph Fiennes (the onetime 'English Patient'), comes in for possibly the most brutal role he's ever played as the obsessed vengeful father of the departed lad, and Irish actor Brendan Gleeson (a veteran of the Harry Potter films) is also quite charming as the avuncular partner in crime of young Farrell. Guns galore and drugs like cocaine and LSD are taken for granted in this colorful criminal saga, and the city of Bruge itself is shown in its full glory, day and night. The music, incidentally, is extremely subtle with a quiet piano playing soothingly in the background of some of the most violent scenes. Very good music in its own right, and compliments to composer Carter Burwell, who does the music for all Coen Brothers flicks among others. Winding up with a breathtaking chase through the cobblestone streets of Bruges at night and a shootout on the canal, 'In Bruges' literally leaves you gasping for breath and needing a drink... and realizing that, whatever it was about, you just had one helluva romp and laughed a lot. The perfect bookend for a modest film festival in a major east-European capital.",10,0,4,15 December 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious rewriting of history as it should have been
","'Tarantino's INGLOURIOS BURSTERDS' by Alex Deleon for August 26, 2009I have never been a great Quentin Tarantino fan (I hated 'Pulp Fiction' and walked out of 'Reservoir Dogs') but right off the bat I will have to say that even if he doesn't get an Oscar this year, Mr. Q. should at least get a medal – the Congressional Medal of Honour (of Poland and Israel?) – for telling it like it should have been, even if it wasn't quite actually that way. Any person of Jewish persuasion who does not stand up and cheer at various points in this tremendous historical revision comedy isn't worth his (or her) weight in schmaltz. And any Gentile person of liberal democratic red blood who doesn't let out a few whelps of 'Amen', or 'right on', during the proceedings, needs to be taken out into the alley and shot in the head.The basic plot: A merciless vengeance unit composed mainly of Jewish commandos under the leadership of a delightfully southern drawling Lt. Brad Pitt (best thing he's ever done!) is parachuted into Nazi occupied France in 1941, their mission, to strike total terror into the hearts of all Germans by not only brutally slaughtering every German soldier they can get their hands on, but scalping them American Indian style, bashing their brains out with baseball bats (another all-American touch) and carving swastikas into the foreheads of their victims. One such swasticated German soldier is purposely let go so that he can take his tale of terrorization back to the Fuhrer hisself. Der Fuhrer (Adolph Hitler) is tellingly portrayed as a frenzied madman who does everything but literally chew up a rug (Supporting actor contender in my book) when he sees what these stop-at-nothing 'Basterd' vigilantes are doing to his pure Aryan troopers. Propaganda minister Goebbels also comes in for significant treatment in a film almost as good in its portrayal of Nazi pageantry and evil as Istvan Szabo's 'Mephisto' in heavy reverse gear.The plot, told in five well defined chapters, is far too complicated to unravel in a mini-review such as this, but it's all about getting good and even with the Germans for their well-known collective brutality and genocide policies. Suffice it to say that all the krauts get what they deserve in the end and just about every one of the many twisted and complex roles in the film are tossed off to perfection. Very fetching is one of the heroines, Madeleine Laurent, as 'Shoshana Dreyfus', a French blonde Jewish girl whose whole family was murdered by the Germans and who is hell bent on revenge no matter what the cost. (and does she ever get it!). Equally fetching and outstanding is blonde German actress Diane Kruger as a conspiring anti-Hitler German actress who will get herself unceremoniously strangled by Herr Oberst Waltz for her glourios underground efforts. Kruger, interestingly, was Helen to BradPitt's Hercules in 'Troy' some seasons back, where she was little more than Teutonic window dressing, but here she has come a long way as an actress and is most cleverly employed by Quentin.Of exceptional note in this delicious international cast is German Actor Christof Waltz who very nearly steals the show as a smooth-talking tri-lingual Gestapo officer, almost as charming and suave as he is evil and cruel. Nearly half of the film is actually spoken in German and French, (with and without sub-titles) which adds a touch of class and authenticity, giving a realistic semi-serious edge to this basically surreal black comedy. Bunuel would have loved it and, even though it does get a wee bit talky here and there between scalpings and other instances of arch mayhem, I found the film extremely satisfying -- in short loved it. My only complaint was that there were not enough juicily explicit scalpings (since at the beginning unit commander Brad, half-Apache, tells his men that each one is expected to bring a minimum of 100 German scalps home, or die trying) -- and in the final inferno, where a full house of high-ranking Nazis (including Hitler, Goering and Martin Borman – just follow the white arrows) and their women folk are locked into a French cinema which is then set on fire – (remember that a favourite way of getting rid of Jews in WW II without wasting bullets was to lock them in a synagogue and then burn it down) -- we don't actually get to see them roasting alive in dynamic close-ups. What was needed here was a walk-on by Robert Duvall doing a variation on his Apocalypse Now theme –'When I smell German flesh burning it smells like .. sniff-sniff ... VICTORY!' – and some lingering closeups of roasting live red German meat dripping juicily in the flames. All I can say to anybody who stumbles onto this review is, forget about the BS the critics have been writing to show how deftly they can dissect a truly joyous and educational film to death. Just get out there and see this bloody movie – or we'll break your laigs – and take the whole family too, because this is definitely family fare of the highest order. Not to be missed if you like movies that tell it like it should have been .... and you can take that to the bank!Grokked at ODEON Muswell Hill, London, Tues.

Shutter Island," Scorcese On a roll -- straight down the Drain ...P. U.
","World Premier viewed on Valentine's Day, 2010 at the Berlin Film Festival. A U.S Marshal investigates the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane. 'Shutter Island'-- should be shut down quick before it escapes... Scorcese's SHUTTER ISLAND is a P.U. (it stinks!) production from Paramount, a picture to commit suicide over immediately after use. But Sir Ben Kingley and the Swedish Angel of Death, Max Van Sydow have at last found their ecological niches in cinema history -- as -- uncompromising ultimate GHOULS! I would have ankled this piece of unmitigated water torture after thirty minutes, but being wedged into a balcony seat at the Friedrichstadt Palast theater and unable to extrude my body without disturbing the whole balcony, I was condemned to suffer through the entire torture session to the bitter end. I did try to close my eyes and think of other things a few times, but even that didn't help much. This is pure unadulterated insanity and mindfuck without a letup. The music selections by Mahler, John Adams, John Cage, and others of the Depressia Profunda School, were carefully chosen to provide the film with a certain intellectual cachet, while enhancing the mood of endless misery with a No Way Out conclusion. In the film the exceedingly creepy doctor Kingsley and his Frankenstein like syringe clutching crony, Von Sydow, on the Evil Island where experimental Nazi type brain operations are going on, are trying to convince Govt cop Dicaprio that he has lost his mind, and finally succeed in doing so --but by this time the audience has also been driven pretty much gaga as well.Mr. Scorcese is obviously trying to outdo Kubrick in 'The Shining', but where the Shining had some shining moments, lots of verve, and a bit of a sense of humor, this extended piece of dark mumbo-jumbo has no redeeming moments, no verve or social value whatsoever, certainly no sense of humor, and plods relentlessly on and on aiming for the jugular vein of the mind. This all only goes to prove that Mr Scorcese could probably use a complete brain transplant himself before carrying on. He shoulda thrown in the towel after Raging Bull, but he is apparently too much in thrall with his 'great Hollywood director' image to know when it's time to quit. (He did say he was ready to quit a few films ago, but has sadly reneged on this promise). 'Shutter Island' (or, The Isle of Ultimate Ghouls) was definitely one to ruin Anybody's Valentines Day. I needa drink! The location of the film is, incidentally, a Devil's Island type islet off the coast of Massachusetts which will probably not do much for tourism next summer.",1,4,10,9 April 2015
Interstellar," back To The Future reloads with a Bigger budget
","INTERSTELLAR. Back to the Future, reloaded with a bigger budget image1.jpegINTERSTELLAR: viewed at Berlin Sony Ctr. Cinemaxx, FEB. 2015-- Cutting edge pseudoscience from Christopher Nolan. Nolan is noted for making wannabe sophisticated big budget big star films with big special effects that bedazzle the masses but don't hold up to serious scrutiny. interstellar is a perfect example. In this one Nolan plays around with advanced notions of theoretical physics and cosmology such as Einstein's Space-Time Relativity and wormholes leading into parallel universes. To lend authority to this exalted wool pull he has consulted with noted Cal Tech physicist Kip Thorne, the go-to scientist for serious reflection on wormholes and possible other universes. What emerges is a pot-pouring of cutting edge wild ideas not too convincingly thrashed through the cosmic mix-master and coupled with a Back to the Future Midwest farm family back story that is fairly entertaining if you don't think about it too hard and just call it Science Fantasy, like Nolans other pictures. Last years Best Actor Oscar winner, Matthew McConnaughry, is back from his winning cowboy with Aids turn to star as a good ole country boy farmer who happens to do a little astronaughting on the side. He is engaged by a most unlikely Michael Csine (-think Alfie-) in the role of a super scientist leading an ultra-secret interstellar project designed to find a new inhabitable planet for the remains of mankind to escape to, because as we learned from the early scenes back on the farm, the Earth is in the final stages of environmental collapse.The reason Caine's project is so tiptop secret is that they don't want to set off a global panic on our dying planet.Well, to make a very long story short Mac goes off in search of an appropriate wormholes way out there in the greater interstellar beyond accompanied by a beautiful co scientist on board (Ann Hathaway) finds his wormhole, lives to tell about it, and miraculously returns to the original country homestead where he finds that due to Einsteinian relativistic time bending he is now younger than his grandchildren. (e =mc2!) In Part II maybe a few surviving earthlings will be shipped out to beyond the wormhole to carry on the propagation of our species on an exoplanet that is not dying. The details of how this is all worked out would require a report longer than the picture itself. But I must say that, at a commercial screening with a German audience, I was mildly amused and even found Mr. McConnaughry, whom I normally cannot stand, passably acceptable in a role that suits him. Old time actor John Lithgow was gramps in the rocking chair on the porch.Give it five stars out of ten for half speed (Half Fast Science)",5,1,4,23 April 2015
American Sniper," Eastwood takes America on a tour of the Shock Corridor
","American SNIPER ~~ Viewed at Cinestar Berlin, March 5, 2015. It's,hard to tell whether Bradley Cooper as hero Chris Kyle --- is a sharp shooting junkie, just addicted to war, an unflagging American patriot, or maybe all three. In any case, a very strong but restrained Oscar worthy performance to say the least. As a Navy Seal trained super-sniper using state-of-the-art sniper equipment he volunteers for four consecutive hazardous combat missions in Iraq leaving his little children and constantly pregnant wife behind in small town Texas. The film opens with a scene of the superstar sniper viewing an Iraqi woman clad in black robes with a little boy at her side suspended in his cross-hairs. His finger is on the trigger as he carefully draws a bead, but -- a doting new father himself back home as we will soon find out -- he is anything but eager to gun down a defenseless civilian woman and a child. However, this is not just any innocent civilian woman and any child. The woman slips a bomb concealed in her robes to the boy and whispers something in his ears ~~ obviously instructions to run at the American armored car and soldiers down the street in a glorious kamikaze attack, kill a few of them and go to Heaven. BAM! The boy goes Down as the bomb falls harmlessly aside. The woman tries to retrieve the bomb to complete the suicide mission. BAM again -- That takes care of her as well -- with a big blotch of blood up against the wall. We then get the back story of how Kyle was trained as a boy by his father in the art of hunting with a rifle, how he grew up in the macho atmosphere of Rodeo bronc-busting and met his future wife during Seal training at a lowdown local saloon. Heavy duty physical training on the beach prepare the Seal volunteers for the arduous tasks ahead. Quick no- nonsense marriage. Off to Battle.MIssion One. Back to the cross-hairs and the grim mission in a battered Iraqi city constantly under attack by Guerrilla Arab defenders. In an action to find Al-Zaqari, ruthless head of the Al-Qaeda enemy, Kyle and his cohorts ruthlessly roust civilian Arab families in their homes. In one seemingly ordinary household a stash of bombs and weapons is found concealed under the floorboards. One Iraqi father is ruthlessly gunned down by fellow Arabs for 'talking with the enemy'. This is a ruthless war on both sides of the fence. House to house and room to room -- no glorious battlefield vistas. Endless fierce shootouts ensue that make the Okay Corral look like a Girl Scouts picnic. From the scene of battle Kyle often chats with his anguished wife back home via cell phone. All she wants is for him to come home to his family. All he wants, it seems, is to keep shooting down more of the enemy. Big question: Who needs him more ~~ His country or His family? After a particularly furious battle -- in overpowering red darkness filling the screen for many minutes, Kyle has had enough and yells to his wife on the phone over the din that he is COMING HOME -- this time for good. At home he is obvious rattled by his lurid war experiences. He volunteers to assist other crippled and traumatized Iraqi war veterans in recovery. On February 2, 2013, one such veteran shoots him dead. Almost as big a shock as all that has gone before! The denouement of the film is the memorial service for Kyle with a stadium in Texas named after him. Lots of American flags but not waving too strongly. The end credits roll before a stunned German audience. Nobody leaves until the lights go up. A powerful non-judgemental Clint Eastwood Judgement. The American Gun Dream reconsidered. If anybody, Dirty Harry should know. Alex, BerlinPS: Do you bleeding liberal punks out there feel lucky?",9,34,63,6 March 2015
Gone with the Wind," Frankly, Scarlett -- He DID give a damn ...
","GONE WITH THE WIND, MGM, 1939 IMG_1251.JPG IMG_1251.JPG GONE With The Wind' is so famous, probably the most famous motion picture of all time, that the initials alone GWTW are enough to identify it, yet, how many people alive today have ever seen it, not chopped up on the boob tube, but uncxut on a full size screen — undoubtedly very few. One of the most rewarding side bars of this years 65th Berlin Film Festival was the restored Technicolor Section in cooperation with MoMA of New York City, and the Eastman Kodak Archive in Rochester, N.Y. Among the many choice offerings a totally restored print, fifteen minute musical preamble and all, with 15 minute intermission at the halfway mark, of 'Gone With The Wind', the magnificent silver screen wonder of 1939 ~1940. I had seen it so long ago that I needed a refresher on the plot — Scarlett such a scheming bitch and Gable such a cool cad, Both negative characters you can't help being charmed by and rooting for both even through they are pitted against each other in a towering knock-down drag-out love-hate relationship. I had forgotten that Gable actually marries Leigh and they have a child together who gets killed in a horse jumping accident before their horrified eyes. Of course everyone remembers Gable's famous last line: 'Frankly Scarlet — I don't givva Damn! '' – but how many can recall the context? ~ It was in reply to Scarlett pleading with him not to leave her, after giving him nothing but heartache and two-timings all along — claiming that now at Long Last with the death of their child she realizes that she really loves Him — (Not wimpy high-minded Ashley Wilkes) — and exclaims pitifully as he is about to walk off: 'What will I do with out you!!' — to which GABLE's memorable last line finally puts her in her place. It is well worth noting that in 1939 'Damn' was regarded as a such a strong expletive that It barely got past the damn Puritannical censors of the time! ~~ Today he could say: I don't give a flying f**k' – and in our oversaturated four letter word world it wouldn't be half as shocking.A marvelous experience to see Gone With The Wind in all its blazing glory here in Berlin. But, what struck me Most about It in retrospect was how similar the central love triangle between Gable, Vivian Leigh (The all time most beautiful and alluring silver screen bitch!)– and Leslie Howard, was — nearly a perfect parallel to: Bogart, Bergman, and Paul Henreid, in CASABLANCA — So similar, in fact, that one can't help thinking that the writers of Casablanca were simply reapplying a tried and true box-office formula just three years later, updated, of course, from the Civil War to World War II then raging in North Africa. With uncanny serendipity, only weeks after the premiere of Casablanca the big three allied leaders, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin met at Casablanca to decide the postwar fate of Europe.Come to think of It Gable as Bogart, Vivian Leigh As Bergman, and Howard as wimpy high Minded Hero Victor Laszlo, would have been almost as good a cast for the B/W Curtiz pop Masterpiece. Curiously enough actor Leslie Howard was Shot down by the Nazis on a flight from Gibraltar not far from Casablanca which was thought to be carrying Winston Churchill in June 1943 — just as the film Casablanca was becoming the box office sensation of the year back in the states.",10,8,12,31 March 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Visual Vaudeville: All Star Variety Show is a Barrel of Fun!
","Grand BUDAPEST Hotel, Berlin, Friday February 7, 2014. The big opening film of the 64th Berlin Film Festival was the world premiere of the much ballyhooed 'GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL' which has nothing to do with Budapest or Hungary but is set in a mythical European country that could be Hungary, (with some Polish Signs) and is populated with a prestige all star cast: Ralph Fiennes as a hotel concierge in a thirties full buttons outfit like Johnny the bellhop who used to sail through the Philip Morris hotel lobby shouting 'call for Phil-lipp Maw-aw-rey', Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, and a staggering lineup of other names Adrien Brody (The Pianist), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Ed Norton, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe, F. Murray Abraham (remember him from Amadeus, 1984?) — plus French stars Mathieu Amalric and Léa Seydoux — wow! How'd he get 'em all to sign up? Directed by Wes Anderson who can be counted on for absurd comical romps and is a favored son of this festival with previous entries such as 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' (the biggest bore of 2004) and 'The Royal Tennenbaums' starring an obviously disgruntled Gene HackmanGBH was far more fun than I expected it to be judging from certain mixed opinions that have come my way. I would play it as a double feature with Kubrick's 'The Shining' for the contrastive use of an old Grand Hotel settings and for opposite cinematic purposes --- Fear and Fun! And then throw in the old Greta Garbo Grand Hotel itself... Director Wes Anderson who is no newcomer to the Berlinale, has marshaled every visual technique in the book to come up with a piece of Visual Vaudeville that is really lots of fun if not exactly too coherent -- but then why should an all-star Variety Show-- which is exactly what Budapest Hoteĺ is -- be anything but flippy and fun?Part of the fun is trying to identify extremely well known actors in makeup and disguises so extravagant that it makes them well nigh unrecognizable: Harvey Keitel with a shaved head and naked torso covered with funny little tattoos, Jeff Goldbloom dressed up in a wig and high collar tweeds totally away from his usual image -- only the voice gives him away - -Polanski's Pianist Oscar laureate Adrien Brody so disguised that even his prominent proboscis goes unnoticed -- on and on to the point where the viewer keeps asking him- her-who-self; 'Hey - wait a second -- wasn't that .... ?? -- altogether an hilarious off- season Halloween party and an easy sit through if not quite the most coherent motion picture of all time. On stage introducing the pic tall comedian Bill Murray in a long black coat topped off with some kind of boxy black hat, and a regular presence in Wes Anderson pictures, told the Friedrich Palast audience categorically, in patented Murrayesque manner, 'This is the best picture Wes has ever made. Don't even bother looking at the other competition Pictures -- This one is it!'Wes Anderson's 'Grand Budapest Hotel' is indeed one of the 23 entries competing for the prestigious Berlin Golden Bear award at the end of the fully packed ten days coming up. Whether Mr. Murray's broad statement turns out to be a fulfilled prophecy is an open question -- but nobody can deny that everybody had lots of fun tonight, and the Sixty- Fourth Berlin Film Festival is off and running ~~ Fasten your seat belts and enjoooooy! -- or else!PS: The grand opener, Wes Anderson's 'Grand Budapest Hotel' was awarded the so called 'Grand Jury Prize' which seems to be some kind of special recognition (booby prize?) for a film that should have won the Golden Bear Best Film award but was too good for its own good at this politically inclined festival which prefers to recognize obscure films from the Twilight Zones of the inscrutable East whenever possible.The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.Ps: Żubrowka is the name of a popular brand if Polish Vodk",10,1,3,9 April 2015
The Theory of Everything," A Lush Baroque Love Story Turns into a Medical Nightmare --
","A Theory of Almost Everything-- or Cosmology for Beginners. Viewed at MK2 Bibliothèque, Paris, January 26, 2015. This fervent quasi religious hagiography starts out as a tender saccharine love story in Cambridge,1963, but soon segues into a Medical Horror picture. It ultimately became an ordeal to sit through because hitherto unknown actor Eddie Redmayne got Hawking so right -- down to the last twisted tormented detail -- that it became sickening to watch after a while. If Eddie doesn't stumble off with the Best Actor Oscar this year it will be a major mystery. He should also be decorated with a Purple Heart for heavy suffering sustained in the line of duty. Felicity Jones is a revelation as the totally dedicated long suffering wife and her unwavering steadfast support needs to be recognized as well. The most curious aspect of this based-on-actual-facts tale is that, bent out of shape as he was, Hawking managed to impregnate wife Jane three times -- although the third time might have been an end run by choir master Jonathan. Apparently his brain was not the only organ spared by the onslaught of Lou Gehrig's disease. Altogether a worthy ordeal to sit through had it not been so weighed down with a ponderous musical score that felt like gravitational collapse. Plenty of heady cosmology in there for serious students of spacetime singularities and black hole leakage and a must- see for all who purchased Hawking's famous bestseller, 'A Brief History of Time' but couldn't get past page two. In the last scene at a well attended public appearance Hawking is asked whether he believes in God, After a painfully long pause he launches into a long non-committal answer and receives a standing ovation from an audience that would prefer to think he believes ~~ but we who have read his later works know he's as much of as atheist as ever ~ Thank God! Five Stars for the Lush Cinematography, but viewer Beware -- this is not about Jelly Beans! -- plus an extra two for the inclusion, however brief, of two other Important cosmologists, Dennis Sciama and Roger Penrose.Sent from my iPad",7,0,1,29 January 2015
The Imitation Game," Cracking the CODE --The smartest film of 2014
","IMITATION GAME In 1940 in the dark days following the fall of France and facing the Germans alone Britain was on the verge of collapse. The massive Luftwaffe bombardments from the air and deadly U-boat attacks at sea were coordinated by a secret military code called 'Enigma' which was considered to be of undecipherable diabolical complexity. With their fading hopes hanging on the cracking of the code an enigmatic (aloof, arrogant and homosexual) mathematician from Cambridge, Prof. Alan Turing, regarded as a very touchy eccentric genius, was recruited in desperation as a last resort to head a team of experts assembled for the top secret operation but totally stymied until then.The film deals with Turing's tenterhook relations with the high command and the conflicts with colleagues he regards as simpletons, one of whom is a a pert young women (Keira Knightley, drably dressed in wartime austerity duds, but still looking great) who steadfastly defends him and supplies moral support in moments of doubt. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch (37) is letter perfect as the irascible genius saddled with the extreme responsibility of being his country's only hope, working with people he disdains, but above all because he is basically an egomaniac, seeing the problem as the greatest intellectual challenge of his life. Director Morten Tyldum, born in Oslo, 1967, is a leading director of tight Noreegian dramas (UNO, 2008, but this is his first film in English and by the result you'd never know he isn't even an Englishman. The wartime decor, costumes, and atmosphere is so spot on it gives you the feeling of being there, not looking back, especially with the subdues low key photography and authentic English accents. Most important, even if we know what the outcome will be in the end, Tyldum skillfully maintains mounting tension every step of the way playing off of the antagonism of the others against Turing and his own frustration at failing to find the answer before it's too late.In a brilliant flash of insight Turing cracks it -- partly by realizing that the formula 'Heil Hitler' will be repeated in all messages in what looks like meaningless strings of jumbled letters. This is the high point of the desperate quest for a solution, but a second high point comes in the final act, when exposed as a homosexual, a crime in England at the time, Turing is disowned by the establishment he has just saved, and rewarded for his efforts by being offered 'chemical castration' (a new one on me!) in lieu of being sent to prison. His towering ego can only take so much of that insanity before he commits suicide, which he in fact did, in 1954 at the tragically early age of 42. A series of inscriptions at the end inform us that Turing was later retroactively rehabilitated and honored. Largely as a tribute to his memory and his key contribution to victory over Nazi Germany, thousands of homosexuals who were prosecuted during England's peak homophobic years, living and dead, have now been officially pardoned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown (2009) and Queen Elizabeth, Royal Pardon, in 2011. ( But, please Note: she was the sitting queen when Turing was royally screwed in 1954!) In a sense then, 'Imitation Game' is as much a plea against official homophobia as it is a tantalizing gripping World War II back story. Above all, Cumberbatch's performance is low key Awesome!The title stems from the fact, graphically shown throughout, that Turing had to emulate, or attempt to imitate the code, on a captured Enigma typewriter salvaged from a destroyed German U-boat. Without that simple device the task would have been impossibleComparison with 'The Theory of Everything' the story of wheelchair bound Physicist Stephen Hawking, another Cambridge genius, is all but inevitable. Both pictures came out in late 2014, both are about English geniuses from Cambridge University, both were directed by relatively unknown directors, both starred hitherto little known actors in the leading roles and had outstanding female roles in support. Both were showered with all kinds of awards in a variety of ceremonies from the British BAFTA awards to the Hollywood Oscars. Finally, both are intelligent off-mainstream productions that performed well at the world box-office anyway because of their inherent quality as entertainment. James Marsh's THEORY is over-the-top Baroque razzle-dazzle and Eddie Redmayne, as fully expected, walked off with an undisputed Oscar. In Sober contrast Tydlum's GAME is more restrained and Classic in style, but even Cumberbatch's fine-tuned Turing could not top Redmayne's gaggling Hawking. Yet I think Tydlum's sober classic is the superior film. Felicity Jones, incidentally, was terrific as Hawking's wife but Keira Knightley was not far behind as Turing's female safety blanket. In every other way Tydlum's film feels less commercial and more authentic. Theory appeals to the emotions and pulls out all the stops ~~ Game, more to the mind, but also the emotions in a more subtle way. Different strokes for different folks. Marsh had one success previously, Man on a Wire, 2008, Oscar for Best documentary feature. Redmayne figured prominently in 'My Week with Marilyn' an excellent English Film that that came and went with little notice in 2011.",10,1,5,27 March 2015
Shine," Virtuoso performance by Geoffrey Rush as a disturbed virtuoso pianist.
","Viewed at RIGA, Arsenals Forum IFF, September 20-28, 1998. SHINE (1996) written and directed by Scott Hicks stars Geoffrey Rush as an emotionally disturbed virtuoso pianist in Australia, freaked out by the impossible demands of a father who constantly abuses him with the memory of his own disturbed childhood in Europe and the loss of family in the concentration camps. The cruel father of the child prodigy pianist, passing on his genocide complex to the next generation, is heavyweight German actor, Armin Meuller-Stahl (b. 1930) who is in everything these days, and it ends with a rousing piano rendition of Rimsky-Korsakov's 'The Flight of the Bumblebee' when the hero, after a long stint in an institution, recovers his senses to some extent ... The true story of David Helfgott (may God help him) -- very absorbing with tour-de-force performance by Mr. Rush. After this he'll be in everything! (And he was).Shine was one of the big films of the year and earned Rush the Academy award for for Best Actor plus a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting role for Mueller-Stall. Also nominated for Best Picture and best Original Screenplay. It included the last screen appearance at age 82 of British born actress Googie Withers who was a big star way back in the thirties (for example, in Hitchcock's 'The Lady Vanishes'). Another elder British giant, John Gielgud, had a cameo at age 94! -- and passed away in 2000. Aussie director Scott Hicks, not very well known outside of Australia, also made 'Snow falling on Cedars', a 1999 drama with Ethan Hawke defending a wrongly accused Japanese American in a murder case during the wave of anti-Japanese prejudice in America following Pearl Harbor.",10,0,0,7 December 2014
The Departed," The biggest DUD ever to get an Oscar -- crass commercial crap
","THE DEPARTED, viewed at first Rome film Festival, October, 2006.In response to email asking if I thought this was Scorcese's big comeback after a run of flops and flubs. Wed. October 17, 2006 Ahoy, Tomasso -- Yessiree -- Life is pretty sweet here in Rome at the moment, and I'm glad you asked about Scorcese! I was just getting ready to knock out the usual cagey, diplomatic, journalistically correct (JC) review of 'The Departed' but with you, of course, I don't have to hedge my bets or pull my punches, and can tell the Truth -- the Hole Truth, and nothing but The Truth... So, for openers, the bottom line is, NO --this is not the great comeback for Scorcese -- in fact it's a regression even further back into obvious crass commercialism than was 'Aviator', which was pretty damn regressive, not to mention a pile of horseshit. To start with, both Nicholson AND Dicaprio were SEriously miscast -- The best role in the whole film is Marc Wahlberg -(fast becoming my favorite Hollywood actor) - - who should get a Purple Heart for having to give his all in the company of these phony stars who walk away with all the credit --as if there was anything creditable to speak of -- while he actually keeps this monstrosity afloat whenever he's on. The interview following the press screening was FAR more interesting than the film itself, which I found hard to actually sit out and squirm through For one thing, too much rapid artsy-fartsy inter-cutting between the parallel stories of how Dicaprio and Damon infiltrate the police department and The Mob, respectively. The whole shebang was far too intricate for a Boston based gangsta Story and shoulda 'stayed in bed', which is to say, in Hong Kong, where it started out -- and where it belongs. An exercise in glossy malarkey all around -- (Scorcese makes Good-Looking, high-GLOSS films -- even if there's no 'there' there otherwise...) and also -- according to Scorcese in the following Press Con, an exercise in 'experimentation'. Well, maybe that was the problem -- It's so Experimental that it falls apart in every other scene without ever getting it together anywhere in between. The only thing that makes it more or less tolerable are the very good supporting roles by Alec Baldwin (always good), Wahlberg (always superb), and Martin Sheen (always interesting, especially now with white hair), but there is one key supporting role that is pathetically bad --the police psychiatrist, played by an unappealing) actress by the name of Vera Farmiga. For ChrisSake -- Whoopy Goldberg would have done a much better job! This gal must be a friend of the family -- in fact the whole film feels to me like an expensive home movie made by Scorcese for and with his family and friends. The bottom Line? P. U. -- 'The Departed' sucks heavily. Glad you asked.Given the obvious star power of the main cast and the advance hype to the effect that Marty is 'back in stride doing his gangster stuff', I would be hesitant to predict that this awful picture will go under in America, but somebody watching the parade just has to come out and say it --when the king ain't wearing a single darned stitch!As for the main roles, it's maybe not so much that Jack Nicholson was miscast as an Irish Maffia don, but rather that he's gotten to be such a gigantic Ham that all he ever does anymore is imitate himself or play an old creep on constant Viagra overdose. Nevertheless, because of some sort of star-inertia principle (a moving Hollywood Box Office Force tends to keep moving in a straight line as long as money can be drained out of it), his face and name still sell tickets. Viggo Mortensen would have been more credible in the role. As for Leonardo -- well, to see the way he beats the crap out of all kinds of heavy thugs in this pic with the greatest of ease, you'd have to think he was the baddest ass who ever lived. A bare-knuckled Billy The Kid, when actually we all know he's a frail, sensitive, loving chap who wouldn't hurt a fly -- be cause he doesn't have the strength to! This all has about the same credibility level as a tubercular looking Montgomery Clift knocking John Wayne for a loop in 'Red River'. Matt Damon, the third big name in the cast, is acceptable since he's not called on to do anything but what he always does best -- a grown up hoodlum with a working-class Boston accent who wishes he could have made it to Harvard. Hate to disappoint you, pal, but let me know what you think when you get to see it -- and just remember: Never trust a film critic! -- not even me.Alex in the press room, Rome.ROME DIARY, REPORT 4 -- PRESS CONFERENCES -- AND FILM",1,1,2,3 May 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," MIRROR, MIRROR ON THE WALL -- This is no doubt The fairest of them all!
","SNOW WHITE & THE SEVEN DWARFS, 1938 Viewed at Berlin 2015 in restored Technicolor Retro series.IMG_1272.JPG THE Seven Dwarfs R~L: Sleepy, Bashful, Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy, DOPEY — Find Snow White asleep in their cottageMIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL Who is Fairest of them all? — The Mother of all Animation. The beautiful queen's beauty is exceeded only by her vanity So she needs to be reassured every day that She is the most beautiful female in the realm. Of this her magic all-seeing mirror reminds her daily until one day  Nope — not anymore Babe –your own step daughter, Snow White has now emerged from puberty and puts you to shame in terms of pure pulchritude. Oh NO!!- gotta get rid of that pert little bitch. Woodsman, take her out in the forest and do her in! But woodsman doesn't have the heart to bump lovely Innocent maiden off so he turns her loose and claims the wolves got her. But of course they didn't –So with all the friendly forest animals and birds — prancing fawns and flitting lovebirds — taking her under their wings (incredibly beautiful animation sequence) — they lead her to the cottage of the seven dwarfs who whistle while they work merrily in the nearby mines. (their cheerful songs kick in all of which became instant pop hits ~ Heigh ho, Heigh ho — it's off to work we go — etc.) — and the dwarfs each representing a certain state of mind or human foible — became stars on their own: HAPPY, Doc, Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, Grumpy and, last but not least, lovable Dopey. This was the first movie I ever saw at age six and I identified strongly with Dopey. Now it becomes a little horror film. The evil queen changes herself into a most scary witch and coming to the cottage in disguise as a friendly old hag offers blissfully naive Snow White the poison apple that puts her into a state of deathlike Suspended Animation — (pun intended) — The horrified dwarfs think she is dead and enshrine her in a class coffin and there she stays suspended until Prince Charming comes along and pulls her out if it with the fateful kiss of pure love –whereupon all Live happily ever after.Anybody who can resist the visual beauty and magical charm of this mother of all animations, can only be the ultimate grump and should be put out of his misery with a poisoned apple — Disney's clean cut cartooning style is like Rembrandt to Peanuts in comparison to successor animation styles in terms of rendering skill and grace of image movement. The ultimate genius of the genre his Snow White is Evergreen and continues to out-dwarf the competition Seven and a half decades after it first appeared. Pure joy if you ever get a chance.",10,1,1,31 March 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Abominable: Iñarritu should be shipped back over the border
","BIRDMAN, Or (the unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) -- (Or, The Pained μεταμόρφωσις of Batman) Dir. Alejandro Iñarritu, 2014The metamophosis of Batman -- a Painful experience: A washed-up actor, who once played an iconic superhero, battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career and himself in the days leading up to the opening of his new Broadway play.Academy Awards, 2015 (for films of 2014) Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography. My Awards: WORST in the First three categories; Pass on the Fourth. (Cinematography) But, Thank God KEATON was scratched in Favorite of Eddie Redmayne (Theory of Everything) which indicates that the Oscar voting committee is not entirely composed of imbeciles.Iñarritu's BIRDMAN is a stylishly overblown over-acted over-directed over-praised and over-awarded P.o.C. (Piece of Crap) that bites off far more than it can chew. Yes, of course Actor Michael Keaton is geared up for and delivers a High decibel change of pace reflecting his own flagging career; the special effects crew are working overtime, the writers are reaching for the rarified atmosphere of All About Eve, and the photography is State of the Art, but the overall result is an annoying screecher that rings false at every turn, except for the one True Scene, when Hawkman goes flying out the window in the only sequence that rings a little true to the falseness of all the rest. The whole idea of this giant stuffed bird having once been a Successful Hollwood Superhero is soaking wet -- just plain bad concept -- and the supporting cast, from usually believable Ed Norton on down, is a study in strained 'good acting' -- actually the result of phony bad direction. Above all, who wants to watch an unattractive middle aged actor screaming his way through an actual Mid-career Mid-life crisis for two over-strained hours? Lots of people obviously did considering the box-office returns, which in my view merely reflects the fact that we live in an Age of High Anxiety where one of the main functions of film is to provide audiences with a safe arena in which to unload theirs fears and anxieties without paying high psychiatric fees whilst under the delusion that they are being entertained. There, I've said it. I did not find Iñarritu's flamboyantly fatuous Birdman the least bit entertaining -- from the pretentious secondary title, 'The unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' to the bitter End -- nothing but highly annoying and a drag all the way. A tribute to Ignorance of good taste. Saying this film is 'for the birds' is actually an insult to the honest birdlike intelligence of birds.Pass thus up and checkout Birdman of Alcatraz, or better yet, Hitchcock's THE BIRDS! Bottom Line: Non-stop inauthenticity strictly for The Birds: Iñarritu should be shipped back over the border.",1,8,17,10 April 2015
