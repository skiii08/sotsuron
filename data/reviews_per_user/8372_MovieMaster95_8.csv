The Expendables 2," Dear Mr. Stallone, why do you like to disappoint me so?
","So my reaction to the first Expendables was very lukewarm. I liked the fact that Stallone was bringing back all these action stars to come together in some epic ensemble movie. But sadly, it failed to really excite me as a huge action movie buff. The action was poorly shot and the whole thing felt rushed. Still, I was excited to see what Stallone would do for the sequel. Maybe it would be better.Alas, I was wrong. This was another disappointment. It started out good with some over-the-top action and plenty of good old fashioned silliness but sadly the plot showed up. The plot (if you can call it that) is a 'done to death' revenge plot where one of the crew members is killed (just before he retired) so the team go out of there way to hunt down evil Jean Claude Van Damme to kill him. Just good old fashioned family fun. Speaking of Van Damme, he's easily one of the best parts of the movie. I've alway found Van Damme to be somewhat charismatic and he's really good a playing a sinister baddie. It's just a shame he gets so little screen time.The rest of the movie is just the team moving from one action scene to the next. The action has is shot in a much better way when compared to the first film but unfortunately, there are fewer memorable moments. And what's with all the CG gore. Give me some real blood squibs Stallone, stop being lazy. They meet up with Chuck Norris at one point, which is fun but also pointless. I like the fact that he spoofs his own internet persona but that BS about him censoring the swearing is still an issue. So swearing is bad, but killing people in over-the-top violent ways is fine?Then there's the climax, which honestly I had the most problems with. Like the original film, it felt rushed. It should be really cool seeing Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Willis gunning down baddies together but it ends up not being too memorable. There are some cool moments, like Arnie ripping the door off a car and then proceeding to shoot a ton of enemies while Willis drives. Speaking of Arnie, he's another great part of the movie, just because of how corny and terrible his delivery is. Believe me, I love the guy, he's my childhood hero but I can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it is to see him doing his 'Commando' routine at his age.Then there's the fight between Stallone and Van Damme. What a letdown. Stallone's ego seems to be in action here, since for the most part, he has the upper hand. Van Damme only manages to hit him a few times with his trademark helicopter kicks. But eventually, Stallone kills Van Damme. And then the worst part of the movie. Stallone cutting off Van Damme's head and putting it in a bag. WHAT? Remember in the first Expendables movie where everyone thought Dolph Lungdren hanging the pirates was 'sick'. But now it's okay to cut off an already dead man's head and carry it around in a bag. It's overly sadistic and made the character out to be a complete psychopath. Anyway overall the movie is 'meh'. Really nothing special aside from the cast. And like the original, the cast is still not used effectively. This should be a love letter from Stallone to every action fan including myself. But it ends up just being nothing special and kind of dull in a lot of ways. The movie has its moments but that doesn't stop the direct to DVD feel I get from it. And after watching the other disappointment that was 'Bullet to the Head', I've lost all enthusiasm for Stallone's work. Expendables 3 is on the way and honestly, I don't care.",3,0,0,29 November 2013
The Expendables," Sadly Disappointing from Stallone's 80's revival
","First let me say that I love the action genre especially those from 80's and most of the 90's. Back when action films were for adult audiences and were brutal, bloody and had high body counts. Nowadays however, action movies are a lot more family friendly, with bloodless action, few swear words, over use of CG and an annoying shaky cam.But when I heard Stallone (The star of Rambo) was going to make a big cheesy, 80's style action film with an ensemble cast, I couldn't be happier. When I finally went to see the film however I was sadly disappointed.I was hoping for a simple plot, with an awesome team, an over the top villain (Unless Dolph Lundgren counts), cheesy one liners and old school action scenes. Sadly the film only briefly delivers...The plot is just a bunch of terrorism propaganda which is very incoherent, Stallone and Statham seem to be the only characters the film focuses on, no memorable villain, not enough one liners (and some weren't even that good) and as for the action. It delivered on the gore but it was shot with a shaky cam and too many quick cuts which makes it almost impossible to tell what's going on. I was expecting a 'Predator' like film with a lovable team just wielding huge guns, killing bad guys and spouting quotable one liners.The action is still quite fun at moments and very explosive, but I just wish it was shot the same way something like 'Commando' was filmed. The only scene that reached my expectations was the cameo scene with Schwarzenegger and Willis which is short but sweet. I don't really recommend 'The Expendables' but if Stallone hopes to make another, I hope he does a little history on classic cinema before so. Don't listen to those who say it's the 'Greatest Action Film Ever' as their are far better films that deserve that rank.",4,17,35,3 October 2010
Predator," Manliest Film Ever Made!!!
","Huge guns, Huge tough guys, macho dialogue, funny banter, One liners and an Alien. John McTiernan's 1987 classic 'Predator' is a action fans dream and a true guys film. What's not to like? Quick setup. Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of bad-asses are sent to the South American jungles to rescue a group of POW's from an enemy hideout. Simple enough, but that's before they start getting picked off by a hunter from another planet. The rest of the movie relies on suspense, an over the top macho atmosphere and a entertaining team.John McTiernan's style of creating a believable atmosphere shines out through the characters and dialogue. Every member of the rescue team is memorable and likable due to their humorous dialogue and over the top macho-ism. Dutch chomping on cigars, Blain wielding a mini gun, Mac shaving with his own sweat and Billy's huge knife are all examples of the manliness portrayed in the film.The Predator is great in its first portrayal, brought to life thanks to Stan Winston's incredibly lifelike effect. His gadgets and weaponry stay cool and interesting right until the end. One of the things that make the film interesting is watching the team come up with new ways to kill this creature that's picking them off like flies.The film is filled with memorable quotes and scenes that will linger in your mind any time you think of masculinity. Any fan of action or Schwarzenegger will know this is a must see and one of the quintessential 80's flicks. A true guys film that teaches us that 'If it bleeds, we can kill it' and Guns + Muscles + One liners + An Alien = Manliest Film Ever. Highly Recommended",9,1,1,23 October 2010
Man of Steel," Just an all around unpleasant experience
","This movie is jaw dropping at how bad it is. How could they mess up a Superman movie this badly? It's borderline comedy. I'm half expecting Snyder to just come out and say 'We were joking, the real Superman movie is here.' But no, this is the final product. This is the movie many are giving 10 out of 10s. And for what? A stupid and ugly film with no value of worth. Let's start with the characters shall we. All of them are bland. All of them. First off, Cavill. I liked him. He seems to be doing the best of what the poor script will give him. He's tall, handsome, has a good voice and could have made a great Superman. Too bad he wasn't given one. I don't mind a movie that shows the darker side of being Superman, but at the end of the day, I want to be uplifted by his presence. Compare him to Reeve, who swoops us off our feet just as easily as he does to Lois the moment they meet. He shines charisma. Cavill on the other hand just mopes throughout the entire movie, punches things and...I think that's about it. Lois Lane played by Adams. Starts off well enough with her being tough, wily, etc. But unfortunately her role goes downhill the moment Zod and his buddies arrive. Why did Zod want her on his ship? Was it just for exposition? Screen writing 101 guys, characters actions should make sense. Then towards the end, the military have her on the plane or something. What is she doing there? She's a reporter, not a military adviser. It's like they wrote the story and then someone said 'Oh, you forgot to put Lois Lane in.' So the screeenwriter just put her into a bunch of scenes without it making any sense. She even has the power of teleportation as shown at the end where she appears just to be the shoulder that Superman cries on when he kills Zod. The rest of the characters, aren't worth mentioning because I forgot them already, except for Zod. Zod is angry...NEXT! Let's talk about the dumb stuff, particually Pa Kent's death. Talk about not getting it. In the original film, his death is done in such a heart wrenching manner. The point of it being, with all Superman's powers, he still couldn't stop something natural like a heart attack. But here, there's no excuse. It was borderline parody how silly it was. I would have laughed if I wasn't so shocked about how bad the movie was. Why is everything in this movie super realistic. Superman is an alien with God-like powers who flies around in a cape and tights. You don't try and make that realistic, because then it becomes silly. The cinematography reflects this and it's some of the worst I've ever seen. Shaky cam is terrible. I hate it with a passion. And not only do we have shaky cam where we can't tell what's happening during the boring action but also everything is super PALE. Why is everything either white or blue? EVERYTHING. This is the whitest and coldest movie I've ever seen. It's like they found the film in a block of ice. Even when they're in the desert everything is cold. Where's the COLOUR?! And finally, the action. Oh boy, could they have made this any more boring? If you enjoy CG explosions and people punching things for 2 hours, then this movie is for you. And this is coming from someone who's favourite movie is Die Hard. News flash guys, action only works in two ways. It can be either tension filled, where we cheer on our vulnerable hero and hope he survives and saves the day. Or is can be done in a way that attempts to impress and entertain you through effects, choreography and stunts. Man of Steel is obviously going for the latter, but the problem is, that kind of action only works in small proportion. Take the original Matrix (another one of my favourite movies). Everyone remembers the amazing 'bullet-time' action scenes. But when you watch the movie, the action only makes up a small portion of the film. The limited amount of action, made the action scenes all the more exciting. It's one of the reasons why Matrix Reloaded didn't work for me, because it had too much action. Man of Steel has the same problem. How many times do we have to see someone being punched in the face? It's ridiculous how violent this movie is. Isn't Superman for family audience? Well not anymore. Step up comic book nerds, here's a movie that's so dark and moody that no one is going to call you a loser for watching it. Except the people who know what a good movie is...(whisper) don't worry though, those people generally don't appear on IMDb message boards. I wrote too much didn't I? And I didn't even talk about the cliché and cringe-worthy 'movie trailer' dialogue or the forgettable soundtrack. Oh well, I think I've got my point across. Superman shouldn't be dark and realistic. Trying something different is a good thing, but this was just the wrong way to do it. At least this movie wasn't shot on real film, because that would have been such a waste. 1/10",1,43,82,31 July 2013
Die Hard 2," This time, the weather outside really is FRIGHTFUL!
","Die Hard 2 is a film that has got a lot of backlash over the years. Being too much of a rehash of the film, being too violent and over-the- top and having a flawed plot. Personally, I love the film for exactly what it's trying to be, a fun action film that give fans more of what they loved from the original. It's Christmas eve and once again, Detective John McClane must wage war against a team of terrorists. This time they've taken over an airport and have complete control over the planes above, one of which has McClane's wife aboard. The film lacks the tension that was present in the original. McClane is never really all alone and he never gets as brutal injured as he does in the first film. Instead the film feels like a race against time with McClane desperately rushing around the airport, capping off baddies and doing whatever he can to get the planes to land. It's still great fun and it's always a blast to watch McClane fighting against the odds.Die Hard 2 also feels a lot more mechanical in it's story telling. Renny Harlin does a decent job but never reaches the excellent standards of McTiernan. The supporting cast doesn't feel as three dimensional as they did in the first film and the gritty realism is somewhat watered down this time. Even the writing isn't as tight this time round.But these are just minor flaws, in fact I consider it to be one of the best action films of the 90s. The film-makers made the film because of the originals success so they basically tried to give the fans more of what they wanted. The action and stunts are well shot and very fun to watch. The villains are colder than the original's and while not as memorable, are still a very believable threat. Bruce Willis is still in his prime and gives another charismatic performance. Also, while Harlin may have stumbled here and there, the overall feel of the film is superb. The airport is still a familiar and charming setting for the film and the inclusion of setting the film during a blizzard is great. The heavy snow is not only a major plot point but it also adds to the Christmasy feel of the film as well as being another obstacle that McClane and the terrorists have to deal with on throughout the film. The finale is one of the best ever filmed for an action movie and I know this is an overused phrase but they really don't make 'em like they used to.Most of all the film has heart, while some say it's just a cold cash-in sequel, I still find it just as warm and as charming as Die Hard 1 and 3. It's still follows the elements that make a Die Hard film, unlike Die Hard 4, that felt like just another Bruce Willis film. It's always a joy to watch this film around the Christmas season, back- to- back with the original. If you loved the original Die Hard, check this one out.",8,3,4,2 December 2012
The Dark Knight," The Most Overrated film I've ever seen!
","When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",6,17,33,2 October 2010
Die Hard," A Skyscraper, 13 terrorists & Bruce Willis = Greatest Action Film Ever!
","Back in the 80's, Action movies were mostly dominated by huge he-men action stars such as Schwarzengger, Stallone and Van Damne. Thay were filled with huge explosions, unlimited ammo and hilariously cheesy one liners. Then in 1988, Die Hard was released and for better or worse, changed the action genre for the next decade.The film starts with our hero John McClane played by Bruce Willis. A chain smoking, foul mouthed and down to earth New York cop, who's instantly likable the minute he's on screen. He's come to LA on Christmas Eve to meet his estranged wife at a party in the Nakatomi tower, hoping to rekindle his marriage. Unfortunately, after McClane has a wash, terrorists take over the skyscraper and take the guests hostage. Now, alone, bare foot and fighting for his life, McClane goes to war with the terrorists, to save the hostages as well as his wife. It's not Shakespeare but it's smarter than your typical 'hero kills bad guys' situation.What makes Die Hard so revolutionary is how realistic and ground based it is (Atleast in Action movie terms). McClane fears for his life and would prefer the police take care of the situation instead of him. He doesn't run in guns blazing but instead sneaks around the building taking down terrorists one by one. The Skyscraper creates the perfect action setting and give the film a claustrophobic atmosphere. Through the course of the movie he gets bloody, beat up and injured depicting him as a real person. Not that any of this should turn you off, McClane still is cooler than ice and has a great sense of dark humour, filling the film with funny and memorable one liners.The terrorists are great to, each having their own personality and each being recognisable from another. The team is led by Hans Gruber, played by Alan Rickman who makes the character instantly memorable and a ton of fun to watch as a suave and cunning villain. The film also has great pacing, starting off slow but as soon as the terrorists arrive, the film snowballs into a fast and furious pace.There's not really anything else to say that has not been already said. A clever plot, memorable characters, solid acting, a ton of action and many quotable lines. The film is a classic by all mean and not only is it arguably the best action movie of all time, but because of it's setting at Christmas, makes it a perfect 'Anti Christmas movie' as well which is great around the holidays. Highly recommended for everyone.",10,1,2,20 December 2010
Back to the Future," A Classic That Should Not Be Missed
","One evening, during my early teen years, I turned on the TV and watched the 1985 classic 'Back to the Future', and my only regret is that I hadn't seen it earlier...The film tells the story of a skateboarding, guitar playing teenager named Marty McFly (played by Michael J Fox) whose life is far from perfect. That is until his eccentric, scientist friend Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine and sends him back to 1955. From there the movie really accelerates into exhilarating fun that get more complicated as it goes on but will keep you entertained until the very end.Pretty much everything about 'Back to the Future' works from the interesting characters, to the clever humour, to the magical experience of going back in time. But without giving too much away, I'm going to let you go see it for yourself. A well worth purchase and a classic for generations to come.",10,1,1,3 October 2010
