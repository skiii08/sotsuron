The New World," The best at what he does
","Terrence Malick is one of those directors that has created a genre of film-making, and he is best at it. Many indie filmmakers today attempt to imitate his style, but are unsuccessful (I am thinking in particular of David Gordon Green and 'Undertow', a film produced by Malick). He is a master of visual poetry. Nearly every person that liked this film mentions the astonishing visuals, and they are perfectly justified. This film is lovely. I don't think that each scene is as tightly constructed as in a Hitchcock film. For Malick the Gestalt is more important that the individual scene. This film is very impressionistic. I cannot note any specific scene that stood out to me. The compilation of scenes is what gives the film substance. Malick is a very naturalistic filmmaker. He is more interested in how his characters interact with nature and how nature interacts with the characters. The narrative is not the main objective, that is why the narrative is highly corrugated. One of the aspects of the film I liked the best was the voice over narration. That is something that has stuck me about all of his films. It is not tightly connected to the narrative. It is on another level, and yet it has everything to do with the narrative. Sometimes it seems superfluous and pretentious, but most of the time it is very provocative. You have to think about it since it is perpendicular to the narrative. This is not Malick's best film. That honor goes to 'Badlands', his first. But this film is very good.",8,1,4,27 May 2006
Memento," Style = substance
","This is one of the rare films where the style equals the substance. The chronology of the film is not simply a gimmick. It brings you into the world of Leonard. It helps you to see what he sees. Yet, we are also able to see some things he doesn't see. It is very difficult to see where this film leads. There are some very legitimate twists and turns, ones that are not manipulated just for the sake of having a twist. This film is very smart about psychology. It makes some profound observances on psychological disorders. It shows you what pain and loss can do to a person. Guy Pierce's performance is very strong. You feel compassion for him, and yet you also feel some contempt. This is a very well made film.",9,0,2,15 October 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," We don't want to have a mine-shaft gap
","This is funniest film of all time. This film proves that you can be hilarious and significant. The humor is intelligent, precise, and well-crafted. Kubrick doesn't resort to cheep tricks and shenanigans. The actors play their respective roles with ultimate sincerity. They completely believe in everything that happens. That is why this film is so brilliant. Kubrick understands perfectly the message he wants to send, and places the exact amount of irony into it. I love the way the men on the base respond to the invading troops. 'Those Ruskies are really good. Those look exactly like our tanks.' I love the glee with which Gen. Turgison talks about launching a preemptive strike. 'Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks.' I love the way President Muffley talks on the phone with Premier Dimtri. 'I'm sorry, too, Dmitri... I'm very sorry... *All right*, you're sorrier than I am, but I am as sorry as well... I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri! Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are... So we're both sorry, all right?... All right.' I love Major Kong and the silly expressions he uses. 'Well, I've been to one world fair, a picnic, and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I ever heard come over a set of earphones.' I love the way Dr. Strangelove has to fight to keep his Nazi side from taking over. 'Mein FÃ¼hrer! I can walk!' Every time I watch this film I laugh harder than I did the last time I watched it. Excellent film.",10,2,4,3 January 2006
Alien," What Sci-fi thrillers can be
","I can watch a Ridley Scott movie just for the visuals. Nearly every one of his films look stunning. This is one of his better ones. I like the fact that this is ultimately a simple ghost story. There is nothing extremely over the top here. I like the fact that the characters a blue-collar people. They don't do anything any average person would do. They don't suddenly become superheroes. They remain simply men, and women, being hunted by a terrifying beast. Did I mention the look of the film? So many filmmakers have tried to imitate the industrial look of this film, but they have failed. I did not like James Cameron's 'Aliens'. I thought that movie was so many things this film wasn't. This is one of my favorite sci-fi films.",8,1,2,10 November 2005
Armageddon," Hollywood drivel
","I hated this movie. I hated the absurd plot. I am confident in saying that not one complete minute of this film is plausible, or even remotely believable. Some sci-fi films are far-fetched (i.e. 'The Matrix' or 'Blade Runner') that still retain at the very least internal logic. I hated the crappy sentimentality. Not for a second did I buy any of the emotional content of this film. I hated the ridiculously unnecessary camera-work. The camera is never static, and there is no legitimate reason for it to be so. I hated the fact that the film contained good actors (Thornton, Willis, and possibly Aflac) that were playing silly roles. To say that they were cardboard cutouts is to insult cardboard cutouts. The Care Bears have more emotional depth than these characters. In other words, I hated this movie.",3,1,3,11 November 2005
The Usual Suspects," Some almost get it
","I read through several reviews of this film. It seems that many of the people who didn't like this film where upset that the film 'lied' to us. They say that movies are not supposed to do that. They got that right. Film is not supposed to do that. Maybe that is one of the reasons why this film does that. Many of the reviewers said they were drawn into to the story, only to have their hopes and aspirations smashed at the end. They couldn't understand why the filmmakers would do this. Is it possible that they 'got' the film without really getting it? To be correct, the film doesn't lie. The character telling the story lies. The camera is simply showing us what the narrator is telling us. We are so accustomed to believing what the camera shows us, that we accept without reserve. We forget that the 'camera' is actually the filmmaker, a human being (in most cases), telling us a story. People lie. We cannot always trust people. We cannot always trust what seems to be objective reality. This film does the same thing that 'Rashomon' and 'Persona' do, although I consider those films deeper and more profound. We the audience are Dave Kujan, Chazz Palminteri's character. We are falling for the lie being fed to us. Though what we are being told is not totally a lie. Many of the things said and told are true. A lie is not a lie unless it contains much truth. Most of what we see actually happened. The fact that not all of it did is what makes the film so interesting. We are left scratching our heads trying to figure out what actually happened. What we thought we knew we no longer know that we know. I think that is one of the marks of a great film. It stays with you, for good or bad. It challenges your idea about film.",7,1,3,21 January 2006
Amadeus," For those who do not think they like Classical Music
","This movie very effectively combines Mozart's music with the plot. This movie wouldn't have been anything without Mozart's music. As it is, it is an extremely well made film. I understand that this movie is not entirely historically accurate. I don't think it is supposed to be. It takes the elements of a historical events and creates a very powerful fictional story. All the acting is superb. Murray is fantastic as Salerei. He is so hateful, so spiteful, and yet so astounded by Mozart's ability. This movie looks amazing. There is so much detail and so much texture in each scene, you can almost smell the environment. The sets are as important a character as any person in the movie. The costumes are amazing as well. I think the greatest character in this movie is the music. It lingers through each scene like a lifeforce. It permeates your senses and enraptures you. I says more than any other character in the film. Mozart's music lives in this movie. It is amazing.",9,2,4,11 November 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Are we happy, or do we only think we are?
","Charlie Kaufman writes movies with uniquely bizarre premises and utterly human themes. In Being John Malkovich, he deals with identity, aspirations, and the hard reality of existence. Adaptation is about the creative struggle and the need to adapt and evolve with the circumstances. In Synecdoche, New York he presents us with a stylized look at our perception of life and other people. In Eternal Sunshine he searches through the meaning of love and memory. All of these descriptions are trite, insufficient, and probably inaccurate. They are, however, what I recall learning from and seeing in the films.I just re-viewed Eternal Sunshine. I think it is his best script, and one of the best scripts of the 00′s. In all his films, Kaufman is able to create a bizarre world filled with eccentric characters that are surprisingly like each of us. I have not had to deal with the rise and fall of a relationship like Joel and Clementine do in the movie. I have had to deal with the peaks and valleys of ones. I can most certainly understand the place memory holds in our value system.I recently saw a lecture on the meaning of happiness. The speaker noted that there are two main types of happiness: that which comes from experiencing and that which comes from remembering. This movie very effectively illustrates that there is a disconnect between the two. The lecturer noted that people who moved from Ohio to California would say that they are happier. They aren't. They remember the hard winters and are comparing their present experience to their memories. We tend to filter our memories to extremes, either very good or very bad. We tend to not place emphasis on the middle.One of the many problems with Joel and Clementine in the movie is that they place more emphasis on present experience rather than memory. In the end, Joel comes to realize the importance of memory, and its supremacy to the present. Even though he knows his relationship with Clementine will probably fail, he is will to move ahead, if only for the pleasant memories of pleasant times.The themes of this movie are similar to the themes of Dark City, another very good movie. The two might make an interesting double-feature, even though the forms of the movies are very different.",9,2,4,8 August 2010
Blade Runner," Sci-fi Supremo
","This is my favorite sci-fi film. This is quite possibly the most visually stunning film of all time. I consider it a tragedy that this film gets shown on TV in Pan and Scan. If there was ever a film that needed to be shown in widescreen, this is it. Showing this movie in Full screen is like playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony without the brass section. It would be like showing the 'Mona Lisa' only from the neck up. It is like reading the Cliff Notes of 'Hamlet'. It is a cinematic sin. Those who commit this sin are anathema. A mark of a good film is how often it gets imitated. This film has been imitated by too many people to count. No one has come close to the visual aura of this film.This film also contains one of the finest monologues of film history. The 'Tears in the rain' scene equals the 'I cuda been a contender' scene from 'On the Waterfront', the Ferris wheel scene in 'The Third Man', the scene in 'The Godfather' were Michael disowns Fredo. It is great.",9,1,2,11 November 2005
Ran," The most provocative ending.
","This film has to be seen. It is profound. It is stunning. It is a work of genius. I love the look of Kurosawa's black and white film. They have so much texture and tone. They have so much depth and character. I just recently watched 'Rashomon.' That is a very beautiful film. He is able to use color equally as effective. Every color is perfectly arranged. Like a painter, he composes each scene, each frame with tender affection. I doubt you can find a better looking film. The ending of the film is the most cynical, the most depressing, the most emotive of any film I have ever seen. It has stayed with me ever since I first saw it. Kurosawa, near the end of his career, has ostensibly lost all faith in human kind. There is no goodness. There is no decency. There is no hope. All that is left is meaningless suffering. That last few images are the perfect images of desolation. This is an excellent film.",10,8,16,3 January 2006
The Great Escape," One throughly entertaining film
","This is as entertaining as a POW film can be. It is primary a lighthearted film, though it does have its serious moments. The characters are all very colorful. They are not overly stereotyped since this film helped to created the stereotypes. I enjoy that facts the prisoners get to work on escape before their feet hit ground. It is the thing that prisoners must do. The actors are all very good. Steve McQueen is my favorite--not because he is the best actor, but because he is so cool. Nobody makes riding a bike into a barbed wire fence more imitable than he. James Garner is perfect as the 'Scrounger'. I like the scenes where he is working on the German soldier. I really enjoy all the scenes where we get to see the soldiers working, and all the creative ways in which they get the job done. Though this doesn't have the psychological complexity of 'Bridge on the River Kwai', it is one of my favorite war movies.",8,4,7,1 May 2006
