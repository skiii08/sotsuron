The New World," How on Earth is this a good movie?
","I'll start off with good comments. This movie had an amazing feel to it. It looked absolutely beautiful and had some of the best cinematography that I have seen.But here's the true problem with the story. It had no real continuity and reminded me too much of the cheap independent films I've seen at film festivals. I could never identify with any of the characters and never felt much sympathy for any of them accept Pocahontas. This movie seemed more like a stage play than an actual movie. The actors didn't really seem convincing in their roles. The natives seemed more like Puerto Ricans than natives. It's like the makers of this movie have no idea of the concept of plot structure.My girlfriend passed out from boredom while watching this movie, and I almost joined her. I actually like movies that start out slow and build their plot and characters (like you're supposed to). But this movie never got going. I never saw a point to it. Maybe I'm just too shallow, but I thought this movie was dreadful.",3,2,5,21 January 2010
Requiem for a Dream," Not sure if this movie makes me want to do drugs or abstain.
","Let me start off by saying that I will save the spoilers for the end so feel free to read the beginning of my review.I feel that this movie is just what Hollywood wants you to believe is realistic about drugs and the world. They also want you to believe that this movie is a good movie. It's not very realistic and is NOT a good movie. I have experienced all sorts of aspects of the drug world from user to witness of the South American effect. With that in mind, I will tell you that the movie 'Traffic' is much much closer to the truth about drugs. I see way too many people saying that Requiem for a Dream is a movie to show your kids or loved ones about drugs. You must be on drugs to think that way or have not thought about how unrealistic this movie is.Here's my issue. Unlike the movie 'Traffic', this movie doesn't develop the characters. I immediately couldn't stand the mother, Harry, his girlfriend, his friend.... nobody! I couldn't really identify with them. The mother. She looked and acted like a grandmother. She seemed like far too fake of a character. I actually spent most of the movie laughing at her character. Even now my girlfriend and I crack jokes about 'the refrigerator'. Harry was a selfish jerk of a son who I didn't care if he lived or died. His girlfriend was never really developed throughout the movie. Too little was touched on about his friend.Now here is where the spoilers come along.The last half hour of the movie caused my girlfriend and I to laugh and also say 'c'mon!'. I have plenty of experience with people being arrested and admitted with drug problems. Not once have I seen a doctor have a severely infected patient get arrested without being taken care of. Never have I seen a patient be sent right to shock therapy because they overdosed on uppers. The mother and son could have sued and won tons of money for his arm being amputated and for her being sent through last resort mental procedures without ever going to detox. It's like this movie was meant to scare you into abstaining from drugs but at the same time causing so much laughs that you wonder if you shouldn't just do some drugs to understand what is going on. And last of all, the 'ass to ass' scene. That wasn't necessary. Seriously, how many times is a druggie going to just agree to do 'ass to ass' in front of a bunch of strangers for just a little bit of smack. This movie took the absolute most unlikely and worst scenario and made a movie out of it.If you honestly think this is a good movie to persuade people not to do drugs, think again. The people who told me to watch this movie? Yes, all drug addicts. Drug addicts who aren't going to therapy. The people who told me to watch the movie 'Traffic'? They were recovering addicts, addicts in therapy, addicts who had reached the end of their rope and turned back, or police officers. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this movie.This movie is just as realistic as MTV's 'the Real World'. Sure it seems real. But it's basically the most wacked out and unlikely scenarios being thrown into a movie. It's like someone making a movie about how you shouldn't smoke cigarettes. In this movie about cigarettes the characters die by accidentally burning down their house, starting their cars on fire, or dying of lung cancer at age 25. Or making a movie about how you shouldn't own guns and all the characters blow off their fingers and commit terrorist attacks. This movie is way over the top. So over the top that many people will laugh like I did.Please, if you disagree, learn more about the drug world and how you can prevent your loved ones from doing drugs. Don't use this movie as a tool. Now I have to go. I think I hear.... oh my gosh!!!! The refrigerator!!!!!",2,7,12,31 October 2010
The 13th Warrior," My date and I almost left the theater in disgust.
","I went to this movie on a date. There wasn't anything good showing, so we picked this movie. We both were in awe of how awful this movie was. The only good thing about the movie was the stunning visuals. After that, I wasn't impressed at all. Let me summarize the movie for you. This is a spoiler, so please don't listen to me if you want to see this movie. A priest is basically forced to travel on a boat to fight a vicious enemy. The enemy is a lanky green woman who looks like she's on heroin. Her warriors are people running around with buffalo heads placed on their heads. They kill the buffalo people and kill the screwed up woman. Done deal. Yep, that's the movie. No point to the movie. No good villains. No good ending. Don't waste your time on this movie. I'm surprised my date went out with me ever again.",2,1,4,2 February 2010
Alexander," Awful, absolutely dreadful!!!!
","I will first give a 'Spoiler Alert'. Not because I'll really tell you anything specific about the movie's events, but because I'm going to summarize this heaping pile of dung.First off, I'm someone who really finds the historical character Alexander the Great to be one of the most amazing figures ever. I don't think he was really a good guy at all, but he had many honorable qualities and was one of the best war strategists ever. He was so important to our world that it's believed that he was prophesied in the Bible. He helped shape our world as we know it. To this day people study his war strategies. His life's relation to the King of Persia is one of the greatest historical stories ever.With that, how on Earth can you make an awful movie from Alexander's great legacy? Don't worry, Oliver Stone stepped up to the plate. Oliver Stone made a 2+ hour movie that mainly showed Alexander being a whiney little brat spending all his time in drunken orgies. It's like the whole movie is about Alexander's sexuality and not his life achievements. To show my point, the King of Persia is dead minutes after the movie starts. Oliver Stone totally blew that chance to add irony, symbolism, and suspense to this movie.The only actor who came close to fitting his or her character was Angelina Jolie. Colin Farrel was an awful 'Alexander', resembling more of a sexually frustrated and confused surfer dude. Rosario Dawson's appearance was pointless, unless you just wanted to see her nude. Val Kilmer was one of the worst choices you could have to play Alexander's father. Jared Leto had no business being in this movie. Might as well put Jessica Simpson in this movie while you're at it.To put this movie into perspective, imagine Oliver Stone doing a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. If he followed this model, King's speech would be 15 minutes into the movie, he would be played by Eminem, and the rest of the movie would deal with his affairs that he allegedly had. It would miss the point completely, which this movie did.If you like movies and history, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it re-affirms my belief that Oliver Stone needs to retire.",1,4,5,21 January 2010
We Were Soldiers," Finally a war movie that properly depicts a battle.
","My father is a Vietnam vet. He rarely talks about Vietnam, and when he does, he talks about boot camp or his training. He won't ever talk about the battlefield. So I knew this film had to be decent because he loves it. He only likes three war films that I know of, this one, Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers. Here's why this movie is amazing. 1. The movie is about an incredibly important part of history and shows how gruesome the first attack was in Vietnam. It also shows how, once again, France got us into a war that they couldn't handle. 2. It's incredibly realistic. My father thought that one scene might have been too influenced by Hollywood, until he found the actual footage of the battle. In one scene the Vietnamese soldiers just charge in aggressively and are being shot at close range by U.S. soldiers. It all looks more John Wayne then anything at first. But as the movie showed us, there was a reporter there filming the events that took place. His footage is available online. Sure enough, it shows Vietnamese soldiers doing an all out charge at the U.S. soldiers and looks just like the scene depicted in the movie. The movie showed how grueling war can be and how one quick decision can be fatal. 3. Sam Elliot. I was blown away by his take on Sgt. Plumley. Amazing. He played the part of the grumpy and pessimistic... but tough sargeant. It was almost as if they had hired a drill sargeant to do his part. 4. The movie depicts perfectly the sacrifice that the soldiers and families give up. It demonstrates that the war wasn't just in Vietnam, but it was also carried over here on the backs of soldiers and bared by the families and wives of these very soldiers. No soldier was cast as a major hero nor as some major action superstar. They were cast as soldiers, plain and simple. The movie asked for no glory, no praise, just for you to listen. As one Vietnam vet said, 'This is our story'. 5. The music to the movie was great, especially since it was performed by the military's own. I recommend seeing this film. It's not a 'feel-good' movie or a movie made for pure pleasure. It's made to show the story of the soldiers. It isn't meant to push a political belief nor to protest anyone. It tells a story, an amazing and true one at that.",10,4,7,2 February 2010
The Mist," Not as good of representation of human nature as some say.
","I'm not sure if it's because of Stephen King's name being affiliated with this movie, but the movie does get a little bit of hype. This movie is supposed to be about human nature. It's trying to show how humans would typically react to such a strange and awful event. For a movie that is trying to show human nature, it failed on many fronts. This movie is basically supposed to be 'War of the Worlds' meets 'Lord of the Flies'. But Lord of the Flies was much better at showing human nature. Matter of fact, the children in Lord of the Flies showed more intelligence than the people in the Mist. I have been in survival situations before and can tell you that this movie doesn't do a good job of portraying humanity. It does have some truth to it, but plenty of fallacy. Here are my points for why this movie fails. 1. Mrs. Carmody. Yes, in crazy situations religious zealots will start preaching. But here's the thing. All of these people are scared and start becoming religious. Yet, do you see any of them praying? Nope. Not one. Just preaching. When religious people are scared, they start praying. Also, only a select few idiots would fall for her preachings about the end of the world. Most people in America know that she was missing 99% of the prophecies of the apocalypse. Even with a Bible present, nobody called her out on her errors. 2. The doubters (those who doubted there were monsters in the mist) claimed that a mine accident probably caused the deaths of people in the parking lot. Soooooooo everyone who goes outside afterward makes NO attempt at covering their mouths nor faces. Not one attempt. In the beginning a man dies within a few yards of the store. Instead of claim it was a monster, they say it was gasses. So they go outside without protection. Right. 3. Right from the beginning people wondered if this had something to do with the military. Trapped in the store are three military men. Nobody thinks about questioning these men until it's too late. Matter of fact, the military men don't even follow their training. Any soldier will tell you that these characters were wasted in the movie. They didn't use their training nor were they used as a resource. 4. Okay, so you think there are monsters in the mist killing people. Actually, now you KNOW they are killing people. So what do you do? You go outside, stand straight up, and walk incredibly slow to your next location. For crying out loud, even the soldier did this. Why? You are on the defense. Why the heck are you making yourself into a large slow-moving target? 5. The ending. I won't go into specifics. But the protagonists of the movie will do anything to survive. They are willing to take risks to survive. They will even kill other people in their way in order for them to escape. The ending was quite out of character for all of the protagonists. I understand the irony and purpose of the ending. But I would have expected that sort of ending to have happened to the people in the grocery store who stayed behind. Nope. Instead the protagonists broke character. The ending will make you very very angry. I promise. I compare this movie, after seeing what it was really worth, to '30 days of Night'. Great premise. Great suspense. Poor characters. Poor ending. Thanks for reading.",4,3,7,24 February 2010
Unknown," Another thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat!
","Unknown is one of those movies that takes you in one direction for a long time only to completely throw you off track near the end. I was worried at first because I thought this movie was a ripoff of 'Lady Vanishing'. But this film takes the mystery of the main character to another level.While this movie has an interesting plot and keeps you on the edge of your seat, it isn't flawless. What keeps this movie from getting a 9 or 10 for a score is that it does have some moments that are quite unrealistic. This isn't always a big deal in thrillers like Unknown, but this movie actually has a sense of realism that is spoiled now and then.What helps to carry this movie is the strong acting and resulting strong character of Ernst Jurgen (played by the great Bruno Ganz). His performance stands out and helps carry this film.Unknown is a thriller with enough turns to keep you intrigued while helping you forget any of the movie's deficiencies.",8,2,3,28 February 2013
Paranormal Activity," Not your typical horror movie
","When I first heard about this movie I figured it was another Blair Witch ripoff. But I must admit that it is actually a decent horror flick.This movie doesn't rely on blood, guts, gore, sex, and nudity to make itself a good movie. It relies on well-planned and placed scares, sounds, and reactions. I was very tense during this movie and many unexpected frights make the hair on your neck stand up. The actions of the paranormal entity mixed with the frightening sounds make for one frightful film. On top of this, the movie feels realistic. For being amateur actors, the acting is superb. It truly feels like this story could be true and be something documented.I'm not the sort of person who gets scared easily during movies. The last film that spooked me this much was the Ring. I didn't watch this film in the theater. I watched it from home which gives it more of a scary feel. Many complained to me that far too many rude teenagers come to these types of films. This is why I watched this one from home. If you are a patient individual who likes movies about paranormal entities, while not being 'too Hollywood', this movie is perfect for you.",7,0,0,24 January 2011
Chariots of Fire," Is it because I'm not British that I think this movie was awful?
","With the Olympics going on, I decided to have my girlfriend and I watch this classic. I am someone who loves true story movies, loves old classic movies, and loves movies that build their characters over time.But this movie, in our opinion, lacked plot structure, a point, any sort of climatic instance, any drive, and any real love for the characters.For those of you who plan to see this movie, this is a summary of what we saw. The two main characters are Eric Liddel and Harold Abrahams. They both are honorable characters (honor being the only point of the story) who both love to run and are quite good at it. Both want to be in the Olympics. For most of the movie you hear about how Liddel is a great runner. Every ten minutes you will see him run a race, races which are usually pointless. Between each race scene there is about ten minutes of British banter and young British men running around in their polo shirts and scarves talking about politics and the weather. Throughout the whole movie, you see Abrahams on the sidelines. He hardly ever races. He just sits around flirting with some actress or talking about running.... but not doing any of it. It's apparent that he wants to prove that he's better than Liddel, which gives some tension to the movie. However, they never race aside from the beginning of the movie. The movie ends with him racing without Liddel in the Olympics because Liddel is a Jew and won't run on the Sabbath (honorable and understood). Liddel wins other races without Abrahams.There's nothing I can tell you about these characters other than that the two main characters are honorable men who like to race. Their love interests were hardly seen nor talked about. Abrahams girlfriend just popped up now and then for a kiss and that was about it. There was no point to the love relationships. I didn't identify nor really see any reason to care about the main characters. The movie spent so much time talking about nothing and, in the end, amounting to nothing.Maybe it's because I finally saw the movie almost 30 years after it's release. But as I stated earlier, my girlfriend and I both love classic movies. We aren't the sort of people who really like Michael Bay films or any other films that rely on special effects, sex, and violence. This movie was done with taste, but incredibly boring taste. I saw more plot structure in an insurance seminar than in this movie.",2,16,31,15 February 2010
Up," Simply Beautiful.
","I can only summarize this movie as beautiful. I didn't think that Pixar could make such a heart-warming movie, even after Wall-E.It's hard to believe that this is a kid's movie. It is so well written and so touching. I may be an adult male, but I will admit that I cried at the beginning and end of the film. If I didn't cry out of sadness, I cried just because of the pure emotion the movie portrayed. The movie isn't your typical kid's movie. The characters aren't your typical characters. Usually movies rely on young attractive characters. This movie relies on an old feeble grumpy man and a pudgy little boy. Yet, they are one of the best duos I've ever seen. This movie has an important theme, that there is a place for everyone... even after tragedies in our lives or when our lives are near the end. It stresses love, carpe diem, forgiveness, and tolerance. There is always someone who needs us.This should be a movie that is at least up for an Oscar for best picture. I know it will be shunned as a kid's movie, but it's better written than most of the movies this year.",10,0,3,21 January 2010
Identity," A refreshing thriller!
","I'm really getting sick of Hollywood movies. But this one was refreshing. I love Hitchcock movies and this one reminds me of something Hitchcock would have done.This is a movie where you don't want to miss anything. It reminds me of Shutter Island, a story that takes you one way and then blind sides you later on in the movie. Every time I thought I knew who was behind this mess, a new suspect showed up.What I really liked about this movie is that it isn't the standard Hollywood horror movie. It's not some movie where rebellious teenagers run around in their underwear having sex and being hunted down. This movie instead relied on very well developed characters, characters that many people could identify with. It relied on classic plot structure instead of sex and violence.This movie does still have some plot holes. But I was easily able to forgive them because of how good the movie was. I recommend this thriller to people who love thrillers and don't care for the standard Hollywood thriller.",8,1,2,1 November 2010
Gangs of New York," Research the Five Points before watching this film
","This is one of those movies that is very deep, has a lot going on at the same time, and demands your full attention. But one thing that it also requires is a historical knowledge of this time period. Without that knowledge, the movie isn't worth much to the viewer. You may also find yourself lost and even wondering why anyone likes this film.I will start off this review with the positive aspects of the film. 1. The acting. Daniel-Day Lewis put together his best performance since 'My Left Foot'. He plays the antagonist and does a superb job of making you loathe him. The greasy hair, the ridiculous outfits, the smug look on his face, that arrogant walk, and even his manner of speaking makes him repulsive. His image alone makes you want to curl up your fist and smash his face in. He is truly the ultimate villain. Even many of the smaller roles are played quite well. The actor selection for this movie is amazing, save the selection of Cameron Diaz. Don't get me wrong, Diaz surprisingly performed her part well. But with Scorsese, you'd expect a better selection of actress. Nonetheless, she easily put in her best performance ever.2. This film does a fine job depicting this specific time period in New York. The story is important and is actually quite relevant today. Based on the description of this movie on the back cover of the DVD, I figured this movie was just about the Irish. But it's not. It is also about civil rights, the poor, the corrupt, and is a testimony to the history of New York. This is a story that needed to be told and it was put together quite well. The set designer deserves credit for putting together an excellent representation of a Civil War era New York.Here are the problems with this film:1. It is still rather bland and lengthy. The movie is more informative than entertaining. While the movie definitely has tense moments, irony, foreshadowing, and amazing acting it still doesn't have much of a climax. The climax also quickly fizzles. 2. The movie has so much going on that it becomes quite confusing. I commend the director for using visual aids such as flashbacks to try to clarify the film. But it is still hard to follow. With so many events going on and so many different groups fighting, it's hard to keep track of the whole point of the film. At the end of the movie plenty of people will be left wondering what just happened and what purpose this film holds. This movie is still worth watching. But like I stated earlier, please do a little research before watching this movie. Do a quick study on the Five Points, the Civil War, and immigration during the Civil War era. You will appreciate the film much more if you know what is going on.",6,0,0,28 January 2011
