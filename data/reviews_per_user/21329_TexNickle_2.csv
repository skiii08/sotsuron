Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Watched 'em Back to Back
","Due to some problems that I won't go into here, I missed the theatrical release of Vol. 1. So I got the idea to just sit and wait. Why not let Vol. 2 finish it's run too, then when I can have them both on DVD, run them back to back in my home theater.And I have to say, once I finally did it, it was fun, and well worth the wait. From the moment those crazy 1970's lobby cards came up at the start of Vol. 1, to the cool animation, thru that awesome homage flashback bit with the white haired master, and on to the final unbelievable finish, it was a riot.Not great cinema, but a lot of fun, a great night of entertainment.If you have a sense of humor, and know anything about the cinema of the 1970's, I think you will really enjoy this film. And so what that it's volumes 1 and 2, it's one movie, without question.I'm Tex Nickle and that's all I have to say about Kill Bill.",8,0,1,28 September 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Another Summer Bummer
","Burton's version of this classic '70's flick is just another stink bomb in the bummer summer of 2005.Mr. Depp is a great actor, and one who has voiced his love of playing odd roles, and he pulls out a real doozy with his version of Willy Wonka. But do we really like this character? My answer is a clear no. He's way too creepy, and his motivations for having the golden ticket contest are never made believable in this picture.Freddy Highmore as Charlie is one of the few bright spots in this current retelling.The 'new and improved' Oompa Loompas were a total bust. The new songs were the worst and I had no idea what the lyrics were even saying.This version may be more faithful to the book, don't know as I never read it, but it sure makes for a lame movie.The 1970's version clearly lacked the visual pizazz of the Burton flick, but it made up for that ten-fold by packing the story with heart. The Gene Wilder Wonka had a warmth, the Slugworth character gave Charlie and the other kids a much clearer dilemma. And many moments like the one where a kind-hearted Charlie momentarily tricks his grand folks into thinking he has the Golden Ticket because he wanted to see them all happy, are sadly missing from the new flick.But worst of all this new version of the famous chocolate factory movie lacks 'pure imagination', and I mean that in all its meanings.I'm Tex Nickle and I seriously doubt this new version will live on in anyone's hearts and minds.",4,1,3,27 July 2005
