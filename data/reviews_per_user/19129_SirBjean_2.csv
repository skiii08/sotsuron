Blade Runner 2049," Stellar Follow Up
","VFX - spot on. Gosling - typical low key v.goodThere's not much to dislike about this film. It's got some stellar backdrops to a powerful story.
One of the more exceptional sci-fi movies in recent years.",Null,0,4,20 March 2020
Annihilation," OK
",This could of been a great sci-fi but it fell apart at the midpoint and never recovered entirely. Portman delivers on performance as do the other cast but the story via weak as it progresses. Visually it's pleasing with some top level effects. Also hints at legends like Kubrick in its shot setups. Shame about the story though.,Null,1,2,27 February 2020
