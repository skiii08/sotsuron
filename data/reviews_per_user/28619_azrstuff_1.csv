Howl's Moving Castle," Now the truth is out. Yipidee, lippp & badtobono got it right
","I just got back from Japan. Ghibli's new movie has been out for almost 2 months. The reviews are not good. More interestingly, a few bad reviews from famous reviewers say roughly 'not a good movie, hard to follow, but Ghibli does make bad movies ... just look at Hauru, that had the same problems this one has.' These are from reviewers who did not dare give Hauru a bad review. Now the truth is out.Congrats to yipidee, who said 'I honestly believe a lot of people think that if they don't enjoy a Miyazaki film they're wrong, and therefore say it's great no matter what. This film is the best example of it.' Right on, yipidee.Congrats to lippp, who said 'why do people sit through a film they really can't make heads or tails of and sing it's praise? Well, probably because you're supposed to. Slapp on the artsy title of animie and Miyazaki's name and you have critics falling over themselves to sing it's praise.' Right on, lippp.Congrats to badtobono, who said 'incoherent ... nothing but a series of images ... derivative'. This is exactly what the new reviews are saying about both movies.Sometimes it takes a few years for people to speak the truth.",2,9,21,31 August 2006
