Lucky Number Slevin," Slick, Fun and Very entertaining!!! 10 / 10
","This has to be one of the most enjoyable movies to come out of Hollywood for years. It wasn't any of this Arty-farty crap(like the tragic 'Revolver').Its slick, very well acted and great direction. Sharp, funny dialogue that keeps you smiling (think Guy Ritchie, could learn a few things from this movie). Morgan Freeman was great, along with Sir Ben Kingsley. It was great to see Josh Hartnet get a good interesting role for a change. Bruce Willis was, well, just another great performance from him!!. I wont give any thing away about the story.. just watch it and let the Film do the talking, Fans of the Gangster genre will love it!!.",10,162,262,30 June 2006
