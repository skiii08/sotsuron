Hereditary," Only watch if you have NOTHING else to watch
","I really anticipated watching this movie for months because I heard it was the best horror movie to come out in a long time. BS. I do not know what these reviewers saw but because of them and their positive reviews, I wasted money and time renting this movie. Not only is the first hour extremely slow and boring, the movie is not what it is hyped up to be. Sure once an hour passes, you get a few screams, jumps and scares but overall it was just a waste. The second half is not that bad, that's the reason I didn't not give it a 1 rating, but I wouldn't recommend getting this unless you are just bored and there's nothing else on to watch.",2,1,4,28 December 2018
