Ford v Ferrari," A Heart-Driven* American Picture. 8.2
","An easy watch that reminds me Hollywood can pass on a little truth and pride.
Altogether well oriented-
Exemplifying dignity and morals by separating the heart driven characters versus the selfish/uptight moneymen....
& also showing that PG13 is a high standard in cinematic storytelling (Mangold must have a heart of gold).Matt Damon & Christian Bale had the love in their eyes as they played their roles with such grace.",7,1,2,1 December 2019
John Wick," GREAT INTRO-BUILD BUT A SHAKY PICTURE.
","The movie came in with perfect intentions for John Wick to do the needed damage. I was very excited for his reign but this 'boogeyman killer', 'Shadow-man' looked a little rusty. Maybe because of his retirement?
I did root for John Wick all the way through but when the bad guys clearly have more than one chance to easily kill him and they DON'T but instead decide to throw him around it makes me feel a little awkward.
Some shallow choreography in the shoot outs. It seems John Wick is the only one that can shoot straight, EXCEPT, that is, when he has his first clear shot at his main target. Haha!
Also seems he's the only hitman who can see his opponents first- more especially when he's walking from room to room & wall to wall shooting them like targets.
Also the arbitrary 'rules' of a 'code' between all the community of hitmen/women was up in the air and disconnected from any of the stories momentum.
In an action movie all these details make a huge difference on the pay off.
All this production needs is a good script and better choreography.",7,1,2,9 May 2019
Chinatown," Hypnotic*
","I am just captivated by the rhythms & tones this film expresses.
Over all the chills, thrills and dangers of this movie there is just a Meditative-Overlay that makes this movie very attractive & of course Hypnotic*",8,0,0,1 December 2019
Watchmen," Too quick to start slow.
","THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT READ THE NOVELA.
This movie began with a brutal pg-13 fight scene which did very well without showing too much gore. I think it was the song (Unforgettable) and the shot sequences in and through the high rise apartment. Definitely a hook and sparked my interest as to the who's and why's.
Then the movie followed Rorschach- the character with the most depth (In my opinion) as he is tying together exposition
Then it carried on with slow scenes that expected us to sympathize with these characters we did not know.
Followed by some more Rorschach bold sequences.
The only ones who seemed to care about the nuclear threats were these super heroes rather than the general public who were more curious of controversy AND this could be reflective of society but it wasn't devised that way I assure you . And in the midst of all this Laurie is destroyed when she realizes that her father was actually The Comedian. Her reaction didn't ring true as she seemed more broken up about this compared to the real world nuclear risks.",7,1,3,13 April 2019
The Thing," Classic Horror! 8.6.
","An Intensely eerie tragedy with gut wrenching suspense. Carpenters nightmarish craft leaves a sickly stain. Proof that real horror doesn't need CGI, a complicated plot or evil spirits.",8,3,5,25 June 2019
Toy Story 4," Sweet & Easy While Subtlety Allegorical.
","This movie shows that Disney & Pixar still have a humble spirit left in them. Generally, the more impactful children's cartoons have underlying themes that deal with deeper subjects of humanity i.e change, loss, relationships etc. This one seemed to play off a root subject that connected well with the entire series and ultimately made the movie easier to sympathize with. Right from the start Toy 4 was very easy to follow and maintained its smooth ascend all the way to the end (which came quick!!!). That said, I immediately give recognition to the writers and then, of course, to the cast/crew. Lastly, the ending seemed to disappoint people BUT no-one recognized how it wasn't really an end to the Toy Story series. If you watch it you'll see that the movie doesn't conclude on a tone of a finale. Not one bit. TOY STORY 5????",8,0,1,27 June 2019
JFK," Great Disillusive Material*
","Forgot how cinematically elaborate this is!
Felt like a classical tragedy.
For all you who dislike the factuals- Oliver stone said JFK was a movie in which he got all the crazy theories and presented them. 'You are taken to a time of much distrust, horror, confusion, corruption, and cover-up'.'It is an outcry from Oliver Stone to remind us that truth is never simple'.'Stone runs the difficult task of presenting fact, fiction, conjecture and opinion, twisting them all to present the increasingly difficult dispute'.Kevin Costner had a strong performance.
Gary Oldman looks almost identical to Lee Harvey Oswald.
& Even John Candy shows a deeper shade!
It's got great scenes & cool speeches that, I feel, can be molded into a theatrical tragedy.",8,0,0,2 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantinos gentlest movie. 7.6
","Quentin made an indie film about an actor and his stuntman and an average couple days in 1960s Hollywood (that is until the end). Unlike Quentins other films there isn't many thrills, more vintage pleasantries. It's alot simpler and slower than you'd expect from the flashy movie poster BUT of course the attractive cinematography keeps you in. The lengthy one-shot scenes are talented- DiCaprio built an organic time-stamped character. I wouldn't go to the theaters to watch again BUT If I do watch it again it wouldn't be for entertainment but only to meditate on the easy LA times it portrays.",7,8,12,28 July 2019
Children of Men," A solemn thrilling fable. 8.2.
","This film created an intelligent surpassing theory in a future that felt like a mocking sordid sketch of our world today.
For 2006 this movie is definitely ahead of its time in regards to the amount of detail and realism the continuous shots capture, more especially the IMPRESSIVE choreography within the cinematography & acting- Or to put it simpler, the camera and acting were synced to a suspenseful perfection.
The follow scenes through the refugee camp were horrific and captured a real/true disaster that goes on in our world today.
Plus, Clive Owens' own acting was VERY GENUINE (Hugs and kisses to him).
That said I wouldn't watch this movie again because it just wasn't a classic.
As a whole, it felt like there was a layer of neutralizing gloom over it.
This is more-so a salute film that is fired off for nobility and a one time impact-ful experience, AND, at the end of it all I didn't walk away feeling empowered but more so questioning and reflecting on the moral of the story.",8,2,2,28 June 2019
The Dark Knight," A Compelling Beam of NEO-NOIR.
","This movie landed, exploded and sent shock-waves for some time.
To this day it's always great to see the reign of the most depth-full joker.
It's a deep crime thriller written in a hard boiled style with a layer of goth-psych over it.For the most part it's so fast paced that we are occupied and miss the reality and weight of the situation, so much so we are only entertained and intrigued and accept the layout easier. I feel like other Nolan movies do the same- The
Prestige & Inception.
If you stop and watch this movie attentively you'll notice the shallow parts of the film and get a better feel for the illusion it tries to illustrate.Never the less it has Iconic qualities and came out at a time when it could be most appreciated.",8,0,1,19 August 2019
Pulp Fiction," HMM.......
","One of the toughest movies I've had to rate & review.
Firstly it does not represent the title 'PULP FICTION' because real PULP does not involve Tarantino's tangents of food and his social frustrations. Real pulp is gritty, hard boiled, and most importantly believable, written by writers who don't try and survive on their own humor. The movie will never be bad and has a VERY attractive theme, compelling/interesting scenes and some organic, grade-A acting BUT you can feel when a filmmaker is flattering themselves for being unconventional. Tarantino loves to play the shock factor- Something that was fresh for the time (1994). It's a variety show that feeds the feeling of 'Bad but Cool' and has become more transparent as time has gone forward. I can agree that it has STRONG replay value and all the means to be a classic but to be critically acclaimed and considered a landmark for film? Maybe not. Some parts feel immature as others bloom boldly. For most of the movie I wouldn't praise it for it's content only delivery, although- the exception being the last scenes textual brilliance- That much I'll admit. One of the great endings purely moved by text. That much I'll admit**",8,1,3,2 April 2019
Joker," A Surprisingly Grounded & Interesting film-- yet not essential Joker. 8.5
","Overall Great movie!!! (writing, direction, acting)
I am excited to see if it's strength raises the bar for newer releases.
It's plot sings the blues of the jokers story and does so with nostalgic aesthetics- combining 'Taxi driver' psycology with a 'King of Comedy' theme (Coincidently two movies starring De Niro & directed by Scorsese).
The emphasis was heavy on the mental illness and misfortunes of Arthur Fleck but unexplored were the entertaining/ musicality traits of a joker.
The playfulness that was expressed through the character seemed more-so of Joaquin Phoenix and less in the spirit of Joker.
Throughout the movie the Joker is portrayed as self conscious and the resolution/ climaxed rebellion is an out-cry from that- not so much on his real connection to Gotham or a villainous reign.
That said I don't see this Joker bright enough to be an infamous, self sustaining, street-wise villain.",8,4,7,7 October 2019
Sherlock Holmes," Contrived entertainment with no pay off.
","All in all Robert Downey Jr. is a big reason for liking this movie- He has this role under his thumb and plays it with such honesty.
Another reason this movie is OK is Guy Ritchies cinematic story telling by rhythym of shots and cuts. It keeps the movie at a interesting pace.
The resolution of action shots were cool but the scripts specifics were weak and not logical, such as; Watson (an insightful doctor) who pronounces the evil Blackwood dead yet fails to not notice any rope marks around his neck because we are supposed to believe the reason for Blackwoods survival is by police corruption and supernatural concoctions. Holmes' ending explanation sequence doesn't land and therefor NO PAYOFF.
But, for some reason I Could not wait to watch the second movie and maybe it's because all this production needs is a good script!",6,1,2,12 April 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Ahead of the curb.
","All-round solid movie at every angle. From Cinematography, editing, lighting, acting and writing.
I must add that it was a first for its time in the way it used 'profiling' of the criminally insane and engulfing us in their world. That gives it most of the headroom in my book.What I didn't like is how it built up to the easy escape of Mr Hopkins. I mean, he went from a maximum secured, 24 hour survelenced prison to a two guards on that entire level without any camera surveillance- that's definition 'contrived' if you asked me.",8,1,1,26 February 2019
Sin City," NOIR-FICTION THAT WORKS!
","In Brief,Robert Rodriguez tied together a creative, black and white, (literally and metaphorically) tough portrait of a place I'll never want to live at but only dream of.
If NOIR could be fictionalized this is it working.
Not sure how to judge without reading the comic but the characters and story had me wanting more and wanting to read the comics.
The stories were interesting and had me entertained like a kid watching cartoons.
CREATIVE, CREATIVE, CREATIVE and Rodriguez at his best.",9,1,1,11 April 2019
