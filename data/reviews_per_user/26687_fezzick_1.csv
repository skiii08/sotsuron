Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing and Horrible but Undeniably Brilliant
","If this movie doesn't win best picture, i'll eat my own shoes. and those are some big shoes.  i couldn't even turn the movie off when it was over; i just let the credits roll and roll, swept away and awash in the soundtrack. this is, simply put, better than any movie i've ever seen, except perhaps seven samurai. if you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT. but don't expect to sleep too well that night.",10,0,0,24 July 2001
