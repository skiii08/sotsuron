Casablanca," 50th Anniversary Celebration
","I think it has been 15 years since I last saw Casablanca. Yesterday I was in the Goodwill Thrift Store and I found a Brand New Shrink-Wrapped 50th Year Anniversary Edition VHS 1992 copy of Casablanca for .99 cents. That makes this brand new VHS copy 22 years old. Not only was the movie as fantastic as it always was, the Special Feature presentation after the movie narrated by Lauren Becall, (imagine Becall is 89 years old), was super. The is also a little booklet that came with the VHS.You have read the reviews many times and know this movie. It is just sort of fun to open a brand new VHS that is 22 years old and throw the charming fuzziness of the B & W in the VHS player....at least it is classy acting, rather than throwing in a bunch of 'F' bombs like Argo, Zero Dark Thirty or Elysium. A bunch of classless potty mouth actors!",9,1,3,19 May 2014
The Hunger Games," Good Movie
","Some of these reviews sound like Jane Austen fans criticizing a Jane Austen movie for not have enough character development. I am not a book reader I am a movie watcher! Nobody can fit the character development of a super long book in a 2 hour movie, and not too many people want to see a 4 hour movie. That is just the way it is. Some of the reviews talk about the 1st half of the movie being good & then somehow failing their expectations. This movie has super special!The poverty & scenery of District 12 was very well filmed. One felt the poverty of the coal miners. How a pc. of bread was so rare it was just wonderful to get a little bit. The opulence of the Capital City was very well portrayed, with people gorging on pigs, and Tribute shooting an arrow in the apple, 'For your consideration. The special effects from fire, evil animals, etc., created by the game-room special effect artists for the arena was nicely done. ActingThe acting was very good. I think there was enough character development for movie standards, as a matter of fact most movies do not have as much character development as this movie does. I think that this is an unwarranted accusation against this movie by book readers. Consideration of ContentOK, here comes the prude in me. We are entertaining ourselves with a movie that is portraying a very violent and evil situation. One has to ask themselves if we are like the Romans, or Citizens of the Capital getting enjoyment from seeing people being forced to kill each other. There is a sense, however, of good vs. evil, & strong vs. weak, the evil teaming up to kill the good, & the strong teaming us with the weak to defend the weak, & to help each other to defend against evil. The good is, basically, only killing in self-defense. Due to the violent nature this prude would not let a teenager, (especially a younger teenager), see this film. Overall a good movie, but I do have problems with the content.",7,0,5,25 October 2013
Barry Lyndon," Boring
","A beautiful movie, beautiful scenes, beautiful costumes, and beautiful music. I saw it on the big screen when it came out. I think it was 1976 that I saw the movie the first and last time. Now, I actually own 2002 Space Oddessey, I think that the movie was made in 1968, and my wife and daughter hate the movie and find it sooo boring that it beats 'Remains of the Day' out on the most boring movie ever list for them. My daughter has not seen this movie and I am now thinking of getting it from Netflix to get her reaction of what number she would place it on her list as the Most Boring Movies of all time. One person on the Internet had this as his 19th movie choice as the Most Boring movie ever. The movie drags on and on. The movie might also relate to the how people felt about America and politics in 1976. Nobody has thought of this relationship.I do not like the one scene where Barry Lyndon is in the bar fondling the woman's nipples on his lap. Acting is only fair by Ryan O'Neal in this movie, I did not find the acting that special. On an on this movie goes. I was glad it was over in 1976...and really have not missed seeing it since then.",5,1,10,31 July 2013
The Imitation Game," A Great Movie...but
","Is a movie well acted if that part that the person is portraying quite different than actual history? If an actor can portray a part in a fictitious manner to create sympathy and compassion for a specific group without regard to actual facts, is this good acting? I liked the movie itself, however, I am the type that goes home and does research on the actual facts surrounding the movie and characters themselves. This movie is very loosely based on the life of Alan Toring, and contains many historical inaccuracies. Historical inaccuracies not only in facts about the Enigma Machine, historical inaccuracies about the main characters themselves. The actual history of the matter shows that the Enigma Code was broken in 1932, by Marian Rejewski. One can look at the Wiki article on, 'The Imitation Game,' to see the many historical inaccuracies. So, why did Cumberbatch and Knightley portray this type of great acting jobs for these characters? The acting seems great, but when one looks at the facts they are not like the characters of history. They are both trying to create the type of compassion and sympathy for Gay Rights, (end of the film), the very type of compassion that Britain has demonstrated recently towards the historical Alan Toring. My problem, and this is not gay bashing, rather to point out that Cumberbatch is portraying a stereotypical acting job of what a gay person is like. If you are gay and reading this, see the movie, (and it is a well done movie), review the history, step back and say to yourself, 'Is that the stereotype I want a portrayed for a gay person?' * An almost autistic person that has social problems. In fact, he got along with his co-workers. * The machine was named the 'Bombe,' not after Christopher, his real friend that died when he was 18. * The fictitious scenes of Christopher and the way Turing finds out about his death. * The exaggerated relationship between Turing and Clarke, showing Touring as somewhat a monster for his reason to get engaged. * There is historical evidence that Clarke never visited Toring near his death. * There is historical evidence that his treatment inspired Toring to work more in Mathematical Biology due to the treatment. * The treatment ended 14 months before Touring's death. * There is a possibility that the death was not suicide. When one reviews the historical facts much of the movie is fiction.",7,1,6,8 January 2015
