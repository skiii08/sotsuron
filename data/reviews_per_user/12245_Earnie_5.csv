Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An excellent introduction to the Star Wars saga
","Positives:- Excellent special effects, class lightsabre battles throughout, Amazing race sequence (podrace) and the best lightsabre duel(s) of the saga (the 5 films to date).Negatives:- Jar Jar Binks (didn't bother me, I liked him, but many people found his voice and clumsiness too much to handle) and lack of character development (there's another 5 Episodes after this one for you to get familiar with the 'important' characters).Overall:- An excellent introduction to the Star Wars saga, the action scenes are brilliant.  I didn't want too much to occur in this film, as there are another 2 films for the events leading up to A NEW HOPE to pan out, and this episode will definitely contrast the next 2 episodes.  THE PHANTOM MENACE is very 'light-hearted', but who wants each film in the prequel trilogy to have the same 'dark' atmosphere? I know I didn't.",10,3,6,21 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brilliant first film
","Since this is the first film of the Star Wars saga, people should see it as that, and stop comparing it to the original trilogy (OT).  If you watch this film and compare it to the OT, or expect the same style of film as the OT, then you'll be disappointed.You should watch this film for what it is, a 'U' rating aimed at children (e.g. Jar Jar Binks) and the introduction film to 6 Episodes.  Many people were annoyed that this film was too childish, that it does not relate to the OT much and they thought that is was 'dry'.  Well first of all, the Ewoks are probably more 'child-like' than Jar Jar, this film is set in a 'dry' time, it is more serious, therefore, there is no e.g. Han Solo character.I personally do not watch Star Wars films for the great acting and dialogue etc, although I think they are fine in this film, but many people dislike both the acting and dialogue.  If you want to see good acting and dialogue, go to the Theatre, or watch another film, if u want to see amazing special effects along with intense scenes, then watch 'The Phantom Menace'.So if you watch this film with the above in mind, you should enjoy it. When this film was made, it was the Star Wars film with the most lightsabre action in it, the Podrace scene is excellent, and it has the best lightsabre battle in the Star Wars saga.Although I love this film, I still believe that 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi' and 'Attack of the Clones' are superior to it.  So although in my opinion it is not the weakest of the saga, it is also not the best.  The amazing special effects though gives 'The Phantom Menace' the edge over 'A New Hope' in my opinion.I give 'The Phantom Menace' 10/10 (There's a few films I've given 10/10, but some just edge it over the others e.g. 'The Empire Strikes Back' is also 10/10, but it edges it over 'The Phantom Menace' in my opinion).",10,3,6,12 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Massive Improvement on THE PHANTOM MENACE
","THE PHANTOM MENACE (TPM) was brilliant, whether people personally disliked it or not.  ATTACK OF THE CLONES (AOTC) is even better:-<ul><li>This film is 'darker'</li></ul><ul><li>Characters are developed more</li></ul><ul><li>Anakin Skywalker has improved significantly (he's older, aggressive, and is a very skillful padawan)</li></ul><ul><li>There is a 2-way storyline (following Obi-Wan, and following Anakin and Padme), whereas TPM only had the 1 main storyline</li></ul><ul><li>Mace Windu shows why he is the 2nd 'baddest' guy in the galaxy</li></ul><ul><li>Yoda shows why he is the 'baddest' guy/thing in the galaxy</li></ul><ul><li>AOTC has an excellent side-character (Jango Fett)</li></ul><ul><li>The major battle scene in AOTC is a massive improvement to the battle scene in TPM</li></ul><ul><li>There are more Jedi!</li></ul>Overall:- This is an excellent film from start to finish, and has furthered the storyline from TPM.You can see events unfolding in front of your eyes that will lead up to A NEW HOPE.  Now there is only one more episode to go, and the ending to this film leaves you 'itching' for Episode III to arrive.",10,0,1,21 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Best of the Saga
","Out of the five Star Wars films to date, this is my favourite.'Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones' (AotC) is set ten years after the events of 'The Phantom Menace'.  Padme Amidala is no longer Queen, she is now the Senator of Naboo, Anakin Skywalker is a 20 year old Jedi Padawan, and Obi-wan Kenobi is his Jedi Master (looking more like Alec Guinness did in the original trilogy).An assassination attempt is made on Padme, so Obi-wan and Anakin are re-united with Padme for the first time in ten years, and are to protect her.  When another attempt is made on her life, Obi-wan is sent to investigate who is trying to kill Padme, with Anakin being handed his first lone assignment, which is to protect Padme at all costs.When going to watch this film, do not expect action scenes from start to finish, because there is an in-depth story line to this Episode.  Although I do not go to watch Star Wars films for their in-depth story lines and good acting, this one does not disappoint (in my opinion).  However, there are some brilliant - and intense - scenes in this film.In my opinion, out of the five Episodes to date, AotC is the most different. It is the only one whereby the main character, - who is a 'good guy' - his actions and emotions are tempting the Dark Side.  It has the greatest battle of the Star Wars saga, it has the best character of the Star Wars saga (Anakin Skywalker in this film is great), and Yoda is amazing, everyone will 'love' him even more after watching this film.  Also, the ending left me with loads of anticipation for Episode III (2005 release), I have never been so excited about a film going to be released, as I am now for Episode III, and I have the AotC ending to thank for that.When you have seen this film, am sure you will understand why this film is called Attack of the Clones, there is no other name for it really,  the Clones are magnificant!I gave this film 10/10 of course, although I give all the Star Wars films 10/10.  There is something in this film that makes it greater than the other four in the saga, whether it be the best action sequences, the best character or even the best story line, this film is just absolutely amazing!p.s. the music sends tingles down my spine on many occasions during this film.",10,0,1,12 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Still brilliant
","The first made, but 4th of the saga.This film is my least favourite of the Star Wars saga, but is still brilliant.  It is my least favourite because of the time it was made (1977) e.g. it has the worst special effects and the worst lightsabre duel of the saga.Before I'd watched 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' (AotC) I loved this film, but now that I've seen them, I love this film even more. The characters we see already have depth because of the prequels.  A great example as to why I enjoy it more is: I did not like the lightsabre duel between Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader, but now that I have seen the way they acted towards each other when they were younger (in AotC), I get tingles down my spine when they fight.I am sure my opinion of this film will improve even more after I've seen Episode III, everything will fit into position, it will be like one long story.  The only thing I am concerned about is, when watching Episodes I-VI, the special effects after Episode III will drop dramatically, there'll be a 28 year gap difference, 'A New Hope' just might not be able to compete with Episode III in my opinion.  I'm sure it will though!",10,0,0,12 October 2002
