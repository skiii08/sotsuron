Hereditary," Overrated
","I love horror movies, but Hereditary is overrated. I was hoping to see something different given the ratings, but the plot was very cliche. Annie is either mentally ill or going through a supernatural possession either of which could be hereditary...I guess. The daughter, Charlie was creepy but the character development is lacking. Peter was at the center of the film though his character also wasn't developed much. The father had a weak and passive role. Even the cult wasn't explained much. In the end, the cult wins and the spirit and/or Charlie possesses the body of Peter. I won't be watching it again and I won't be recommending the film to others either. If you are looking for a scare without much character development then go for it. If you are going for something with more depth, then choose something else.",2,7,17,21 June 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great actors but plot needs a lot more character development
",There is only so much the actors can do if the plot sucks. The first half of the movie was really slow and the second half of the movie felt rushed. Some parts could've been cut out to accommodate more background story. The audience is left wondering about Batman's dreams (or visions...whatever they were) and why they were included. There is also little explanation about who the villains are and how/why they became villains. The rivalry between Batman and Superman isn't explained well. There is a tiny background story on Batman but nobody else got a background story. I didn't like Man of Steel because I thought it needed more character/plot development but this movie was even worse.,1,5,18,26 March 2016
