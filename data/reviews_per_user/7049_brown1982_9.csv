50 First Dates," Much better than anticipated...
","I was so pleasantly surprised by 50 First Dates, I feel the need to comment on it. Expecting to be bored and grossed out and maybe laugh a little bit if I was lucky, I couldn't have been more wrong. It was sweet, full of laughs and just plain entertaining. I thought Drew and Adam were adorable; it was impossible not to cheer them on. Rob Schneider and Sean Astin were hilarious. Go see it! 9/10",9,0,0,22 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Wow, fun for the whole family...
","My ever-sexy, scrumptious dreamboat Johnny Depp as a pirate. A match made in heaven; a perfect movie experience for moi...  I could bask in Johnny's sumptuous performance while the hubby and kids enjoyed all the fighting and explosions! Just can't take the smile off my face and I'm gonna see it again next chance I get.",8,0,2,17 July 2003
The Others," Awesome!
","I loved, loved, loved 'The Others'.  Chilling and suspenseful and just plain fun.  Nicole deserves an Oscar nomination.  The kids were incredible, too. I was entranced throughout, not knowing WHAT to expect.  A refreshing good-old-fashioned(made even better with modern cinematography)-creepy-ghost movie that deserves a 10/10!",10,0,0,13 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Torture
","I'm sorry, but this movie was an endurance test for me.  I hated it. Natalie Portman is a marionette.  I couldn't have cared less about the romance between Padamay and Anakin. There are more sparks in my socks.  There was about a 10 minute segment in this film where I felt that old Star Wars giddiness, and that was toward the end, with the clone army and some cool laser fighting...after I had desperately fought dozing off for a big chunk of the film. 2/10",2,0,0,17 June 2002
Radio," Bring your tissues!
","Call it manipulative drivel if you will, but I fell for it.  Sure, there could have been more character development.  Yeah, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant 'movie of the week' score, but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding adorable and touching, and let's face it people, in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others.  Not many.  We did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialog in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so in my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his 'comfort zone' to reach out to another human being, and in the mean time, touched the lives hundreds more.  A lesson we all need to me reminded of. Why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do?  I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart.  You won't be disappointed.  And bring your Kleenex. 8/10",8,0,0,25 October 2003
Cold Mountain," Unnecessary Nudity
","Call me a prude, but in a civil-war era film that lovingly portrays the sensitivity and decorum of its protagonists during that 'outwardly' chaste period in our history, why in God's name does a gorgeous film have to be tainted with soft porn?  I loved the book, loved the movie, EXCEPT when we see boobs and butts flappin' in one brutal scene, then nipples and butts in another absolutely unnecessary love scene, it brings the viewer right back into the 21st century where sadly not much is sacred anymore.  If a real Ada and Inman were to step forward in time and see their most sacred moments together revealed to the world, they would certainly believe that the devil was in charge and the world had gone to hell. (After discussing Cold Mountain with co-workers, family and friends it seems that those two scenes alienated a lot of history lovers and lovers of the book and in my opinion without them, the movie is a near masterpiece)",Null,0,0,18 January 2004
Some Like It Hot," Never get tired of it!
","This movie always brings a smile to my face.  The scene where Jack Lemmon has to tell himself 'I'm a girl, I'm a girl, oh boy, am I a girl'.  What can be any funnier than that?!!  It's simply the best, and deserves its reputation as a classic!",10,0,0,13 August 2001
War of the Worlds," Retarded!
","I know it's not PC to use that 'R' word, but I can't think of a better way to describe this movie. So many holes in the plot I can see cartoon Jerry devouring this monster chunk of Swiss cheese. These holes have already been eloquently revealed to you dear reader by better IMDb critics who precede me. Just felt compelled to add my harsh review of this stupid movie. What a waste of talent and special effects! I entertained myself by noting every oh-so-unrealistic plot factor during it. So, in that respect, yes, War of the Worlds is an entertaining way to pass the time. I think Spielberg is in the early stages of senility. I never saw so many people run toward danger rather than away from it.",3,3,5,10 July 2005
Bruce Almighty," Very Entertaining But No Belly Laughs
","I wanted a pee-my-pants Jim Carrey laughfest (like the first time I saw Dumb and Dumber), but it didn't happen.  It doesn't help that some of the funniest snippets have already been aired on TV a few hundred times, so when I saw them in the actual film they just weren't funny anymore (ie: doggy on pot, girl's skirt flying up, parting of the tomato soup, clothes flying off before sex, etc.). However, the movie does deliver and I wasn't too disappointed.  Morgan Freeman is God!  That was totally cool, cuz he is perfect in the role, and the only theologically incorrect line that I could sniff out was the part about him being on vacation during the Dark Ages.  Funny, but not true if you're a Bible believer (God never sleeps...but maybe he takes a vacation?, I hope not.). Had a good time at the movies, but not rolling in the aisles. I give it an 8/10.",Null,0,0,25 May 2003
