The Blair Witch Project," Just give 'em the Oscar now
","Loved this movie! ~It'll take you right back to that childhood sense of horror you used to get when vividly imagining one of the more grisly 'fairy tales', or hearing a ghost story around the campfire and being too scared to go back to the cabin.  One recommendation though:  see the website first. (It'll give you a better context for what happens, leave you with fewer questions, and possibly prepare you to be even *more* freaked out.)  The acting was excellent, BTW, and if Heather doesn't get nominated for Best Actress, there is no justice....",10,2,4,23 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Disappointing, unoriginal
","Kubrick may have been trying to say something new about sexuality with this movie, but he certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel.  Although the cinematography and set design are stunning, and the supporting cast fascinating, this movie disappointed me as just another het male fantasy. There's not a naked guy in sight, the orgy scene is anything but sexy, the dialogue is forced, and what's with Nicole Kidman's accent lapses?  (She's a good actress but she's no Meryl Streep, and should have been allowed to speak in her native tongue, seeing as how it would have made no difference to the storyline.)  The colour and poignancy of the supporting characters (also beautiful people in ugly situations) is the only redeeming factor here.  All in all, I expected something groundbreaking, something original, and found instead what amounts to a very pretty but very strained attempt. Not only is it the same old wheel, but it covers the same old territory, too.",2,0,2,19 July 1999
