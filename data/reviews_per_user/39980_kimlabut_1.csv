The Incredible Hulk," Bad, Bad, Bad
","What on earth do we have to put up with these days, a huge budget feature where the script was written with as much finesse as the hulk himself would, if you gave him a piece of a4 paper and a kids crayon! The set up from the previous film was played in the opening credits and then we had to endure laborious romantic interludes with some science thrown in, in between some predictable action scenes. This film could have been cut down to 28mins and would have still seemed floppy. Even the CGI was poor, Ray Harryhousen did better with some old left over plasticine!! As a point in fact look at the scene in the cave, they don't even line up the Hulk and his love interests hands properly, when they go into yet another romantic interlude.Overall this was a terrible film even on the scale of Spiderman 3 terrible. Come on Marvel insist on some reasonable script writers at least and try and add some flare.This is yet another comic book missed opportunity",1,24,51,12 June 2008
