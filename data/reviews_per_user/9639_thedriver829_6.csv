The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A Franchise That Continues To Get Better And Better
","The first Hunger Games completely surprised me. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. And then Catching Fire really surprised me with where it took the series, ending with perhaps one of the best twists from last year. And the cycle continues to repeat itself, in the very best of ways, with Mockingjay - Part 1.What I love about this entry to The Hunger Games franchise, and what might turn some people off about this movie, is that it takes us out of the games and into the resistance. And I thought it was really cool what they gave us, and how they explored the build-up of this rebellion against the Capitol. I also enjoyed seeing what they've done with Katniss' character, showing how she is losing grip of her mental state and could lose it at any moment. It was nice to see her vulnerability in those moments, but it was also sweet to see her become a member a symbol of the resistance and take on that responsibility. She has her motivational moments and they are really effective, even to the point where you would want to fight with her. And I felt that Jennifer Lawrence gave an incredible performance (as per usual).One thing I noticed also is that this movie wasn't the most action- packed of the franchise, but it never bothered me because the intensity was so high. This had me on the edge my seat from beginning to end, and really took the franchise to what I think is at its best so far. Of course don't take that as there is no action in here. There's plenty to keep you going and there are some pretty sweet moments found here.There are also some noteworthy performances from Julianna Moore, Elizabeth Banks, and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (they put a tribute to him at the end credits of the movie, which was nice to see). It was also nice to see where they took the character of Peeta, which I won't spoil here but let's just say it will definitely be a shock. And I was surprised at the fact that the ending felt like it had some sort of resolution while still pumping you up for the next installment, which I'm sure is going to be one heck of a finale.Overall, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part I continues to lead The Hunger Games down the path that has made it so successful so far. It's intense, engaging, has some really great performances that I wasn't expecting, and I liked how it was able to keep us invested without having to rely on the anxiety of the games. It sucks that we have to wait another year to see the next one, but for now The Hunger Games continues to get better and better, and it shows no signs of stopping.",9,21,57,22 November 2014
Troy," A Flawed But Entertaining Epic
","I've never really understood the immense hatred that Troy received. Even in a year where we had failed epics like King Arthur and the atrocious 'Alexander,' people still considered this to be a terrible attempt at adapting Homer's The Iliad. While I certainly agree that the movie could have fixed a few things, I can't help but have a lot of fun every time I watch this.The biggest thing I loved about this movie was that it felt like a tribute to the epic sword and sandals movies of the 50s and 60s. Everything from the sets, costume design, and even the running time of the movie screams epic. There are incredible battle sequences that never seize to amaze, and Brad Pitt does a good job playing the almost invincible hero Achilles. Even when the movie was at its downtime, I was still invested in its characters and story.The actors all do an excellent job. As I mentioned, Brad Pitt does a very good job, and definitely fills the presence of an unstoppable fighter. Eric Bana does a great job as Hector, and Peter O'Toole almost steals the show as King Priam, for the little bit that he is in the movie. I also really liked the performances of Rose Byrne as Bruseis and Sean Bean as Odysseus.And like I said, everything technical about this movie is stunning. The sets, particular those set in Troy, are beautiful to look at, and you can definitely see the attention to detail there as well as in the costume and weapon design. The musical score by James Horner is pretty good, though it can feel a little too bombastic at times (there is a loud female shout every once and a while). And the action sequences are perfectly choreographed and entertaining on many levels.Unfortunately we do have to touch on where the movie gets it wrong, and largely it seems to stumble when it comes to its dialogue. A lot of the dialogue here does come off a little clich√©d and cheesy, and some of the actors aren't able to live up to their co-stars. Orlando Bloom, for example, seems like he is struggling to show himself as intimate and a boy in love, which may be because of how he's gain this persona as a elf warrior badass from Lord Of The Rings. Diane Kruger is a little stale as Helen, and sometimes Brian Cox feels a little over the top in his acting. Some of the death scenes also come off a little awkward, particularly the aftermath of Paris and Menelaus' one on one battle.Still, while these flaws are prevalent, Troy still is able to succeed due to its attention to artistic detail, entertaining action sequences, and solid actors whose characters we can connect with and enjoy watching. As far as epics go, this one isn't among the Bravehearts and Ben-Hurs of the world, but it still is better than a lot of the more recent epic action films we've seen as of late. I recommend checking this one out.",8,2,3,2 December 2014
American Hustle," Well Acted, Stylish, but Also Self-Indulgent and Disjointed
","Hype can be a major killer when it comes to movies, and American Hustle is a huge example of this. There was a lot to be excited about here. The cast was huge, with big named, really incredible actors brought on board. It has David O. Russell in the director's chair, coming off his back-to-back critically acclaimed movies 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Playbook.' It has the feel of a Scorsese film, with the music that feels like a throwback to the 70s. And it holds a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes; that alone garners this movie a chance. So why did I walk out of this movie dissatisfied?Largely it has to do with the overall structure of the movie. It has everything that it needs to put together a fantastic movie, but feels very disjointed, like they didn't know how to put that puzzle together. It also feels like it has a touch of self-indulgence thrown into the mix, like O. Russell wanted to make his own version of Goodfellas, only without the flow and consistency of that film. And ultimately it ends up feeling very jumbled, very inconsistent, and very unsatisfying.Of course there is still a lot that this movie can be praised for. All the actors do a tremendous job, the two main standouts being Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper. Amy Adams does a good job as well in the main female lead role, and Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as well (even though I feel like she is completely miscast and not as incredible in this movie as everyone makes her out to be). There's also some great dialog, great editing as well. The overall tone is fun and it definitely keeps you interested in what's going on. I just felt if they had found a much better way to bring all of this together, it would have succeeded a lot more than I felt it did. Hopefully next time, O. Russell remembers that to back up his great actors, settings, costumes, soundtrack, and dialog with a solid and stable story.",7,0,1,22 November 2014
Schindler's List," A Beautiful, Haunting Masterpiece That Will Stick With Me For A Long Time
","Out of all the movies I've seen in my lifetime, Schindler's List will always be a staple in my mind. The first time I watched it, I was just left in complete silence as the closing credits began to role. After the movie was completely finished and cut to black, I realized that I had watched what I consider to be the greatest movie ever made.This movie really is an experience. Not only does it suck you into the time and place which it is set in, it makes you feel like you're there experiencing it all. You feel like you are here witnessing these events take place. The violence feels real, and the hand-held camera sequences give a reality and a look of how it must have felt to be there during this dark time in our nation's history. It's powerful and hits hard, especially during the liberation of the ghetto and the ending where we see Schindler break down because he feels like he could have saved more lives.Liam Neeson gives what is probably his best performance still to this date as Oskar Schindler, and you really see his evolution as a character and his change in view as he watches the violence committed against these people. In the beginning he doesn't seem to care; he simply sees them as an opportunity to make money off of business. But as he sees these events unfold, and as we watch them as well, you see how much this impacts him, particularly when he sees the girl with the red coat in one of the movie's most famous scenes. Ben Kingsley also gives a powerful performance as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's adviser, and Ralph Fiennes gives a stunning performance as the menacing, hateful Amon Goeth, a merciless SS Officer. There are also some fine performances sprinkled across the supporting cast and many of the Jewish characters, and there is not a single poor performance here.Some may feel that the 3 hour running time will be monotonous, but Schindler's List completely captures the viewers' attention throughout the entire motion picture. The situations these characters go through, the characterization of Schindler and Stern and their collaboration together, and simply seeing the brutality and merciless nature the movie depicts are all enough to keep one occupy, not to mention move them emotionally and thoughtfully. The black and white cinematography looks beautiful and helps with putting you in 1940s Poland, and the script and dialogue are so perfectly written by Steve Zaillian. Not to mention Steven Spielberg's direction on this is flawless. He pieces everything perfectly together, wraps it up in a bundle, and gives us an absolute masterpiece of a film.Schindler's List is my favorite film. There has not been a single film that compares to my experience watching it. There has not been a single movie that has moved me and left me speechless like this movie has. The only movie that has come close to impacting me like this was Alfonso Cuaron's Children Of Men, and even that by comparison doesn't add up to how Schindler's List impacted me. I know some people will say 'You need a movie that you can watch over and over again that is fun and enjoyable. How can you have something so depressing as your favorite movie?' Some will even say it's too obvious a choice. Well, you know what? It is an obvious choice, because it is obvious that this is a powerful, beautiful, and incredible film experience that excels in pretty much everything it has to offer. It's an incredible achievement and I can't wait to watch it again. Well done, Spielberg.",10,28,48,17 January 2015
12 Years a Slave," Captivating, compelling, frightening, often hard to watch, but in the end completely rewarding
","It's hard to review a movie like 12 Years A Slave, considering the amount of love this movie has gotten. It's the Best Picture winner for 2013. It's sitting at a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, among the highest rated movies by critics and audiences. What more can be said, other than the fact that all of these accolades are not only well deserved, but completely justified?12 Years a Slave is a phenomenal piece of work. It's captivating, compelling, frightening, often hard to watch, but in the end completely rewarding. It shows slavery in its true form and never sugarcoats or turns its back on the message it is trying to deliver.There are some great performances here, many of which were nominated for and one of which won the acting Oscars. Chiwetel Ejiofor completely carries this movie and you long so much for him to get out of the situation he is in. Michael Fassbender plays the role of a sadistic slave owner, who you loathe every single time he is present on screen. One of the biggest surprises comes from Lupita N'Yongo, who at only 16 minutes of screen time becomes one of the most memorable characters in the whole story and proves that she deserved the Oscar she won. There are many other actors who show up briefly, such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt, and others, and they all do fantastic as well.As I mentioned above, 12 Years a Slave is a really realistic portrayal of slavery. As a result, many scenes are hard to watch. There is no holding back. The two whipping scenes in this movie are tough, the latter all captured in one take lasting about 4 minutes, and almost reach a 'Passion of the Christ' level. There is also a lot of other horrific moments, such as hangings and rape, that will definitely be hard for the viewer to experience. However, at the same time, they are powerful and really puts you in that experience.And everything technical about this movie is fantastic as well. Steve McQueen really impressed me with 'Shame' back in 2011, and continues to show his potential of becoming one of this generation's best filmmakers. The camera work is excellent, sometimes going on long takes that submerge you into the setting. The production and costume designs look authentic, the writing is great, the musical score is engrossing and moving; 12 Years a Slave really excels in its technicality. However, it still keeps us rooted in its story which keeps up invested and looking for resolution until the very end.Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a fantastic and powerful film, and could easily be this decade's 'Schindler's List.' It examines slavery in a realistic, albeit graphic approach, has great actors that keep you invested in the characters, and is structured and directed perfectly. It's a wonderful and moving movie, and while some may not be able to handle it, this will no doubt go down as one of the most powerful and thought-provoking movies to come out in a long time.",9,0,2,22 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Human Depravity In Its Most Delightful Form
","So many have been quick to label this movie as a glorification of reckless behavior. Critics claim that the movie has a moral ambiguity, and that it actually promotes the sex, drug abuse, and debauchery it shows on screen. And I can certainly see why one might say that: The Wolf Of Wall Street is a graphic movie. It has probably the most graphic depiction of drug abuse I've seen on screen, as well as sex scenes that are almost to a pornographic level and f-bombs which never seem to stop. However, watching The Wolf of Wall Street, I felt more like the movie was a commentary on people and how greedy and depraved we are. It's one of the reasons I love this movie, not to mention the fact that it's a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted film.We all know how great of an actor Leonardo DiCaprio is, and he's definitely progressed more and more with each movie he is in. But with this movie he gives his absolute best performance to date, giving his 110% to every seen, whether he is calm and collective or he's spazzing out and screaming at the top of his lungs. You can feel how much he took over the character. Jonah Hill also takes a dramatic turn from what we're usually used to seeing him as. He's still his funny self, but man the guy really can act! Matthew McConaughey, while not in the movie much, makes a memorable appearance earlier on in the film.All of the other actors do a really good job, and that largely has to do with the script by Terrence Winter ('Sopranos'). This is easily the best written movie of 2013, and while one could certainly detract it for its 500+ f-bombs, it has some of the best and most memorable lines to come out of a movie this year.And of course we can't forget to give Martin Scorsese his due. We all know he's a talented director. He's made classics, and this could easily become of his classics. This could easily fit in with something like Goodfellas and Casino, and is very similar in content and in style. It fits perfectly with all of his filmography.I also have to give props to the editing and the visual effects team. The editing and cinematography looks incredible, as it always is with Scorsese and how he puts his movies together. But I was really surprised when I found out how much of this movie was actually CGI. There are a lot of locations and sections that we see in the movie that are completely computer-generated, and you don't even realize it. So props to the team in charge of that.In the end, The Wolf Of Wall Street may be graphic, sometimes almost to a fault, but ultimately does a great job at depicting this real life event as well being another welcome addition to the Scorsese catalog. My only complaint is that it may have run a little too long at times, but there's nothing in here that needs to be taken out in order to make a much better film, and it's already fantastic the way it is. So if you like Scorsese and don't mind a lot of sex, drugs, and swearing, pick this one up.",9,1,2,22 November 2014
