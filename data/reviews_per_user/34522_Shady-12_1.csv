Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A generally good and occasionally spectacular film.
","I went into the cinema expecting to hate this film.  The type of hype and merchandising that goes with so many big releases is always off putting, however I was happily proved wrong.The plot cleverly shows how a minor trade dispute sets the events in motion that will ultimately lead to the downfall of the old republic.  The story is very well told, alternating between the invasion of the small planet of Naboo by the Trade Federation and the political shenanigans of the slimy Senator Palpatine, portrayed by the superb Ian McDiarmid (bit of a giveaway there).Like the original films, the settings are wonderful, immersing you in a different universe so convincingly that you don't think about the film as effects and sets.  The scenery on Naboo is beautifully rendered and the senate chamber on Coruscant, and accompanying scenes are totally convincing. The battle sequences are solid, if a little 'seen-it-all-before' and the pod race is great fun.Unfortunately, these good points are somewhat at the expense of character development.  Qui Gon and Obi Wan are a bit two dimensional, although Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor make the best of what they get in the script. Darth Maul could perhaps have done with some background, and as for Jar Jar, well I forgave George Lucas for the Ewoks so I'll let him off here.  Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine was wonderfully devious in his manipulations of both sides and Natalie Portman puts in a notable performance as the courageous but naive Queen Amidala.Overall then, a very enjoyable film.  There are flaws but hardly enough to spoil the fun.  It's well directed, exciting and intriguing and the lightsaber battles are fantastic (let's hope we see more of Ray Park soon). The film works as a scene-setter for the rest of the saga, and personally, I can't wait for parts 2 and 3.",Null,0,0,25 August 1999
