The Avengers," overrated but not bad.
","I have seen the avengers 3 times now and ever since the first time i watched the movie i felt that even though it was enjoyable there was something about the movie that just kept it from being a masterpiece to me.First I will point out the good things about this movie. The characters are very dynamic and well developed and some of the best conflict in the movie is between the hero's rather than the villain. Another thing is that this movie has well done humor that doesn't seem out of place.Now onto my issues with the movie of which there are 3 and I'll start with the smaller ones. First off, no spider-man which is kind of ridiculous because spider-man is one of the main avengers but that is forgivable. The second issue is the fact that they never give a good explanation for why Bruce Banner can all of the sudden control his powers. Finally Here is the big issue with the movie, there is no moment in the movie where the hero's are actually in trouble by that i mean no matter how bad things got there was never a huge struggle and the hero's had everything under control. In fact the final battle was far too easy. They were facing an entire alien army for goodness sake but they never seemed overwhelmed.Overall a pretty good super hero movie but falls short of the higher realm of superhero movies like the Dark knight, Iron man, Spider-man 2 and Watchmen.",7,3,7,31 January 2013
