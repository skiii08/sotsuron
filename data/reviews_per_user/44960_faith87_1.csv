The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Didn't live up to expectations
","I waited a year for this movie, since The Hunger Games is one of my favourite books and movies. I loved the entire book series and expected to love all of the movies as well, but this one was really disappointing. It followed the book more closely than the first two parts, but this is also the problem. It makes the movie too slow, too boring. There are no exciting parts in this movie whatsoever. Where Mockingjoy part 1 ends, the book starts to become more exciting and beautiful, so I expect Mockingjoy part 2 to be better. The acting is great and the movie is visually beautiful, but as a fan I have to admit that this movie disappointed me. There is no suspense, it's not gripping, you are waiting for something to happen and that moment never comes. Unfortunately.",5,17,31,23 November 2014
