Hereditary," First hour is ok, but then...
",It ends being another 'horror' movie like all the others. So much 'spooky' and WTF moments that lead nowhere but to think you've wasted minutes of your existence.,5,1,1,2 March 2020
The Witch," Beautiful, dark and pointless
",That awful script that leads to nowhere ruins the beautiful scenery. Acting is average.,4,3,4,2 March 2020
