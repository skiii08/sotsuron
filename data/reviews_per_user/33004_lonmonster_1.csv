The Incredible Hulk," Ang Lee's Hulk - For Dummies
","This is Pander-fest 9000.If words confuse and irritate you, if logical action sequences strain your mind and you yearn for something easier to understand and desire visuals to motivate your thinking, than look no further! Leterrier's Incredible Hulk has all of the watered-down clich√©s you've seen a million times before, so it's all comforting to know that there's nothing new to shock you with, and challenge your brain.Motivation for the villain not your cup to tea? No problem! There is none in this movie. he just looks mean and smashes things.Tired of Hulk transforming when he's angry for various reasons, and tired to figuring out what those reasons are (oedipal complexes!?! boring!) - Look no further! This movie has the simplest Hulk motivations! In fact, Betty is in peril so often, you can make a drinking game out of it! And who hates the military? Tentpole movie audiences, that's who! With their evil plans and reckless decisions! It's so simple! So sit back, relax, and forget that moody talking movie with their complex characters, well-formed narrative structure, and other conceptual ideas you don't want to have to think about, and enjoy Leterrier's Incredible Hulk. It's just like Ang Lee's (without all that brain stuff)!",2,33,54,7 May 2010
