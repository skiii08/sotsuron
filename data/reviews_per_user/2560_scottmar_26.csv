The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the hype
","The question is this. Why was Blair Witch Project so successful? The answer is simple. Because there are a lot of people in the United States that are very stupid and gullible. Who went to see this thinking it was real. Believing that a snuff film would be a summer release. People say Hollywood insults their intelligence, but after the success of Blair Witch, I wonder if the mass audience has any intelligence to insult.
This is an amateurish gimmick movie. No more, no less.I can only hope nobody wastes their time making a knock off version of Blair Witch, because as stupid as this MTV generation might be, I don't think you can fool them twice.Note: Blair Witch was shot on video and 16mm. Not just video.",Null,1,1,14 November 1999
Gremlins," Don't feed them after midnight?
","When is 'after midnight'? They should have said between midnight and 1am or something like that. Because it's always after midnight.
Another problem is: where is the gremlin from the lab? Maybe he rejoined his pals at some point.Beyond the logic problems, this is a fun flick. Only in the 80s would a studio movie have the balls to say there is no Santa in a movie kids would watch!And Joe Dante regular Dick Miller will always make a good monster movie better!",Null,0,1,6 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Uncle George let us all down
","Anybody that says this is a good movie is in serious denial. It would be like a Star Trek fan walking out of Star Trek V saying 'Yeah, I can't wait to see it again!' You take the Star Wars brand name off, and you're left with a bad movie. A movie that plays like a Star Wars knock off, instead of the real thing. Uncle George says that he doesn't care about the adult fans. Star Wars was always about the kids. Wrong. The first Star Wars appealed to adults as well as children. This new movie is aimed at children under 10. By making this movie as stupid and inane as possible, George has narrowed his potential repeat audience. And this also hurts the next two movies as well. People will say there is no way the movie could live up to the hype. They're wrong. There's a couple of scenes, like the senate hearings and the lightsaber dual, that shows us how good the movie could have been. Instead we're forced to sit through lame comedy bits by cartoon characters that are more annoying than Barney the dinosaur.",Null,0,1,21 May 1999
Spartacus," I am Spartacus!
","A good flick. Good performances all around. But one thing that doesn't make any sense. Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas are unchained. Given swords. Told to fight to the death. The winner gets crucified. So they're basically dead. Now, why don't they just start attacking everybody around them. Take some soldiers out with them. No, they do something that makes no sense, and actually fight to the death! How stupid!",Null,0,1,29 November 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Special Edition is ridiculous
","As if it wasn't bad enough that Lucas ruined the Star Wars films, now Spielberg is hacking up the classic E.T. It's sad when great filmmakers become pathetic spas' in their old age. Replacing guns with walkie talkies? That is just gay. And cutting out the line about dressing up as a terrorist for Halloween. C'mon, bad people do bad things in this world. Get over it already! I shudder to think of a special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. They'll probably animate it so that the swordsman pulls out a gun and shoots before Indy shoots him.",Null,0,1,5 November 2001
Dawn of the Dead," Original vs. Remake
","I think the remake improved on some things, but fell short in others.In the remake they had no where else to go but the mall. As opposed to the original where they stay there even though they have a fully functional helicopter. There were a lot of times they should have just hopped in the copter and got out of there.A lot of purists like the sluggish, mentally retarded zombies over the high speed zombies of the remake. But I thought the newer zombies were a lot scarier. You can't just run by them and give them a good right cross to the jaw. Or throw a pie in their face!The original was better in character development, and really driving home the isolation of this new world.And of course in the original they showed the horror of being eaten alive.The biggest advantage the original has over the remake is the creatures were real zombies. The real undead. Enough of this stupid virus stuff!",Null,1,1,28 March 2004
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first, but still not as good as it could be
","Spidey 2 is similiar to Superman 2 in that the first movie dealt with the origin story that most people already know, where as the second one is all action. Introducing a new villian, while using the original villian as a subplot.You could put together the first two of Superman and have a cohesive four hour movie. Ditto with Spidey.It's good that they tried to make Parker's and MJ's relationship as complicated as they could, but it was pretty silly to have the movie end with a Graduate style exit from the alter.This movie, along with the first, should have taken a darker and more serious approach to Spiderman. More like XMen and Daredevil. The movie is too geez whiz and corny a lot of times. They should have set the movie in the 50s or something, because their New York has no resemblance to modern day NYC.The corniest moment of the first movie is when those New Yackers were up on the bridge throwing stuff at Goblin. For this movie, you have Spiderman (minus his mask) crowd surfing in a train car. A ton of witnesses see his real identity, and promise not to tell anyone. Yeah right! And then the 'Hey Doc Oc, this is post 9/11 New York. You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us' type attitude was just plain silly.There's way too many scenes of Spiderman without his mask. I guess they're trying to get their money's worth with what they payed Tobey.Doc Oc is a better villian than Goblin due to the fact that he actually resembles the comic book Doc Oc. They didn't just throw him in a discount Halloween costume like with Goblin.",Null,0,0,6 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Independence Day without the aliens
","This disater flick is very comparable to Roland's 1996 blockbuster Independence Day. Corny. Unrealistic feel. You have a guy who figures out what no one on the planet can (Goldbloom in ID, Quaid here). Those in power don't listen until it's too late.In the President role they should have had Bill Pullman reprise his ID role.In the midst of this disaster you have a teen romance between Bubble Boy and the cute girl from Mystic River.The effects are really good in places. Really fakey in others. Especially those stupid wolves, who I'm sure were suggested by some idiot executive to give the characters more peril than just the weather.",Null,1,3,21 June 2004
The Beach," Where's Gilligan?
","Beautiful photography, good performances (especially by Leo as a not so nice fella), but what is up with island? It had more logic problems than Gilligan's Island. Beyond the obvious of where do they go to the bathroom, the living arrangement of the beach is very bizarre. It's supposed to be a small paradise, but you have at least 20 or more people living there. They can't leave the island for fear someone will find out, but who's keeping there? And, they can't leave the island, yet the leader leaves to buy all kinds of products, save for food. So you have these purists that aren't exactly living off the land. What do they do with all the trash on the island? It isn't like a garbageman will pick it up. Leo's hill assignment is ridiculous. They stick him up there without food and water. Yeah, he'll be just fine. 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Deer Hunter' ensues.",Null,0,0,19 February 2000
Blade II," Fun but flawed
","This would make a pretty fun video game. The new monsters that are a cross between Nosferatu and John Carpenter's The Thing are pretty cool. And there are some impressive action scenes. The problems I see with the movie:1. Bad CG. I think Spiderman is going to have the same problem. Guys swinging around on the ceiling, jumping up and coming down that don't look the least bit real. Filmmakers need to realize that CG is only good on nonhuman stuff. When you try to replicate humans it usually looks like a cartoon.2. Annoying supporting characters. Ron Perlman basically does the same role he had in 'Alien 4'. And what's up with Blade's assistant? Half his role is smoking, the other half is calling Blade 'B'.3. Unimpressive soundtrack. The techno music in the first Blade made me run out to buy the soundtrack. The music in number 2 didn't do anything for me.",Null,0,0,31 March 2002
American Pie," Don't buy the hype
","I usually avoid high school sex comedies. They're usually very pretentious, obnoxious, and bare little resemblance to reality. I finally saw this much talked about movie, and it is pretty much what I expected. I couldn't beleive that in the documentary on the DVD, the cast members were saying the movie was just like high school. I don't know what school they went to, but it seems to me most people in high school are angst ridden and depressed. The surprising thing for me was how unfunny the movie was. There was a couple of amusing moments, most notably from Eugene Levy and Willow (Band Camp girl.) Only once, just once, did I laugh out loud.And that was when the guy watching the streaming video said 'Go trig boy, it's your birthday'. That's funny. Totally silly. Probably wasn't even in the script, just improvised.",Null,0,0,17 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," This is the way to do fantasy
","If anyone asked me what's the game Dungeons and Dragons like, I wouldn't point to that ridiculous piece of garbage that came out in 2000. I would point to the original source, Lord of the Rings. This is the best film of 2001. This is a blockbuster mainstream flick that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, like every mainstream blockbuster flick over the past couple years. George Lucas should take note. This is how you do a movie that everybody can enjoy. I've been a fan of Peter Jackson ever since I saw 'Dead Alive'.I really liked 'The Frighteners' as well, but this is leaps and bounds above those.",Null,0,0,21 December 2001
The Village," Scooby Doo Meets Twillight Zone
","This movie is a lot like Identity in that you go in thinking you're getting a straight up horror movie, and instead it turns out it's not real.
I think it's silly these reviews that say how predictable it is. Romantic comedies are predictable. This isn't predictable. I knew there was some kind of twist to the movie, but I didn't sit there brainstorming through it trying to figure it out. I just watched and let the story go where it did.I guess if someone told me the first twist is a Scooby Doo twist, and the 2nd twist is a Twillight Zone/Identity type twist, then I'd probably have caught on.There's some moments of creepiness in this, but for the most part it isn't nearly scary enough. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson are wasted in this.William Hurt has a good part.The Villiage is a rental. Or just watch that Twillight Zone where the guy thinks he's on Mars but really is in the desert.",Null,0,0,13 August 2004
"I, Robot"," Should have been more like Minority Report
","This movie would have been a lot better if it had the look and feel of Minority Report, and had Tom Cruise rather than Wil Smith. Or anybody other than Wil Smith. Smith is fine when he's playing it straight, but then there's a lot of scenes where he must have gotten confused and thought he was on the set of a Bad Boys movie, so he's throwing out a lot of 'witty' one liners and acting all Fresh Prince.The female lead reminds me of Sandra Bullock in Demolition Man.Holes boy was barely in it. If you blink you'll miss him.To the people who think that this is a prequel to Matrix (beleive me they're out there): It's a Fox movie, not Warner Bros. It's Issac Asminov source material, not Warsowski Brothers.",Null,0,0,2 August 2004
The Patriot," Braveheart meets Maverick
","This is two movies rolled into one. On the one hand, you have a serious war movie. On the other hand, you have a really corny mess, with bad attempts at comedy. This movie starts out good, but as time wears on, it becomes more and more sappy. It shouldn't be a surprise that this movie would degenerate into a brainless 'Hollywood' movie. After all it was produced and directed by the guys who gave us 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla'. And written by the writer of 'Saving Private Ryan'. 'Glory' was a quality film that did a good job capturing the Civil War. This movie does the opposite for the Revolutionary War.",Null,0,1,22 July 2000
Van Helsing," This is no Raiders of the Lost Ark
","Why does Stephen Sommers horror movies keep getting compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark in promos? They did it for The Mummy (1999), and they're doing it with Van Helsing. Raiders of the Lost Ark was a lot more realistic, better scripted, and better acted than this.If you want campy performances, a whole lot of CG (some good and some fakey) and a horror movie that isn't scary, this is for you.This movie has more in common with League of Extraordinary Gentleman. Or Wild Wild West. The Monster Rallies of the mid 1940s were better done than this.The one good thing about this movie is that it made Universal rerelease the classic monster movies.",Null,0,0,10 May 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Whoever goes to see this, they lose
","The idea of two sci fi icons doing battle seems to be a sure thing,but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. First of course is that it's not done in a dark, realistic style like theoriginal Alien and Predator. Then there's the fact that the movie makes up it's own rules as tohow the aliens and predators operate. (Instant birth from the facehuggers).Instead of setting the movie in the future, it's set this October,which would be the future if we were living in the 80s.The acting wasn't great. The lead actress is far from being Ripley.The idea that a Predator would team up with a human is prettysilly. Instead of giving her props, wouldn't the Predator kill hersince she's a formidable adversary?The movie is quick, and sets up for a sequel (in a cheesy mannerlikely thought up by a lame brain Fox exec).",Null,0,0,21 August 2004
Man on the Moon," Good recreations, but....
","This movie does a good job recreating Kauffman bits, but there doesn't seem to be much of a story here. They don't explore the relationship between Love's character and Kauffman. They use creative license in places, so why not go all the way with it and put a movie together that works. Why Danny DeVito is playing Shapiro rather than himself still baffles me. Joining DeVito in producing this movie is Robert Shapiro and Bob Zamuta. I can see why these characters came off so good in the movie. Not an ounce of friction between them and Kauffman. Lawler does a good job. Carey must not have done his homework very well when it comes to Lawler, thinking he had to bait Lawler for real to get a good performance from him. I wish good ole J.R. (Jim Ross) commentated like he did back in the 80s, rather than his 90s style of speaking in soundbites 'Oh my! Oh my!'. Here's an interesting note: Summer 1998 Tony Clifton was at Hugh Hefner's Midnight Summer's Dream party. He was going on and on about being in a Milos Forman movie. So was that Carey, or Paul Giamotti?",Null,0,0,25 December 1999
28 Days Later...," 28 Movie rip offs
",28 Days Later seems to be a hodge podge of various horror movies.Here's some movies it borrows from:Dawn Of The Dead: The shopping scene in 28 is similiar to the one in Dawn. Ditto with the tire changing scene that seems to come from the switching trucks scene.Day of the Dead: Not so nice military. Holding a zombie for study that ends up turning on an evil military.Omega Man: Man walking around an empty city.I Drink Your Blood: Spread of virus that makes people crazy.,Null,0,0,30 June 2003
Million Dollar Baby," It could have been a contender
","This movie was pretty good, but it has a big flaw in it. I haven't watched that much boxing, but I'm pretty sure the rules are different than pro wrestling. You can't sucker punch your opponent after the bell with their backs turn and not face a DQ or suspension. If they really wanted to paralysis Swank's character, why not just make it that she was pushing her self to get through the match. She was sticking in there when anyone else would have given up. After a late round, she walks to her corner, gets dizzy, and then falls on the chair. I wondered how this movie was going to end. Like Rocky 1 or Rocky 2? Instead it ended up with a Christoper Reeves type accident that I didn't see coming.",Null,1,4,23 January 2005
Garden State," Pretty lame movie
","I'm not sure why everyone is hyping this movie such as they are. It's funny, one of the reviews said it defined the generation of people in their teens and early 20s. Wasn't XXX supposed to do that? Actually if this movie applied to any age group, it would be late 20s, maybe early 30s. The dialogue was terrible. Like fingernails against the chalkboard bad. Plus there wasn't much of a storyline.It's funny, if an unknown writer tried to pitch this script, the reaction would be 'Who cares. Why would anyone want to watch some slice of life movie about your home town?'But because this guy is on some TV show, and conned Portman and Holm into doing this, we have Garden State.The only good thing about this is that you get to watch that little hottie Natalie Portman. But your time would be better spent watching 'Closer', where you get to see more of Portman (and I'm talking' skin here), you get better dialogue, and a movie that is a Mike Nichols film, not one that wants to be.",Null,1,3,22 January 2005
Black Hawk Down," Yet another bad Brucheimer movie
","I heard this movie was on some people's top ten list. Is that the ten worst list? I thought this was supposed to be a departure for Brucheimer? It had a lot of the same nonsense that you would find in 'Armaggedon' or 'Pearl Harbor'. Just when I would start to get into it, they would throw in something really corny. Some ridiculous speech. Or some sentimental nonsense. It wasn't gritty and real. There were all these stupid 'movie moments'. And come on, every guy that gets injured begs to get back in the action.The acting wasn't that great. Tom Sizemore chews more scenery than Godzilla ever did. And like a lot of people said, character development is so weak, you don't really care about these guys. The musical score was pretty bad. Usually I don't notice the score of a film, but there were times where the music would stick out like a sore thumb. This movie wants to be Saving Private Ryan & Three Kings, but it fails.",Null,0,0,13 January 2002
The Insider," Pretty good stuff
","This is probably the only movie based on a true story in 1999 that hasn't come under fire. Because they don't grossly alter facts, and they had a disclaimer for the things they embellished.It's good to see the Tobacco industry come under fire. Good to see how ridiculous our legal system is.The movie didn't need to be as long as it was. It could have been trimmed down in places. And they could have lost the one ridiculous thing in the movie, when Russel Crowe is looking into the mirror, and it transforms into his family.I avoided this movie, because I'm not a fan of Pacino. I think he's become kind of a joke, yelling most of his lines in movies nowadays. Normally being a real spas.I thought Crowe did a good job, although I don't think he should have made the top five for acting. I think Damon or Cusak deserved that slot more.",Null,0,0,19 February 2000
The Hurricane," Ridiculous and Cliche
","This is about as cornball as 'Patch Adams'. There was definetly some creative license taken with this movie. C'mon, this evil cop or whatever that pops up through Hurricane's whole life just to screw him over. Or the really nice prison guard, who even shows up to Hurricane's final trial. And it's almost criminal not to have the other convicted man in the final trial scene with Hurricane. I can't believe some of the corny moments. After reading Hurricane's letter, he looks up and sees birds flying. And the celebrations at the end. I expected them to put in stock footage of people in foreign countries out in the street applauding.And this cliche dialogue. Like 'You don't choose the books, the books choose you'. They never fully explained what the deal with the Canadians were. I'd like to know their real life story. Their living arrangement seemed really odd.",Null,2,4,30 January 2000
The Great Escape," McQueen's Heroes
","After all the positive things I've heard about this movie, I finally sat down and checked it out. I was very disappointed. I was hoping for a serious, realistic WWII flick. Maybe not as heavy as Escape From Sorbibor, but something that was closer to reality than this. What the heck kind of Nazi prison camp is this? Obviously this was the inspiration for 'Hogan's Heroes'. I for one wasn't in the mood for wise cracking Americans and wacky NAZIs.",Null,1,4,9 May 2000
Gladiator," Nothing new, but entertaining
","If you've seen any of the old Roman Empire movies, then you won't see anything too original here. At times you can almost predict what's going to happen next. The battle scenes were exciting, but I guess it's now a cinema law that you have to incorporate the sped up Saving Private Ryan style. Good acting. Nice touches here and there. But the end is a little bit of a let down. (SPOILER ALERT) Here this guy is up against incredible odds. You figure he'll have to have a huge war with the Roman army. But oh no. This movie takes the easy way out by saying 'O.K. To win, all you have to do is beat this guy in battle'. This kind of easy out is the only problem I had with 'Rob Roy'. Side note: Gladiator's T.V. spots were incredibly lame. I almost didn't want to go see it after watching the spots. Comparing football and hockey players to the Gladiators, all to a rock song. It was really weak.",Null,0,0,6 May 2000
