Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Biggest disappointment in the history of film
","Star Wars. The most successful, most loved and most talked about movie franchise of all time ended in 1983. For decades after the millions of loyal fans went nowhere, still completely swept up in the now dormant Star Wars world. Then one day, like a flash of heavenly lightning, there is an announcement, Star Wars is back! People all over the world rejoiced, looked up at the sky with teary eyes and kissed the ground they walked on as they heard the news. It was a wonderful day to be alive.The build-up was unprecedented. Three long years the world waited impatiently for what seemed too good to imagine, it was a miracle, it was the second coming of Jesus, it was by far the most anticipated film of all time. Three years of production, sixteen years of ideas, this was bound to be the greatest movie ever seen.And what did we get? Garbage. The most anticipated movie in history turned out to be also one of the worst, it was genuinely terrible.It was so devastating many fans not only lost faith in Star Wars, but in movies themselves. It finally proved life wasn't fair, there was no justice in the world, you're beloved family would turn on you and chop your head off. It was cinematic apocalypse.I saw this movie on the 31st of December 1999, and at the countdown to midnight I was hoping the Y2K Bug rumors were true so this tragedy and all evidence that remained could be erased from history forever.The world stared blankly ahead in horror, there is no god.",3,1,4,14 September 2013
Seven Years in Tibet," Interesting premise, let down by everything else
","This had the foundations to be something truly special. An Austrian mountain climber leaves a dying marriage to explore the Himalayas in British India, but with the onset of World War II is forced to flea through inhospitable terrain to Tibet where he is befriended by a doomed world leader.Fantastic, how could such a unique and complex plot go wrong? Well believe me, they found a way.10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming.Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again.Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse.If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.",4,8,10,17 September 2013
Enemy at the Gates," Pretty average overall, waste of a great set
","Being a bit of a history buff I had high hopes for this movie but it let me down, it was just average on almost every level.The first 15 minutes or so is actually fairly eye opening, but the film doesn't kick on from there and slowly gets more dull as it progresses.The set is spectacular, but that's the end of the good news. The script felt like it was written in a day, it's completely void of wit and is barely insightful, I could've been watching a bad TV movie. The acting suffers as a result and none of the main cast shines, Ed Harris especially was wasted his character is badly developed and despite being the main bad guy we know almost nothing about him.The soundtrack is disappointingly dull and forgettable, the only up side is it is numbingly sappy so it fits in with the rest of the movie.So that's it, a blown opportunity to tell a great story about Stalingrad, Enemy At The Gates is ordinary from start to finish.",6,0,2,30 September 2013
