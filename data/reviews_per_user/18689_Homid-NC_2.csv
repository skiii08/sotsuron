Requiem for a Dream," Simply Breathtaking
","I had heard about this film in late 1999 through word of mouth from some friends. After one of my friends saw this film they simply said, 'Don't do drugs!'. Hearing that comment got me even more interested in seeing this film. He told me it was visually breathtaking, and left you on the floor, lifeless.So, when it came to Duke University in late 2000, I jumped at the chance. I told my girlfriend to come see this movie because I heard it was a magnificent film with a strong message. I was in for a surprise. (And NO....this is NOT a date movie! :) My girlfriend will vouch for that!)Not only is it a magnificent film with a strong message, it is literally the only film I have seen in the past few years that actually scared me. I saw the characters slowly decline throughout film wishing I could do something for them. The impact this film has on people will change the movie industry forever. This was GROTESQUE but not gratuitously. This was extremely shocking images that weren't there for show, but to explain. To help you understand why some things are better left alone and how life is ruined so easily.My overall experience of this film was great and terrible at the same time. Seeing images that are depicted in this movie left me unable to even finish a cigarette afterwards, due to thinking of how bad it was for me.This movie should be in every Health awareness class. It will definitely change your mind about picking up a syringe. 10 out of 10! BRILLIANT!",10,1,2,6 October 2001
Training Day," A gritty film.
","I personally have to say that Antoine Fuqua is an outstanding director. This is the better of the two 'action' films I have seen (The Replacement Killers is the other). He has a great eye for film when it comes to directing and even his music videos are entertaining.This film caught me off guard. As I'm sure many other people than I have felt going to see it, I thought it would be horrible. When the first 10 minutes or so went by, I could tell it would AT LEAST be entertaining. When the story began to unfold, I was actually into the movie.
The character development in this movie is great. Denzel Washington played a great anti-hero and I would not be surprised if he won some awards for his performance. Ethan Hawke also played an immensely convincing role.
The director, perhaps, was the best part of the movie. Fuqua has a magnificent eye for setting up scenes. The drug hallucination part was a brilliant way of showing it.I gave this film 8/10! If you have a chance and you like action and good plots, GO SEE IT!",9,1,12,12 October 2001
