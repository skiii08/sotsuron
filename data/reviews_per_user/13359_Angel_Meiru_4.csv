The Ring," The Korean and othe Asian versions were better....IMO
","After seeing the well-done Korean 'Ring Virus', I decided to see the American version as well. And well, I was pretty dissapointed.To start, the colour seemed too bright for me. In 'Ring Virus', the colour was very dark, setting the moody atmosphere better.I also like the Cheju island setting of 'Ring Virus', since the setting seems so ancient and mysterious.Second, the acting. Naomi Watts is not that good of an actress and every scene that she is in, she seems rather snobby and stuck-up acting, even around the little boy (who is not like the kid in Ring Virus, more like the kid in Sixth Sense). While Korean actress Eun-Kyung Shin did a lot more better job and seemed much more emotional and caring.Another thing, though I think Daviegh Chase is a cute actress, she is just way too young for her role in this movie as Samara. Usually, the actresses whom played Sadako/Eun-Suh have been at least in their young adult years, but Chase was only 11 or 12 while playing this role. Does anyone find that a little disturbing besides me?And then there is the video. In 'Ring Virus', it was made out to look sweet and innocent on purpose, because sometimes the scariest of things can be something that can look cute and innocent at first, but then lash out at you later. In this version, the video is just about as 'chilling' as a Marilyn Manson music video.And the idea of a sequel and never crediting the original creator is quite a crying shame....",Null,0,1,13 March 2004
The Polar Express," Nice movie
","I found a movie that is a perfect family favorite. Based off of the 1986 children's book, the Polar Express follows a boy whom feels doubtful of Christmas hopping on a magical train, meets new friends and go on a railroad journey of a lifetime.This movie is exciting, touching, cute and admirable. A lot of work went into this movie and it is well worth your time. It is not an emotionless G rated movie (like most in this PC era), it was full of twists and turns and you could feel both sympathy and relief for the characters (especially the Lonesome little boy in the back of the train).I wish there would be more family movies like this instead of plot less toilet humor flicks.",10,1,4,17 December 2004
Grave of the Fireflies," It would be heartless not to like this movie
","Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no Haka) is one of the most powerful and beautifully made movies based on WWII.It is not about the leaders or military, but about the people themselves. Two orphans Seita and Setsuko lost their home to the air bombs, where thrown out of the house of their angry Aunt and forced to live on their own in the bomb shelters.Some people have complained that this movie is pro-Tojo and anti-American, but it's not. It is just simply a point of view from the common folk of that country, and everyone of every country, whether in War or Peace, have a story to tell.Did you know that this movie is based off of the semi-true story of Akiyuki Nosaka, who also lost his sister to starvation. Feeling guilty of all this, he writes this story, with Seita's death symbolizing the slow mental dying in the poor man's mind.It is a powerful movie, I recommend this movie for everyone to see. It has a well meaning message of the hardships of WWII.",10,13,16,22 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Tim Burton's worst film
","Okay, I'm a fan of Tim Burton and I also think Johnny Depp is talented (seems like I'm one of the few girls who likes Depp not just for his looks), but I think they both blew it big time when remaking Willy Wonka.Okay, neither version are that faithful to the book (which movie is faithful to books?), but I liked the 1971 version of Willy Wonka a lot better. In the book and 1971 version, Charlie has human flaws, Violet is a girly girl and the TV addict is smart. With this version, they throw everything out the window. Charlie is a perfect little saint, Violet is a feminist tomboy (catering to Politically Correct beliefs of Americans maybe), Veruca is nowhere near as obnoxoius as she was in the old movie and book and the TV kid is dumb and plays video games (another half-@$$ misguided message that video games rot your brain is being featured in this film. Video Games do NOT rot your brain!).Oh, did I mention the special effects? The computer graphics in this movies were awful and fake looking. I mean blueberry girl Violet looked totally fake and the CG look outdated, even for a Tim Burton movie.And finally... WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO THE OOMPA LOOMPAS? They're no longer green and orange, and they sing RAP SONGS! This screams 1995 instead of 2005.Even talented Johnny Depp looked like he was bored and was overacting. That's sad, because Depp can do so much better.If you like Burton, watch Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride. If you like Depp, watch Pirates of the Caribbean. If you like Dahl in general, read the book or watch the 1971 movie.But if you want to watch train wrecks with outdated special effects and lame jokes, watch this movie. However, watch it at your own risk!",1,3,6,6 April 2008
