The New World," Screenplay and Directing A Snoozer
","The cinematography of beautiful scenery was so beautiful that actors were not required. And that's fortunate, because no acting was present. Lead star Colin Ferrel had the same expression throughout the movie. The visual effect of the filming was so spectacular in many scenes that dialogue was not required. This also was a good thing because the dialogue was in a made-up Indian language that was impossible to understand from the context of the scene. It appeared as if the movie was shot without a script and instead improvised as they went along. The directing also was subpar. It looked like the same scene was being replayed over and over again. There were about three settings: tall grass, the fort, the ships in the harbor. Who wrote this thing? There was no storyline. No character development. No tension. There was no story. No drama. Nothing. They should have not released this film.",3,0,4,7 October 2006
