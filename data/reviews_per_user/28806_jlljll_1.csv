Blade Runner 2049," Truly a Masterpiece
","I just saw this movie for the first time. I just want to encourage everyone who loved the accomplishment of the dark dystopian vision of Blade Runner, to experience this movie. I wasn't tuned in to the movie when it first came out and I'm sorry now. Part of my love of movies is too talk to like minded people who love the same genre as I do and experience it again and discover new things from those people. I think this movie is truly a Masterpiece of SciFi. It's so much darker even than the original. (It's literally so dark you need to shut off all your lights and close the shades to see a good portion of the movie. This will help to immerse you in this possible future World within the first few scenes.) It's even darker than the earlier movie with less hope than before. Humans seem fewer and the bright billboards and lit up cabs less. The lights in the apartment towers where people must live, are also fewer. Most of the frenetic activity of the underground where all sorts of transactions took place before seems muted. This World, at least for humans, seems to be winding down. The story of Earth has turned to the Replicants. I'm not going to repeat the plot, because if you haven't seen the movie and you are of a more 'realistic', more melancholy bent than most of your friends, then you need to adopt this movie for your own and let it speak to you of loss, with perhaps, just a scintilla of hope.",9,2,8,2 July 2018
