The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Exiting,thrilling,edge of your seat,movie of the year. Loved it!
","I am anything but a fan of the chick-flick,but I have been seduced by the entire twilight series. More questions than answers have been created by part 1. I believe that was the intention of the writers/directors. It left me wanting the answers and I suspect part two will break the all time top 5 movie opening night sales. Great movie I say spend the money for the big screen effect you will not be disappointed. Can't wait for the follow up. I was floored by the extremely low rating but am sure it will come up dramatically as the number of reviews increases. I believe that most of the ratings reflect the feeling of being left in the dark about so many questions in the plot however the release of part two will unveil part one as a true classic in my opinion.",Null,2,8,21 November 2011
