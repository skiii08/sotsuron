Skyfall," Not The Best Bond Outing For Craig
","First thing's first...this is NOT a Casino Royale quality film. Plain and simple. Now that we have that out of the way, lets get on with the review. We see our beloved hero a few years after the events of Casino and Quantum, and he is obviously out of his element. Sure, its Craig back in the role, but its almost a different breed of 007. It starts off with the pedal to the floor, a huge opening sequence that leaves the audience wanting more. Whether it loves up to the watery mouths, that's up to the viewer. Story: The story is rather flat, and that is coming from a guy who never really says that. One scene, Bond is in this part of the world. The next, a completely different part, leaving me, at least, wondering, 'Um, did I miss something?' Now don't mistake this as a negative review, because it surely is not. James Bond was kicking ass throughout, just as much of a bad ass that one would expect of Craig as 007 at this point. There were those spectacular action sequences that you just find yourself smiling at, whether you know it or not. Without giving much away, this is a rather generic plot. Bond returns, terrorist at large who happens to be MI6's most wanted, and insert twist and turn from there. It's a good story, but does it blow you away? Not by a long shot. Acting: Daniel Craig IS James Bond at this point, like it or not, 'Blonde-Bond haters.' He just flat out rocks as our secret agent hero. Every time he's on the screen, you can't help but want more and more of him, heterosexually. His performance as Bond NOT being recognized by the Academy is a BLASPHEMOUS ERROR by the Academy, especially after his THIRD Bond film. Judi Dench as the mother-like 'M' is always as elegant and brooding, and in this installment there is no difference. She is just great. Ralph Fiennes (sp?) is the new guy this time around in MI6 and lives up to the expectations. He's just a master of the acting craft at this point, like it or not. Then, there's Javier Bardem as the menacing and, at times, overly awkward Silva, who is a bad guy but who has heart, as well. He's scary, funny, and dramatic all at once. Easily one of the best Bond villains of all time. Final Verdict: Sure, this didn't live up to Casino Royale, which was easily one of my favorite Bonds. Should you see it? Yes. Is it something to rush out and see? If you are a true, die-hard Bond fanatic then of course. If you wanna have a good time at the theater, then again, go see it. Just go in with an open mind, and let yourself be the judge. 7/10. Hopefully the next one is huge, much like I expected this 'action movie' to be.",7,2,8,2 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A Perfect Conclusion. What More Could Anyone Want?
","I told myself when I bought my tickets for The Dark Knight Rises TWO weeks in advance that I wouldn't let myself get too over hyped about it. Well, sure enough as the date approached, I became more and more anxious and excited, which is weird because I'm not a big comic book nerd. Did TDKR live up to the hype and it's predecessors' success? Yes, it blew them outta the water. Story: The story was the perfect third act that anyone could have imagined. It was tense, gritty, thrilling and beautiful all at the same time. I'm not going to elaborate on the story (for those who haven't seen the film yet), but you can gather from the trailers, correct? The Nolans have outdone themselves again with a near perfect script, one that kept the audience tense and ready for the next larger than life scene. Acting: Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Christian Bale is flawless, as always, as our hero in black and as Bruce Wayne (yes, separate roles). He delivered, BY FAR, his best performance of the trilogy this time around. Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, I mean what's not to love? It's Gary Oldman, a legend in the making. Tom Hardy is brutal and just plain frightening as Bane, the film's leading villain. The rest of the cast (Caine, Freeman, and Hathoway) are great in their respective roles, as well. Final Verdict: Don't let the negative reviews fool you. No, this is not another TDK, but that's a good thing. It would be boring to watch the same movie twice in a row, right? This film is HUGE, from the story to the unbelievable visuals, stunts, chases, etc. The emotion is still in tact, no worries there. In fact I would say it's the most emotionally moving of the trilogy. GO SEE THIS FILM. I'd see it in IMAX, but either way, it will blow you away. Promise.",10,5,11,1 December 2012
