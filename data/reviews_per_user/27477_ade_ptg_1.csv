The Perks of Being a Wallflower," We are infinite.
","Why do most of us choose to hang out with the wrong people? This is a question I have been asking myself for years. Watching this movie, my dilemma came to an end. 'Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing? We accept the love we think we deserve.' It might seem an easy explanation, but in fact it's a deep saying, hard do understand. As I got used to doing so, I have divided my vote in other 6 smaller ones. For the image/cinematography, I gave it an 8, as it doesn't impress with any particular techniques. For the music/sound, I have to offer it a 10, since it has so many old and great track, filling any gaps remaining. For the script, a 9 is just, it is interesting and complex. For the directing an 8, there are scenes which impress a lot (e.g. the scene where David Bowie's song is played in the car, and the character portrayed by Emma raises her hands and enjoys the moment) For the acting, 9, everybody doing a great work, and expressing very well the feelings they were supposed to show. For the whole movie, a 9. I think Ezra Miller acted topside, having a unattainable exuberance. As a conclusion, I think this movie should be watched at least once in a lifetime, because it reveals the beautiful or less beautiful moments of the adolescence and how these influence teenagers.",9,0,1,9 September 2015
