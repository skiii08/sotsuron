The Lobster," A switch off movie
","Dull dull dull. The pretentious premise of this movie is lost in the lack of any character empathy and use of Peter Greenaway mimicking music soundtrack. How Is this classified as a comedy? It is not even interesting. Not clever. It is not even pretty to look at. Why does this movie exist? I do not often write reviews but as a punter, this is only for those with a pretentious disposition who want to appear clever and intense. In fact it adds nothing original or entertaining to the pantheon of cinema. How did the excellent cast get involved in this ego trip other than by being hoodwinked into thinking it was something better than it was. Maybe something was lost in translation. It certainly does not work in Anglo Saxon English. Avoid.",1,20,33,12 February 2016
