The Lobster," You are in for something special
","I consider myself to be a avid movie fan. Anything from any genre or decade ill give a watch. I've loved everything from Star Wars to a space odyssey, from pulp fiction to Django, from a clockwork orange to trainspotting, from the lion king to good will hunting. I think you get my point. I try to see anything that hits the big screen, and some that hasn't. I loved a lot but I've also seen my fair share of bad movies. At the end of this movie , for the first time ever, I was able to say 'this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life' and know it was 100% true. Before I go on, I will say that the actors/actresses in this I really do like, from top to bottom, so no bias in that respect. the fact that this movie was even mad is mind boggling, never mind the casting they some how pulled in for this movie. It is a dark and unpleasant movie that was so terrible it'll make you uncomfortable in your own home. From start to finish this unpleasant movie will make you regret you own a tv. How this movie was even considered a comedy is preposterous . I get in the era of film we are in, that today the dark and different independent films and dark twisted comedies are praised more then ever. I myself find a lot of them refreshing from your cookie cutter Hollywood movies, good guy wins, bad guy loses, lessoned learned etc. etc. This film tho had no place ever being made or even thought of. I've always been able to watch even a bad movie and see why some people might like it or why it has a cult following but the fact that enough people rated this high enough to put it in the 7's is really disturbing to me. I really can't elaborate enough how terrible this movie really was. I truly believe it'll be a long time until another movie can come along and be able to take my top spot for worst movie of all time. All time worst movie experience in my life. hopefully this 2 mins of reading saved you the 2hours you would of spent watching this Mona Lisa of bad movies. 0/10. Enjoy.",1,2,2,13 December 2017
The Legend of Bagger Vance," a classic that got away
","In my many years of film watching I've never come across a that was quite underrated as this one. through and through this movie is one of my favorites. From the setting, to the plot, to the cast in this movie I could sit down and watch over and over. all though this movie may seem just like another feel good sports movie about golf, but it is so much more. A movie set in the depression era showing the struggles of all types of men/women dealing with family, financial, and even post world war traumas. This star studded cast of Matt Damon, Will Smith, and Charlize Theron in there prime, along with a great supporting cast, makes this movie enjoyable for any type of movie fan. Of all my favorite movies, a lot of which are more widely agreed upon as classics, this movie is the diamond in the rough (no pun intended). I can't tell you how many times I've tried to pass this movie along to friends cause I know everyone will love it. If I had a dollar for every person who I've asked if they have seen it and them never of even heard of it, id use that movie to buy advertisement across the country to try and spread awareness of how great this movie is. In the mean time this will have to do. hopefully you take my advice and watch. I also advise you to try and see the deeper, underlying meaning throughout the movie and not focus on the golf as the major story. 10/10. Enjoy.",10,2,3,13 December 2017
