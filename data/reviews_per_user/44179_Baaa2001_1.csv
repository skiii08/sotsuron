United 93," Makes Your Heart Beat Intensly.
",I only got to see it half way to the end. I was flipping through the channels and it came on. I didn't know if I wanted to watch it. But what the actors were doing and what they were saying drew me in. I can't imagine reliving that moment that would change our lives forever. The way they portrayed that movie was unbelievable. I cried through the whole time. It reminded me of watching Titanic. I new what was going to happen and I cried so much. I felt proud though because those were people thinking to do something. Another target would have been hit. They took a stand and fought back. They will always be great heroes. Everyone was heroes on that day.,10,0,2,6 October 2006
