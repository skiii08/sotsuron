It," Worse than 1990 series
","I like 1990 series. Didn't like 2017 version because of the gore of Georgie's death. Conection between kids was better portrayed in 1990 version, here it was lacking big time. Only connection here was love for Beverly. Parents and teachers in both version I just can't beleive their acting and directing of the story, they ACT like morons. Creepy as hell. Pennywise is expected to be scary, but parents. After seeing this version, I would rather see 1990 version few times just to get rid of bad feeling after seeing 2017 version. It was to bloody gory, if director thinks ppl need this kind of stimulation, then he should stop directing.",4,0,1,20 December 2017
