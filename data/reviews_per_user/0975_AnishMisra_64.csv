Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 review
","Blade Runner 2049 is a film directed by Denis Villeneuve. I had watched the 1982 film in January and remember loving the film. It was a different kind of sci-fi film that I had seen. Watching the teasers and the trailers also excited me a lot but I had a certain fear for this version. But all of that went away as the first shot came in.Plot: In 2049, LAPD Blade Runner K discovers some truths regarding replicants that lead him to Rick Deckard.Story and direction: The fear I had that this film would commercialize every thing that made the 1982 film so distinct was all removed as I saw the opening shot of this film. This film is dark and not pleasant in any way. The production design was so authentic. I could go on with that. The VFX for this film were so seamless. I felt so associated with the characters of this film. Normally for an R rated film which involves quite a lot of violence the blood is normally CG-ed which takes off your experience. But this film didn't do that considering it had quite a budget for it ($150 million).Camera Work is top notch. All the scenes are filmed with so much perfection that it was difficult to differentiate whether it was filmed on set or natural environment. The score - Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch - deserve a clap from my side. To integrate Vangelis' wonderful score of the film that was famous in 1982 along with an existing modern score is not an easy task. And finally, the story. Bringing Hampton Fancher (the original writer) along with Micheal Green (Logan) was a great job done. The themes that are dealt in this film are very rich and deep. Many people would be having the issue of connecting with the film being 163 minutes long. But the story was so much engrossing that I couldn't take off my eyes from the screen for a minute. Denis Villeneuve has assembled such a talented crew, so how it's possible that this film will not be top notch!!!! I happen to watch this film in 3D (my first R Rated film in this format). And it was an other worldly experience for me. The fault for this film is very minute for me, Harrison Ford. I hated the amount of screen time he got for this film. If you put a person on a poster, put him for the right amount in the film too!!!!!! Performances: Ryan Gosling stealed the show for me. His performance as K, was fabulous. I could get associated with his character in the film. Harrison Ford shined through his role considering the screen time he got. Jared Leto was quite the character. His eyes (the white contact lenses) got me chills. Ana De Armas was also good as Joi. Robin Wright was also great as the Lieutenant. Sylvia Hoeks was ruthless in her role and carried it effortlessly. It was good to see Edward James Olmos too. A special mention to Dave Bautista. I saw him for the first time in that kind of role and I was impressed.Favorite Scene: I guess the scene where Deckard hits K in a dance bar that's fully vacant and stops suddenly saying that the Elvis Presley song that is playing is favorite. We too have a Elvis Presley hologram. This scene got many laughs from my side. And was a standout because it was the only of the few comic scenes in the entire film that was dark.Verdict: If you loved Blade Runner and you love the sci-fi genre, this film is a must watch. This film goes out to prove that having right ingredients makes the film a masterpiece. It's very sad to see an audience not going to such a film (considering the box office results).I am going to go with a 9.5/10.",9,3,9,17 October 2017
First Man," First Man Review
","First Man is a film directed by Damien Chazelle. I remember this film being announced 2 years ago and I have waited a long time for this. SO naturally this film was one of the most anticipated of this year's. In addition to that I wanted to see what the combo of Damien and Ryan had for me. After the film ended, the film lover in me was over-joyed.Plot: Follows Neil Armstrong and the years leading up to the Apollo 11 mission to the moon in 1969.Story and direction: The main hero of the film is the script by Josh Singer and director Damien Chazelle. Singer who has some great films to his credit (SPOTLIGHT, THE POST) has written an emotional and thrilling story. This went on to show that how well the director understood what the writer wanted to say on the screen. The film has its moments of thrill and emotions. And never for a single moment those went overboard, there was a balance between the two. Also, I did love the way Damien has used practical effects instead of VFX (an age where VFX is used in almost 90% films). I remember in every scene involving spacecrafts I was terrified for the safety of those in it (although I still knew the results in some scenes). The emotions depicted are so apt and correct that I could very well connect to the pain these characters are experiencing. The score by Justin Hurwitz is another plus point. I especially liked the track titled 'The Landing' (Yes, I did look up the name after watching the movie). I did like the way hand-held cameras were used to film the scenes. But on the other hand, I hated the way there were too many close-up shots instead of wide angle (barring the spacecraft scenes).Acting: There are two people that stood out for me: Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy. Ryan Gosling has come a far way and has shown he can do variety of roles. As Neil Armstrong, he nailed it. It's for the first time I am seeing Claire Foy in something and I was gobsmacked. Be it emotional or happiness, she just plays the role with ease. Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler and Corey Stroll provide good support.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Janet confronts Neil just before he is about to leave for Apollo 11. I would not like to spoil much but the scene was full of emotions and I was just fully into the scene. I literally had goosebumps watching the scene.Verdict: It is quite sad that a beautiful film like this is not doing well in the box office for some very stupid reasons. I felt the film was great and left the cinema happy and satisfied. I look forward to see what Damien has more to offer us.I am going with a 9/10.",9,0,1,17 November 2018
Antz," Antz Review
","Antz is a film directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. I decided not to watch or read anything regarding this film before watching the film. After finally watching it, I can say that I enjoyed the whole 87 minutes of this film.Plot: Z, a worker ant decides to impersonate as a soldier ant just to impress the Princess Bala.Story and direction: The film released at a time when CGI animation was just starting. This film is also famous because of its similarities with A BUG'S LIFE. But let me tell you these two films are poles apart in terms of content. This film mainly focuses on the issue of making your own choices rather than just doing the things just because someone told you to. This theme is very relevant in modern times and it has been very clearly justified in the film. There are many adult references in the film which also made it very different considering at the time animated films were aimed for the children. Also, the designs for the characters are amazing. The voice work was aptly chosen. Finally, the music of the film was great and was like sugar to the ears. What I did have a problem with was the animation itself. Three years before this we had a film like Toy Story which is considered as a landmark in terms of animated CGI films. The animation was not impressive with this one, but I laud the effort that the makers went to in order to make this film. Favorite Scene: It would be the first interaction between Bala and Z and then the dance in the scene thereafter. This scene caught on to my mind because this particular scene justifies the basic theme of the film of doing something different than others so that you can be unique. Verdict: Although I won't say that this is one of the best animated films of all time, but I do say that this film deserves a watch. With 87 minutes as the runtime, I did feel entertained for the whole time. I never felt for a moment that the film even diverted my attention, which is a huge credit for any film.I am going with an 8/10.",8,1,3,2 July 2018
Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Impossible - III Review
","Mission: Impossible - III is a film directed by J.J. Abrams. After the dismal second instalment, I wanted something that could revamp the series and bring new energy that the series deserves. This film exactly did that.Plot: Ethan Hunt is called out of retirement when one of his trainees is captured by black market arms dealer, Owen Davian.Story and direction: This film is the debut of J.J. Abrams as a feature film director. He had a huge responsibility of bringing the franchise back on track and he delivers. The writing team (Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Orci) do know what the franchise needs, gives the fans (like me) satisfying moments that was longed for in the second part. Abrams being into spy thrillers (Alias) was the perfect choice. For the only time in the series, we do see the IMF office, which was a wonderful take. Also shown very beautifully is what happens when the professional life overtakes the personal. The characters that are newly introduced just go with the flow of the film in addition to leaving their own impression. Some of the action scenes too are just powerful and full of adrenaline. The music by Michael Giacchino is suspenseful and adds to the wonder this film has. I did like the colour palette that the film used which gave the film a very gritty and dark look. The main issue with the film is regarding the cinematography. There are certain scenes where there are close-ups for very long time and also there was a lot of shaky-cam which interrupted my viewing a couple of times. Also, there were certain scenes where some explanation or even a small description would do justice.Performances: It was good to see Tom Cruise back into action after his tireless romantic attempt in the previous instalment. Ving Rhames provides good support to Tom's character. Simon Pegg does a wonderful job as Benji. So does Michelle Monaghan as Julia. Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup are great in their performances. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are awesome as IMF agents. And finally, Philip Seymour Hoffman is probably the best villain the M: I series had. He is ruthless and cunning. Philip nailed his role perfectly.Favourite Scene: It would be the one where Ethan tries to exact information from Owen by threatening him to throw him out of the plane. Without any fear, Owen replies that he will find every loved one of Ethan's and kill them right in front of him. This scene showed the devilish side of Owen and I was impressed.Verdict: Even with its flaws, Mission: Impossible - III serves as a good film with loads of suspense and action scenes and ample of entertainment. I am going with an 8/10.",8,1,1,23 July 2018
Source Code," Source Code Review
","Source Code is a film directed by Duncan Jones. I had this film on the back of my mind. So I decided yesterday night to actually watch the film. And man, I was highly impressed.Plot: Colter Stevens is sent into a computed reality to find a bomber on a train.Story and direction: I have seen many time travel movies but none like this. The concept was fantastic. Kudos to writer Ben Ripley and director Duncan Jones for successfully creating a world where this is possible. Every second is utilized properly. Never do you feel bored in this 90 minute film. Also the characterization is so perfect. For every minute of the film, you feel for your lead character. You are connected with the character on screen. Also, I didn't see any sort of trailer for this film, which was an added advantage as I could enjoy the film very nicely. Also the editing was razor sharp and crisp. It felt like a nice flow, which is what makes a film believe-able. The cinematography is awesome too. But there were some flaws for me. The VFX was a bit fake. I could know in some scenes where green screens were actually used. Also towards the climax, the film felt a little bit cliched.Performances: Jake Gyllenhaal has always impressed me and he cotinued to do in this film too. He acted his role so perfectly. Michelle Monaghan was also good for the part given to her. Vera Farmiga was also impressive. The complexity given to her added a different layer to her character that accentuated her performance too. Jeffrey Wright was good too. Favorite Scene: No spoilers, but there is a phone call scene during the climax of the film which really touched me. That displayed Jake Gyllenhaal's character at his peak.Verdict: This film was a great use of my 90 minutes. While watching the film I was never bored. This is a highly recommended film for those who like mind-bending movies. I assure you it is worth a watch.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8,0,0,29 March 2018
It," It 1 Review
","It is a film directed by Andy Muschetti. I remember watching the trailer when it launched and I was scared to hell. So my expectations for this film were quite huge. After watching this film, I can say that this film is horror at its best. Plot; Bill and his friends decide to spend the summer investigating about Bill's missing brother, Georgie.Story and direction: From the first scene itself, the mood gets set. It signified that the ride is not for the faint hearted. Never for a moment I felt that there were jump scares. And when there was a scare I literally had goosebumps, The story also was quite good. I liked the approach to separate the film into 2 chapters: One of the children and other for the adult part. This allowed for the story to be streamlined and focused. The characters, especially the Losers' club, were interesting. Each one of them had a kind of backstory that could be related to. The way this film handles and highlights issues related to children was impressive. The production design for the town of Derry was spot on. The makeup and VFX was amazing. It was as if I was looking at a real creepy clown. But the film had some issues for me. I felt the supposed love angle between Ben-Beverly-Bill was forced into the screenplay. Also the kid that starts cursing every second was very irritatting. I know that this film is R rated, but seriously to have a kid of 12-13 cursing is little bit overboard.Performances: Bill Skarsgard nailed it as Pennywise. He looked crepy each and every second he appeared on screen. He emoted the character of the psychotic clown effortlesly. Jaeden Lieberher was great as Bill. Finn Wolfhard had already impressed me in Stranger Things, he continues to impress here too.Jeremy Taylor was quite cute looking to the eyes but he too delivered an earnest performance. Spohia Lillis was also impressive as Beverly. Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs and Jack Dylan Grazer all delivered awesome performanances. Favorite Scene: It woule be the one where the kids go to Bill's home to see the town plan of Derry on a projector. But then Eddie doesn't feel well and tells Bill to stop his presentation. And suddenly just out of nowhere the projector changes slides on its own and then Pennywise appears in the slieds and then leaps out of the slides. The mood, tension and scare factor was what made this scene stand out from the rest for me.Verdict: For those who think you will see a Stranger Things (which I love btw) on film, you are absolutely wrong. This film is way different both thematically and tonally from the famous series. I loved It and can't wait for the second part.I am going with a 8.5/10.",8,0,1,12 February 2018
A Star Is Born," A Star Is Born Review
","A Star is Born is a film co-written and directed by Bradley Cooper. This film has been on my radar from the day it was announced. The trailers came and I kind of loved the vibe and knew that this film was going to be one of the best. After watching it last night, I knew that my movie senses were in the right direction.Plot: Jackson Maine, an alcoholic and drug addict musician falls in love with a much younger singer, Ally.Story and direction: This film has been shown before in India in the form of Aashiqui 2. All of the people loved the music but I was one of the few people who did like the film too. So for me while I was starting the film, I kind of knew the story and the territory I was stepping into. What I did like about the film was its approach. This particular story has been shown three times before and its natural for people to think as to what else can be done. But Bradley has done a fantastic job in making the film his own and marking himself as a fantastic director. In each and every scene you do feel what the characters are going through and what is their mind-set. For most of the run-time, I was invested in the film. The film also very beautifully highlights both the negatives and positives of being a celebrity and how it affects your lives. The cinematography of the film is just awesome. Each and every frame of the film is just fascinating to look at. The concert scenes are very well directed. But the film does have places where the pace kind of goes down and you feel not very invested in that particular scene.Performances: Bradley Cooper does a great job both kin terms of physicality and acting. He delivers a phenomenal performance. But the main star of the film is obviously Lady Gaga. I have heard few of her songs which proves her mettle as a singer but she is a wonderful actress too. She gives her best performance and it's difficult to digest that this is her first film. Sam Elliot also gives a standout performance. He sometimes does make you emotional and you understand the plight of his character. Andrew Dice Clay and Dave Chapelle also give some good performances.Music: The film has some great songs thanks to Lady Gaga, Luke Nelson and a whole lot of others. I decided not to hear any one of the songs before watching the movie. And that turned out to be great. 'Shallow' obviously is awesome and is getting a lot of accolades. Another one that caught my ear was 'Always remember Us This Way'.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Jack proposes to Ally. The reason as to why this particular scene caught my eye was because I wasn't expecting that and also the proposal was done in the most creative way possible.Verdict: A STAR IS BORN is definitely a film that I loved and would recommend all romance and music lovers to watch. This film has a quite unique approach which might not sit right with many, so I do understand if you will not like the film. But anyways, I did love the film.I am going with a 9/10.",9,1,2,26 January 2019
Wind River," Wind River Review
","Wind River is a film written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. I remember watching his previously written ventures Sicario and Hell and High Water, but those two didn't give a blow to me. This film does and in the most realistic way possible. I saw the film with not much expectations but I after watching it I have a certain respect for this film.Plot: Jane and Cory try to find out the killer of a Native American teenager whose body is found on ice.Story and direction: The film starts off with a very good poem about meadows. Although I thought that this was just done to get the groove of the film going on, it's somewhat later that I realized the reason for that poem. As the film progresses and we are introduced to our characters and the main crux of the story, we see the inner pain some characters have gone through. The backstory given to these characters is quite emotional. I could resonate with the kind of sadness they are facing. And then we get to see government regulations that restrict people to certain extent. That thing was quite beautifully shown. That wasn't forced as done in normal films. As for faults, I did find the final act to be quiet rushed and left quite open ended. But that's just me being a bit nit picky.Performances: Jeremy Renner was the show-stealer in this film for me. As his character Cory enters the film, you could see the anguish and guilt on his face. Elizabeth Olsen was also good which I didn't expect from her. Her character of being introduced to some new things in her society was great. And she emoted the character to the T. The rest of the supporting characters were great too.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Cory tries to comfort Martin about his daughter's loss as Cory had also lost her own daughter too. And the thing that he said about the good news and bad news were actually the ones that affected me a lot. Also immediately after Martin tells Cory to find the person who did this to her daughter. There you can see a father's anguish and pain.Verdict: Beware, that this film is not for the faint hearted. This film has some very disturbing things that his you very hard. The film is extremely dark. Hats off to Taylor and team for pulling off a gutsy subject like this.I am going to go with a 9/10.",9,4,6,14 October 2017
Darkest Hour," Darkest Hour Review
","Darkest Hour is a film directed by Joe wright. At first when I watched the trailer for this film, I was impressed seeing Gary Oldman. He was almost unrecognizable. And after the film festivals said that he was the top choice for Best Actor, I felt that I should give this film a watch. Finally, After watching this film I can say that everyone was right.Plot: During he early 1940's Winston Churchill is elected as prime minister of UK much to the dismay of many people.Story and direction: Let me say very frankly that I had doubts regarding this film since the very initial reviews for this film in IMDB were not that good. But after the film released the my faith in this film got restored. Yes the film has faults in certain places but I can still say that it is a decent watch. The film starts off quite nicely. We can feel the tension that is mounting on screen. Then we immediately shift to Churchill and his life. The portrayal of him was what made much of the film. Also the characters surrounding his personal life were good in their own way. The characters of the parliament were captivating. Kudos to the makeup and production design team. The atmosphere of the 1940 was very well maintained. Also the photography. It was spectacular. It never felt superficial. I felt like I was living during that era. The story started off great initially. But after an hour or so the pace seems to be a bit uneven. But again during the scenes towards the climax the pace is regained. Also the film felt quite cliched from the political perspective like people not liking Churchill, deciding for no confidence vote, etc...Performances: Gary Oldman deserves a standing ovation and all the praise he is getting. That first scene in his bedroom where he is with a cigar, wine and English breakfast sealed his fate. I mean after some four hour makeup, who can maintain a diction like that? Kudos to him. Kristin Scott Thomas was great too as Churchill's caring and supportive wife. Lily James' role although was limited but she was impressive. She continues to prove that she is a great actress. Ben Mendelsohn was also good as the King.Ronald Pickup and Stephen Dillane were equally significant in their roles.Favorite Scene: Many would say the speech scenes were great. And it would be a very easy statement just for anyone since they are meant to create impact. But for me it would be the scene in the London Underground with the commoners. I didn't kind of expect that scene. But still the sense of responsibility towards the people and knowing what the people want is what attarcted me to this particular scene.Verdict: Even with its flaws, this film is a intense and applaudable in its own way. Joe wright very meticulously interweaved this film. Although the film is titled Darkest Hour, I would say that my 2 hours were well spent.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8,0,3,14 February 2018
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel Review
","Captain Marvel is a film co-written and directed by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. To be very honest, the trailers and promotional material didn't excite me for the film and so as a result my expectations from this film were not very huge. In short, I would say that this film was quite a satisfactory watch for me.Plot: Vers, a member of the Starforce is the only hope when Earth becomes the target of an intergalactic conflict.Story and direction: MCU has grown over the years and when you have in mind to watch a film from this universe, it has a certain bar set for itself. Well since MCU is one of the most successful franchises to date, this film knew that without even promoting people will sure be attracted to watch this new venture. So, in short, I went into the halls a blank slate having no expectations what-so-ever. This film is neither bad (as many trolls suggested) nor great. For me, it was a decent film. The good is the technicality the film has. The VFX is as usual awesome and you have wide angle shots and CGI that doesn't feel mis-placed. A big hats-of from my side to the team for the de-aging effects. OMG. It felt as if I was seeing a younger Sam Jackson and Clark Gregg. The action scenes felt quite natural to me and were just quite good. The marvel brand of comedy is there and you are surely entertained by it. But what did feel lacking for me was the character development. I was not really invested into a character and cared for them. That's what you want from any film. Yes, the film was entertaining and good but what good is a film when you really don't have anyone you can pinpoint on after watching the movie. Where is that lasting effect? The film too doesn't have its own voice. Also, the score was pretty average. In an action scene, apparently a pop song just plays in the background which felt too out of place.Performances: Brie Larson for me did a fair job. She has what it takes to carry a movie on her own shoulders (this being much different from her much acclaimed ROOM). Samuel L Jackson is just awesome and it's just a treat to watch him in this universe. Ben Mendelsohn actually surprised me. He was good. Jude Law, Djimon Honsou, Lee Pace and Gemma Chan were good additions to the film. Clark Gregg had a small yet effective role. Lashana Lynch was really bad-ass. And so was Annette Bening. A special mention to Goose. OMG, the cat is so adorable.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Vers and Nick Fury have a conversation in the bar interviewing each other on whether they are Skrulls or not. That scene was funny and entertaining at the same time and the MCU we know for quite a long time now.Verdict: I would say that this film is quite weaker than the previous MCU films we have seen in recent times. But for me this was a decent watch. Don't really believe the trolls. Make a judgement on your own. I am really interested to see how this character is incorporated into future films as well as the upcoming finale of AVENGERS. Be sure to watch the dedication to Stan Lee. That man is a legend and the tribute to him was just great. Yup, don't forget to watch the mid-credits. Post-credits can surely be forgotten.I am going with a 7/10.",7,1,7,22 March 2019
Aquaman," Aquaman Review
","Aquaman is a film co-written and directed by James Wan. I remember being the few people who actually liked the trailer and what it was actually going for. I was with the film from the beginning. After watching it today, it felt like an adventure filled ride.Plot: Arthur Curry, the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.Story and direction: I have adored James Wan as a director for quite a long time. I even liked his film Furious 7 (maybe I will go on to say the best the series had). So, with the film I was quite positive that I would fully understand as to what Wan wants to achieve. And he totally achieves it in this film. His vision is huge and he does complete justice to it. The film is a big celebration of CGI and style. The action scenes are wonderfully choreographed and filmed on wide angles, which hugely impressed me. The creature designs and production design are impressive. Also, the comedy is just spot on. I laughed at even the smallest joke that was cracked. The emotional aspect of the film, although very small, was just great. The characterization for most of the characters were spot on. They were not perfect which is what I liked. The musical score was fabulous. The VFX was great and in 3D it just was awesome. Some things that bogged me down was the runtime. At times, it does feel that the film was dragging. Also, the first act did feel a bit rushed and I did feel that they could have built on certain aspects of that act. Orm as a villain was a bit cliched. He didn't have any such motivation for his actions.Performances: Jason Mamoa lived through the role of Arthur Curry. From the first scene onwards, he just makes you believe that he is strong. Amber Heard complements Jason's character nicely. Patrick Wilson was good with what he was given to do. William Dafoe was good as Nuis Vulko. Yahta Abdul Mateen II was bad-ass. It was god to see Dolph Ludgren. Finally, Nicole Kidman and Temeura Morrison were great as Aquaman's parents.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene with Arthur and Mera on the Sahara. That scene was very funny. The jokes were spot on. Adding to that, the scenery was just awesome.Verdict: If you enjoy big adventure and CGI filled action films, then this film is perfect for you. If not, then I would advise to stay away from the film. Yes, the film is not perfect and has some flaws, but I did have a fun time with the film. If the makers are planning a sequel they surely have excited me. The DC Extended Universe has definitely redeemed itself and I am looking forward to its future films.I am going with an 8/10.",8,1,1,22 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 Review
","Deadpool 2 is a film directed by David Leitch. The trailers for this film looked fantastic. And, since I liked the first one I was looking forward to this film. And yes, Team Deadpool has delivered is what I can say.Plot: Deadpool must save Firefist from Cable, a time travelling soldier, who has a grudge on him.Story and direction: From the first shot itself, the mood is set. I also liked the way they actually had a kind of James-Bond song for the film. The film doesn't feel like a studio film who just wants to make money out of a successful venture. I can give that credit to the team. It retains the things that made the first film a success and just develops on that. Also, we do get to see Deadpool getting a whole lot of drama, which was something I wasn't expecting. But that was good since I got to see a whole new persona of Deadpool. And this film just doesn't feel like a set-up for future instalments which normally is the trend now in Hollywood. Since we have David Leitch on the director's chair, how is it not possible for the action scenes to be awesome? The score by Tyler Bates was awesome. I am a fan of the kind of music he incorporates to his films. Also the VFX has improved from the last time, although still there was one particular sequence that just felt CG-ed to mess. AS with the last film, I felt much wasn't going on in the story department. It's a kind of story that is seen before. Since the makers wanted to introduce a human aspect to the film, I felt the jokes were little less than the previous part.Performances: Ryan Reynolds juts embraces this character of Dedapool. You just can't picture anyone else, since he is just perfect. Josh Brolin just proves that he is a brilliant actor who just can do any kind of role. T J Miller and Morena Baccarin were good too. Karan Soni's was also fantastic in what he was given. Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand also provided good support. Julian Dennison gave an earnest performance. Last but not the least I felt Domino was just superb.Favorite Scene: It would be the one between Colossus and Deadpool during the final fight. I remember laughing so hard in that scene. The kind of chemistry these 2 characters have is like no other.Verdict: Even with a few flaws, I still thought that Deadpool 2 was an entertaining film. I had a great time watching the film. Hopefully, the future films will be as good as or even better than this one. If I have to compare with the first part, I will say that the first part was better. Do wait for the mid credit scenes. I just loved that. It was so hilarious. I am going with an 8/10.",8,2,5,24 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor: Ragnarok Review
","Thor: Ragnarok is a film directed by Taika Waititi. The trailers that had come for the film excited me quite a bit for this venture. And somewhere in my heart, I felt that this was going to be the best Thor films. NAd after seeing the film, I can say in all happiness that it is.Plot: Thor imprisoned in Sakaar must escape the place and save Asgard from the wrath of Hela.Story and direction: Right from the very first shot of the film, you get the film will be an entertaining one. Thor, I guess was not utilized nicely in the previous 2 solo ventures, because of which many people didn't love the films. The first 2 films were OK but had nothing that made it special. But Taika Waititi takes all of what we know about Thor and gives his own kind of spin. This film is a fun filled ride from the start to the finish. But this film is just not about jokes. It has a wonderfully written story woven into it. The characterization is awesome in this film. And I can go on with the VFX of the film. The 3D just enhanced the fabulous and stunning VFX of the film. I liked the Game of Thrones reference in the film (the scene where actors enact scenes from the previous films). The score of the film was awesome too, It was soothing to listen to 'The Immigrant Song'. Given that at least 80% of this film was improvised (as Taika Waititi suggests), this is a great film. Because it takes only moments when improvisation just goes haywire. But this film is not all perfect. The faults I noticed were with the finale, where I could see how the film will end. And also the jokes. They say that too much of everything can be harmful. In the same way, I can say that the jokes at one point became little too much.Performances: Chris Hemsworth was once again great as Thor. This film gave a whole new dimension to the character. Tom Hiddleston was again great as Loki. Anthony Hopkins was also good as Odin. Tessa Thompson was fabulous as Valkyrie. Hope to see her in future MCU ventures. Jeff Goldblum was amazing as the Grandmaster. It was always a delight to see him. Taika Waititi was good as Korg. Didn't know the director had this talent hidden under him. Idris Elba and Karl Urban were also great in their roles. Bruce Banner was very funny in the Hulk scenes especially. And finally, Cate Blanchett. She was one hell of a badass in the entire film. The viciousness was excellently portrayed by her.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be during the final scenes, where Thor helpless says his father that he won't be able to defeat Hela because she is too strong. But then Odin says, that he is stronger than Odin himself. That scene impacted me a lot and said that people must never give up and believe that everything is possible if you put your mind to it.Verdict: Thor: Ragnarok is certainly the best of the Thor trilogy. And it has opened up new dimensions in the MCU franchise. Just can't wait for the next MCU film, Infinity War. And yes, there is a mid and post credit scene.I am going to go with an 8.5/10.",8,1,7,4 November 2017
Ready Player One," Ready Player One Review
","Ready Player One is a film directed by Steven Speilberg. I had this film on my watchlist since the film was announced as the plot-line of the film intrigued me. Also, the trailers of the film looked quite promising which increased my anticipation for this film more. After having watched the film last night, I can say that I was satisfied.Plot: Follows Wade and his group of friends, who have to retrieve an Easter Egg in the Virtual Reality world of the OASIS before Nolan Sorrento from IOI does.Story and direction: I have been a fan of Spielberg films and it was good to have him back in the zone he is best known for: adventure filled films. This film is a joyride. From the story to the visuals, everything is breathtakingly gorgeous. From the first visual, you can see the meticulous detail Speilberg and his team have gone through to portray the digital and real worlds. I was just in awe. But that's not only it. The story has a message underneath this sparkling and dazzling adventure. Its shown that how people engross themselves in technology so much that they forget to differentiate between what is real and what is virtual. Also shown nicely is the way how people disguise themselves in the virtual world. Some of the pop culture references are just spot on. I can imagine the hard work that must have been endured to ensure this. The make-up work is so good that I believed that the actors were really that age they are portraying on the screen. Janusz Kaminski as the cinematographer is just awesome in his camera work. Michael Kahn and Sarah Broshar have done some great editing. Although I do miss John Williams' score, but that doesn't go to say that Alan Silvestri has done a fantastic job (including bringing back his famous Back to the Future theme). Some places that needed improvement was surely the finale which felt stretched. Due to which I think the length of the film could have been shorter. Also, the villains needed a lot of worked. They were cliched and did not have any specific motive other than just wanting the Easter Egg.Performances: Tye Sheridan just knocked it out of the park. Same can be said for Olivia Cooke. It was good to see Lena Waithe in mainstream cinema and hope to see her in some other ventures. Philip Zhao and Win Morisaki gave decent performances. It is always a delight to see Simon Pegg. Mark Rylance lived the role he was offered. T J Miller has provided some awesome voice-work in the film. Ben Mendelsohn and Hannah John-Kamen were good but the characterization for their characters was not there, which made them look dull and boring.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Wade and Samantha meet for the first time in the real world. The scene was so beautiful that it is quite difficult to express that in words.Verdict: READY PLAYER ONE for me is a visual treat and I enjoyed my time watching the film. If big action scenes along with a CGI fest, is your cup of tea, you are in for a feast. Otherwise, I don't recommend the film.I am going with an 8/10.",8,1,3,25 November 2018
"I, Tonya"," I, Tonya Review
","I, Tonya is a film directed by Craig Gillespie. I hadn't known about this film until, I heard about the Golden Globe nominations. This film also got some rave reviews, which increased my curiosity for the film. So I finally decided to give it a watch without watching any trailers. And I can say that I wasn't disappointed.Plot: The life and times of Tonya Harding, a professional ice skater and the 1994 controversy that led to her subsequent downfall.Story and direction: This film is not your conventional biopic. The makers decided a different way to go about it, which works quite a lot in the film. It employs the fourth wall breaking and mockumentary technique, which fascinated me a lot. The characters also are varied and interesting. We have Tonya who from her childhood itself was hardened to become strong and stand for herself. Then is LaVona, Tonya's mother, who is very hard on her and wants to make her daughter stand on her own and fight for herself. We also have Jeff, Tonya's husband, who has various shades for his character. And finally, Shawn, Jeff's friend, who is that dumb person everyone has in their life. The skating shots also looked very real. It never felt that a stunt double was doing the skating and it was edited so beautifully to make it look like one shot. The selection of music is great too. I felt like dancing in each of the soft rock numbers that played on screen. But this film has some issues that bug me. For instance, towards the last act the film felt quite rushed. And also some characters were just kind of not given that screen space which should have been done. Performances: Margot Robbie did it again. She never failed to impress. From sad to happy she yet again proves how fine an actress she is. Sebastian Stan was also great. I didn't expect this kind of a performance out of him. Allison Janney just killed it. The way she adapted to LaVona Harding was awesome. She just mesmerized me. Bobby Cannavale was restricted to only the interview parts of the film, but still it's always fun to watch him. Favorite Scene: The scene where LaVona warns Tonya about Jeff right after Tonya's wedding. We see a mother's worry and a daughter just not caring about what the mother thinks of her choice. This is the kind of scene that takes place between every mother and daughter even now, which touched me a lot.Verdict: Although there are a few hiccups, I, Tonya doesn't have a single dull moment. I liked the not-so conventional take on a biopic. Do watch this film for some awesome performances and the great soundtrack.I am going with an 8/10.",8,2,3,16 January 2018
BlacKkKlansman," BlacKkKlansman Review
","BlacKkKlansman is a film co-written and directed by Spike Lee. The acclaim surrounding this film along with it being in the Oscars compelled me to watch the film. After watching it, I can say that this film is pure entertainment.Plot: Follows Ron Stallworth, a police detective in the Colorado Spring PD and his attempt to infiltrate the local Ku Klux Klan.Story and direction: To be very honest, I haven't watched most of Spike Lee's ventures except for INSIDE MAN which to me was quite a different kind of thriller. So watching this film for me I had no expectations whatsoever. But having said that I was mesmerized by the sheer brilliance this film had. Each and every frame had a uniqueness and beauty in it. I am not saying that the film is perfect, but it was great to watch. The writing of the film is so intelligent that in scenes of tension they introduce certain things that make it a delight to watch. The subtle comedy is to watch out for and I can understand many people not getting that. The use of music and the songs played in the background are just awesome. You feel like you are in the 70's and living in the era. The film is basically about racism and a big salute from my side to the makers for portraying this aptly (although I still have heard from various sources that certain things were not correctly depicted). With that being said, I still felt the film would have been better if the runtime was trimmed a bit. Also, the romantic subplot made no sense and I didn't feel any need for it.Performances: Let me say that I just love Denzel Washington. He has a charm and that hasn't faded up until now. Now watching his son in the film, I even fell in love with him. He lives up to his father's name and I want to see more of him. Adam Driver doesn't have much of a role but he shines with what was given to him. Laura Harrier was OK. Ryan Eggold and Jasper Paakkonen were great. And so were Topher Grace and Ashlie Atkinson. Robert John Burke and Fred Weller also do deserve some praise.Favorite Scene: The scene comes quite early in the film where Ron is a rookie and he is kept in the archives section and Andy comes in to ask for a file on a 'toad'. He replies that there are no toads here but human beings. He gives him the file anyway and after Andy exits, Ron does some kind of hand movements. What got me in this scene was the comedy, I was laughing throughout the scene.Verdict: Many people will actually not get this film and honestly if this film would have come out a few years ago, my review would have been entirely different to the one I have written now. I had a blast watching this film and Spike Lee is definitely a director that is on my watchlist.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8,3,7,16 February 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man: Homecoming Review
","Spider-Man Homecoming is a film directed by Jon Watts. Finally, I got to see my favorite superhero in the MCU. I was hoping for that secretly in my mind after the disastrous Amazing Spider Man 2. And yes, I was very much satisfied with this version of the Spiderman.Plot: Peter Parker tries to balance out high school and his wants to be a part of the Avengers.Story and direction: Going into this film I knew that nothing could be the Sam Raimi trilogy. I mean I keep that at my top favorite super hero films. But I had some expectations and it had been fulfilled to the most. But people do have to keep in mind certain things that have occurred in the previous films, because these are all connected. Many people have said this film to not show Uncle Ben and Peter being bit by a web. We have already seen that in 2 versions. If this film would have shown that too, I would have thought that 'Yeah, they just want to pass their time.' Now lets see some supporting characters. Ned was my favorite. The way he supports Peter and also adds some level of comedy was good. Michelle at times felt irritating. Tony was good for the amount of screen time he received. Pepper Potts was back which was unexpected. I liked her in the Iron Man trilogy and would like to see further where this character would go. And a special mention to Vulture/Adrian Toomes. I liked this villain. He has this personal vendetta which added something to his character. I guess this is one of the best villains MCU has given. Regarding some flaws in the film. I guess it is basically the time-line. They say the events of this film takes place 8 years after The Avengers which doesn't make sense. Because Civil war showed us the events (of Avengers) to be taking place in 2012. And Happy's statement regarding something in 2008 too contradicts the time-line. Also Shocker was not given much importance in the film. The 2nd post credit scene was basically some kind of joke about patience which I liked considering the way we wait for Post Credit scenes in MCU. The design for the costumes both the rough one that Peter wears during the second half and the one that Stark gives him was great. But I hated the costume Stark was supposed to give him in the final scene. Thank God, Peter didn't take that. The AI part in the costume was also good. That was something different I never expected. There were some scenes in the trailers that didn't make it to the final cut like: Iron Man and Spidey being together and flying, Tony saying to Peter that you don't need to worry about the 'Flying Monster Guy' and an alternate type of entry for Vulture. I hoped these scenes would be there but unfortunately were not.Acting: Tom Holland rocked in his role both as Spidey and Peter. Jacob Batalon was great as Ned. His comic timing was spot on. Zendaya was good and irritating (in terms of her character) too. Micheal Keaton was great as Adrian and Vulture. Laura harrier was also good as Liz. Tony Revolori was also good as Flash Thompson (a somewhat non-white take in the character that I liked). Finally, Team Iron Man (Downey, Favreau and Paltrow) were bad-ass in their appearances.Favorite Scene: The scene where Tony asks for Peter's suit back because of the Ferry incident. I guess that added a new layer to the film because Peter had to prove himself to Stark without the suit. And as Stark rightly 'If you are nothing without the suit, you are nothing'. Meaning that it is not any suit that makes you a superhero, but the responsibility of service to people that makes you a superhero.Verdict: Overall, I had a great time watching this film. Although it had some flaws but still it was an enjoyable experience. At least, better than Amazing Spiderman 2. I hope to see another great solo Spider-Man film and waiting for his appearance in the Avengers too.I am going to go with an 8.5/10",8,14,25,10 July 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Review
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a film written and directed by Martin McDonagh. I hadn't seen a trailer for this film nor heard of the director. Seeing the Golden Globe nominations got this film to my notice. And I can say that this is one of the best films of this year.Plot: Mildred Hayes has three billboards outside the town much to many people's dismay.Story and direction: This film doesn't deal with the subject of rape but with the effects that a voice can have when it is displayed on a thing like a billboard. I liked the variation each of the main characters had. Lets start with Mildred. She always has a kind of rudeness which remains constant throughout the entire film. That can be because she has hardened up because of the incidents that have happened. She also breaks down at certain moments in the film which was the perfect way of her emoting her sadness. Now about Chief William; he is one of those who wants to abide by the law. That was very well written in the screenplay and how he is not able to do anything is very well shown. Now about Jason Dixon. He is one of those characters who just has about a problem in anything. But the sudden change in his character during the second half of the film was quite appreciated. The film has also very nicely interwoven the reactions and actions taken by people because of Mildred's action. The film is very beautifully shot, thanks to cinematographer Ben Davis. The colors which are transcended on screen look very real. An engaging background music by Carter Burwell also contributes to the greatness of this film. A fault that I felt, which may be me only, was towards the ending where I felt that it wasn't quite necessary.Performances: Frances McDormand was great in her role. The variations in her role were well emoted by her. Woody Harrelson was good in the role written for him. Sam Rockwell was the highlight of this film. The variations that his character had were like none. Lucas Hedges was a great addition to this cast. Abbie Cornish looked quite honest in her role. Clarke Peters too delivered an honest performance. Peter Dinklage will always be loved no matter how long the role.Favorite Scene: The very first scene where Mildred just goes to the ad agency and just says what has to be written on the three billboards. The dialogue delivery and mood created in that scene was great and that attracted me to this scene.Verdict: I would say that I was floored with this film. It is filled with Award worthy performances and one of the best 2017 had to offer.I am going with a 9/10.",9,2,5,1 January 2018
Ant-Man," Ant-Man Review
","Ant-Man is a film directed by Peyton Reed. Back in 2015, when I saw the trailers for the film I was quite excited for the film. But not knowing much about the character I still had doubts. But I had a blast watching the film. Three years later as the sequel to this film is approaching, I felt it was the perfect time to review this film.Plot: Hank Pym, a former Ant-Man mentors Scott Lang to take his place and help him with a heist.Story and direction: Knowing that Edgar Wright would have directed the film, I felt the film would be quite different from what we have got as of today. But this film is not bad. It's quite entertaining and good. Thank God, the studio retained Edgar Wright as the writer for this film. The characters except for some instantly attract you. The jokes also don't seem out of place. They feel natural to the story. The human element of emotions is quite well balanced in this film. Considering the budget was kept lower the what MCU invests in other films, I felt the VFX was at par to the previous ventures. Never for a moment I felt I was seeing CGI. Kudos to the VFX team. But as with positives, do come certain negatives. I felt as a villain Darren Cross didn't appeal to me. He was very lousy and awkward. Also there is a scene post the epic battle that was a bit over-melodramatic. And then the editing regarding some action scenes. This is where Edgar Wright would have succeeded. The editing is quite choppy which is very cringe-worthy which makes some action sequences less enjoyable.Performances: It will be very hard for me to imagine Ant-Man without Paul Rudd. I loved him and he embraced his character so nicely. Evangeline Lily was great too. Micheal Douglas was awesome. The pain, anger, sorrow he carried all those emotions with so ease. Micheal Pena was easily my favorite character each time he opens his mouth, I was bursting with laughter. T.I. and David Dastmalchian as provided great support to Rudd's character. Corey Stroll was very unimpressive. I couldn't connect with him for even one scene. Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer and Abby Forston were good. It was good to see Marvel Alum gracing this film with their presence. And finally Stan Lee. Although he comes only for about 10 seconds I always will love him.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Scott and Hope have a pep talk and Scott finally learns how to control the ants. This scene was where you could feel the strong bond between Scott and Cassie. This is why this scene resonated with me the most.Verdict: Although it misses on a few points, I do feel for an origin story it did quite a decent job. Can't wait for this character's appearance in Infinity War and also the upcoming sequel to Ant-Man.I am going with an 8/10.",8,0,0,11 March 2018
Baby Driver," Baby Driver Review
","Baby Driver is a film written and directed by Edgar Wright. When I saw the initial trailer of the film itself, I was sure that this film was going to be a blast. And yes, I was quite overjoyed with the film. I haven't seen much of Edgar's work (I have only seen Shaun of the Dead). But I can definitely say that this is one of the best action films I have seen in quite some time.Plot: baby is a getaway driver for a group of robbers led by Doc. Meeting Debora, he decides to leave this job. Can he?? Story and direction: For me, script and direction go hand in hand. If either one of these are faulty the film tends to fail. But in the case of this film, the both of these were just correct. Edgar Wright deserves full credit for this. After the film finished, I was like 'WOW'. I just couldn't stop clapping my hands. This film shows that with the right people on board for a film, you can work wonders. I mean this theme has been worked around for quite long wherein a guy with bad people always wants to get out. But when he decides to, he just realizes that it's just not easy. But the way Edgar handles this theme is just marvelous. And the car chases.... I can basically go on about them. They were just impeccable. Many people have complained about the romance slowing the pace. But, I think that was quite necessary to delve deep into the characters of Baby and Debora. But when the pace picks for the final hour, I mean I seriously had goosebumps. Each and every minute you worry about the lead pair. And finally, I would like to comment on the thing that was the soul of the film: THE MUSIC. I am not quite a keen listener to Engish songs. But man, I liked the choice of songs that were picked up for this film. Excellent work Steven Price (who also scored Suicide songs- which too had a nice pick of songs)!!!! Also, a small mention to choreographer Ryan Heffington who syncs in the action with the music seamlessly.Acting: Ansel Elgort was the star of the film. My god, what a diversity!!!! I loved him in the Fault of Our Stars and here is still proving that he is a great actor. Lily James was just like your next door girl. She was sweet, cute, bubbly, etc... Kevin Spacey was also good as Doc. Jamie Foxx was also great as the twisted Bats. Jon Hamm was also one of the highlights. During the last half hour or so, I quite liked his performance.Favorite Scene: The scene where Doc says Baby to scan the United States Post Office for cameras, exits, employees, etc... We basically can see the reluctance on Baby's face regarding the work given. And the kid, just blurting out all the info to Baby was just an icing on the cake. And the scene there after, where Baby just gives the info to Doc and the kid reminds him that he forgot something. This scene also showed that Baby was fed up of the kind of work he was doing.Verdict: I had a blast with this film. Watch this film especially for Ansel Elgort, he is a definite star in the making. if you are a music lover too, I guess this film won't disappoint. If you are an action lover too, I recommend this film.I am going with a 9/10.",9,5,10,16 September 2017
Justice League," Justice League Review
","Justice League is a film co-written and directed by Zack Snyder. I guess every superhero fan would have wanted this film and it is finally out. I have grown up watching the animated series of the DC characters. And the trailer of Justice League also showed that they might redeem themselves. But alas, I was wrong.Plot: Steppenwolf wants to find the three mother boxes in Earth and it's upto a band of superheroes before its too late.Story and direction: The film basically is 120 minutes. That is quite short for a film liked Justice League. And also that is felt in the film for many scenes. For example, like I know things that happened to Flash (courtesy tv show). But I don't what actually happened with Cyborg and Aquaman. I mean I don't want a whole kind of backstory but atleast some details could have done it. Some details are provided, but as for people who are not avid comic book readers, you feel somewhat lost. Then we have Steppenwolf. I mean except for just appearing, kicking peoples a** and taking motherboxes, he basically has nothing to do. He was the wekeat thing in this entire film. Then we have a town in the finale that has only one family. I mean I get it, that there was some radioactive explosion or something, but seriously one family!!!! They could have done with a vacant town or something like a population of 100-200 people (when Cyborg just happens to say we have resettlements going on). And the topping was Superman's face. Oh my god. Each time I felt like just turning away from the screen in those scenes. His face looked like some plastic surgery had been done. Also many things shown in the trailers were not in the film, which was disappointing. Also there is a lot of over-sexualization to the Amazonians especially Wonder Woman. That was not great at all. But its not all bad. There is some good. I liked the characterizations behind Aquaman and Barry Allen. The tone for those characters were very light and provided some entertainment. Also great were introduction to Green Lantern universe. The battles fought were awesome. My jaw dropped almost every time. The Superman ressurection was great. A special mention to Danny Elfman for his score especially the Batman tune that evoked many memories. Performances: Ben Affleck was again wonderful as Batman. The same can be said for Gal Gadot. I liked her in her solo venture and so in this film. Jason Mamoa was perfect for Aquaman and so as Ezra Miller as The Flash. Henry Cavill did quite good although much wasn't given to him. Same can also be said for Amy Adams and Diane Lane. Liked J K Simmons as Jim Gordon and hope to see him in future films. Jeremy Irons too was perfect again as Alfred. Favorite Scene: Easily would be the meeting between Lois and Clark after Clark's resurrection. The emotion that flowed in that scene just touched my heart. Verdict: To be very fair, Justice League is a one time watch. It was not the film I wanted but it is not a bad film too. It can come in the OK category. I don't know how many films are yet there in the DCEU but they seriously have to get their gear moving and stop imitiating the MCU. It's just high time.I would go with a 6/10.",6,0,1,30 December 2017
Split," Split: Movie Review
","Plot: 3 Girls are kidnapped and kept in a place by a man who suffers from multiple personality disorder. He has 23 identities of himself and warns the girls of a 24th one who is about to come.Review: This review of mine will be containing some Spoilers, so please if you haven't watched the film please don't read the review.So Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan who is mostly known for the films which have some sense of super-naturalism in it. I saw this film with huge expectations and man the expectations (if not all) were met. The film is 117 minutes long and I was invested in it for most of the time.Talking about the plot of the film. The plot started out as a somewhat normal Kidnapping type of film. But then as the story progresses, we see that the kidnapping goes way deeper than what is was meant for. For me, the pace of the film started after 30-35 minutes or so. I guess that is when Kevin's personalities come to light. At first many people would think how the hell is Shyamalan going to manage the space for 24 personalities. But yes he does. Hats off for that. I also for some time wondered what the hell does Casey's backstory have to do with this. But you see that the backstory is an integral part of Casey. Also we do have a Dr. Karen who's character is fleshed out quite good who tries to help our protagonist (antagonist).Now about the performances. James McAvoy (who I better know as Professor Charles Xavier of X men) killed it. The personalities were portrayed by him were near perfect. I especially like the characters of Patricia and Hedwig. The 24th character (Beast) was not too convincing for me (Maybe I have a taste for violent films, so that is why I was expecting some gore in that part). Anna Taylor as Casey was also great. Actually if you see it is a film about the way how both Casey and Kevin deal with the abuse in their childhood in the present day. The film shows the contrast between these 2 behaviors in a very nice way. The role of Betty too as the caring doctor was great.My Favorite scene would be towards the climax where Casey tells Kevin's whole name. Kevin comes to his normal self and asks Casey to kill him. But then the other personalities of Kevin come and scare off Casey. As I said above, the Beast wasn't too convincing for me, but Casey's fear during the scene actually made up for the horror that was needed for the scene.Spoiler reveal: (which I had actually known for quite some time). We see Bruce Willis in the end as David Dunn sitting in a cafe watching a news about Kevin. Many Unbreakable fans (as myself) would be quite happy seeing that. Many people were waiting for a sequel to a Unbreakable. And I am happy we have got something close to that. Shyamalan too has said that his next film will be in this U/S U (My abbreviation for Unbreakable/Split Universe). So can't wait for David vs Kevin (if that would be the plot for the next film in this universe).Final word: Split is actually a great film. Do watch out for the great performance by James McAvoy. Although little loose during the start, but once it keeps the grip it never loosens it till the very last scene. The opening and closing credits are also done in a quite interesting way.So for me Split is an 8/10 film.",8,4,14,8 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 Review
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a film directed by David Yates. Since this was the second last instalment, my anticipation for this one was sky high. And after watching the film, I can say that that film exceeded all my expectations.Plot: Harry, Ron and Hermione team up to destroy the secret to his immortality - Horcruxes.Story and direction: This film started the trend of the last part being split up to two films. But I can say without doubt that none have achieved the level of greatness that this film achieved. As I have stressed in the previous instalments, the character work in this film is just like no other film series. The makers know what the audience expects and just taps on to that. From the very first scene you know that the stakes are real and the setting itself made me worry for the safety of the characters. We have some amazing action sequences in the film which are very beautifully shot and nicely edited. The film mostly takes place between the 3 main characters of the film. And it never feels boring just to watch them doing what they are great at. Alexandre Desplat's score is just amazing. The sets and camera work for the film is beautiful. The VFX is the best the series has to offer. Some characters do suffer consequences and you do feel sad for them. The film does end in a cliffhanger but that will not disappoint as it is known the film will continue.Performances: Daniel Radcliffe was great as Harry Potter. The emotional depth this character has is deep and you feel for him. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is just great. For the first time in the series, I felt the emotional side of this character. Rupert Grint successfully portrays a different side of Ronald Weasley. This film does introduce Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour. The role is small but good enough to leave an impression. Also introduced here is Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood. I did feel the role was good but a bit unnecessary.Favorite Scene: It would be a scene when Harry decides to cheer Hermione when she is sad by having a small dance with her. This scene showed the maturity and understanding these characters have for each other. I came to know from somewhere that this scene was nowhere in the book. So it is a big pat on the makers' back for innovating something new and presenting us in a good way.Verdict: For a second last film in a franchise, this film does justice. It sets up scenes for what is about to come and makes us ready for some consequences that might not just be in our favour. Thanks again to David Yates, Steve Kloves and the entire team of Harry Potter for bringing us a franchise that knows how to treat a particular story with respect. I can't just wait for the final instalment.I am going with a 10.",10,1,2,12 July 2018
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine Review
","Little Miss Sunshine is a film directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. I had heard of this film once from my friend who would go on praising the film. Yesterday night when I had nothing to see my sister suddenly decided to see this. After the film finished, I was just flabbergasted.Plot: A road trip is taken by the Hoover family from Albuquerque to Los Angeles to attend the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for their young daughter, Olive.Story and direction: The film has a very simple story but yet its heart is in the right place. Although the film revolves around only 6 characters, but yet they are so varied. I felt an instant connection with all the characters. The pace of the story is good also. Never do you feel a dull moment. It's comedy which is in bits and pieces also works. Kudos to Micheal Arndt for the wonderful writing. Considering the budget in which the film was made, the result is awesome. The troubles and ways to get out of those troubles with a smile is perfectly shown in this film. The film gives the perfect message that whatever happens, just never give up. The film had such authenticity in its feel which is what attracted me even more to the film. Performances: Greg Kinnear was great. Toni Collette was awesome too. I didn't know Steve Carell was such a talented actor. He nailed this role. Paul Dano was awesome too. Alan Arkin was exceelent as the foul mouthed elderly member. Abigail Breslin was good too. My heart went out for her. It was good to see Bryan Cranston and Dean Norris although they have roles in only one scene.Favorite Scene: The scene where Olive doubts about her position in the competition and then Edwin instills confidence in her was my favorite scene. This particular scene perfectly defined the main theme that the film was going for.Verdict: This 101 minute ride is worth the watch. This again goes to prove that with the right talent and the right script, the film can work wonders. It's a must watch for those who feel they haven't achieved anything in life.It gets a well deserved 10/10.",10,0,1,30 January 2018

","Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is a film directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman. The trailers of the film excited me a lot (Of Course, its Spidey!) and I anticipated this film for a long time. After seeing it today, I was satisfied.Plot: Miles Morales teams up with Spider Men and Women of different universes to take down Kingpin.Story and direction: Spider Man is very close to my heart and ever since I have watched the 90's cartoon I am just a fan of this character. And this film exactly does that. It shows respect for both the character and the audience who has been loving the character for almost now 50 years. The story is engrossing and connects you instantly. You see every Spider Men/Women is not perfect and that what makes them unique. The family dynamic is very nicely highlighted in the film. You see the characters that are something in the beginning but at the end you feel for every one of them. Each of the Spider Men/Women are likable and by the end of the film I couldn't even decide which one I liked better. They melt your heart in a good way. I did like the animation also. It was closer to the comics which is never seen in any animated films of the recent times. Also liked the way the thought boxes from the comics were introduced, which I never expected. The visual effects and fight sequences are surely a treat to watch. The comedy is spot on. Every joke just made me laugh. The makers even go on and make a joke out of everything we know about Spider-Man without offending us. And lot of it was due to the intelligent writing (Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman). The voice-acting was also great and the casting was just spot-on. The score by Daniel Pemberton too was awesome. The fusion of an action-packed score along with the Afro-American songs was just so cool. If I had to pinpoint one thing that wasn't good it was Kingpin. It seemed like the makers wanted to go for an arc, but they decided not to, which made his character less interesting.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Jefferson has a heart to heart talk with his son from behind the door and Miles due to the situation he is in can't open the door. I liked the small pep-talk (if that's what it is) that a father has with his son and it inspires Miles and kind of brightens a ray of hope inside him.Verdict: I may place this film on par with the Tobey Maguire series because its' seriously that good. I was mesmerized by each and every aspect of the film. Never for a second, I felt bored or tired from watching the film. The film obviously does have a post credit scene, so will advise you to stay till the end (that is standard for any Marvel Movie). If this film has sequels or spin-offs, I am ready for them, but they better be good. If you are a Spider Man fan I am sure you won't be disappointed.For now, I am going with a 9/10.",9,3,13,15 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible Rogue Nation Review
","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. After the exciting 4th instalment, I was pumped up for this one. And it again just delivers spot-on.Plot: Ethan Hunt and his IMF team are against a rogue organisation, termed as the Syndicate who would wipe anyone out of their way to achieve their objective.Story and direction: Chris McQuarrie and Drew Pearce (co-writer) infuse their new and vibrant energy into this franchise because of which it never feels old or run out of fuel. The story is very impressive and I liked the way the film covered the previous 4 installments. I would not be wrong saying that this film was teased during the last moments of the last part. I think the makers were going in for an arc spanning 2-3 films. But that doesn't mean the film doesn't stand on its own. It does and very beautifully. There are certain characters that are stretched and explored more which I liked. Even the new characters don't seem disposable and bring a lot to the film. The action scenes are just great and never feel over the top (especially the car and bike chase set in Morocco). The VFX of the film also does wonders and adds to the beauty of the film. The music by Joe Kraemer impresses on various levels. The cinematography and editing are top-notch. The film faltered only on one aspect: the climax. Normally, I do expect the M;I finale to be a big blast and full of tension creating adrenaline moments. But here I felt the film was going the expected way and I wasn't surprised. It felt very ordinary. Maybe FALLOUT will explain those events.Performances: Tom Cruise is as usual in his best and gives a great performance. His dedication to his work and especially towards the action scenes is always felt. Jeremy Renner contributes to the film in his own special way. I liked Simon Pegg's character being more dramatic than of a comic relief. Rebecca Ferguson brings in new energy to the films and I can't wait to see her in FALLOUT. So does Alec Baldwin. Sean Harris's portrayal of Solomon Lane was kind of different and I liked the way he was characterized.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Benji confronts Ethan about Ethan sending him back to DC and Benji saying that he should be with Ethan since they are a team. This has an effect on me as it showed a different side of Benji which I never expected. Also, shown so beautifully is Ethan's concern for others.Verdict: ROGUE NATION has added another fun-filled, action-thriller ride to the M: I Series. I had a fun time with the entire series. Just waiting for FALLOUT to come. Can't wait for it.I am going with a 9/10.",9,1,1,25 July 2018
Dunkirk," Dunkirk Review
","Dunkirk is a film written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Whenever a Nolan film comes out, I am very excited. I am a fan of each and every film of his. So when I knew Nolan was going to direct a film on WW 2 I said 'He is Nolan. He won't do anything straight.' And that's what I got.Plot: Set during World War 2, this focuses on the evacuation of soldiers trapped in Dunkirk.Story and direction: Whenever I go to a Nolan film, I always expect to be surprised in every way. And Dunkirk is exactly that. It got me surprised in each and every scene. I don't expect less from a Nolan film. And since it is written by him too, you don't expect the story to be that simple. We get the story in 3 perspectives: Land, Air and Sea. And each of these have a time-line attached to them. And also we get the non linear narrative, which is Nolan's style. The most people have complained about little characterization. I don;t think we need characterization for a war film. In real time, we don't have time for any chitchat. And we don't also get to see any of the opposing forces. Which was also a change. The horror that someone is always behind you just to finish you off, was enough to keep me scared. Which I think Nolan got right. Then we have the vast production values. I heard that to minimize VFX extras and planes were actually used. Even if VFX was used, I couldn't know. It was seamless. Nolan gets a Hats Off from my side. Taking such a risk actually paid off. The sound design was awesome too. The gunshots, bombs, etc... I guess they sounded real as ever. I have never paid to sound design in any film except for this one. Ans finally Hans Zimmer. He is a genius. The BGM enhanced my interest in this film further.Acting: I guess when it comes to casting Nolan nails it. Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles were great in their roles. So as Jack Lowden and Tom Hardy. The amount of depth and conflict that Hardy's character faced every minute was riveting. Mark Rylance was exceptional. You could easily see the dedication on his face. Not to miss out Kenneth Branagh. He too was good in the limited role he had.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Cillian Murphy's character says Dawson to turn around the boat. We get to see the horror a soldier has faced and why is he scared. And then Dawson says that he is just scared. He will get over it. That scene was just picture perfect.Verdict: The film is very good but not excellent. In comparison to other war films the film is a shortfall. I actually can't fault it. Everything was perfect. But not to give it a 10.I am going with a 9/10.",9,4,13,25 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Review
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a film directed by Alfosno Cuaron. I was curious before watching this film as many critics have noted this film a turning point in the series. After watching the film, I can say that this is by far my most favorite film of this series.Plot: Harry Potter is warned about Sirius Black, a prisoner who just escaped Azkaban prison in order to kill him.Story and direction: Taking the reins from one director to another is a very risky thing sicne you have to match the expectations of the audience as well as find a way to say your voice in the film. But this film has excelled in that department. Alfonso Cuaron is successful in providing a change of tone in the film. From scene one, you know the film is going to be different from the previous two. This is very clearly known from the lighting and camera work which is just awesome. The images of certain things like the tree or the flowers depict the kind of silence this film wants to convey. But the film doesn't seem boring for even a single moment. It is never dull because it has the series comedy that defines it. The comedy is very subtle and that says how good a director Alfonso is. Also we get to some new characters in this film, which are very interesting. I especially liked the bond formed between Lupin and Potter. He was just like a mentor to him helping him out in various odd situations. The music is also great and I can just go on about it. The VFX has improved from the previous two and even today it is very much relevant. The VFX feels real and just immerses you into the fictional world that is created. And for the first time, the Quiddicth scene was just to look out for. It was gorgeous. Also to be noted is some of the animal designs in the film. They are so life-like. You feel scared by some of them and also you feel that you want to own some of them. I liked the fact that the film is shorter than the previous two since it was a good move and a long film I guess wouldn't have worked. Steve Kloves deserves a pat on the back for adapting another chapter of Harry Potter successfully. Performances: The regular cast does their job just perfectly and also adapt to the new settings. Michael Gambon is great as the new Dumbledore. Never for a moment do you miss Richard Harris. This character also has a change of characterization from the previous two which I very much liked. David Thewlis is also great in donning the role of Remus Lupin. He is the new character that I liked the most. And finally, Gary Oldman: He is just awesome. Although his scenes are lesser than the rest, but he just leaves an impact on the mind.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where the kids go to Hogsmeade and Hermione and Ron see some building. Then Malfoy and gang come and begin to tease them. After that, Harry with the help of his invisible cloak scares Malfoy and gang away. After all, who doesn't want to see Malfoy beat up!!Verdict: This film is by far the best of Harry Potter. The film did everything for me that I wanted to see in this series. And also, it makes me anxious as I can't wait to see what else it has got to offer. This goes on to prove that when you tap on to the right content and know what your audience wants, I think you can make sequels even more successful than the originals (story wise). Sequels are never cursed. It is just that the makers should know how to handle the characters and give them the respect that they deserve.I am going with a perfect 10/10.",10,2,6,6 July 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America - Civil War Review
","Captain America - Civil War is a film directed by Russo Brothers. Back in 2016, watching the trailer excited me. But due to some reasons, I couldn't watch it in the cinema. Finally, when I watched it at home, I felt so bad for not watching this film in the cinemas. But still I was satisfied since I got the best that MCU had to offer.Plot: Due to recent events, the Avengers are divided into 2 factions over an Accord that would oversee the Avengers' activities.Story and direction: Russo Brothers nailed it when it came to The Winter Soldier. They opened so new dimensions to Captain America and MCU that I couldn't think of. So when announced that they would be returning for the third installment, I was overjoyed. The story encompasses all the events that have happened in the past eight years. The theme dealt with in the film regarding those who still suffer while the Avengers win, so gets attached with you. This is what instantly got me connected. Also we get the MCU dose of entertainment which never is off. The characters, even the new ones although minimal in their roles get their due importance in this film. You can understand as to why a person makes such a decision. Same can be said for the villain too. As usual, production design and VFX are top-notch. Never does it feel artificial, it feels so natural. The action sequences are jaw-dropping. Many people complained of shaky cam been quite often used, but I didn't notice any. Henry Jackman's score is awesome to hear especially during the Bucky-Cap-T'Challa chase scene and the climax in Siberia. I couldn't fault this film even in a single bit even in my 5th viewing of this film.Performances: Chris Evans is again on par excellence as Captain America. Robert Downey Jr I guess delivered his best performance as Iron Man/Tony Stark. A special mention to Sebastian Stan for wonderfully carrying the role of Bucky Barnes. Same goes for Anthony Mackie. Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson were alos great in their appearances. I missed Hayley Atwell in this film a lot. Emily VanCamp was great. Chadwick Boseman looked promising and can't wait for his solo venture. It was good to see William Hurt Back. Daniel Bruhl also was impressive. Paul Rudd reminded me again why he is perfect Ant-Man. Finally, Tom Holland. It's a Spider-Man that I have been waiting for years. Than you MCU for giving us the Spidey we love to see.Favorite Scene: When it comes to this many will say the Airport fight or the climatic battle in Siberia. But those are action scenes. Not that I am saying they are not great, but those don't count for me as a favorite scene. My favorite one would be the one-on-one Stark has with Peter Parker as to why he (Peter) gets up every morning. That scene impressed me a lot because of what Stark makes Peter realize in the scene.Verdict: Civil War is definitely the best that MCU has us to offer. The Russo Brothers again did it. They had a difficult task of handling an ensemble cast and they came out victorious. Can't wait for their Infinity War.I give it deserved 10/10.",10,2,4,29 January 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Review
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a film directed by David Yates. I had watched some of the Harry Potter films years ago. Then I came to know about this particular film which was a prequel to the Harry Potter Films. Seeing the craze of the Harry Potter series in many people, I decided to give this film a try. And I enjoyed it.Plot: Newt Scamander arrives in New York when some of his creatures escape from his suitcase and it is upto him and his allies to save the day.Story and direction: This is J K Rowling's first film as a screenwriter and I can say she has done a wonderful job in creating a world where both magicians and normal citizens live together. Hats off to David Yates and team, for creating a world for creating a world I so want to be in. The creature designs were fantastic and that goes on to say how talented the crew is. The characters for this story were so mesmerizing. Each of these characters had something to be liked. The comedy also was so good and never felt forced or out of place. The action scenes were so nicely done. The production design and costumes transported me back to the 1920's. But the film, was not all perfect. The film's first 20-30 minutes, felt little flat for me. But that was understandable, as I was getting to know this world and it was a slow-buildup movie. Also the editing and VFX in certain portions of the film felt little haywire.Performances: Eddie Redmayne was very lovable as Newt. The little chacacters nuances were perfectly performed by him. Katherine Waterston also provided some great support to Newt's character. Dan Fogler was the comic relief and he was impressive. Allison Sudol was good too. Ezra Miller was awesome. You could feel the pain his characater was going through. Colin Farrell was great. And for those who haven't seen this film, I would say just wait for Johnny Depp. Yes, he is there in the film. But I won't go any further.Favorite Scene: Again no spoilers but there is a scene involving, Newt, Tina, Queenie and Jacob towards the climax that was heart-touching. I also teared up for a bit. Verdict: I had a fun time watching this film. For a person who has not been updated with the Harry Potter series, I fully understood the film. And was quite happy that the film didn't rely on Harry Potter. It's good on its own. I am going with an 8/10.",8,0,0,2 April 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame Review
","Avengers: Endgame is a film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. This film was my most anticipated one for this year for a number of reasons. The trailers got me pumped up and increased my anticipation even more. But after walking out of that cinema hall, I felt that the creators did justice to all that was served to us in these past 10 years.Plot: The Avengers decide to reverse Thanos' action done during the events of Infitnity War.Story and direction: As this will be a non-spoiler I shall try to be as generic as possible as tio what I liked and didn't like about this movie. This film is a conclusion to a long story arc that started in the beginning of this cinematic universe. Yes, the film is three hours long (by far the longest in the MCU, too) but the best thing about the film was that the film never felt that long. And, for that, I would like to give a big salute to the creative minds behind this mega-blockbuster. In each and every minute of the move, you do feel for the characters. There is a sense of human-ism which is quite rare in superhero movies, which I was a big fan of. None of the scenes felt misplaced or unnecessary. I even liked the risks that were taken with characters which too is very rare for a commercial movie. The MCU brand of humour is there in some moments and I just loved them. This film had a proper balance of tension, entertainment and laugher, which is what wants from any kind of movie. Talking about the action scenes. OMG!!! They were huge, awesome and fantastic. Also, the VFX. My God!!! I can imagine the VFX artists had to do to bring so many of these scenes to like. And I salute them in doing that in the most seamless and effortless way. Alan Silvestri has also done a wonderful job on the score. I don't remember tearing up in any movie, but I surely did in this one. This film had such a profound effect in me. But in saying that, there were some scenes that did feel like plot-holes. Also, with the announcement of so many movies and TV show spin-offs this film still didn't manage to address so many things. But these, things are any way secondary to me.Performances: Now if I list each and every cast member and their performances, this review will go on and on. But still, I will do some highlighting. People have been wanting Robert Downey Jr to be nominated Best Actor for the Oscars next year. And I really hope they do because this was the best of Tony Stark in the MCU. Chris Evans as usual is fantastic and I saw a side of him in this film which wasn't even tapped on in this universe. Chris Hemsworth was the funny man in this film. His scenes just made me laugh. Same can also be said for Paul Rudd. Mark Ruffalo too was just great as the Hulk and Bruce Banner. Scarlet Johannson and Jeremy Renner made me remember what made them so special and unique in this team. Josh Brolin again was fantastic as Thanos. All the rest of the cast members too were just great and commendable.Favorite Scene: This is where I am out of words. But I will say it anyway without giving away anything. I will say it will be the one during the final hour of the movie where you will feel that are heroes have nothing to do. But then there comes a ray of hope and you feel that victory will surely touch our heroes' feet.
Verdict: Is this film perfect? No, absolutely not. Does this film satisfy the MCU fan? Hell yes, it absolutely does. This film just made me realise why I love movies and why my love increases every day. Its exactly for films like these that I live for. Do watch the film in 3D (IMAX, if possible) for the best experience and I am sure you will have a smile on that face yours feeling a sense of completion and happiness. If the MCU has more films up in its kitty, bring them on because I seriously would like to see what more can they give. Yup, and for the first time ever: NO POST CREDITS. So don't need to wait till the end waiting for some random scene to show up.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8,2,5,5 May 2019
District 9," District 9 review
","District 9 is a film co-written and directed by Neil Blomkamp base on his own short film Alive in Joburg. I saw this film just because I have an interest in the sci-fi genre. But mind you this is not your normal sci-fi film that has special effects and larger than life action. It is something different. That is why I loved the film.Plot: Wikus van der Werwe is an Employee of the MNU. While serving an eviction notice to an alien colony (District 9), he accidentally exposes himself to some fluid to drastic consequences.Story and direction: The film is shot in a semi-documentary style. Which is somewhat different for a sci-fi genre film. I liked that move. And you would be expecting a lot of guns blazing, violence, etc.. That is there. But it is quite secondary in the film. This film basically deals with loneliness (that the protagonist faces after a tragedy). Wikus's pain and anguish is very nicely written in the film. Also aliens are mostly shown as some supreme beings with a lot of super powers and stuff. But here they are shown as oppressed individuals. Which too is something different.Acting: Sharlto Copley as Wikus actually killed it. We see 2 different sides of his character: one as the employee of MNU, who is indifferent towards the aliens and other as a saddened individual who is forced to ally with the aliens. David James as the sadistic Koobus Vanter is also a bad-ass villain. The rest of the supporting cast is also good.VFX: This is the department where I felt the film lacked finesse. Sometimes the VFX was looking very superficial. Motion capture was already quite developed by this time. But yes the budget would not allow that.Favorite scene: I guess it would be the scene where Wikus puts on the alien suit and kills the MNU soldiers. The suit reminded me of the climax of Aliens where Ripley finds some kind of armor and fights off the alien queen.Verdict: I enjoyed the film a lot. It was kind of different than your normal sci-fi films. But yes as I said the VFX wasn't great.I would give it a 9/10.",9,0,1,16 April 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," The Fault in Our Stars: Review
","The Fault In Our Stars is a film directed by Josh Boone based on the John Green novel of the same name (The first time his novel is adapted to a film). Now let me confess I am not a person who see's romantic films. I would rather watch films of action genre. Even when I read a one line summary about the film I wasn't ready to see it. Because I thought it would be overly melodramatic. But then many people said me it's actually not that. And when I saw the film I thought how wrong I was. Plot: Hazel and Augustus meet at a support group and fall in love with each other.Story: If you see the film, in the very first scene only you get a hint at the ending of the film (I actually guessed the ending of the film and YES I WAS RIGHT). The story has basically nothing new in it. The setting is little bit changed to 2 people who are actually battling for their life. I also began to guess some of the scenes. Which is the only 'fault' in this film. But still I was feeling joyed and excited in every scene that I was seeing. That is the magic of the screenwriters and directors. They create a world in which you love to swim. That is why the film actually caught hold of me (even though I knew most of the scenes). There are many things that differed from the novel. But I will highlight the 2 which I thought were important: 1) Ansel died quite quickly in the novel. 2) Hazel forgives van Houten during the funeral scene. The reason I highlighted these 2 things is because I liked the way these two things were not shown in the film. Because actually the essence of the film quite die.Now since I saw an extended version of the film, I would actually give light on some of the scenes that was not in the theatrical version: 1) The first would be the scene where Hazel tells her Mom that Gus is ready to take her to Amsterdam and after the scene they go to the doctor to ask for permission which she declines. I guess this was quite important to show the care of the mother for her child. 2) Another one is toward the end where Hazel takes Gus to the hospital and on the way she recites the poem 'The Red Wheelbarrow'. This scene is too important as it tells more about how strong is the relation between Gus and Hazel.Acting: Shailene Woodley is actually the main protagonist of the film. She did an excellent job as Hazel. As the director had said once, Within ten or fifteen seconds of Shailene's audition, I knew she was Hazel. She held up her script pages and just her eyes were peeking over them.' I couldn't see anyone as more convincing as her. I would also say the very same statement for Ansel (as Augustus). He too was very good. William Dafoe as the alcoholic author was great. And the rest of the supporting cast too especially Laura Dern as Hazel's Mother. She killed it with the emotions as a mother whose child is suffering.Favorite scene: I guess it would be the scene where Hazel and Gus meet after the support group session for the very first time. Then Gus puts a cigarette in his mouth and Hazel is surprised. The reply to Hazel in that scene was actually something that grasped and fascinated me a lot.Verdict: I loved the film a lot. As I said, the only 'fault' in the film is that I have seen things like these many times. But still I enjoyed the film. SO I would give it a 9/10.",9,0,1,11 April 2017
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol Review
","Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a film directed by Brad Bird. After the third one, I was eagerly waiting to watch this one. And one again, the M: I series didn't fail to surprise me.Plot: Ethan and his IMF team, now disavowed, must stop a Russian strategist who wants to start a war between the US and Russia.Story and direction: Knowing that Brad Bird (his first live-action film) was going to direct the film, I had huge expectations from it. The story is takes the basic idea of US vs. USSR and spuns it into a complex and diversifying one. The film has so many layers and interesting characters because of which there were no dull moments. The new characters introduced have such interesting back stories that it is interesting to watch them. Each scene is just full of tension and suspense. This film very nicely balances the action and thriller aspect of the film. Full credit goes to Brad Bird on proving that he can give a good film whether animated or live-action. The action scenes and VFX are just spot-on especially the one in Dubai where my heart just skipped a beat several times. The cinematography is just awesome. Since IMAX cameras were used in some scenes, it feels quite good. There are many wide-angle shots that do enhance the beauty of the film. The editing of the film is wonderful. Michael Giacchino has again done wonders with the BGM of the film. My only issue with the film is just the villain. He has no such motivation or arc. He is just a guy who wants to destroy the world. I can very safely say that he is the least impressive villain of the entire series.Performances: Tom Cruise has just synonymised himself with Ethan Hunt. It is juts difficult to imagine this series without him. Jeremy Renner delivers a great performance. So does Paula Patton. Simon Pegg returns in this film with a much meatier role as compared to the previous venture and he just impresses. Michael Nyquist was good on the acting department but nothing the story did to move his character forward. Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan do return in smaller roles but it is always good to see them both. Favorite Scene: Apart from the Dubai Sequence (which is almost everyone's favorite scene in this film), I would say the film ending was quite good. Ethan says that however difficult the mission be, it is the team that makes it successful. I liked the fact that the scene stressed on the importance of a team and teamwork.Verdict: This series never fails to impress me. I can't thank the makers enough for raising the stakes of the film in terms of action and storyline in each and every film a notch higher. Can't wait for ROGUE NATION.I am going with a 9/10.",9,0,0,24 July 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers Infinity War Review
","Avengers Infinity War is a film directed by the Russo Brothers. This film was my most anticipated film for this year and I can definitely say the same for every MCU fan out there. I viewed the film very late and knew how much I had to wait. But the wait was worth it.Plot: The Avengers team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from obtaining the 6 Infinity Stones.Story and Direction: The Russo Brothers and the writers had a huge and daunting task of bringing all of the characters that we loved for all these years into one big movie. And I can just say that they did an excellent job. Never for a moment do you feel that the characters were not given space and time to do what they wanted. The character work for this film is just flawless and I think Thanos was just the best villain MCU ever had. Although he is strong and kind of undefeatable, he has emotions which provided a lot of weight to his character. The film is has a much darker tone compared to other MCU films. The stakes in this film are very real and never there is rest for the mind. You do feel the tension lingering around and feel for the safety of your characters. But the film does retain that Marvel brand of humour in places. And all of the jokes are very funny and do provide relief. Given the film was shot on IMAX cameras, the visuals are just awesome. I had goosebumps just looking at how beautiful this film looked. Also the action scenes were awesome. And the VFX was just jaw dropping. Action scenes were just awesome. Although there were some shaky cam scenes, but they were just perfectly handled. The score by Alan Silvestri was quiet good and complemented the scenes very well. Also the film doesn't end in a very peculiar way. It takes a very different route, which was very well appreciated. I did have one little issue but here I am being quite nit-picky. Some scenes in the trailers didn't make it to the film which was disappointing and also the Thor storyline didn't feel much important to the film.Performances: The Avengers and The Guardians were just awesome with Thor being my favorite character in the entire film. His presence and his comic timing were just awesome. Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston too deliver good performances. Josh Brolin was just excellent as Thanos. Every time you watch him on screen you do feel that he was just the correct choice. Also the Black Order was nice to watch. And finally, Peter Dinklage. He also delivered an earnest performance for his role.Favorite Scene; It would be Thor's scene with the Guardians. That scene lightened the mopd for a bit and also gave that kind of entertainment you expect out of these characters.Verdict: This film satisfied the Marvel fan in me. I walked out of this film with a lot of questions about what will happen next and I can't just wait for the next instalment arriving next year.I am going with a 9/10.",9,1,6,22 May 2018
Get Out," Get Out review
","Get Out is a film written and directed by Jordan Peele. I saw basically no trailers of this film. I saw the 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was immediately attracted to it. Seeing the name Jordan Peele also kind of excited me as I liked Keanu that was out last year. After the film finished I was kind of overjoyed. I liked this film.Plot: Chris, an African American goes to met Rose's parents (a white family). Everything is going good until Chris detects something sinister going on.Story and direction: It's good when you have not seen anything regarding the film. Because you can go with a free mind and think what you want. That's what with the case of this film. I would say this film is more of a psychological thriller than a horror film. Yes, there are some scenes where I was scared. But that doesn't make it a horror film. This film deals with racism in a somewhat unconventional manner. That was something new which I liked very much. I never thought of racism in that way. I too read of an alternate ending to the film in Wikipedia but I guess the theatrical one was apt. It would have been a bit unjust on the hero of that alternate ending had been there. The only issue with the film is that some things were not clear to me. Maybe that was what Jordan wanted just to maintain some kind of suspense. But after the end too I was a bit confused regarding some scenes.Acting: Daniel Kaluuya was great as Chris. I was with him each and every time. Allison Williams was sweet (and Menacing too) as Rose. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener were also excellent. A special mention to Lil Rel Howery. I mean I laughed at every joke he made. He was the special attraction and the comic relief of this tense film.Favorite Scene: The scene where Missy hypnotizes Chris was my favorite. I saw a new way of hypnotizing people. That actually gave me a lot of chills. And it is from this scene where the film shows its true colors.Verdict: I had a great time watching this film. I strongly recommend it to those who loves these psychological thrillers. I would not say that its an excellent film, but yes it's very good.I am going to go with a 9/10.",9,10,19,9 July 2017
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place Review
","A Quiet Place is a film co-written and directed by John Krasinski. The film already had me ears when I saw the trailer. It was something I never saw before. The reviews came out and increased my anticipation for the movie. Finally, watching it last night, I had a smile on my face.Plot: The Abbott family live their life in silence when a creature hunts people by the sounds they make.Story and direction: Even when writing the plot of the film down in one sentence, I can't believe that such a piece of work exists. It is something that maybe hasn't been created in years. Kudos to the writers and Krasinski for bringing this piece of art onto the screens. I was just glued to my seat for each minute in the film. I liked the way in which the film opens with no exposition as to what has happened. In this way I was able to give my full attention to the film. Each moment is filled with intensity and suspense. Even though the antagonist is seen for just few moments, Krasinski knew how to keep the surrounding full of tension. That's what anyone wants from a horror film. It even didn't have jump scares that normally any horror film has (or even overuses these days). The characters of the film also draw your attention a lot. Each of the character has a certain pain of their own and you can relate to that pain, which made it easier to connect to them. The creature design is just good and so are the visual effects (considering the budget in which the film was made). Something that caught my attention were the sounds. They were also kept quite minimal, true to what the story intends to do. Hats of to the sound team for this amazing feat. If I had to note some flaws, it would be the score. Marco Beltrami's score is one that has been heard before in certain horror films and felt quite repetitive. Also, one scene felt a bit impossible from my point of view. Performances: The film has some amazing performances packed along with the watertight script. Emily Blunt we all know is a great performer and she cements it with her performance in this film. John Krasinski (who also rewrote the script in addition to directing it) did an amazing job as a father who cares for the safety of his family. Millicent Simmonds was the star of this film. Although she is deaf in her real life, the emotions that her character went through spoke louder than words. Noah Jupe also gave a compelling performance.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where the father and son have a small conversation on the riverside. That conversation shed some light on how a father cares for both of his children and loves them no matter what.Verdict: This film is certainly one of the best that 2018 has to offer. This goes on to show that with great talent and an extraordinary script, the results are more than expected. The makers have announced a sequel to this one. I don't know how they will top this film.I am going with a 9/10.",9,1,3,7 September 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Call Me By Your Name Review
","Call Me By Your Name is a film directed by Luca Guadagnino. I herad of the fim mostly because of the acclaim from the critics and its nomination in various cermeonies. I was quite curious to know as to what was so great about this film. After viewing the film I can say that it was quite a decent watch.Plot: Tells the relationship between Elio and his father's assistant, Oliver in 1983, Italy.Story and direction: To be very honest, I am not quite keen on films that deal with same sex romance. So the film came as a bit challenge for me. I was quite in doubts. But all got cleared after watching this film. I felt it was very beautiful and pure. It never felt adulterated. The characters instantly strike a connection with you. It feels that you are living with those characters. That's what I liked about this film. Kudos to Luca Guadagnino. Also it was great of Luca to use Italy as the location. It felt like no sets were used and all locations were real. So much detailing was done to make it look like the 80's. But still I felt some issues with the film. I felt the film stretched at times. Although the runtime is 132 minutes, I did feel the film would be perfect if kept under 2 hours. Most of that is due to the fact that the first hour of the film felt like it was wandering and had no such real motive.Performances: Timothee Chalamet was the star of the film. I could very easily get connected with his character. It was maybe the first time I liked Armie Hammer's performance. He delivered quite a performance. Michael Stuhlbarg was also good in what he was given. The rest of the cast offered good support to the film.Favorite Scene: It would be the one near to the end where Elio and his father have a talk. This scene summarized the whole film into one scene and also showed the love of a father towards his son.Verdict: I would say that this film is not everyone's cup of tea. I would like to see the film again as I think I would love the film more if I see it more number of times.But for now, I am going with an 8/10.",8,1,5,3 March 2018
Coco," Coco Review
","Coco is a film co-written and directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. The instant I saw the trailer of this film, I knew it will be the best for 2017's animated films. And seeing a film after a very long wait proved that I was right.Plot: Migues, an aspiring musician, reaches the Land of the Dead by accidently playing the deceased Ernesto de la Cruz's guitar.Story and direction: Pixar for me is the animation company that not only provided some great characters and films, but also with each film gives something that latches on to you for the rest of your life. That in Coco is the theme. Its the importance of family that takes prime importance in the story. This theme is so well crafted in the story. Then the animation. I was mesmerized by the kind of animation this film had especially the designs for the land of the dead. It felt like I was travelling through that place. It felt very live-like. I might be wrong about this fact but I have never seen Spanish culture so very correctly depicted in any film. It respected the culture and showed the culture in its various colors. The songs and background score by Micheal Giacchino were awesome. It further enriched the Spanish culture. But this film had a tiny little fault. I felt that in some places the film took a route that was seen before in many films.Favorite Scene: it would be the scene where Miguel tries to play the guitar while seeing a music video of Ernesto de la Cruz on TV. The passion and love that Miguel has for music is clearly visible in this particular scene.Verdict: Pixar again proves why it is the best when it comes to animated films. This film will be remembered for a long time in the minds of people. Watch this film certainly, it has a lot of entertaining and emotional value that will be woven into your hearts forever.I am going with a 9/10.",9,0,1,21 January 2018
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby Review
","Million Dollar baby is a film directed by Clint Eastwood. I wanted to watch the film but circumstances didn't allow me to do so. Finally, Last night I decided to watch it and was blown away.Plot: Follows Frankie Dunn, an old boxing trainer who decides to train an aspiring female boxer, a thing Frankie has never done in life. Story and direction: The film is just not about boxing (as I thought it would be). It is about the bonding and emotions formed between characters in the film. This is very well crafted by writer, Paul Haggis and director Eastwood. I was actually quite shocked of the themes the film dealt with. I was just fascinated by each and every scene of the film. The dialogue felt so real and struck a lightning bolt in my heart. I could relate to each and every scene in the film. The cinematography in the film is awesome. The boxing scenes were shot in a beautiful way. What added to the intensity of the boxing is the razor sharp editing. In addition to directing and producing the film, Eastwood also scores the film. Although the score is very minimal (which was apt considering the storyline the film was going for) and employs mostly pianos and guitars, it was very effective. My only flaw of the film was the sudden change of tone. It felt the first half was one film and second was another. If the flow would have been even, thw film would have been a notch higher.Performances: Clint Eastwood is a multi-talented personality. He acts perfectly. The grumpiness and mellowed version of his character was balanced perfectly by him. Hilary Swank was believable in every scene of the film. The hard work gone through by her is visible clearly. Morgan Freeman, who does serve as narrator too, does a wonderful job in supporting our main characters as well as guiding the audience through this emotional and soulful journey.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Maggie faces her first match with Sally as her manager and Frankie and Scrap watch from the other side of the hall. Frankie repeatedly tells Maggie to keep her left up. But when Frankie realises that Sally is making the match go his way for his own benefit; Frankie steps up to help Maggie. This scene showed the bond formed between Frankie and Maggie and how much Frankie cared for Maggie even if Frankie wants to hide it.Verdict: No wonder this film won big at the Academy Awards the subsequent year. Filled with earnest performances and a heart-filling emotional story and set-up, the film is definitely as must watch for those who feel that emotions surpass everything.I am going with a 9/10.",9,0,1,27 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi Review
","The last Jedi is a film written and directed by Rian Johnson. Finally!!! After all my busy time was over I was able able to watch this film. It was great for cinema holders to actually have this film after 2 weeks!! The trailers didn't show much which is quite a positive thing, as you have not much things to hope for. BUut after seeing this film, I can say that this film is an entertaining film.Plot: Rey goes to Atch-To to request Luke Skywalker to help out the Resistance in their mission while Resistance Leaders try to escaping the repeated attacks of the First Order.Story and direction: This is the eighth film in the franchise. But the excitement in me is never less considering I happened to be introduced to this film series only 2 years ago. As soon as the title and with that the opening crawl appears along with John Williams' famous score, my heart just fills with nostalgia. We have the beginning as a great battle sequence in space, which doesn't fail to impress. This sequence just amped up my expectations. Then we shift to Luke and Rey. I can say, that those sequences involving these two characters were the best. We can clearly see the kind of regret that Luke suffers from. That's what touched my heart. The credit for this arc goes wholly to Rian Johnson. Also, Rey not giving up hope on Luke was impressive. The sequences where Kylo Ren and Rey connect with each other too were impressive. It was I guess the first time where we saw a kind of sequence where the villain and hero (heroine in this case), actually talk to each other (although being in different place). It's was good to see quite lot of Poe and BB-8 in this film. Poe was missing quite a lot in Force Awakens, but this film gives a lot to Poe's character. And I liked it a lot. Admiral Holdo was one of the new character's in this film. Initially I kind of hates her, because of her becoming that character who just doesn't listen but towards the end I liked her character. Also seen more was Snoke, which was quite supressed in Force Awakens. Now let's talk about Kylo Ren and Hux. I loved Kylo Ren in this more. We see a more evolved person in this one. The twist introduced to his character in the end just startled me. We see a much more darker side to Kylo Ren. Hux as a character who is a kind of Morf Tarkin was quite likable. I thought we would only see some glimpses of him. The lightsaber battle towards the end was awesome too.The visual effects were great. John Williams always impresses me with his scores, he just never disappoints. Now the negatives. It would be the Canto Bight sequence with Finn and Rose. Initially I thought that was quite an important sequence, But then towards the end some revelations made me feel like 'Why the hell were those sequences in the film!!!!' Also the final sequence on Crait felt a little elongated. Although I would say the action in that sequence were the best, but it felt it was adding to the runtime of the film (which is by the way the longest runtime in the franchise of 152 mins).Performances: Mark Hamill was at his best as Luke Skywalker. Daisy Ridley was great too.Adam Driver has showed us how great an actor he is. Carrie Fisher was great as Leia; she will be missed a lot. Oscar Isaac was also good. Laura Dern and Domnhall Gleeson didn't fail to impress. Anky Serkis yet again proved why he is the master of motion capture. It was great to see Frank Oz back as Yoda. Anthony daniels was great too as my much loved C-3PO. John Boyega and Kelly Tran were good. Benicio Del Toro is a great actor but the characterization of his character was not goo; he was underutilized.Favorite Scene: There were 2 for me. The first would be where Luke tries to teach Rey about experiencing the Force for the first time. The second would be the confrontation between Luke and Kylo Ren towards the final act. That scene was just jawdropping. Verdict: I haven't seen any film of Rian Johnson. But with this film, I can say that he is quite an excellent director. You seen just feel the love that he has for films and especially Star Wars. He took the film to a direction which I liked a lot. Yes this film is not perfect, it has a few hiccups. Although I still would say The Force Awakens was a better film than this, The Last Jedi still doesn't dissappoint. As a Star Wars fan, atleast I wasn't.I am going with an 8/10.",8,1,3,29 December 2017
Jurassic World," Jurassic World review
","Jurassic World is a film directed by Colin Trevorrow. Initially, I had no interest in seeing this film. I thought basically its just dinosaurs running here and there. But I watched the first film again. I became a fan of it. I skipped the next 2 (basically because of its reviews). I watched this. And I was overjoyed.Plot: When an Indominous Rex gets out of hand in the newly built Jurassic World, its upto the authorities to get a control on the species.Story and direction: Now I went into this film knowing that it couldn't be in level with the first part. That was ultimate. But I was expecting a decent film. And yes, I got that. The VFX and camera work both are good. The dinosaurs looked a little 'faked' at times although the character designs for the dinosaurs were great. Hey, but that's just me. The film actually takes a little time to start, about 20 minutes. But after that, it was bang on. I liked the entry to Owen's character. He showed that there is a great promise to this franchise. The story was basically here and there. There were subplots that were kind of distracting me. The kids were kind of unnecessary. It felt as if they were recreating the first that also had two kids!!!! And using raptors as military weapons!!! That was atrocious. Here that was not even necessary. The climatic battle between the dinosaurs was a visual treat to the eyes.Performances: Chris Pratt proved that he can do roles other than the Star Lord. Bryce Dallas was also great. Vincent D'Onofrio was good as the semi-villain (although the part was not needed). The kids were also fantastic in their roles. Irrfan Khan again proved that why I loved him. B D Wong was OK.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the scene after Chris Pratt's entry. The communication and bond that was shown between the dinos and humans was phenomenal. I hoped that this theme would have been further explored in the film.Verdict: Jurassic World is actually a good film. It has some flaws but it is watchable. Definitely not better than the original. Can't actually wait for Fallen Kingdom to come.I am giving it an 8/10.",8,0,2,29 June 2017
Mission: Impossible II," Mission: Impossible II Review
","Mission: Impossible - 2 is a film directed by John Woo. Many people have cited this to be the worst entry in the M: I series. I can also say the very same thing after I saw it again. Plot: Ethan and his IMF team have to retrieve a biological weapon called Chimer from rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose, who intends to make a profit out of it.Story and direction: After loving the film Face/Off (again by John Woo and by far his best Hollywood attempt) I would say that I had high expectations from this film. First, let us get on with the positives. The set design and scenery of Australia is very beautifully utilized. I feel in love with Australia after watching this film. The cinematography of the film is what enhanced the scenery. Hans Zimmer's score is also awesome. The scenes had an additional layer of tension thanks to the BGM. Most of the action scenes too worked for me. Now, for the negatives of the film. The plot itself is very boring. I was invested in the first 15 minutes or so of the film and towards the end, the film gets interesting. It is the middle half/45 minutes that are so badly written. It is also full of unnecessary drama that the film didn't need. The villain I felt was set up very nicely and provided nice characterization. But he was underplayed as the makers wanted to focus on Nyah and Ethan's romance, which was dull and drab. Even for a moment I wasn't invested in that part of the story. And sometimes, the action scenes did have a lot of slo-mo. I understand that slo-mo is a technique that is used to enhance a particular scene. But in this film, it is used in almost every scene. And that finished its effect that it tried to create and irritated me after some time. 
Performances: Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames were just spot on and gave charismatic performances. Thandie Newton was also good, it is just her character felt unnecessary to the plot. Dougray Scott did give an effective performance but it would have well appreciated if he was given more importance. Richard Roxburgh and Brendan Gleeson did provide good supporting roles. And finally, Anthony Hopkins. Although his role was more of a cameo, it was good to see him. Favorite Scene: It was where Hunt and his team decide to infiltrate Biocyte and destroy Chimera while Sean and his team decode the steps Ethan will take to destroy the Chimera. This scene for once displayed the capabilities of Sean as a capable villain giving a toigh competition to our hero, Ethan Hunt.Verdict: The film could have been better if it would have stuck to the tension and thrill that any spy film needs instead of focusing on the romance. It felt like a romantic drama instead of a spy thriller film. This film felt like a detour from the previous instalment. I would say this film as more of a time pass and can be avoided. Only watch it for the stunts and the charismatic Tom Cruise.I am going with a 6/10.",6,0,1,21 July 2018
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Uri Review
","Uri: The Surgical Strike is a film written and directed by Aditya Dhar. The trailers of the film had me quite excited. After watching it last night, I was floored by the sheer excellence of the film.Plot: Major Vihaan Shergill leads a team of soldiers to avenge all the soldiers killed in the Uri Camp attack of 2016.Story and direction: It was in a very long time, that I found the cinema hall to be housefull for a film. From the very first scene the mood is set and the makers make it very clear that the film is not for the light-hearted. For a first time director I would like to commend Aditya Dhar and his team for bringing us a tale that not only engaged me but also made me feel something at the end of it. In each and every scene, you feel the hard work the makers must have gone through to make this fruitful. Although it takes a bit of time for the main action to start, I can give the benefit of doubt since we need to understand the characters and their mindset when they make a certain decision. There are moments when you feel worried for the safety of certain characters. Much of the reason as to why I enjoyed the film was because of the audience as they were shouting 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' when something important was happening on the screen. The writing of the film is spot on and you feel for even the minor characters in the movie. There are some sequences of comedy in the second half that bought a smile to my face and didn't feel forced. The action and combat sequences are well directed. Also commendable is the camera work which surprisingly didn't have any shaky movements when the action was going on. I wasn't bored for a single minute during the run-time. But even quoting that, I did have some minor issues. There are a character or two which I felt didn't get the justifies screen time and one thing (atleast for me) was totally guessable. Also, there is a small VFX shot that just looked fake.Performances: Vicky Kaushal is in the top of his game. Be it emotion or anger, he gave it all and I would like to see him more in solo ventures. Paresh Rawal is a powerhouse in himself. Yami Gautam too was just awesome. Kirti Kulhari I felt wasn't used well considering how good an actress she is. Mohit Raina gave an impressive performance in his debut. He has his moment to shine in the film and I hope to see more of him. Also, quite excellent was Swaroop Sampat. You just have to wait and watch for Rajit Kapur and Rakesh Bedi. The rest of the supporting cast were just great.Music: Sashwat Sachdev bought some great songs and an awesome background score to the film that not only suits the scene but also takes the film forward. Most of the songs I heard were for the first time. The one that impressed me a lot was 'Beh Chala'.Favorite Scene: The scene that surely caught my attention was the one before the interval. Vihaan instructs his unit to message the loved ones not to disturb the unit until a certain date. This scene sets the mood for what is about to come in the second half.Verdict: Uri is a film that will certainly go down in history as the one that not only celebrates patriotism but also some great film-making. I was floored after the film finished and clapped my hands after the film finished.I am going with a 9/10.",9,1,3,20 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Review
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a film directed by David Yates. I remember watching this film back in 2007 since my school took me and not understanding a single word of it. But finally after watching it so many years later, I enjoyed the film.Plot: The Ministry of magic goes to every extent in order to hide Lord Voldemort's return.Story and direction: This is the first film directed by David Yates who went on to direct the rest of the parts and first not to be written by Steve Kloves but by Michael Goldenberg. I could understand the pressure on these two people but in spite of that they deliver. This instalment is the one that has the Ministry of Magic play out its politics. And that is something quite different the series has never tackled before. Also introduced in this film is Harry Potter forming the Dumbledore Army and the anti-Voldemort organisation the Order of the Phoenix. The film has progressed from Harry becoming just a little boy to one where he is fighting Death Eaters. Each character has an added layer of information to itself that made me care for them so much. And it was so beautifully handled. The makers know the importance of these characters and give them the respect and care that they deserve. Also featured inin this film is the biggest action scene ever where stakes are very high. I remember very well enjoying the scene at that time but now knowing all the characters and their motivations, I enjoyed the scene even more. The music in this film is awesome too. But I did have one little issue. And that is the VFX. After so good VFX in the previous parts, here in some scenes the VFX were cringe-worthy.Performances: The regular cast does so well in their parts that it is very hard to fault them. Imelda Stauton does one hell of a job as Dolores Umbridge. If you thought that ypou have seen enough of evil characters in this series, you are wrong. She is definitely the worst. Helena Bonham Carter also nails it as Bellatrix Lestrange. Although her role is quite short, but it is very effective. And finally, Evanna Lynch is awesome as Luna Lovegood. The way she alliances herself with Harry and the gang is awesome.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Fred and George trouble Dolores Umbridge during the OWL exam. That scene was just awesome and I laughed so hard during this scene. It always feels good when an evil character faces such a situation.Verdict: This franchise knows what it is doing and it is good at it. With every instalment, the anxiety increases as to what will happen next. I had a good time watching this film and can't wait to see as to what is next. I applaud David Yates and team for bringing another part of so wonderful series.I am going with a 9/10.",9,0,0,9 July 2018
Mission: Impossible," Mission Impossible Review
","Mission: Impossible is a film directed by Brian de Palma. I have seen this film one time before. But I again decided to see it since I wanted to go into the intricacies of this venture. And I was stunned.Plot: Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent is on the run from his superiors for killing his team and stealing a NOC list.Story and direction: This film is more of a thriller film than an action one, which was very rare at the time at which it released. This is what impressed me the most. The story is very intriguing and for every second of the film you feel the tension mounting. The complaint heard mostly from this film is that you can't move away from the screen even onece as you may miss something. But I genuinely don't see that as a flaw. Don't the people who invest in the movies want the audience to put their whole focus on the movie itself? The characters and their story are also very interesting. In the initial scenes itself, you care for Ethan Hunt. He worries about the safety of his agents and his country and that was very beautifully shown. The score by Danny Elfman works wonders. In some scenes, there is total silence as the director wants to tap on the tension. This shows that Brian de Palma is in love with his work. The action scenes are minimal in this one, but they are great. They feel real even 22 years later. But the film had one minor flaw for me. It was the VFX in the climactic battle. It looked like blue/green screen work in the background which made me cringe a bit. Performances: Tom Cruise's image changed overnight just because of his character, Ethan Hunt. I just loved him. He lived each and every moment in the film. Who could have tought of a big bald, plumpy black guy like Ving Rhames as a hacker? Not me. He just was great and did provide some comic relief in the film. Jon Voight is awesome. So were Vanessa Redgrave and Jean Reno. Henry Czerny is the kind of boss that just doesn't have a clue as to what's going on and I loved that. I had a small issue with Emmanuelle Beart's casting. She still happens to retain her French accent, which is never explained in the film.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Luther, Krieger, Claire and Ethan are on a train to the US and Ethan explains as to what they are about to do. The tension is what gave me goosebumps as it just happens to explain the following scene. Also, the thing done well was showing Ethan's confidence and Luther's doubt in the mission.Verdict: This film marked the beginning of a great franchise which boasted not only goo stunts but also good character development and things that are still remembered even 20 years after. I applaud Brian de Palma and team for bringing such a film to the screens.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8,0,2,20 July 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast review
","Beauty and the Beast is a film directed by Bill Condon. Normally when the film is announced as a remake of something, I tend to watch the original of that. But that was not the case here. I directly watched this film. And I can say that I had a very good time watching this film.Plot: Belle becomes a prisoner to a monstrous looking prince bounded by a curse.Story and Direction: I know this story of what I had read in my childhood. Some changes obviously were made to the story so that it sets apart with that of others. The production design and visual effects of the film had me in awe. They were so vast and colorful. I was immediately attracted to it. The attention to detail is very good in this film. Even the beast design and motion capture looked excellent. The songs were also fitted into the narrative very nicely. It didn't look like the song was unnecessary. But I would say though that this is actually not the best musical I have seen.Performances: Emma Watson shined as Belle. She looked real in her performance. Dan Stevens did also a great work as the Beast/Prince. Kevin Kline was also good as Belle's father. Luke Evans was somewhat funny (in a good way) and menacing as Gaston. Josh Gad was good too as LeFou. The additional cast that did the voice work for the castle household items were good too.Music: Alan Menken returned to compose songs and score for the film. I was mesmerized by the songs that were in the film. I would say 'Belle' and 'Beauty and the Beast' were my favorite.Favorite scene: The scene where Belle and Beast dance with each other was the best for me. The choreography and emotion in that scene were par excellence.Vercict: As I said before, this was not the best musical I have seen. I too haven't seen the original so I can't actually compare it with that. This film was actually very good on its own.I am giving it an 8/10.",8,0,2,27 June 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," GOG 2 review
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a film written and directed by James Gunn. This film is again a part of the very famous MCU franchise. I hadn't seen the trailers, so I didn't actually know what to expect out of the film. I liked the first one a lot. And I ended up liking this one too.Plot: The Guardians run away from the Sovereign after they steal something from them. Meanwhile, Peter gets to know something about his heritage.Story and direction: This film (and the previous part too) basically reminds you of those 1980's buddy cop action films where people just are banded together for one common cause and they also share a love-hate relation with each other. I like many of those kind of films. Because of which I have a special connection with this film too. Within the first few minutes, I was liking the film. The jokes were quite good (This part has some adult jokes too). Then by the time I got towards the climax and the main crux of the story I began to think 'Was actually the Sovereign necessary??' I thought that it wasn't necessary. It felt very forced. Also, there was a small part where fast and furious was mentioned (please remember the 'family' part that Drax says). If more focus would have been given on some characters like Rocket or Gamorra, I would have loved the film. Also even though I liked the jokes, I felt that the jokes were a bit on the too much side. The emotional quotient was quite missing. That is what made this film less likable than the first part. But the VFX and sets were quite massive and great. Also some of the stunts were awesome. Also this is I guess the first film in the MCU, where we had some 4 post credit scenes. Keep Up the good job, MCU.Acting: Chris Pratt was again rocking as the Star Lord. I couldn't replace him with any other actor. Zoe Saldana was also bad-ass as Gamorra. Dave Bautista showed another side of his character Drax (the comic side), which although was in quite excess but was enjoyable. Micheal Rooker was also great as Yondu (will quite miss him in the future parts). Pom Klementieff was a great addition to the cast as Mantis. Sylvester Stallone was not necessary for the film. I still didn't understand why he signed for the film. Kurt Russell was great as Ego.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the very same as the first part. Yondu using his fin to control the arrow. This time the scene ran for quite a long time. And we see Yondu, Rocket and Groot walking down the road. I mean that scene had a different level of awesomeness in it.Verdict: Although not as great as the first installment, this film is still good. It was vibrant and enjoyable for me. Can't wait for their crossover with The Avengers and in GOG 3.I am going to go with an 8/10",8,9,13,9 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Review
","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.I am going with an 8/10.",8,6,7,4 July 2018
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a film directed by Mike Newell. With every instalment of the series, my anticipation for the film also increased. And I can say even with the fourth instalment, the excitement is never reduced.Plot: Harry Potter is selected by the Goblet of fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament making him the youngest ever to compete much to the chagrin of everyone.Story and direction: This is the first film in the series not to have the first scene at Privett Drive. I thought it was the right move considering the film has many things going on. During the first fifteen minutes or so, the film feels quite fast paced. I didn't get the understanding as to what his happening. If the makers would have given a little importance to the beginning, I guess the film would have worked wonders. But after those initial minutes, I was totally engrossed in the movie. There were some new characters to look out for and I can say all of them impressed. Also some of the VFX work in this film is incredible especially the broom scenes which have greatly improved. With that being said, I would add that the tournament scenes were well directed. There is always a sense of tension in the atmosphere during the scenes as you care for the safety of those characters. The film also brings another aspect of the trio's friendship into light which was very nicely handled. This is the first film also not to feature John Williams as score composer. But I can very well say that Patrick Doyle did a spectacular job as composer. The film do marks the very first appearance of Voldemort and I can say that he is terrifying. With his appearance and the build-up that has beenmade, you can say that this man means business and also that he is ruthless and would harm just anyone who comes his way. Performances: If I had to pin-point I had to say that this was by far Daniel Radcliffe's best as Harry Potter. The emotional side had never been explored until this film as it was great. As for new characters, Ralph Fiennes just nailed it as Voldemort. He just looks as the villain you predicted. Brendan Gleeson brings his charm to the screen and that just lights up the scene itself. Robert Pattinson also justifies his performance. Timothy Spall and David Tenant gave good support. As for rest of the cast, always just do justice to their roles and never have they given me a single reason to complain.Favorite Scene: It would be the Yule Ball scene where the boys after the initial dance just sit at one side and are jealous of Hermione seeing she is having a lot of fun unlike them. This very well depicts the teenagers who are at that age.Verdict; Thanks to Mike Newell and Steve Kloves we have got another griping chapter to the series. Except for the first fifteen minutes, I enjoyed the entire film.I am going with a 9/10.",9,14,19,7 July 2018
The Shape of Water," The Shape Of Water Review
","The Shape of Water is a film co-written and directed by Guillermo del Tero. I heard of this film for quite some time and was pretty sure that it was going to be good by looking at the trailers. Finally after seeing the film I can say that I was impressed.Plot: Elisa, a mute janitor, at a research facility forms a bond with an alien like asset bought on for research at the facility.Story and direction: Having not seen much of del Tero's work, I didn't know what to expect. But I knew that it will be something to look out for. The story has not much to it. But the way it was said was very impressive. Much credit goes to del Tero for giving us a great visual experience. The characters also are to look out for. Each are different and contrasting from each other. But you feel for each of the characters, which anyone wants out of any film. The production quality and make up for the characters (especially the asset) is top notch. I don't know how much of VFX was used for the film, but if used it was excellent. The costumes and cinematography made it look like the ear of Cold War. Hats off to del Tero for putting up a fabulous crew with a shoestring budget. But the film still has issues. Apart from the film being quite known, some scenes felt a bit cliched. I could guess as to what would happen next. Also the score from Alexandre Desplat was not that interesting. Yes, the old songs used were good to hear but apart from that nothing in the score was a stand-out.Performances: This film is filled with great performances. Starting with Sally Hawkins. I was mesmerized with her performance. She nailed her character so perfectly. Richard Jenkins was also to look out for. Octavia Spencer also did a fabulous job. Many didn't mention but I did like the performances of Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlbarg. And finally, Doug Jones was quite good as the Alien.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Eliza shows the Asset how to eat the egg. This scene felt very crucial to the bond formed between these two characters. The honesty and earnest-ness is what captivated me towards the scene.Verdict: This film was great and a visual masterpiece. The film is a great example that a big budget is not needed for anyone to make a great film.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8,24,43,25 February 2018
The Disaster Artist," The Disaster Artist Review
","The Disaster Artist is a film directed by James Franco. I had heard about this film some 3 months ago while browsing a random website of upcoming 2017 films. Then a trailer of the film came, which impressed me a lot. I decided not to see 'The Room' just not to build up any kind of expectations. And after seeing this, I can say that this is just perfection.Plot: Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero decide on making thier own movie after not being able to prove themselves in Hollywood.Story and direction: In the beginning we get interviews from various celebrities quoting that how Tommy Wiseau tried to create a different kind of cinema and people happen to still remember this film because of how silly and bad its supposed to be. Then we shift to San Francisco, where we are introduced to Greg who struggles because of having stage fright and Tommy who in the very same scene acts quite horrendously and still has no shame in doing it in front of 15-20 people. Then begins the journey of these 2 people to destination Hollywood. Then we get to see their love for cinema and them deciding to go to Hollywood to make it big there. Then we also see concerns of Greg's mother as to who is this Tommy person and all her other worries. This all comes from great writing. Kudos to the writing team (Scott Neustader and Micheal Weber, who happened to write also 'The Fault in Our Stars' another of my favorite film). James Franco as a director too has done a fantastic job showing us not only the Hollywood struggle but also the precision with which 'The Room' was made. I felt an instant connection to the characters. At the end of the film we see scenes from 'The Room' are then compared side-by-side with reenactments of the scenes performed by the film's cast. Those scenes felt like it was the scenes of 'The Room'. An exact replica!!!! Performances: James Franco hit it instantly as Tommy Wiseau. His accent and body language were perfect. Dave Franco also was excellent. I didn't expect a fabulous performance from him. The role of Seth Rogen was quite mininal but its always a joy to see him. Allison Brie was also good as Greg's girlfriend. Ari Graynor was also good as Lisa. It's always a treat to watch Bob Odenkirk and Bryan Cranston!!!Favorite Scene: It would be where Greg along with Lisa and Claudette discuss as how difficult it is for Claudette to come everyday to set to perform considering her age. And she replies that we are actors and even a bad day on set is a good day. Also one other member in the same scenes deduces that 'The Room' might be semi-autobiographical. This scene showed the behind the camera tensions and worries of the cast which I liked about the scene.Verdict: This film ticked out all the boxes for me. I see many nominations for this film in many categories and do hope it wins. Even if you haven't seen 'The Room', it's no problem. You will still enjoy it. It has elements of comedy, but drama is too present in this film. Please give it a go. I assure you, it will be a blast.I am going with a 10/10.",10,1,3,4 January 2018
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Review
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a film directed by Chris Columbus. After watching the first film which I liked a lot, I was pretty excited for the second part. After watching it I can say that I enjoyed this particular part too.Plot: Harry Potter is warned by Dobby, a House elf not to attend Hogwarts School of Magic as danger awaits him.Story and direction: This film is one of those rare sequels which improve upon the first. This film doesn't take time to set up things. But instead we are immediately thrown into action. Also introduced are some new characters which impressed me like Lucius Malfoy and Ginny Weasley and another one not being of much importance like Gilderoy Lockhart. If this character was removed it wouldn't be much of a loss to this film. The funny scenes also feel funny and not forced. John Williams' score is again awesome and I can just hear it again and again. The film deals with another theme which I liked a lot the way it was handled. As for the VFX, although it has improved much from the first part but still there are some imperfections. There is some animatronic work with creatures which were excellent. It felt like the creatures were real and would jump out of the screen. The sets are massive and adorable. The action scenes in this film were great.They were so believe-able that I had goosebumps. Even though the film is longer than the first part, I felt much more entertained by this film. Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves have again done a wonderful job in providing us another chapter in this universe that not only makes us happy but also makes you feel for the characters in those particular settings. This film does have a post credit scene but I didn't think that the film did need that.Performances: All of the regular cast members did an outstanding job. Jason Isaacs was bad (in a good way) as Lucius Malfoy. Kenneth Branagh was also good in the material that was provided to him. Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley did a fine job. The voice of Dobby by Toby Jones was awesome. I didn't know that he voiced Dobby until I read it in the internet. Favorite Scene: It would be one where Hagrid consoles Hermione about her parents being muggle and both Harry and Ron providing support to her. This scene showed not only showed the strong bond between the kids but also how much Hagrid cares for Harry's gang.Verdict: For a sequel, this film just ticks all the boxes. I had a great time with this film. It improved upon the first and also opened many new doors for the future films. I just can't wait to see what this series has yet to offer me.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8,0,0,5 July 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Anchorman Review
","Anchorman is a film co-written and directed by Adam McKay. This film just happen to come on my radar and I decided just to give it a shot. And at the end, I can say that this film was an enjoyable ride.Plot: The KVWM channel hires a female news reporter much to everyone's dismay.Story and direction: This is mostly a spoof on the news channels during the 70's. Although taking place during that era, mist of it is still applicable in today's world and the case is just not only for news. It is for any field of work. The title of the film is like that of a superhero, considering the films is about news anchors. I remember laughing throughout the entire film with no rest. I liked the way issues like sexual harassment, looking down upon women employees, etc.. were handled with comedy in this film. The film doesn't go below the belt, which is commendable. Also the characters have so much diversity, that you instantly fall in love with them. The 1970's was also beautifully depicted by the production design and costume team. A salute from my side to Will Ferrell and Adam McKay for succesfully introducing us to this world of Anchormen and Anchorwomen. My only issue with this film would be that sometimes the film goes over-the-top and the climax tended to cross the boundaries of reality.Performances: Will Ferrell deserves a standing ovation. He was born to do the role of Ron Burgundy. Christina Applegate was also perfect as a choice for Veronica. Paul Rudd and David Koechner were also excellent in their role. A special mention to Steve Carrell. This man is so talented!!!! Vince Vaughn was also great as the rival channel reporters. It's always a treat to see Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Seth Rogen. Although they had nothing much substantial to do, they were good in what was given to them.Favorite Scene: It would be the fight sequence between all the channels taking place and Burgundy keeping a condition that no harm must be caused to the face and hair (considering how important are those for any person appearing in the entertainment media). I laughed so much during that fight. Verdict: Although over-the-top at times, Anchorman still is quite an entertaining film. I assure you that you won't be bored. If you want to watch something light, you can watch it. It's worth your time.I am going with an 8/10.",8,0,0,5 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Kong Skull Island Review
","Kong Skull Island is a film directed by Jordan Vogt Roberts. Now i have only seen the 2005 King Kong version. And from just the trailers, I guessed that it would be actually a sin to compare that film with this film. But I wasn't entirely disappointed either with the film. Yes, it has some flaws but it is a good film.Plot: Billy Randa leads a team of people into the uncharted area of Skull Island.Story and direction: I judged this film being independent of the other King Kong films that have been out. The story basically has nothing new to it. The film heavily relied on VFX to tell the story which I think is not good. Also the emotional content of the film is very much missing. The most part of the film has been concentrating on action. Action is OK, but there should be something to make you glue to that screen of yours. At times, it kept me glued. But at times, not. Even some of the characters are not built properly. Like Weaver's character. I don't understand why a photographer needed to go on this expedition. And when you are running for your life you will click photos!!! Come on, be serious. Even Conrad wasn't portrayed well in terms of character. Now since I watched this as an action film, I wasn't much disappointed. At the end, this was basically a franchise building film since we have a post credit sequence too for the upcoming films in the MonsterVerse.Acting: Tom Hiddleston was the macho person in the entire group. Loved him. Brie Larson had nothing much to do which was disappointing. Sam Jackson was being himself. I had a shock from John Reily. He delivered some what a good performance. John Goodman was good too.Favorite Scene: The climatic battle between Kong and the lizard type creature was awesome. My jaw dropped in that scene. The VFX too was excellent in that scene.Verdict: Do watch this as a pure action film. It is not the best King Kong film (of course) but not even that bad too.I am giving it a 7.5/10.",7,0,0,2 July 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman review
","Wonder Woman is a film directed by Patty Jenkins. I saw all the 4 trailers of the film and had high hopes. But still there was a part in me that was scared for this film since we didn't get some impressive films from the DC Extended Universe. But man, I breathed relief as I came out of the hall.Plot: Diana, an Amazonian from Themysciara decides to go to the outside world to defeat Ares and restore peace in the world.Story and direction: The story was as good as it got. The woman director move by Zac Snyder (who happens to be the story writer and producer of the film) was great. Although I had my reservations (Patty has directed only one film- Monster that was not a commercial film), but they were all cleared few minutes into the film. I could see the film go wrong in many ways but I guess the sailor of the ship (ie director) was apt. The first act was kind of slow. But yes we needed that to strengthen Diana as a character. The second act is where we get a sense of comedy, as Diana trying to understand what is happening around her. It could have become way absurd with the comedy. But thank god, that didn't happen. We get to see characters fleshed out so nicely. We see Steve's friends who are actually in the horrors of war or who don't want to be a part of the war but have to be due to some reason. The third act is where actually most of the action happens, which was phenomenal. The only problem I had was actually with the main villain: Ares. There was a tension, frustration, etc.. But I wanted more of that. Even the General taking some kind of drug to increase his strength, I saw no use actually in that.Acting: Gal Gadot was par excellence in her role as Wonder Woman. I couldn't picture any other actress for this role. The fierceness needed for the role was there in her. Hats Off!!!. Chris Pine will be loved by me for the role of Steve Trevor (although I still don't understand his 'multi picture deal' thing). Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright were good as Hippolyta and Antiope respectively. David Thewelis as Sir Patrick Morgan was good (Love him as Varga in Fargo) but he was so so in Ares. I wished to see a much younger actor for the role of Ares.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Steve expresses his love for Diana before going on a flight full of gas canisters. That was kind of intense for me.Verdict: This film although not fully perfect but has instilled in me that there is hope for the extended Dc Universe. I am rooting for the Justice League (given the fact that 2 Directors are giving their contributions to this film). Go enjoy this film. I can assure you it will not be a disappointing experience.I give it a 9/10.",9,3,9,6 June 2017
The Iron Giant," The Iron Giant Review
","The Iron Giant is a film co-written and directed by Brad Bird. This film was on my radar for quite some time since it is directed by Brad Bird. Finally, I decided to watch the film and I can say that it was definitely great.Plot: Hogarth befriends a giant robot but also has to defend the robot from a ruthless government official.Story and direction: This film was in the traditional animation form which incorporated little CGI. At a time when CGI films were on the rise, bringing out such a film is a risk. With Brad Bird as the captain of the ship, what is to go wrong?? Nothing. Director's like Brad Bird is why I love animated films. Not only do they have such a good story but a message that is relevant and should be applied too in real life. This film deals with themes that no one at the time dealt with and is still relevant even in this world where technology has dominated every aspect of our lives. The film also very beautifully shows that it is not necessary to be human to have feelings. Everyone has feelings. Brad Bird and his team were able to grasp my attention in this 87 minute film. But it is quite sad to know that this film didn't work wonders at the time of its release. Some things quite notable are the designs for the town and the robot. They are impeccable and beautiful. Even the characterization work in the film is just spot-on. The bond formed between Hogarth and the robot seems real. Kent's character has been beautifully portrayed in the film. Even the voice work of this film is excellent and I couldn't fault it for even a second. There are some jokes in this film that I laughed and also some scenes which made me very emotional. The music by Michael Kamen also does wonders and goes with the flow of the film. If I had to nit-pick this film for any flaw, I would say it was the story. Many movies have shown such stories and the subject I would say was nothing new.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Hogarth decides to tell a bed-time story to the robot so that he could fall asleep. He has different books with him and tells them the gist of two of them. This scene just resonated with the main theme the film deals with and very correctly justifies the difference between good and evil.Verdict: As a first timer director, Brad Bird just hit a bulls eye. I was impressed with almost every aspect of the film. This film proves that medium is not necessary to bring across your point. If the message is correct and properly shown, then the medium doesn't matter that much. Even after the film ended, I was thinking about the film. And thank god, the film wasn't made into a musical (which was actually the original plan of the makers). For those who have loved Brad Bird animated films and think that he is one the great animators at present, I urge you to watch this film. It is a beautiful and thought provoking feature. I was highly impressed by it and sure that you will be too.I am going with a 9/10.",9,0,1,19 July 2018
Black Panther," Black Panther Review
","Black Panther is a film co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler. After a brief appearance in Civil War, I was very happy to hear this character getting a solo film. The trailers looked awesome and increased my expectations for it. Finally, after watching the film I can say that it was a great film.Plot: T'Challa returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a long-time adversary, in a conflict with global consequences.Story and direction: Ryan Coogler was the perfect director for this film as he breathed new life in the MCU as he very nicely did it in the Rocky Series. The story very nicely intertwines the African culture along with the issues that every African American faces. This film is not the regular sueprhero film, which makes it stand apart from the rest. The characters of this film also make you glued to the screen. We have T'Challa who has a lot of responsibility not only as king but to the world also as a citizen. Then Killmonger, who also has a point in his statements but goes about it maybe in the wrong way. Which makes his villain mean something and stand-apart. Dora Milaje aspect was also great. The production values are enormous and it feels justified. Also the designs for Wakanda were awesome. It looked like a country that I would like to visit in the future. The background score was awesome. It further infused in the African Culture. Hats off to Ryan and team for the hard work put into this venture. The action scenes although minimal, were awesome and great. Where the film failed were the VFX. Considering that MCU have given great spectacles for almost 10 years now, VFX not being upto the mark is almost equal to a sin. Performance: Chadwick Boseman was great as T'Challa. The various shades of his character were perfectly acted by him. But the icing on the cake was Michael B Jordan. He pulled of the conflicted character with ease. People may not be wrong in saying of him being the best villain since Loki. Lupita N'yongo and Danai Gurira were earnest in their roles. Letitia Wright was quite the Q in this venture. Her comic timing was spot on. Daniel Kaluuya delivered a good performance.Winston Duke was great too. So was Angela Bassett and Martin Freeman. Andy Serkis proves that not is he only great at motion capture but also in real acting too. It was good to see Forest Whittaker and Sterling K Brown utilized nicely. And finally, Stan Le. No Marvel movie is complete without this genius.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where T'Challa comes to know about something in the past and shares his thought with Nakai. Then Nakai says that its upto T'Challa as to what kind of king he wants to be. This scene stuck with me as this showed even though Wakanda was the most advanced technologically but the people using it are humans.Verdict: Although it may not be the best of MCU, but it still is an enjoyabke and entertaining film for me. I had a great time with this film and yes, if you are wondering, I had to wait till the credits as there are post credit scenes in this film. Can't wait for Infinity War. I am going with a 9/10.",9,4,14,23 February 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Review
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a film directed by David Yates. This film just firmed up my belief that however good or bad the start is the ending of any story should be shockingly awesome.Plot: Harry Potter and his friends decide to stop Voldemort and the Death Eaters once and for all.Story and direction: This film is much shorter in comparison to the other parts (130 minutes). And this is actually justified because all of the setting up was done in the past 7 movies. Here we jump straight into the action. I would like to commend on the action sequences. They felt every real and each and every time I felt scared for the characters in that particular scene. The film is fast paced and not much time is wasted. The set design and cinematography is just awesome. I can just go on about the wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat. Also, the VFX is just the best of the entire series. I was just gobsmacked by the improvement the series hads shown in the VFX department. The level of maturity these characters have is very well defined in certain scenes. There are certain scenes in the film that make sense in this final part that are explained very well without deviating from the tension in the film. And I have to commend the makers on splitting up the novel into 2 parts. This was needed as many storylines and plot arcs have to be wrapped up. This film just brings the storyline to an end so beautifully that I couldn't fault the film for one moment.Performances: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as usual are great. Maggie Smith has some scenes in which she was great. Ralph Fiennes was in his best form as Voldemort. The same can be said for Helena Bonham Carter and Micheal Gambon. It was also good to have certain actors back for this one epic battle.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Snape orders the students to give up anything they know about Harry Potter's whereabouts. Then Harry steps up and challenges Snape and Minerva comes to the rescue. This scene was just amazing on another level as I saw a battle that I may have been waiting for since the last instalment.Verdict: This film is just great on so many levels. I honestly can say that in each and every scene I had goosebumps. This film series ends on a great note and delivers a very satisfying finale. This film series should be a lesson to some people on how greatness, novelty and creativity when mixed together provide an art that just cannot be forgotten and is just relished by the person watching it. My heartiest congratulations to the team of Harry Potter on celebrating our favourite characters in the best way possible.I am going with a perfect 10.",10,2,3,13 July 2018
Life," Life Review
","Life is a film directed by Daniel Espinosa. Now when I saw the trailer for this film, I was quite excited for the film, as I like these kind of films. And at the end I was very satisfied with the kind of film that was finally made.Plot: A team of 6 astronauts inspect a soil sample from Mars to dangerous consequences.Story and Direction: Now what made me attract to this film is basically the writers: Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. The team gave us the phenomenal Deadpool that came out last year. The writing for this film is good. There are sequences that actually give some depth to these characters. I can feel with all these characters every second. Especially Sho's character. He was my favorite. We see the kind of difficulty that he is facing as a father not being there for his child when he is born. Then the crew giving him support. But where the writing falls short is the familiar kind of story. This story was shown before in the very famous Alien that is some 40 years old. And some scenes actually seemed so technical that I couldn't get the film in some aspects. Also the unnecessary introductory sequence and the sequence where school kids communicate with the astronauts. But on a positive note,the VFX and production design were marvelous. That is quite rare for an R rated film. Also the design for Calvin as he grew in each stage was also excellent. It was something different than the aliens we have seen in films before.Acting: Jake Gyllenhaal was excellent again. I like every role that he takes up. Rebecca Ferguson was also good. She is quite underrated but with this role she proved that she too has range. Ryan Reynolds was good too in his short role. Hiroyuki Sanada was excellent. His scenes made me get attracted to him. Ariyon Bakare was also great. And finally, Olga Dihovichnaya was also good.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where in Sho's kid was born. The way he guides his wife through the tablet and his crew simultaneously giving him support was phenomenal.Verdict: The film is good, if not great. There are some faults with this film but that doesn't always mean it is a bad film.I am going with an 8/10.",8,3,6,13 July 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick 2 review
","John Wick 2 is a film directed by Chad Stahelski. I loved the first part of this film and had huge expectations when this part was announced. I saw the trailer and loved it too. So the first chance I got to see this film, I saw it. And I was in awe. This film is for those who love action to the core. And I am a hardcore action film fan.Plot: John Wick is called back into action for a favor he has to do for a friend.Story and direction: This film immediately takes place after the first film. Within 10 minutes we see the first part being wrapped up (which was kind of unnecessary). There is also a dialogue that references the first film - 'He killed 3 guys with a F***** pencil.'. But still, we get to see a very large impressive action sequence. Actually, this film even has more action as compared to the first. The first one was a little dark. But this one was more on the commercial side. Which I quite liked. We also have a type of a customer service for contract killing for the underworld!!!! I mean I couldn't actually believe that thing. The underworld is shown a bot more in this film. We even see John EWick having suits made for him when he goes for a shootout (That was something unique). When seen from actually a story point-of-view, it's nothing new. That's I guess the only flaw from this entire film I could take. The film also ends in such a way so that we are actually in guessing as to what the third part is going to look like.Acting: Keanu Reeves one again is a bad-ass as John Wick. I am with him in every scene he is in. Common plays a very convincing and menacing hit-man. Laurence Fishburne was good in the role for what limited time he was given. Ruby Rose as the silent assassin was great. Ian McShane was also good (again) as the hotel Manager. Riccardo Scamarcio was also kind of the bad-ass here.Favorite Scene: Every action sequence in this film happens to be my favorite scene. Another one would be where he goes to Abram Tarasov's office to make peace with him. I was actually getting chills in that scene.Verdict: All in all, I had quite the fun watching John Wick 2. It was more enjoyable and entertaining than the first one. A treat for any action film lover. The only fault with this is sometimes it has nothing new in terms of story-telling. But I still will be waiting for a Chapter 3 and I hope Chad does bring us that Chapter 3 very soon.So I give it a 9/10.",9,0,2,10 June 2017
Annihilation," Annhilation Review
","Annhilation is a film written and directed by Alex Garland. I watched the trailers for this film and was impressed by it. Before that, I had followed the film for over a year as I loved Alex Garland's Ex Machine. And I can definitely say the same for this film too.Plot Lena signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition into a mysterious zone where the laws of nature don't apply.Story and direction: This is the kind of science fiction film that not only has a great story but also does challenge your mind. The film builds every minute. Not a single minute felt dull. the characters of the story were great and you could actually connect with each of them. Each of them had some sort of pain or loss that makes you feel for them. A salute to Alex Garland for giving us a compelling story and women (lead) characters that don't feel like sugar coating. The film is left open ended which I liked because I could keep thinking about this film, which I wan't from any film that I see. The VFX for the film is awesome. This goes on to show that no big money is needed to create some great VFX. But I did feel a little disconnected at one aspect of the film. It was the scenes between Dan and Lena. That could have been avoided as that did nothing much to the forward the story.Performances: Natalie Portman was great in her role. She especially excelled in the emotional scenes. Jennifer Jason Leigh was great too. And so were Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson and Tuva Novotny. Oscar Isaac acted with great ease with what was given to him. This film is all about the women and I can say that this was quite a riveting women-centric film in recent times.Favorite Scene: No spoilers, but it would be a scene in the lighthouse with Natalie Portman and another character. The struggle, the VFX and the acting was what took my breath away in this particular scene.Verdict: Alex Garland is one of the best sci-fi directors out there and with this film he has certified that. Great performances and visuals make this film a treat to watch.I am going with a 9/10.",9,3,7,30 March 2018
Incredibles 2," Incredible 2 Review
","Incredibles 2 is a film written and directed by Brad Bird. After 14 long years of waiting, every 'Incredibles' fan was happy that this film came out and I can definitely say the same about me. The trailers just impressed me and after coming out of the hall I would like to say that this film was a blast.Plot: After Elastigirl, is chosen to redeem the status of superheroes in the eyes of public, its upto Bob Parr to take care of the home and his children. Also there is a new villain in town by the name of Screenslaver.Story and direction: Knowing that Brad Bird would be back with the sequel, I was more excited than ever. I do consider Bird as one of the top animation directors of our time. And with this film, he basically solidifies this fact. He decides to keep the timeline same as of the first part. This shows how well he understands his audience. The writing of this film is just superb. Yes, the jokes are spot on and just got me laughing, but the way he deals with real life issues are just perfect. I felt that certain decisions would be the same if taken by me. The characters, both old and new, are great and get equal screen space to shine. Bird doesn't take the conventional route; he takes risks which is commendable. The animation is spot on. And that's not just because it's Pixar; it's because the detailing is so perfect. The action scenes and VFX are just as excellent as with me seeing it in 3-D, it was an added advantage. The music is also 'incredible'. Given the fact that the film is longer than any animated film (even longer than part one), I never felt bored or the film never felt stretched. But I do have one complain regarding the film. I would say that one aspect of the film felt very guessable, which was the only little glitch this almost-perfect film has. Favorite Scene: It would be the scene of Jack-Jack displaying his different powers in fighting a small raccoon like animal. The scene was just awesome because of the cool VFX and the humour in that scene. This is the scene where I felt that Jack-Jack's character shined the most. Verdict: If I had to compare this film with the 2004 predecessor, I would choose the 2004 film without a doubt. But given the fact that we have had a lot of superhero films from that time to this, I would commend Brad Bird and team for presenting our favourite characters in a film and even making them more likable. The film doesn't feel saturated; it feels fresh, which is rare. The 14 year wait finally paid off. If there will be a third part to this film, I would say I am already in for it. I sure would like this film seen to the nominated in various awards for 'Best Animated Film'. If you loved part one, definitely watch the film as this film celebrates the characters in the best possible way, even after 14 years. If not watched the previous part, do watch that and then watch this film as it's mostly related.I am going with a 9/10.",9,1,2,27 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Covenant Review
","Alien: Covenant is a film directed by Ridley Scott. When the trailers of this film came out, I thought that this was going to be a very good film. I liked Prometheus too. And I love the first 2 films of the Alien franchise. But still I didn't get my hopes high as I knew that this film was never going to be as good as Alien. But I would say that I wasn't disappointed that much after seeing this film.Plot: USS Covenant decide to go to another planet after detecting some kind of transmission from there.Story and direction: The beginning of the film set the tone of the film in a very apt way. And then immediately after the scene we see the title of the film come in a very similar way that the 1979 original film gave us the title. I liked that. And then I see the design of the USS Covenant. Oh man, that was a beauty. The design was par excellence. And also hats off, to the production design team, VFX team and camera team. The planet gave a sense of loneliness and the horror that was about to come. The camera work was also excellent. we get very dark shades of the background which I think is correct. And finally the VFX. The animatronics and effects of the Neo and Xenomorphs were mesmerizing. You could actually feel the neo/xenomorphs are around you. When the xenomorphs would tear anyone up, I literally would have chills. The main fault with the film is the story itself. It is very inconsistent and predictable. I mean a song as a signal. Come on. Ridley Scott is better than that. And the reason to go to the planet just because it is near and people don't have to sleep for another 7 years. That is just ridiculous. The most lamest reason I have ever heard. I mean you are given a job; shouldn't anyone superior be consulted for that thing. And David coming into the picture and his story of Prometheus. I knew that was fake and David is the villain. And the ending twist. As such that wasn't a twist because you could actually see from far away what was the scene. And then there are as usual: THE UNEXPLAINED. Why David developed such hatred? Why did he kill the engineers? What actually happened to Elizabeth? From where the xenomorphs actually came? How many films do we have to have just to answer the questions? This film felt as if it was just ripping off the original Alien and tweaked a bit and presented to us. At least Prometheus felt new.Acting: I loved Micheal Fassbender as both Walter and David. He portrayed both the contrasting characters to the T. Katherine Waterson looked like a cry baby in the entire film. It would be a sin to compare her to Sigourney Weaver. Billy Crudup was good as Oram. Danny McBride was actually more likable than Waterson. He actually had some depth in his character. James Franco and Guy Pearce were also good in the cameo.Favorite Scene: Actually there are 2. The very first scene, the conversation between David and Weyland. That as I said set the tone for the film. And second being the scene between David and Walter. I mean the scene where he teaches the flute, was class. Micheal Fassbender in that scene actually proved what a great actor he is.Verict: This film is actually an OK film. Prometheus was better than this. I wasn't entirely disappointed with the film. But I wanted some answers which were not provided by the film. I get that you are trying to get some kind of curiosity but as it is rightly said 'Too much of everything is not good'. That saying is applicable with this film.I am going to go with 7.5/10.",7,2,5,11 July 2017
