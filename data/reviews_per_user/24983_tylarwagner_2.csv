Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Most Boring Star Wars Film
","The Phantom Menace is easily my least favorite Star Wars film. That's not to say there aren't some redeeming qualities here. The music is amazing as usual. There are some cool lightsaber fights and the battle on Naboo is fairly entertaining. But this movie is extremely boring to me. All of the things I like in this movie don't even occur until around in hour in. The CGI hasn't aged well and I can't stand Jar Jar's humor. This movie isn't terrible, but I have a hard time sitting through it.",4,1,5,27 February 2019
It Follows," A Unique, Original, and Creepy Film
","While far from perfect, I consider this movie to be one of my favorite horror movies in recent years. Some of the actors could be a little better, but I really like the group of friends in this film and find most of them to be convincing for the most part. The slower scenes in which they are reminiscing about their childhood or just being there for one another are some of my favorite scenes. I think it's best to watch this movie without knowing what this thing is, so I won't go into details. I'll just say that I find this concept to be terrifying. When it comes to the technical aspects of this film, I love the way this film looks. Whether it's day or night time, I love the look. And lastly, the music in this movie is amazing and terrifying. If you love music from 80's horror films, you'll probably love this soundtrack as well. I really only have one issue with the movie and it's one that others have mentioned. The rules regarding this thing the characters are running from are inconsistent. For better or for worse, the rules aren't consistent or explained outside of an early exposition scene. I don't find the final confrontation scene to be bad, but I wouldn't say it's great either. While I'm not completely satisfied with that scene, I do really like the ending to this movie. I do think this film is the most enjoyable on your first viewing when you don't know what's going on. That being said, I still have a great time watching this movie after seeing it four times in the past two years.",7,0,0,4 March 2019
