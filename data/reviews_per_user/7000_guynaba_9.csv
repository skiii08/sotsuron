Angels & Demons," Much better than Da Vinci Code
","I didn't read the book to see what's difference between the both of them. The difference can be gigantic or not, whatever, if you didn't read the book and watch the movie you will feel your money was well used.I don't understand why people don't like this movie. It has a good story, good actors, good special effects, action, a good theme (religion vs science); everything is good and in the right measure. Moreover, it's a hundred times better than Da Vinci Code.The theme is very deep and when the movie is over you feel like you want to know more about the church, the Illuminati and the Vatican. It makes you want to read the next Dan Brown's book (at least that's my sensation). The only thing that wasn't clear was the relation between Robert and Vittoria, that gets stuck between a romantic couple and two friends from work. This should have been better worked...",9,2,3,19 May 2009
Star Trek," Surprised me...
","I'd never watched anything of Star Trek, so I had no expectations when I went to the movies, but this one really surprised me. The facts shown happened before everything that people know about the series, which means it's like an explanation of the original Star Trek. This may explain why people that have never watched Star Trek before like this movie. The two hours passes through very quickly, the action really catches your attention and the story itself demands you some thinking, what brings you totally into the movie. The special effects are perfect, the acting is convincing (even Zachary Quinto's... it's almost impossible not to remember Sylar, but he did a great job) and the end is predictable, but also gripping. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes action gathered with a well planned plot. And of course, to all the old fans of the 60's series.",10,1,9,16 May 2009
Constantine," Great movie
","This is certainly one of the best religion/thriller movie ever. It's so full of creations and alternative stories based in reality and in the Bible, that you have the sensation it's an alternative world. Maybe that's why so many people hate Constantine, and many that love - like me.For sure, this is the best movie Keanu Reeves has ever made. He suited perfectly in the character (John Constantine), a sarcastic, black-humored and supernatural detective that fights against demons to receive his salvation from hell. Rachel Weisz is also very convincing as the sensitive policewoman Angela Dodson and works very well with Keanu.People that don't like to see supernatural stuff or alternative imaginative stories probably will hate it. But all the rest certainly will enjoy a lot Constantine.",9,15,22,15 June 2009
Cloverfield," A must-see
","I got really surprised with this movie. I expected an average apocalyptic monster movie with nothing interesting or different, but I have to say that I am very glad that I watched.The direction is perfect. The movie itself is a video recorded from a camera of one of the characters, so it seems like the movie is made of one take. The swing of the camera gives more reality to it; actually you kind of forget that Cloverfield is a monster movie. The writer and director managed to transform a silly theme into a must-see.The actors also made a great job, specially Lizzy Caplan and Michael Stahl-David, what collaborated so much to the sense of reality given to the movie. All in all, this is a masterpiece of thriller.",9,0,2,1 August 2009
Snatch," Clever movie
","I guess this movie has the essence of the pure and sophisticated comedy, without parodies or aggressive jokes (which are sometimes very funny either). The movie itself is very unusual, crazy, alternative, and reminds very vaguely the atmosphere of Pulp Fiction.The beginning is intricate, but as the happenings go on, the relations between the characters get more solid and the situations, funnier.The acting couldn't be better; all of them were perfect for the roles, but Brad Pitt raised the level even more.I recommend this movie for the ones who are open-minded, by the fact that this is not a typical commercial movie; it innovates in some aspects and the result was a clever and sophisticated movie that may not be the taste of everybody.",9,0,1,5 July 2009
Meet Joe Black," It is worth the three hours
","When William Parrish is about to die, Death, in the body of Brad Pitt makes a deal with him: he will live longer than planned as long as William be his guide in Earth.After the deal the story develops in a very natural way. Death proves the Earth' passions one by one (food, desire, love, anger) and these moments make the movie be worth it. Brad Pitt knew how to act like a naive child discovering a new world, and, at the same time, like a serious and cold creature.Claire Forlani also made an outstanding job. It's impossible to imagine another actress to interpret Susan, the beautiful, shy and naive William's daughter. Both roles (Death and Susan) worked perfect together, what contributes to the success of the movie.The negative point is the length of the movie. The movie itself is not too long, but the scenes are. There are some that it takes about 10 seconds for the character to say something, and this slows down the rhythm so much.",9,1,2,4 July 2009
The Happening," The intention was good...
","If you want to watch a great thriller that catches your attention through all the time, this movie won't suit for you.The plot is very original, with scientific explanations and everything. On the other hand, it is badly-worked, in a way that makes you think it was a wasted story.The acting is not convincing at all; Zooey Deschanel didn't do a good job (she made up for Yes Sir), and the other actors, excepting for Mark Wahlberg, also weren't that good.The script itself has some failures, some free violence, some happenings that are not easily understood, and some that are just not explained, although the thing that really makes you feel you wasted your money is the end, which is not just predictable, but also charged with emotions and acts that you can find in the most romantic of the romantic movies, what is totally contradictory with the kind of movie.All in all, just watch this if have nothing else to do or it's passing on TV; if you want to feel attached to your seat with your eyes goggled, try to find another thriller.",5,0,1,18 May 2009
Never Back Down," Surprisingly good
","This movie is quite predictable. The story of a boy that gets into trouble in school and starts fighting because of that isn't original, but between all the predictable movies with this theme, certainly this is the best.Your attention is caught in every single scene. I think the best merit of Never Back Down is that it mixes a lot of types of movie. At the beginning, it's like one of that silly teenager's movie, showing the school, party and girls. Then the atmosphere gets darker and the world of fighting is showed, as well as family's problems, turning everything into a drama. And then... I won't tell the whole story, but I assure that you won't get bored.The acting was very well done too, especially Cam Gigandet. He definitely knew how to be the typical bad guy; not like those annoying bad actors in teenagers movie, but a darker, more 'serious' one.Even with all these qualities that makes Never Back Down stands out, I don't think that older people will enjoy watching it... although the movie brings out a moral that fits in everyone.",9,31,47,14 August 2009
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," 1 and 2 were better
","I always liked animations like his one, but I just didn't like Ice Age 3. The other Ice Ages were so much funnier, with comic situations, and this one is all about family and kids and stuff like that, what turned it into a boring movie.On the other hand, there are still good scenes, creative situations and everything, besides that the animation itself is just perfect. Other thing that catches the attention are the 'subliminar sexual jokes' that, I think, just grown ups understand.All in all, I really think there are other movies of this gender much better. Finding Nemo is the best example, besides the other Ice Ages, like I said... It is not difficult to find others.",6,2,10,7 July 2009
