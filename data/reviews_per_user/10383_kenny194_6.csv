The Devil's Advocate," Charlize Theron has a nice body
","That's about all I can say about this movie that is positive.  Her and Keanu's sister.  I saw this movie in the theater, and have seen it twice since, and I still can't figure out what people see in it.  It's just plain awful.  The dialogue, and the acting is completely abominable all around. Keanu's lack of emotion is unusually irritating, as is Pacino's shouting for no reason, and Charlize Theron....gets naked.  People consider this a good movie, and I will forever be baffled as to why.",2,7,18,5 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why, George Lucas, Why?
","Oh, I remember my youth so well.  I used to think of the Force with great awe, as something mystical that could never be explained.  Then I saw The Phantom Menace.  I can't even begin to imagine what would posess George Lucas to want to ruin one of the greatest movie myths of all time, and explain the Force as something biological, which can be determined by how many parasites you have living in your blood.  To explain the Force is a crime against cinema, and therefore this movie is an embarrassment, an abomination.  No amount of cool light saber battles or pod races can ever change that.  Add in Jar Jar Binks and a huge cast of unnecessary CGI characters, and you have one of the worst movies of all time.",2,0,1,29 January 2000
The Big Lebowski," One Fantastic Movie
","I love the Coen brothers.  I once thought to myself, how can they top Fargo?This movie does it.  All the performances are great, and allow you to get a real feeling for the characters, even if, in cases such as John Turturo's, they are only on screen for a few scenes.  The script is amazing in that it keeps you guessing, introducing surprises all the way through, not just one Kaiser Soze-esque twist, but dozens of them.  And the direction is ingenious.  Any film maker who wants to insert a dream sequence into his film MUST watch this movie, because they can't be done any better.",10,1,1,20 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Not as good as everyone says
","When this movie was in the theaters, EVERYONE was talking about it as if it were the greatest thing ever made.  And then the oscars came about, and it won all kinds of awards that it didn't deserve.  Gwyneth's performance was adequate.  Judy Dench played the same character she always plays.  The direction was also merely acceptable.  The only award it deserved, and the only reason the movie was above average, is the screenplay.  Tom Stoppard puts in all the little Shakespearean touches that are just great and gives it just the right whimsical tone.  This movie was fair.",Null,0,1,20 October 1999
American Pie," Garbage, the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever.
","Never before have I seen a comedy that fails so miserably as this movie.  At least, I assumed it was a comedy, despite the fact that there was nothing even remotely laughable in it.  Anything that may have had even a small amount of humor was beaten to death by the commercials, so when it came up in the movie, all I could do was groan.  For example, all the jokes throughout the movie about the one kid's slut mom, and how everyone wanted to nail her were wasted, because everyone already knew that whateverhisnamewas would get her by the end of the movie, because it was in the commercial.  Same goes for the infamous pie scene.  If you want to shock people, don't show an edited, less interesting version of your shock scene in all the trailers, or put it on all the posters.  Perhaps had I not expected a pie to be molested, it would have been funny, but as it was, the scene was dull, at best.  I've seen 'Batman and Robin,' and 'Chairman of the Board,' yet this holds strong to the title of worst thing I've ever seen.  I wish I could give it negative stars, it was just awful.",1,5,12,24 January 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Remember when...
","...an agent impaled the Oracle with her own arm after ripping it out of its socket?  Wait, I think I dreamed that.  Oh yeah, remember when Morpheus jabbed a ballpoint pen into that French dude's windpipe?  What's that you say?  I dreamed that too?  Nuts.  Ooh, remember when the film reached a satisfying conclusion that made me feel like I hadn't just wasted two plus hours of my life while still leaving me anxious for the third one?  Aah, hell with it.",3,0,0,23 May 2003
