Scarface," best ever ...
",This movie is simply the greatest one ever made ! Al Pacino makes an all-time legendary performance as Tony Montana.Brian De Palma directed this masterpiece with help from Martin Bregman as the producer.This movie also has a phenomenal soundtrack from the hit-maker Giorgio Moroder.Few people know that this movie is the one that propelled Michelle Pfeifer into the Hollywood sky. I have to say that despite all my logical sense this movie is maybe the most underrated ever !It didn't even get an Oscar for the best actor !?That was maybe the greatest mistake by the people from the Academy.And again i have to say .......THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME !,10,0,1,10 February 2006
8 Mile," Cool, refreshing
","This movie is something that really refreshed the Hollywood studio.It's preety different than the other movies because of it's really interesting plot and great cast(including Eminem).I have to say that Eminem did an amazing job on his debut and that he really was fascinating in a role that is maybe very autobiographical.Phenomenal soundtrack including 50 cent and Xzibit and of course 'lose yourself'-the academy award winner.I think that the rap contest scenes are the best part of the movie, because they were made so realistic.After all, a movie that is surely creating maybe even an another genre in something that i called movie industry and a great try !",10,23,29,13 February 2006
V for Vendetta," Best film of the 2006...DEFINITELY!
","Phenomenal film! I couldn't take my eyes of it, partially because of the fascinating action but mostly because of the incredible plot that got me thinking days after the film...Character of V is really incredible and well presented in the film by Hugo Weaving.As a reader of the comic i have to say that film has more action and it's kind of...faster, you know what i mean? Natalie Portman also has a significant role as Evey, V's only helper. Best scene, to me, is the one on the beginning when V is destroying all those buildings while the classical music plays loudly in the background.It really looks as a perfect introduction to the spectacle that follows...After all, you got to give credit to Alan Moore who deserves all the praise for the story. James McTeigue made it big time, and as for the Wachowski brothers, you can only say...THEY DID IT AGAIN!",7,3,6,31 July 2006
