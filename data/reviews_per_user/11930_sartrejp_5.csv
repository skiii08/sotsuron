The Rock," Tortured buddy film
","Angry Marines've taken tour group hostage on Alcatraz, to protest unfair treatment. Also hold some lethal weapons. Biochem. meister Nicolas Cage & mystery con Sean Connery end up charged with freeing hostages, defusing weapons.Cage & Connery characters have nothing in common but must work well if grudgingly together, in the bowels of the island prison. Cage is high strung & scared; Connery is mean & methodical. The product is some very entertaining exchanges. The exchanges betw. two great actors, Ed Harris & Connery, are riveting, although way too brief. Excellent supporting cast. Movie has an outstanding music score too, which really adds some high drama to the massacre of the SEAL team.Before Cage & co. descend on Alcatraz, there's a bit too much time frittering, & tension is deflated if not eliminated by Cage's barfing scene, & the obligatory chase scene with the ageist little old lady crossing the street (she's on screen less than seven seconds, & you just know it's some stuntman made up!) & the frightened cable car conductor might leave you cringing rather than on the edge of your seat.Fair-to-middling action picture with some fine dialog, if one-too-many sight gags.",Null,1,2,4 October 2002
American Beauty," Highly stylized & wicked flick
","Highly stylized account of lives of quiet desperation. Kevin Spacey & Annette Bening are husband & wife passing each other on the escalators of middle class mobility.Foremost: Annette Bening is like super incredible. I always though she was just some babe that had something to do with Warren Beatty. Wow!: that scene where she convulses into tears after the open house. Is that what they call visceral acting? I've seen American Beauty 4 or 5 times, & each time that scene sends chills up my spine. Her whole quirky, esteem less, desperate-for-attention persona places her on par with Streep et al.American Beauty is a fascinating example of the notion of imagination forcing a disconnection with consciousness. Spacey's fantasies about the teenager & the Marine neighbor: more elements of horror than titillation. If you like something beyond being passively entertained, see American Beauty. Post-pop priestess, pre-American Idol Paula Abdul choreographed the cheerleader sequences.",Null,0,1,27 September 2004
Apocalypse Now," Original movie mythology
","This movie rockets beyond the hype. We are watching mythical creatures come to life. Every exchange here, every character has 2dary & 3diary meanings: Dennis Hopper is not just a photojournalist or just a sleazy sycophant: he's the insane harlequin ('The man's enlarged my mind!') in Heart of Darkness & he's Sean Flynn, the son of another mythical movie giant, of Dispatches.Willard's narrative insists that the more he saw of them, the more he hated lies. Marlowe in 'Heart' can't bring himself to tell the truth, so he lies about Kurtz's last words, telling his 'intended' they were her name, instead of what we know they were, thus nailing himself to the heart of darkness. The movie is a journey up river & to the center of the earth.Maybe 'Now' is even the retelling of the Odyssey: Willard in search of Kurtz is Telemachus in search of Odysseus. But Brando's Odysseus is as mad at the end here as Odysseus tried to be in the Iliad. Then the Oedipal twist: kill the father & marry the memory ('It's no mistake that I got to be the caretaker of Walter E. Kurtz's memory.').Everybody here is mesmerizing: coldly professional assassin Capt. Willard is as dumbfounded as a 10 year old when confronted with the TV news team ('Make like you're fighting!'). The war may run by four-star clowns, but it's OK, because 'Charlie don't surf!'Just like Conrad threw up walls of words to bury his story, Coppola erects walls of symbolism to hide 'the horror.' There are endless diversions from the inevitable: 'I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.'Maybe one day there'll be a Redux redux: the post-Cold War 'Now.' Could there be dozens of Kurtzes, forcibly sequestered in caves or deserted monasteries by the war profiteers? With Willard the real Telemachus? What happened when Kurtz died? Did the tribes disband? Or are his minions waiting for the 2d Coming?",8,0,1,4 June 2002
Quiz Show," Entertainment 1, Corruption 0
","About 20 minutes into the movie, I noticed the Rob Morrow character had a Boston accent. I hadn't caught his name, so I thought Bobby Kennedy? Dick Goodwin & wife Doris Kearns Goodwin are probably more familiar as professional PBS talking heads on those Ken Burns dynamos. But apparently around 1958 or so Goodwin was fresh out of Harvard Law, buried in a decidedly unfresh Capitol Hill library ('Must've been an oversight.' 'We're an oversight committee.') & working for a Senate committee.Assigned to investigate wacky game show contestant Herbert Stempel's (John Tuturro, in bravura performance) complaints about network failures to deliver on promises (to put him on another show), Morrow's Goodwin is portrayed as a knight wanting to bring down networks & sponsors; he finds that his fellows merely want to bring down people: Stempel & his 'Twenty One' successor Chas. van Doren. (The names are the same: only the degree of sincerity's been changed to protect the guilty.) Officials & their constituency thought TV was an entertainment medium & were determined to find it @all costs.Turturro's desperate madness & Morrow's cool methodology make for some great exchanges: Quiz Show's best feature is its highly literate script (see memorable quotes @this site). With Martin Scorcese as the Geritol rep. & Barry Levinson as orig. Today Show host Dave 'Peace' Garroway. Paul Scofield is riveting as literary brahman Mark van Doren.",7,3,4,7 February 2005
Mystic River," Film version of Albinoni's Adagio
","Dreary & finally pointless movie: if Clint Eastwood had made The Deer Hunter. Childhood pals, long estranged, are brought together when one of the pal's daughters is murdered.Stars got the Boston accents down, although Tim Robbins's reticent character is a variation on his old Andy Dufresne persona, but in the end the murder has nothing to do with the three pals & none of the main characters changes (well, yeah, except for Robbins). The failure here: murder as plot device to delve into the past of the pals; pals, tho, peripheral to murder. I mean, it's not like Jimmy's daughter was killed to punish him!Robbins et al. are enjoyable to watch, & I'm sure the effort here was sincere, but the movie went on way too long after the case was solved, & it looks as if creating a 'work of art' took precedence over making a coherent movie, which along with a score by Eastwood was a 3d-rate film version of Albinoni's Adagio, sometimes called the most depressing piece of music ever.",Null,0,1,6 July 2004
