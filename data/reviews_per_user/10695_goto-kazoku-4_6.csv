However, he has to be the king because his brother withdraws the crown. Then he begins to train for speech with Lionel who doesn't have a medical license.The scene which they practice is so funny. I laughed out loud. The method of training is unique and it is amusing the attitude of Lionel that doesn't flinch at the king. His wife, the queen, is strong. I think just she is the wife of the king. He is lucky that has marvelous wife. Certainly, king have to be perfect man. Because king is object of worship of the nation. However, even king may have shortcoming. Of course, it is common people have fault. But it is hard for a king of a nation.

I do not know that 'that' is right, however, I cannot contradict.It is difficult problem whether criminal who is arrested once is released or not. I think that if criminal has high skill, we must not release him. Also, the problem whether the death penalty is allowed or not is difficult. I felt that form this film.",Null,0,1,11 September 2013

Therefore it is hard for such a child, Cole. Cole expressed sadness well, so I was painful to watch.I like horror movies very much. I have watched the movies which ghosts attack people or have hate, therefore this film is fresh for me because they think that the ghosts ask help. I feel good that they told the truth of a dead girl. I imagine that the girl is surely happy. The capacity of Cole is not monster, but the capacity which he can save everyone from suffering. And there are no ends that I was shocked about this end.",Null,0,0,11 September 2013

Therefore he is suspected and interrogated by police. Then he talks why he could answer correctly.The form that he looks back on the past while he answer the quiz is interesting. I could understand one by one why he could solve the questions. I watched this when I was 14 years old and I could understand better this time because I had studied world history. I knew the fear of religious issue again. I was shocked that police didn't listen to their request. I also was scared to watch the scene that men flooded. I felt sad when I imaged that there are tourists who enjoy their trip, whereas there are such children. Even if he is tear with a woman who he love, Rathika, he never gives up and goes after her. Jamal is cool and beautiful very much. Incidentally, I like Jamal's brother, Salim.",Null,0,2,8 September 2013
