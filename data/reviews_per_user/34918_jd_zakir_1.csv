The Avengers," 3D Spectacular was more of a damp squib!
","I was hoping that this film would be just as exciting and involving as the Super Hero films I have seen over the last 12 years - X-Men, X2, Spiderman 1 & 2, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Iron Man - I could watch them and really enjoy them time and time again - but this one - it just didn't do it for me! I'm not sure why, but even with the 3D effect - to be honest, didn't make much difference, until the final battle sequence - but even then it was few and far between! I think this film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk - was that supposed to sound impressive? There were a few funny bits, especially with the Hulk, but on the whole the film just dragged on without a real purpose - I hope the supposed sequel will be much better!",5,12,35,28 April 2012
