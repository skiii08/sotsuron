The Blair Witch Project," Incredible scam
","I can't understand how this ugly and very boring movie(if we can call it a movie) arrived into the movie theaters. No scenographie.No costumes.Unacceptable cinematography. Stupid story.Mediocrous actors.Slow rythm.No scaring.No emotional.Really seven $ wasted, In all the story of movies, this is the scam of the century. Never in my life I watched a movie worst than this. As votes go from 1 to 10 I gave 1, but the real vote is ZERO! Don't waste your time and your money entering in the group of scamed watchers this garbage.",1,1,3,8 December 1999
Deja Vu," He can speak!
","Jim Cavietzel can speak! Great news for people who care. Just kidding. This movie is very cool. At the beginning I was hoping in a very technological and maybe political movie. After some tens of minutes it becomes sci-fi and the evolution is a little bit really 'deja' vu', I mean that the second part is a little predictable. Anyway Tony Scott is a good director, cinematography and acting are great,and we have an almost new beautiful actress Paula Patton.Denzel Washington got fat so Val Kilmer but they are a good presence anyway. The rhythm is good as in the action scenes as while talking. A movie for all. If you are man, woman,old, young and blah blah..you all have the same odd to enjoy this movie.Maybe if you like only independent movies and I mean 'just' independent movie you don't have to go.",7,2,4,24 November 2006
Unbreakable," Genre drama (it means for the poor audience)
","Unbreakable in this movie must be only the b...s of the poor audience. Never in my life I saw something as boring and ugly as can be this intollerable and stupid movie. Nothing here is good. Locations are ugly, so the costumes. Story is a real nonsense. Bruce shows just one of his only two acting expressions. The direction is always very very slow (indian timing). Cinematography is dark and bleak. The music seems like in an epic movie of 50s. I rate this movie 1 like BATTLEFIELD EARTH where at least there where some nice and strange piercing on the nose (and that's it) If you are curious for watching this movie wait for it on TV Miro",1,1,3,26 November 2000
Spider-Man 2," Boring, boring, boring......
","Why this movie cash so big at box office? Why people rate so high this ugly and so boring movie. Everything looks old fashion in this horrible movie. It is slow, it is stupid and, over all, so boring. Tobey Mc Guire is so sad and anonymous, the story is so banal, fx are too few and bad done. I rate this movie 1 on 10. On the opposite I saw the beautiful 'King Arthur' which is rated very low in this website and I loved it. (read my post about). What I have to think? Classical American characters achieve the success even if boring, on the opposite if the director is black the rate is always bad. I am white but I blame this way to do in this culturally pathetic Bush America. All my respect to: Kenneth Ivory Wayans, Spike Lee, Antoine Fuqua and all the other underestimated black great directors.",Null,0,0,10 July 2004
Insomnia," Robin disaster
","The only thing that I can say about this movie is the following. This is just a normal, boring, slow movie until Robin Williams enters in the scene. After that this movie becomes unwatchble. Why, at the beginning of his career, people loved this ugly and boring actor? Usual brainwash.",2,6,14,18 January 2003
Snatch," Do we get a new Alan Parker?
","..No! We get a new great director. Mister Guy Ritchie, who deserve not to be the new Alan Parker or Madonna's husband but just himself. This movie is so original, full of ideas, dynamic, tough and fun, is the only in the last year really new. I got a lot of doubt about this movie before because of the director overknown just as the man who married Madonna. I saw this movie because i like the cast and I discovered a new director with a great future. Good for him and for the audience. Congratulations to the author !",8,0,0,21 January 2001
Closer," Unbelievable !
","Mike Nichols is back. Great movie! Great acting! Great script! The best Mike Nichols's movie since 'the graduate' with Dustin Hoffman. For sure this movie does not have anything less than the movies which have been nominated to the Academy awards. I can't tell anything about the story and I don't know how spend my ten lines. I just can say that it is a movie about love and cheating but without sin. If you are intrigued by that this is your movie. If you like a good, really classic, based on a good script cinema you'll love this movie. I missed it at the theater, I was not sure if rent it,I was wrong,I saw it on DVD, I loved it. If you are too much prude or you are scandalized from some bad word don't watch it.....is rated R.",8,0,0,30 March 2005
Lost in Translation," The importance of being Coppola
","I saw this movie one month ago but I have been waiting so far for my comment to watch the Oscar night. I think this is a nice movie nothing else. A honest work by an average director at his second movie. Bill Murray does not give his best. Sophia seemed a little beat disappointed from receiving just one Award for her 'masterpiece'. What a such arrogance! I imagine what the Wachosky brothers should think when I remember that 'the Matrix' was almost forgotten in 1999 and 'Reloaded' has been completely forgotten this year. I saw a lot of small movies which I found nicer than L.I.T and I can't understand those three nominations or the great vote, eight, in IMDB. Anyway I guess that in few years nobody will rent again L.I.T. On the opposite I guess that the 3 Matrix will remain in the story of the cinema. By the way at least L.I.T is not as boring a Virgin suicides. (Read my comment about........if you like). I want too a such powerful father!",5,0,2,2 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Wait for it on tv
",Lord of the rings is very very very boring. It is very well done but it is boring. Three hours are really to much for almost any movie and also this movie was better showing one hour less. I guess that this is a movie very good to see on tv. Better in dvd and split in two nights.,3,1,2,21 December 2001
American Beauty," Beautiful American Movie
","Should be time wasted spending too many words about this movie. Every one knows that every one liked this movie. Me too. For sure it deserve his nominations and it will be easy the winner also because the only beautiful movie like that, The Matrix, has been forgotten almost at all from the Academy,",9,0,0,5 March 2000
Being John Malkovich," very very very good!
","I can't understand why this beautiful movie is cashing so little at the box office. Story is very original and full of new ideas. Acting is very good. Time runs fast with a lot of fun. Everything is genially. My only suggest is this: go and watch, you will remain satisfied for sure. If you already watched: The Matrix,American Beauty,Fight club you don't get nothing else to watch which is good like Being J. Malkovich. Maybe the title is ugly and does not reflect the soul of this movie but if you wasted seven dollar watching a garbage like ******* ******** you could spent One Million to watch a real 'cameo' like this fantastic film. (I'm not a J.Malkovich friend or something like) Miro Viglianesi",7,0,1,11 December 1999
Being John Malkovich," incredible
",It's impossible to me to understand why a very very very good movie like this is cashing so little at the box office. I presume that the TITLE is wrong (It should be better: 'seven floors and half'. I also presume that the  look of J. Cusack & Cameron Diaz has been another wrong. Third wrong: too few advertising (We have to remember that an ugly movie like Blair Witch cashed a lot just for a perfect publicity) I hope that producers will give another chance to S. Jonz who created one of the best movie of the year. I loved this movie. Miro Viglianesi,7,0,1,1 December 1999
Ocean's Eleven," Don't believe to 7.9
","How people can rate 7.9 this boring and empty movie? Action is zero. Style is very very old. Clooney acts like a dog. Script is not original at all. Just the cinematography is very good, all the rest is nothing. The rhythm is very slow like in the other Soderbergh movies. Go, if you want, at your own risk.",3,0,1,9 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Did you see the trailer?
","If yes, you saw what is enough, in this case don't go. If you did not see the trailer watch it and that's it,save 7 and half dollars. Don't fall in the advertising trap. This movie is to long, to stupid, to boring.",4,0,0,16 June 2001
Alien vs. Predator," The dumbest movie I have ever seen
","I can't say if you'll like this movie but for sure this is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. Mixing Alien with Jurassic Park, The beauty and the beast, Godzilla and some other garbage ideas, shooting always in the dark, the director created this kind of mess. I can't really tell the story, I'll try: A team of archaeologist,scientist and climbers retrieve an under-ice ancient city full of aliens. After some time appear some Predators. Aliens and Predators start a fight between them. The number 1 Predator fall in love for a nice scientist-girl and together they beat the number 1 Alien. Most of the time you see some kind of rumble in almost total darkness listening Aliens and Predators making strange sounds. Pathetic! A dumb movie for dumb people.",3,0,1,15 August 2004
The Transporter," very good action
","this movie keeps exactly what it promises in the trailers. a lot of action, some humor and an almost new action actor. it runs very fast for 92 minutes. the story is quiet original the dialogs are so and so. the director knows his job. it passes his test.",7,0,0,11 October 2002
Hero," Magic movie
","People rated this movie 8.5 on the opposite the posts  very often are tough. For me this movie is magic. The use of the colors is really fantastic. Everything you see is made by great taste. The battles are impressive and the duels are beautiful. The acting is very very good. I don't agree with who says that this movie is philosophically wrong because tales without criticism about the 1st selfnominated Emperor Shi Huangdi who was a bloody dictator. The philosophy Ghandi style of Broken Sword is the real message of the movie. The nameless warrior don't get a name because he is just the metaphoric representation of the nemesis. Believe me this is a great great movie. It sounds to me very strange that 'Hero' needed two years to find a distribution in the USA and it gets so poor advertising. That means that distributors are blind. In my opinion this movie is very better than 'Crouching Tiger...'. Usually I like fast action movies but this was so magic! Unfortunately actors speak Chinese with English subtitles and sometimes reading takes away your attention from the scenes, any the way I rate 'Hero' 9/10.",9,0,0,30 August 2004
Mulholland Drive," 8,3? Impossible
",It is totally impossible that such 'original' movie could be appreciated so much by so many people. Impossible. We can go on believing that those are real votes? I can't,7,0,1,2 May 2002
Shrek 2," Another target completely achieved
","Don't worry if during the first 10 minutes of this movie it seems a little bit slow or sentimental. This is a great confirmation of the first one. 3D, colors, story, humor, everything is perfect and step by step the movie grows up and becomes better and better. For sure if you liked Shrek you'll like this second one. Bring your family and friends and go. I did. Honestly I guess that I'll go back and see it a second time to the movie theater and I'll buy the DVD as I did the first time. And don't think that this is a movie for children only, many people should see this movie and learn something from its philosophy. If you'll not like this movie, start to ask yourself what does not work in your soul. ( Nobody payed me for those nice words). Enjoy !",9,0,0,28 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 8.5 ?? How many people Tarantino payed for reaching that ?
","We have been waiting many years for this new Tarantino movie. It was better waiting more and get something else. How people could rate this mess 8.5? Unbelieveble. This movie seems a chinese movie from 35 years ago which has been remade using famous occidental actors. The plot is pretty cheap, banal and simple. The movie is monotonous and also a little beat boring. Based just on some sword duel (all identical) and that's it. It is not spectacular, too few crowd in the movie, nothing is new. The real vote for this movie should be 1 but, as other many times, the director of the cinematography helps the director to raise some vote more using nice games of colors and giving a nice look to a real useless filmband. I'll don't see for sure the next one (Kill Bill chapter 2). I already know that, after killing, in this one, 3 of her 5 ennemies, Mamba will kill the other 2 in the next one. Just one difference: the duel between Mamba an Bill will be longer. For that reason she killed 3 people in the first movie and just 2 in the second one. If you wanna waste 9$ and be scammed from this fake 8.5 go and gape.",3,21,33,19 October 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 8.5 ?? How many people Tarantino payed for... - Chapter 2
","Tarantino will give us a chapter2? I also wanna do that but just to add some comment about what other people wrote about this movie. 1)Scirceo from San Antonio wrote:'I saw this movie on Friday, Saturday, and may go again today.' 10 out of 10 I can't believe it. People come back watching a movie several time when the plot is complicate (this is enough easy also for dumb or  impaired people but here we get a very simple plot with almost no dialog. 2)Ronin 47 from Sacramento wrote `In a nutshell, the best movie I've seen in 5 years (****) `. This is the funniest bul.... I have heard in 5 years. I wanna just list some movie from the last 5 years. American History X (1998) -  Saving Private Ryan (1998) - Truman Show, The (1998)- American Beauty (1999)- Fight Club (1999)- Matrix, The (1999)- Sleepy Hollow (1999)- Gladiator (2000)- Mission: Impossible II (2000)- Pitch Black (2000)- Fast and the Furious, The (2001)-Monsters, Inc. (2001)- Shrek (2001)- Spy Kids (2001)- Swordfish (2001)- And may others (Even the deludental Lara Croft or Charlie's Angels are any way much better than Kill Bill Zeeman from Saint John wrote:'Tarantino is a genius... another masterpiece' How this user can say that? The plot is as simple as a 3rd world movie and the duels seem slow and banal after what we saw in The Matrix or Crouching Tiger. I guess that all those people have been to the movie theatre very rarely in the last 5 years. This movie is just an empty stupid movie based on some blood splashing and some visual effects which make `Blade' a visual masterpiece in the confrontation.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," How old are you?
",this is the most important question. If you are between 3 and 13 years old you can go and maybe enjoy this movie. Honestly I can't say that this is a bad movie but it could be better. HP is too long and not very fast but is not even too much slow. Scenarios are nice and that's it. Nothing more to say.,6,0,1,19 November 2001

Casino Royale," The very truth about Casino Royal
","People who rates this movie just 1 is unfair, they like the traditional Bond and are too tough with this one. People rating this movie 10 are for sure people working for the production company. The very truth is what follows. Daniel Craig is a cool actor but is very wrong for James Bond. Bond is a classy man, Craig is a tacky and ordinary guy. While he is wearing a tuxedo he looks like a restaurant maitre. Bond must look like an English man and Craig looks like a former Yugoslav soldier. When a couple of years ago the production company indicated Daniel Craig as the new Bond we all did not like him, later they pushed him so much and showed us surveys where it looks that 70% of the people like Craig more than Brosnam and step by step we all accepted Craig as a new possibility. But let's talk about the movie. At the beginning Casino Royal starts with a great long scene where Bond pursuits, running,a black very athletic guy and that is the best scene of the movie. Later just boring. If you liked the traditional Bonds this movie is not for you. It does not even look as another Bond movie. The ambiance and the cinematography seems more similar to horror movies like 'Saw'. In this movie Bond does not get any gadget or technology, never uses alternative vehicles (fast boats, wave runners, bikes ecc.,nothing). Craig is in better shape than the prior Bonds but the acting...mmmmmm, for sure he will not receive an Oscar for his performance. The scheme of this movie is exactly the traditional scheme: it stars with an action scene, later nothing cool happens for 100 minutes and it ends with a short action scene. In the meanwhile it is boring and visually ugly. It is a completely new way to shoot a Bond movie, it is more actual but maybe it was better give to this movie a title like: 'The adventure of an eastern spy' and show that to another target. I don't think that this movie will be loved by Bond's fans.The real disaster is the section make up, costumes, hairdressing. Those particulars are so vulgar and ugly to make us watching ugly even Eva Green who is, on the opposite, very very very beautiful (did you see 'The dreamers' or 'Kingdom of heaven'?). Bond's shirts can make Sears shirts looking classy and elegant. Real rate is 4. The director, Martin Campbell, who is the same of 'The legend of Zorro', 'Vertical limit' and other movies which never reached the rate 6 on IMDb, never has been a great one and, at 66 years old, wants to give a modern dress to this movie, but for doing that you must be 35. Go if you are curious but don't expect anything really good.",4,16,28,22 November 2006

The Replacements," my eyes lie, so my ears

Shark Tale," Bad rates and bad posts -Why?- This movie is fantastic
","Don't listen to people who talks bad about this fantastic movie. I loved all made by Pixar 3D movies (Toy Story, Monsters, Ice age and Nemo)and I respect Pixar as the company who invented this kind of cartoons but I loved Dreamworks 3D movies too(Shrek and Shark Tales). So I have seen the all of those. In my opinion Shark Tale is very better than Nemo. Nemo has been the first one under water and I can understand that impressed people a lot but Shark Tale is really funny and cool. I don't know why so many bad posts. Somebody wrote: 'Don't bring your children to this movie they will be bored'. This is an absurdity. I liked this movie very much more than Nemo as it is great in the same way as graphic but very funnier. I guess that many of those posts are pushed by somebody who has a particular convenience to do that. Shark Tale is a great great 3d movie, funny and intelligent. I'm on the point to come back to the theater and see it again. Go and see it with or without your children, you will be not disappointed. My vote is 8 on 10.",8,6,12,17 October 2004
The Island," Nice movie with something wrong
","The script is the best thing in this movie. Michael Bay is a great director but he is not the right one for this movie. A couple of fantastic car-action scenes are in this movie but they should be not. This is not BadBoys II, it looks more similar to Artificial Iintelligence. Ewan Mc Gregor is a good actor but he is not the right one. Scarlett Johanson looks like a potato on the screen and she is the real flow of this movie. While I was reading E.W. I suddenly saw a picture of Scarlet in her white pajama with her only empty expression on her face and I immediately understood that this movie will be a flop.Costumes are pathetic and the costume designer should be hanged up. Go anyway and see it. The story is very interesting and it is never boring. My rate 7 on 10",7,1,5,25 July 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," the tragedy goes on
",i'm sorry Homer!Forgive and forget! In this horrible season the tragedy goes on. I'll not waste many words for this useless and boring movie.
