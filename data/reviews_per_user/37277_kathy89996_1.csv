Howl's Moving Castle," Excellent Movie Where Creativity Runs WILD
","Putting my absolute admiration for the director Hayao Miyazaki aside, Howl's Moving Castle is an epic and awesome anime movie. The art is amazing and is hand drawn, do not think for a second that this means that the characters don't look good. If anything, it makes it so much more human like and real. This fantasy movie rocks the world and the more times you watch it the more you like it and identify the clever hints hidden in dialogue. I Absolutely love the movie's magical world with it's charms and potions. It is only very loosely based on the book, in fact all that's the same is that character names and the moving castle. But for Hayao Miyazaki to actually IMAGINE and Flesh out the castle and the parallel worlds and magic is truly raw talent and skill. His movie should not really be compared to the book at all since they are nearly completely different. This is a must watch movie for all ages! AND if you happen to think your too old then wait till you have children and encourage them to watch this movie, its so rare to find a movie good in every aspect with originality these days and this movie deserves to be past on and remembered as a true classic.",10,0,1,1 December 2010
