The Blair Witch Project," Which witch may peer into the pitch and see but not be seen?
",With all the positive incantations concerning this film it would behoove me if I didn't mention a portion of the holistic majic provided by pure ad lib. The characters are as real as they come because their reactions are from their own imaginations.  Hence the film is insidiously tense and I found myself enjoying this near uncomfortability. It was a pleasure to see fertile imagination win out against special effect over-budget mania. Cold cacklingly recommended!,8,1,1,24 July 1999
