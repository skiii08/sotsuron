Captain Marvel," Could be better
","I'm I 1 of the biggest marvel fans in the world and love captain marvel in the comics and the film but the film is trying to be to towards feminism which I have nothing against but it just fill forced , they do this by making characters like Marvel a women instead of a man like in the comics , also they add in that before she got her powers that she couldn't fly in the army which didn't affect the story and yet again just felt forced and if you have seen the trailers you have seen the film there was no action scene (apart from the last 1 which you still see bits of in the trailer) that was not in the trailers . However under all of this hides a good film which has set up End game vary well but the story could have been better .

People also complain about Hulk but he had a big role and my production is that he won't cope with black widows death and this will lead to wwHulk which is were he loses control and try's to destroy everyone. These little details and deaths will lead to better films and that's just one of the many reasons to why this film is a 10.",10,2,5,28 April 2019
