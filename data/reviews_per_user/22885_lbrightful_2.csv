The Avengers," Good, Not Great
","After hearing my family rave about how incredible, awesome, amazing, blah, blah, blah ... this movie was, my wife and I went to see it. We are HUGE Marvel fans, and we were excited to see the movie. Our expectations simply were not met relative to all the hype, and this film is not worthy of an 8.6 rating. It's a very good movie, but not great by any means. Here's the good and the bad.The Good: The special effects were outstanding as you would expect. The acting was also nicely done. The script was somewhat well paced, although we both felt it started fairly slowly. The movie did had some of the funniest moments of any super hero film I've seen. The storyline was OK, but that brings me to the bad.The Bad: The storyline was just OK. I won't spoil the movie, but suffice it to say the anti-heroes motivations were somewhat silly to me. That said, it follows (somewhat) to the comic storyline, so the plot was never really all that interesting to begin with. The actors and directors did the best they could with the plot, but I was never pulled into the story that deeply, nor did it strike any emotional connection or interest for me. It was just a great action movie that was well acted with a reasonable script.Avengers is a very good action film, and worthy of seeing on the big screen. However, to see this film rated so close to the Dark Night is preposterous. Those films are in totally different leagues.",7,4,10,24 June 2012
Man of Steel," Where Was Superman in this Movie?
","For anyone that grew up reading Superman comics or enjoying Superman movies you will immediately notice that this is a VERY different story than we've ever seen on 'Superman'. The Superman we knew protected people and the planet with his life. He also protected his identity and developed a love affair with Lois Lane. He was faster than a speeding bullet. He was driven by principle and purpose. So I ask, where was 'that' Superman? The writer and director of this movie chose to abandon the actual history of the character and literally just make one up of their own. This Superman has no problem letting people die or killing people. His struggles with who he is and what his purpose is. As for him and Lois, they have a very poorly developed attraction to each other in this movie.The movie is FILLED with plot angles that make little to no sense, and it BEGS viewers to abandon sensibility and just focus on the explosions, graphics and action. And trust me, there is A LOT of action. For me, it was too much action and too little actual story.This is not a Superman that this generation of kids should get to know. This was an abomination of the Superman story and character and only gets 4 stars because of solid acting by people like Russell Crow & Kevin Costner and because the graphics guys did their jobs well. To DC Comics, you really owe your fans an apology. How could you do this to the most iconic action hero in modern history? Shame on you.",4,2,7,24 June 2013
