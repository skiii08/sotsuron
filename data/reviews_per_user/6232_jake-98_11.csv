Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The wait is over, but was it worth it?
","It was no 'New Hope', nor an 'Empire', and not even a 'Jedi' but 'The Phantom Menace' was in fact a 3 star movie that thrilled certain members of the audience, but not me.  Maybe i expected more from the movie, but I believed certain special effects hindered the movie at times.  'Menace' had its share of difficulties; Jar Jar Binks, the two headed race announcer, the trade federation bad guys and the underwater city, all these factors hindered the ability that this movie had to gain prosperity in the film world.  The plot was a good one (I won't give it away), the battle scene between the droids and the Jar Jars(?) was great and the final light saber battle-all were entertaining and I think any fan of the Star Wars trilogy should without a doubt see it.  Jake Lloyd's acting was below par, while Ewan MacGregor's was great.  See it for yourselves though and relive the adventure.  3 stars out of 4. - Jake Klim",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The greatest action/adventure movie every made.
","The exciting saga of an archaeologist who is sought upon by the United States Government to find The Ark of the Covenant before the Germans do. The future of the free world depends on Jones finding the relic, because 'he who marches with the ark before him is believed to be invincible'. The film mixes fantasy with an actual circumstance that could develop, which keeps the viewer on the edge of his. Jones is faced against his arch enemy Renee Belloq, a French archieologist, who heads the expedition that takes place in random abstract locations around the globe. Jones is joined with Marion Ravenwood, his former teacher's daughter, on this great quest to save mankind. Ronald Lacey is excellent as Toht, Belloq's allie and a sinister villain who will kill anyone who stands in his way. Some great scenes include the infamous 'boulder chasing Indy scene' and the 'pit full of snakes'. The film also contains the greatest action sequence in the history of filmaking-The Desert Chase. To tell any more would ruin the movie. A film everyone should see, and a film one can watch over and over again. My favorite movie of all time, it is #60 on the AFI's top 100 list. A 4 star wonder and a classic of its age. Spielberg's greatest accomplishment. The definition of a true adventure. -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)",10,0,0,22 January 1999
American Pie," It is as American as apple pie
","Frustrated and thirsty for sex, four Michigan high schoolers make a pact to lose their virginity by the time of their senior prom. Hysterically and boldly funny, American Pie brakes new boundaries in the field of raunchyness portraying scenes of masturbation, strip teases, father-son talks and more masturbation. Hilarious from start to finish with great character portrayals of a high school jock, an elegant neat freak who hates to use public toilets, the school 'sextololist'  and a nervous/curious American teen who longs for the next step. With a killer soundtrack to boot including songs from the late '90s, Pie is a must see because I think we all have been in their shoes... 3.5 stars/4 stars",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
North by Northwest," The definition of SUSPENSE is NORTH BY NORTHWEST
","N by NW is without a doubt the greatest suspense movie ever made. Hitchcock doesn't waste any time in the beginning of the movie, instead we see Roger Thornhill (Grant) immediately subdued by two estranged men who think he is George Caplan. A severe case of mistaken identity that leads to a never ending fight to find out why he is being chased and who Caplan really is. To tell you more about the plot would ruin the film for you. Famous for its crop dusting sequence and the Mount Rushmore sequence, but also be aware of the various get away scenes. The music is unbelievable and willingly suspenseful, it really gets your heart pounding. Yes that is Hitchcock during the opening credits who misses the bus. It is #6 on my top 50 list. 4 stars out of 4. Rent it tonight with your friends. -Jake Klim",Null,0,0,19 April 1999
American Beauty," A haunting, disturbing and pathetic look at an average American family
","You may have to sleep on it before you make your decision on American Beauty, because I found that after exiting the theater I could not make up my mind on whether I liked Sam Mendes' debut film. American Beauty searches for happiness within all the characters, whether it be falling in love with your daughter's sexy buddy and quitting your job to work at a hamburger joint, or by cheating on your husband business rival. The film tries to portray the message to do what you want and do it without thinking about the consequences, because you only live once. Without a doubt the best movie of 1999 and perhaps claims the best actor of the year-Kevin Spacey. And yes I had to sleep on it before I realized how much I liked this movie. 3.5 stars/4 stars",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
Being John Malkovich," Strange and at the same time interesting and entertaining
","What starts out as a comedy centered around a failing puppeteer, quickly escalates to a sci-fi/humorous picture about ones ability to look through the eyes of the actor John Malkovich. A different type of humor is used throughout the film that has you guessing as to where the picture is actually going. Film has many stars including Charlie Sheen that all play themselves. Kind of depressing at times and is Oscar nominating material. 3 stars/4 stars",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
The Untouchables," Al Capone should have paid his taxes.....
","Eliot Ness teams up with 'a good cop', a good shot and an IRS worker to bring down down one, if not the most notorious gangster in American history, Al Capone. The characters in the movie are fantastic Billy Drago as the relentless Frank Nitti, Charles Martin Smith as the goofy government worker Oscar Wallace and best of all is Sean Connery as the beat cop Jim Malone who teaches Ness to play by instinct and not the rules. Unforgettable scenes are the bridge-bootleg scene, the elevator scene, the 'teamwork' scene and the scene in Malone's apartment. You root for the good guys from start to finish in this great story of 1930s Chicago. Don't miss the quick scene in which you see Malone gulping down a few swigs of hard liquor. Based on the series that starred Robert Stack on television. 4 stars out of 4. #7 on my top 50 list. -Jake Klim",Null,0,1,19 April 1999
Psycho," Hitchcock's masterpiece is the greatest thriller of all time.
","Psycho is a movie with an incredible twist-turned plot that throws the audience's perspective of the film way out of proportion. It is Hitchcock's best, without a doubt. His nervous and jittery Norman Bates is outstanding. If you can guess the ending of this timeless classic, you are considered a genius in my opinion. I have watched this movie a number of times and still find it enjoyable to watch again and again, I also learn something new about the film every time I view it. Look for the various mentions of birds in the film (i.e. Marion Crane, stuffed birds). It is not a scary movie, so don't expect to be terrified of showers or of hotels-maybe this wasn't the case in 1960 though when the movie came out. It is more a thriller or a mystery, one that will still seem unsolved after you learn 'who done it'. #4 on my all time favorite list. It is excellence, 4 stars. -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)",Null,6,10,31 January 1999
All Quiet on the Western Front," The greatest war film of all time
","The 1930 anti-war epic still has the same effect today as it did  the year it was released. It tells the story of a group of young German men who are persuaded to fight for their mother land during World War One. They enlist hoping to gain medals and heroism but in reality learn that war is no game and that the whole idea of such a practice is redundant. The story is centered around Paul and his 19 year old friends who learn the obstacles they must over come while living among the trenches. Paul and his friends are befriended by Kat, a veteran of the German army who teaches them the ropes and skills needed to stay alive. The battle scenes are incredible even for today's technology especially the brutal machine gun and bombardment bits. Pay attention to the mental action displayed by each character for they all learn that war is not an adventure, especially for those who are faced with it. Based on Erich Maria Remarque's novel of the same name. A must see classic, that never is boring. Four star masterpiece. My second favorite movie of all time behind 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)",10,2,3,22 January 1999
Jaws," The movie that truly kept you out of the water
","Whether you are in a swimming pool or in the deep ocean frolicking in the water, be sure you have not recently watched 'Jaws'. The classic horror/suspense about a New England community terrorized by the fiercest creature that roams the ocean, the Great White Shark, changed the way that society looked at the playful and comforting atmosphere of the beach. Believe it or not, the audience does not even see the shark for the first 45 minutes or so of the film. Instead the use of a dorsal fin, barrels or a POV shot is used to determine the whereabouts of the shark throughout the film. Originally the movie was thought to be a bomb but with careful editing the film proved to be a success. Each actor was born for their part in th movie. A four star classic. -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)",10,2,4,26 January 1999
The Great Escape," Excellent characters and an excellent plot
","A facinating portrayal of characters ranging from American to English to Australian who are held prisoner in an allied POW camp. With Richard Attenborough as the leader and Steve McQueen as the unforgettable 'Cooler King' who tries and tries again unsucessfully to escape from the enemy prison. Filmed on location with beautiful cinematography (especially in widescreen) of the German countryside, The Great Escape tells the true story of a mass plan to escape not only the camp but Nazi Germany as well via underground tunnels. A highly organized exodus strung together by intricate coordination using where everyone involved has a job to do. Escape from Germany uses every means possible whether it be by boat, plane, bike, motorcycle, or train. Great near finale scene with McQueen (who did all his own stunts) trying to jump over the Swiss border on motorcycle while being pursude on all sides by the enemy. A must see wonder which I find a little underrated. 4 stars/4 stars",Null,2,4,5 November 1999
