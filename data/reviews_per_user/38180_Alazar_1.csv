Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," OUCH!
","This movie SUCKED!!!!  I really did not enjoy this movie.  The only thing that made it worthwhile were the special effects.  Jar Jar Binx was a pathetic attempt by George Lucas at humor.  Obi wan kenobi was a major suck up, hardly willing to break any rules the high council (big deal ) made. The only half-decent performance was given by Liam Neeson.  (It would have been decent had the movie not be a Star wars flick) .  The story is really boring because, well, you know Anakin Skywalker is Darth Vader  (that moron with the plastic face and asthma problem)  and you know that the good guys will win because they are all that is good and wholesome in the universe (yeah right).  In short, if you haven't seen  this movie don't.",Null,0,1,23 September 1999
