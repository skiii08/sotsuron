Black Swan," Over-dramatic and cliché
","The cliché aspect of this: this is so diatomic--the first half is the director yelling at the dancer to go from 'virginal white' to unleash the 'passionate black swan' which is... really not what I thought Swan Lake is about, but just seems to be made up and stretched to add a dramatic plot. The script is totally lacking--the mother has the worst, most cliché lines--'I gave up my life for you! Sweet girl!' and the director continues to pound the black-vs-white metaphor. Sexual harassment for advancement and the vengeful aging star also put in appearances here.It also seems pushing credibility: Portman seems to have an agonized, needy, nervous expression on her face during the entire film, complete with ragged uneven breathing, which is OK in a person-loses-her-mind film but ballet is famous for valuing athleticism & lightness of expression and no one so obviously nervous and unhinged would be let a lead role. For example, in the rehearsal scene where you can see everyone casually and elegantly doing a straightforward degage/fondu combination, Portman looks so nervous the audience expects she's going to bolt or break down at any second, straining credulity that this would go unnoticed by anyone else or that she would be picked for the lead. In many dance scenes [27:20], she performs with a furrow in her brow--is she psychologically tortured or is she confused and trying to remember how to do the combination? In one scene, there's a head shot of her looking nervous and not spotting, paired with a full body shot of her (presumably body double) confidently doing perfect passe turns, which is pretty physically impossible.The sensuality and club scenes were sexy and made a darker transformation, but again, it's hard to believe that ~suddenly everything is OK. I thought the sex added to the plot as much as the groping and come-ons did--people seem to be extra defensive for some reason. I liked the feathers growing out of skin as a kind of horrifying, shocking moment. I love the way Lily and Nina work together; Nina was not very sympathetic, but Lily was just so full of life and a bit sarcastic; I thought their relationship was great. I did think it was tasteless that Lily had a tattoo of black wings. 1) Can you be any more obvious 2) It seems pretty dumb and career-ending for a ballerina to get a tattoo there. But anyhow.The way scratches kept coming up were really chilling and it became a bit of a horror movie at the end that did shock me.Finally, it passed over ballet as a dance form and made it into a cliché: overworked dancer trying to strive for emotion and compete with other catty dancers. There's shockingly few dance scenes here--I'd say 50-75% of them are closeups of Portman's face and a camera wheeling around her shoulders and upper body, which is not dancing. Ballet has gorgeous lines and this movie doesn't really show any of it, which would be disappointing for dancers. It also doesn't accurately portray Swan Lake. More of a dramatic horror movie showing one deranged woman, rather than anything to do with the artistic endeavors of ballet.",5,5,8,28 October 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Ugh, reading too much into offensive material
","To the people who try to make this movie more intelligent than it really is by saying it ~exposes our American prejudices or whatever, all I see is someone conning strangers with elaborate stories of a Kazhak documentary. Every example on here is just someone hostile (New York), trying to be polite and easygoing (everyone else), or acting dumb (frat boys). It's funny but you can't laugh at people being made to play the straight man. The subconscious message here is 'aww, man, lighten up, it's just a joke!' and it's really not that funny to have everything in your shop breaking or a journalist acting like an idiot to get you to look like a bigger fool.+1 star for actually funny moments that don't involve conning strangers, like the chicken gags or some of the dialogue near the very beginning.Also, WTF for the lenient rating. I saw full on male frontal in this movie, gross.tl;dr humor doesn't have to be always at the expense of others",Null,0,1,17 September 2011
The Young Victoria," Cheesy but beautiful
","This is a really beautiful, sensitive, and romantic period movie. I like the surprising feistiness of Victoria, and the way the film fights against the subdued role of women in the Victorian age. There are some odd moments-- would Albert and Victoria's first meeting really be so honest, complaining about how they both felt controlled like chess pieces, with so much at stake? _while moving chess pieces_?! It felt cheesy at times then, but it does set up the central conflict of the film.The period pieces and drama are just really, really beautiful. Art/Costume is A+++, best I've ever seen in a period movie. There are little details like arranging sparkling wineglasses in order and focusing out. I kept trying to remember the color patterns of the gowns; they were so stylish. It's so inspiring. It's surprisingly historically accurate: they have a play on a that famous drawing where Victoria is told that she is queen, while still in her nightgown, with the councillors bowing down before her, which I thought was surprisingly sensitive. One reviewer says, 'I doubt if (the king) would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at (his sister in law) during a state banquet'. It's funny enough but the true story was that he did publicly yell at Victoria's mother while proclaiming his intention to 'carry on' until his lovely niece turned 18, so I loved to see that scene on film-- it's crazy to believe it actually happened. The music here is very classical and appropriate to the period, but you have to like Liszt and Schubert.I liked the characters more than I should've; it's romanticizing a harsher time. Albert's tutors upbraid him for not knowing Victoria's tastes, haha. He plays his part with subtlety, expressionless and reserved. Emily Blunt is so good in this role where you can see her frustrations, her anger, her happiness under a reserved demeanor.An unnecessarily dramatic ending, but I guess there does have to be romance in this movie to carry it along, since not much else is doing so. It's a little predictable and cliché--even as they were getting in the carriage I was thinking (knowing a bit about Victorian history) 'oh, they're probably going to shoot her now to make this a dramatic ending and tie up this movie nicely.' Sigh. There's no real intrigue, and plot points aren't carried out to the end (at one point, protesters storm at the palace gates, and Victoria shuts her eyes and rolls over in bed until the problem goes away.) I wish we were shown the intriguing romance with a story of how Victoria conquered the scheming at court in her first few years as queen; this movie is so mellow that it can only give us the romance.",Null,1,1,29 October 2011
Ghost," Cheesy
","This is a lovely story that's so, so cheesy. You have to watch it to see how much cheese is totally emanating from... well, everywhere. I like the accompanying plot twists and the villains are pretty villainous yet somewhat white-collar-gone-mad, which is a v. scary combination. At the same time, I felt like Moore took so long to believe her husband was a ghost despite all the details the psychic told her that a lot of the plot hinges on her being, well, idiotic? And what was going on with the kiss with the villain (where it's not romantic if she doesn't smack him and scream at him to get out, instead agreeing to have dinner with him?) Other plot holes include where Swayze takes over Goldberg's body and then begins to caress Moore, and I was so confused--almost illogical. During the entire romantic scene, I was wondering what it must really look like... Goldberg's character herself is really annoying, especially when Swayze has to coach her through a bank move--it was idiotic (again), and the plot hinged on it.This has really nothing to do with ghosts or the eternal or anything mysterious (there are scenes of demons from hell that are pretty ridiculous and over the top); it's just your standard love story... except they can never be together again. I love the performance by the subway guy, who is v, v, passionate. If this is about true love that lasts eternally, though, it's kind of depressing. I thought the special effects were kind of nice for the 1990s (of course super over the top in 2011). In general, a very standard, CHEESY movie that is helped by the strong side plot of crime and avenged death that drives the love story.",6,1,3,27 October 2011
Megamind," Great
","I love this movie. It's funny, it's sweet, it's dramatic, it's clever and it has great pacing. The soundtrack is old school and classic. It does suffer from bad marketing (being released in the same year as Despicable Me, another superhero movie) but it's ten times lighter on its feet, and more clever--with the kind of SNL gags that I think Tina Fey had a hand in writing. It also has a real ~heart with its hapless hero. Some of the gags (an unshaven Music Man) really point to some great scriptwriting and animation, with inside jokes for parents that abound. I love the cute sidekick Minion, which is a v adorable and smart fish. And the invisible car effects and the deranged superhero-turned-villain mixes the lines of motivations and human nature and gives us a fun plot to hold on to. Great movie.",9,1,2,27 October 2011
Despicable Me," Not very clever, a bit cliché, but great visuals
","I enjoyed this but I felt like it was definitely more for kids. The jokes weren't particularly witty or funny and were a bit overplayed; I didn't really feel any empathy for the main character, who was really. bizarre. Some critics say there were some jokes that adults only got, like the 'Lehman' reference as 'bank of evil' (um... not even funny). One thing they do get right is how annoying kids can be (pucker-face, not brushing teeth before bedtime, toilet pictures, sarcastic remarks... ha). Very cliché, so much so I had to cover my eyes at the lines these guys make. I felt like the visuals were very good; the kids' faces were very cute, the giant shark was hilarious, and the roller-coaster ride made me wonder how great this would be in 3D--I watched it in 2D and thought it was great already.",7,0,1,20 October 2011
