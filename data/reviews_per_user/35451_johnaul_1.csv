The Lobster," Great satire and hyperbole
","This film is neither pretentious nor stupid. This is a great representation of what it feels like to want to fit in: people will do whatever it takes. Starting from sitting and chatting with people you don't like and don't care about and ending with sacrificing (well, at first it seems like that) your life for a partner you have nothing in common with. Just wanting to fit in.
When or if you decide that you don't want to be a part of this group after all, you eventually come across another group that (as with the first one) seems great and just for you. But this one has it's ridiculous limits too.
You try to fit in even inside the couple you're in, holding on to one thing you have in common and even HERE you had to search for it.
We really are like that. 'The Lobster' just exaggerates our lives a little bit.",10,4,5,30 March 2020
