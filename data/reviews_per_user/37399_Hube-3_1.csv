The Blair Witch Project," Not Thrilled ... or Anything
","Just got back from seeing this film. Never a moment did wife and I feel a tingle except for mild embarrassment for the filmmakers.
Sure, good on them for getting such great distribution and marketing. More power and all that but the movie was, to us, not in the least engaging, scary, engrossing, etc.A Director and a Cinematographer (both of whom missed the classes on framing, movement, exposure, and focus) get on out to do a film on the Blair Witch Legend. One minute they are interviewing townsfolk (the verisimillitude they got from these actors was tops, by the way) and then, bam, we are in the woods and looking for some 'cemetery?' What did I miss? Did someone send them? Why were the legends so very diverse and misleading?At any rate, the hand-held 16mm finally crashes to the floor (still performing relatively well - at least the frame was steady) and the titles came up. The women in front of us said, 'That was stupid.' We agreed.",Null,0,1,28 August 1999
