The Blair Witch Project," Biggest waste of 90 minutes.
","I can't believe how bad this movie was.  I went in expecting kind of ''Spinal Tap' meets 'The Evil Dead'' and came out with ''Ishtar' meets America's Stupidest Home Videos''  The only thing scary about this movie is knowing that the guys who made it might make another film.  There was no action, no suspense, no character development.  The only thing I found less amusing than this movie was the preview for the movie with Forrest Whitaker as a Samurai.  I want my $10 and 90 minutes back.",Null,0,1,2 September 1999
