Minority Report," Ah, another philosophical dilemma!
","Well, here we have another classic example of a philosophical dilemma. They even mention it in the movie - something about metaphysics. Are we predetermined to do everything we do in our lives? Can we change our future? Do we even have a choice or as we call it, free will? This has been the topic of many many debates over the years and now it's captured in a grade A movie that makes it clear to us that... nothing is clear. Can we know anything? We don't know. That's the common answer, that's perhaps the only answer. We do not know, we cannot know, we will not know. Unclear? Yes, this is what this question provokes. The movie has great value both script-wise and production-wise. Most importantly. it's a movie with human value and that's what makes it leave a mark on us, as any good movie should.",8,0,0,26 November 2003
