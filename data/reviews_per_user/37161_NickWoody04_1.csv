Howl's Moving Castle," 7 Out of 10
","Howl's Moving Castle is an easily missable film but a great film once picked up off the shelf. Its story line brings to life the typical Japanese anime film genre. The actors and actresses have put an incredible effort into making this movie and they should be very proud of their efforts. Thsi film targets not only children but all age and sex groups. Howl's Moving Castle has an excellent setting to compliment its characters and it is obvious it is set in Japan. This is an unmissable film and should be watched by all Anime movie lovers. The time and effort put into his movie must have taken ages and I think it is worth it in the end as it is probably the best anime film i have ever experienced watching. Overall if your looking for an anime film I recommend and I'm sure many others will as well, Howl' Moving Castle!",7,0,2,16 November 2006
