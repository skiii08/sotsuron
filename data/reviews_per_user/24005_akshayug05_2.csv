The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," one of the most Boring movie ever made!
","Seriously, i was waiting for some action or story development throughout the movie but i didnt get one. 2 hours of dull drama in the sci-fi set.",6,0,1,4 May 2018
Spectre," James Bond Character is Dead
","they finally killed bond character, credit goes to SAM Mendis, Bond series need a fresh start now i.e. New Bond and New Director. in this bond you will doubt its whether a Bond movie or Bourne movie. they have turned a super spy in to ordinary emotional spy. no cool gadgets, no strong story, long length of the movie makes u somewhat bored. we cant see any original style of the bond here. you are going to miss the old James bond. a disappointment ahead if you have too much expectations, or you are a old hardcore bond fan. Finally a watchable movie which is not so worst and of-course not a best of the James Bond series. next time please make the bond as seen in Eon Fleming novels.",7,2,5,19 November 2015
