Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Less action, more talk
","In the original film, we saw Uma Thurman kill loads and loads of people to get to two people. She namely out to kill two out of the Assassin squad she had once been part of, but which later betrayed her. After she managed to kill two out of it's four members, the movie ended. But we all knew that a Volume 2 was coming up.In Volume 2 she goes after the remaining members of the Assassin squad, plus it's leader: Bill. This time, it's awhole lot of more talk and less action. In contrast to the assassins played by Lucy Liu and Viveca A. Fox in the first volume, the assassins in these films (played by Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah) are very much developed. At least Michael Madsen's character (Budd). We follow him for a few hours of his life, prior to the moment when the Bride shows up. However, it appears Budd is quite resourceful and manages to evade the Bride's attack.Daryl Hannah's character Elle is brought into the picture as Budd wants to sell her a sword. Elle get's a little less development as we don't really see any scenes from her normal everyday life. But from the dialogue she later shares with The Bride, we get to know quite abit about her character. Superbly done, everything. The Bride and Elle share an awesome fight scene, with a very surprising and perfect ending.So anyway, that fight scene is the only real action we get in this film. And one might say that that's not what we wanted, considering everyone loved Kill Bill Vol. 1 for it's over the top violence and action. This film is more story driven than the first Volume, and it's definetly great. Altough some scenes tend to get a little bit to slow. Quentin could have cut some scenes down by a minute or so, to keep the audiences interested, instead of starting to lean back in their seats, waiting for something to happen.The soundtrack, like all Quentin's films, is superb. The acting is great. The dialogue may not be as good as his other films, but it holds up (most of the time). It has a good ending (altough there's not a big fight involved, if that's what you want). Pretty much, this film has what we wanted from Kill Bill vol. 2. It's an excellent, but not flawless, continuation of Volume 1.You should definetly go see this. Especially if you enjoyed the first volume.9/10",6,0,1,1 May 2004
Minority Report," Its a good sci-fi flick
","Since I love sci-fi, I knew from the start that I would like this one. And yes, it was sci-fi. The vision of the future is very interesting and the whole Pre-crime thing sounds ok, I guess... If humans are ever able to predict the future.As I watched the movie I noticed alot of references to other sci-fi flicks. Johnny Mnemonic, for example. The way the Pre-Crimes were using their hands to move and focus on information on their screens made me think of Keanu Reeves surfing the internet in the year 2021, waving his hand around. Then there was Timecop. Only in that movie, the police went back in time. And not really too stop murders from happening. Then I was reminded of Strange Days when Tom Cruise visited his hacker-friend in that Virtual Reality place. Very similiar to the devices used in Strange Days. I liked all of these movies (even if I can admit that Johnny Mnemonic is bad, and so is Timecop.), and I did like this movie.Its about a futuristic police agency called Pre-Crime, where they use strange human beings to predict the future. The Pre-Crimes can see when a murder is about to take place, then they go there and stop the murder from happening! That's something I'd like to see in the future. Anyway, the leader of this agency (John Anderton) is seen killing a person on their 'future-vision' screen, and finds himself chased by his own partners and friends. He knows he is innocent... will be innocent... ach! You get the idea, and tries to prove it. To do so he must get a number of diffrent pieces of the puzzle together, and the one responsible for the mess ends up being who John least thought it would be.As I said, very interesting movie. But its a bit slow. Not something I would really want to watch again, in awhile. Nice future, nice story, nice characters, nice actors, nice directing. But its slow. And that's really the worst thing a movie can be. But in the end, its a good movie. Something you should keep your eyes open for. And if you like it, buy it. But I recommend renting it first.I give it a 6/10. Good in almost every aspect, but its slow.",6,0,0,19 March 2003
Blade," Norrington is a genius
","You'll not find a better pop corn flick, no matter how hard you try. Blade is an excellent film from the Kung Fu inspired fight scenes to the acting of Wesley Snipes.Blade is a Daywalker, a human with some vampire powers. He has their strength and their regeneration power, but also their thirst. He hunts vampires for a living and that's pretty much the plot. In this film, he goes up against the villainous Deacon Frost who wants to put an end to mankind once and for all and rule over them. Even though Stephen Dorff won't strike you as the coolest villain ever, he is still way more memorable than anything the other Blade films will offer.Kris Kristofferson plays Blade's mentor Whistler who is an aging vampire hunter himself. Even though Kristofferson is just an old country singer, he's definitely ideal for his role. Some of his lines are just golden.Stephen Norrington definitely cooked together one of the best action films I've ever seen. Now it's not something that will etch itself onto your mind and stay there forever but as far as dumb action films go this is great. The action scenes are obviously inspired by kung fu films where western slug fights are matched with eastern camera controls. Not an abuse of quick cuts that Hollywood films usually prefer and instead we get a full view of the fight which is very effective.Other than that, Blade is in this film much different than in the lackluster sequels. Here he is an animal, his hatred for vampires is obvious and he'll do anything and kick anyones ass to get them. Again, this was not present in the sequels where Blade is instead a show off. He spins his sword in nine different cool ways before finally cutting and nobody knows why. That's why you should see this film, and avoid the sequels at all costs. Norrington is one of the best action directors out there, and it's to bad he hasn't done more films.Rent or buy this film. But at least see it. It's an excellent pop corn action flick. As good as you'll find, actually.8/10",8,0,2,22 April 2006
The Mummy," Good action movie
","This movie is a remake of the old classic 'The Mummy' movie. But of course, they changed alot of things around. Which is good. Why bother with making a remake if you're just going to make it exactly like the old one? If you're gonna do a remake, why not do it with some style? And this is what this movie accomplishes. Instead of a horror movie, we are given an action/adventure movie, with much fitting comedic elements. But there are some creepy moments in the film, and I have to say I would be interested in seeing a horror movie based on this story. But for now, this will do.Brendan Fraser plays Rock O'Connell; a mercenary hired by some unknown group. After he gets chased away from the city of the dead, hamunaptra, by ghosts he is sent to jail when he arrives in Cairo, for trying to have 'a good time'. Enter: Jonathan (Brilliantly played by John Hannah) who just happens to steal a nifty little gadget from Rick's pocket while visiting the Cairo jail. He shows it to his sister, Evelyn, and she recognizes it to be of some importance. They manage to get Rick out of jail, and in return he has to lead them to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead.On their way to Hamunaptra they stumble upon another adventure and treasure seeking party, which is most unfortunate, because it is this reckless group that eventually let loose the title character: The Mummy. The Mummy's, or Imhotep's (that's his real name), mission is to destroy all living beings on earth, starting with those who let him loose. Now it's up to Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan to stop him before he can accomplish his goal.The story is good enough to keep the movie going, and it's not in the least confusing which means we'll get a semi-braindead action film without any hassle of lack of story or to much action. The movie is a perfect mix between plot and action sequences, and this is great thanks to the director Stephen Sommers. This movie is definetly worth a rent, or even a buy if you take a shine to it. And if you liked this movie, I also recommend the sequel: The Mummy Returns, which continues in the same style as this movie.8/10 - Perfect mix of storyline and action gives us a really, really good action/adventure movie with some really funny scenes thrown in here and there.",8,2,2,9 February 2004
Blade II," It just sucks
","This sequel takes out everything that was good about the first film and adds in stuff that doesn't work at all. The marvelous action scenes are replaced by traditional Hollywood fights where you have no clue of what's going on and several times the director feels the need to use unrealistic CGI just to replace his actors. You can easily tell the difference between actors and the CGI versions of them, especially in this film. Trust me. Especially dumb is the scene in the beginning where Blade fights against another vampire, and it is shown from the side as if it was some kind of Mortal Kombat video game. You'll have to look hard for a dumber action scene, actually.The Blade series is here turned into something much less mature and adult and into something that is even more dumbed down than the original (which was no Casablanca, but still good). Action at exactly every corner, lots of shooting and fighting and screaming. But no character. You don't really care for anyone in this film, not even Blade. Why is that? Because Blade is no longer the animal he was in the first film, he's much more refined here. He takes time to meditate, he actually lets a wounded vampire go and he does a lot of unnecessary sword moves for no other purpose than to get the audience to watch Wesley Snipes make his moves. In several scenes, Blade flashes his sword around despite being completely alone. Instead of cutting of a tube, he raises his sword and slashes in the air for five seconds before actually turning to cut the tube off. Why? It just looks dumb. Let's not forget the dumbed down rap music and hip characters they threw in. Compare the young and cool Scud to the old and weathered Whistler. Whistler kicks ass, whereas Scuds constant hip remarks are just annoying. Why didn't he die in scene one?The visuals are very colorful. The colors are: Red and blue. That's it, you won't find any other colors here. It gets very tiresome after awhile, and the visuals are further damaged by the constant use of CGI even when it's not necessary! A lot of times CGI blood is added, or cgi characters. It just looks bad. Period.Also, vampire lore is changed. The vampires no longer put up a fight at all, instead they die just by a single gunshot wound. In the original, Blade actually had some trouble beating a few vampires and was taken down by a few of them in some scenes! Here, they go down dime-a-dozen and one wonders why we have to go through two hours of Blade just kicking immense ass in action scenes that are rehashed over and over and over again. Let's not forget the obvious plot holes and character mistakes. In one scene Whistler, an old vampire hunter, knocks out a vampire villain, grabs a sword and then... Takes off? Why the hell didn't he just turn that sword on the already knocked out vampire and save Blade some trouble? What kind of vampire hunter does NOT kill an evil vampire when he has him under his blade? Stuff like this is abundant all the way through, and makes you sit uneasy in your seat.Also, the villain is nowhere near as characteristic or colorful as Deacon Frost in the original. It's just a bald headed, pale super vampire who can take out anyone except for Blade. We don't give a crap about the stupid sub plot they threw in about him, or any of the other stupid subplots.Gah, it hurts my head just thinking about this mess. Avoid.",4,6,10,22 April 2006
Resident Evil," Is this some kind of joke?
","SPOILERS How could they even release this product into the cinemas? What a waste of time and space! This junk has got to be the worst thing ever made since Death Race 2000, only Death Race 2000 is fun to watch because of its crappiness, this movie is not fun to watch because it is just so horribly, horribly bad!Ok, in the beginning they show a scene where some people get trapped in an elevator and a virus is released in an underground research facility. So far so could, this could lead to some pop corn action. Then we jump to a scene in a house out of nowhere where a naked lady lies in a bathtub. She gets up, gets dressed and walks around this empty house without saying a word for a few minutes. Hmm... interesting. Suddenly a cop comes along and yells get down before... hey.. a cop? out in the middle of nowhere? With absolutely no signs of danger at all? Oh well, anyway just after he and the chick 'get down' a bunch of swat-like guys jump in through the window. Why the heck did they do that whe  they could have just walked through the door and taken the unarmed girl without a problem?Apparently there is some sort of underground train beneath the house that the swat dudes need entrance too, and they take the girl and cop with them... apparently the girl works for them, but she doesn't know it. or something...On the train they find yet another dizzy character. Apparently he works for them too. And he is the chicks boyfriend... and he doesn't remember anything... or something...They step off at the research center and after a very long and boring house scene which makes absolutly no sense you finally get the feeling that something is about to happen. Well yeah, about half of the dudes die to a laser. Ok, cool... Then they have to disarm some kind of mainframe, because they got a feeling she is crazy. But in doing so, they release the virus into all halls of the research facility. Nice going guys! You just released a virus that turns all dead bodies into zombies! Better get out of there quick!! (or just restart the mainframe).However they find out to late, and zome (get it? zome?) zombie action occurs. Bite, screams, blood, gore. Probably the most entertaining scene in the movie, altough it isn't entertaining at all.Finally they decide to restart the mainframe in order to escape, and the mainframe leads them through some tunnels and airshafts through some really stupid and funny (unintentionally) scenes. Sometimes I thought it was supposed to be funny, because of the really, really excessive music and then suddenly... silence... Well, its wierd, and bad. And it goes on and on after that... you have to see it to understand how incredibly crappy it is. But instead spend your time on something else.For a very bad script, some very bad editing and directing, some very bad characters and acting (most of them anyway) and some zombie action I sum it all up to a 2... It almost deserves it.",2,0,1,6 January 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Thrilling! (Minor spoilers)
","Holy crap, I did not know what I was in for when I popped this film into my DVD player. It's amazing! At first I thought it was going to be some ordinary thriller with Ashton Kutcher (even tho he usually does comedy), but boy, was I proved wrong.The story is about Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) who throughout his childhood experiences a number of memory blackouts. We get to follow him and his friends throughout various incidents. His mother encourages him to keep a diary, in order to help him remember what he's done. When Evan finally grows up he is studying the human psyche at College, but still hasn't figured out what gave him blackouts as a kid, or what happened during them. But when he one night picks up his old diary and starts to read through them, he finds that he can almost remember what happened.. Or can he?He contacts his old friends from his childhood, in order to sort things out and help him remember, but it appears that they all lead poor lives, and are unwilling to help him. Evan tries to find a way to help his friends and goes back to his diary. During one of these readings, he finds that he can actually go back to the time of his blackouts, and change the course of history. Every time he wakes up, his life is different, and also better than it was before. Or is it?The film is so absolutely stunning and thrilling. As I sat through it I was constantly surprised and eager to know what would happen next. It turns out Ashton Kutcher can actually play in a drama, and he made me really like his character, Evan. All of the other actors in this film (Amy Smart, among others) do their job well. Which is good, because the center of this film is the characters. How they develop, how they change, how they act etc. etc. Very good stuff.The way the story is built up is almost the best about this film, however. Different spins on things etc. etc. It really makes the flick. Along with that, the directors really outdid themselves, and they are aided with an excellent score. I also have to mention the surprise ending, which will leave you stunned for hours. This is really a film that makes you think.9/10. You MUST see this film!",5,0,2,17 October 2004
The Princess Bride," Very good.
","A long time ago I saw part of this film. Well, it was very little, actually, the only part I saw was where Inigo fought the count at the end and kept repeating that phrase. At the time, I thought it was a serious movie, and thus I simply rolled my eyes and switched the channel. It looked awfully cheesy. Hmm. Well, it just so happens that the film was aired on television, again, today and I decided to watch it. But by the time I started to watch it, I still wasn't sure wether or not it was a serious movie. But I had heard some good things about it, so, why not? Here's the plot:A young girl and a stable boy fall in love. But since they are poor, they must seek treasures so that they can marry each other. The boy, whose name is Westley, sets out on a quest to find riches. But when he doesn't return, and the girl (Buttercup) recieves the word that his ship has been attacked by pirates, she thinks he is dead. Six years later, the King decides that he wants Buttercup as his bride, and there is nothing she can do about it but simply must cope with it, even though she still dreams of Westley.So one day when she is out on a ride, she is kidnapped by a pair of criminals, who intend to kill her, in order to spark off a war between two nations. However, they are followed by a masked man, dressed in black, who appears to be an excellent fighter...The film starts off good, and keeps that path throughout the entire film. It's funny, witty, smart, adventerous, action packed and dramatic all at the same time. Rob Reiner has cooked together the perfect recipe for a fantasy/comedy film. Anyone who enjoys a good laugh should really watch this. It's guaranteed to put you in a good mood. The script is also good, as well as the production design which gives us several believable locations. The score is also very good, and always fits the scene it's in. Very good, and gives an additional level to the film, wether it be humerous or dramatic.Cary Elwes plays the perfect Westley. It's like he was born for this part. The other actors are quite good for their parts as well, but I had some problems with André the Giant. I mean, mostly when he talks, you can't even make out what he's saying. In some scenes, it's very annoying. I do want to give some credit to Billy Crystal as well, who is quite funny in the role of Miracle Max, but his appearance is brief.All in all, a very good film. You should see it. Most likely, you'll laugh a couple of times and enjoy the good swordfighting and adventure scenes in this film... Otherwise, Go back to your 3 hour long snore-fest; Lord of the Rings!8/10",9,0,0,28 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Original and Entertaining
","Quentin Tarantino has the ability to write scripts which end up being highly original, despite hundreds of homages to other movies/directors. Kill Bill follows that exact formula. Original, yet it contains so many homages you could probably not count them all.The plotline is: Once upon a time there was a girl called 'Black Mamba'. She was part of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. However, she wanted out and tried to settle down and get her own family. That's when the founder of the DVAS attacked, with the rest of it's members, killing everyone at Black Mamba's wedding. Including Black Mamba (From now on referred to as 'The Bride').Unfortunetly for the DVAS, The Bride did not die. She survived. However, she did end up in a coma for four years. But when she finally wakes up, she goes on a killing spree, killing everyone who stands in her way for revenge. Her first targets are Venitra Green and O-Ren Ishii. Both former members of the DVAS.This film is violent, there's no doubt about it. In the climax battle blood is sprayed everywhere. Altough you cannot take this violence seriously. Just one short sequence of the fight. Three members of the evil guys team yell franaticly, wave their swords in the air and run down the stairs just to be instantly killed by The Bride in a second or so. All of this, including the violence, looks incredibly corny (intentionally) and funny. It's almost sick how perfect this movie's mood is. One could say that this is definetly one of the best movies ever, just because of scenes like that.The acting in this film is good, even though no real room is given for the characters to really go all-out. The directing and editing are top-notch, among the best I've seen. The writing is also good, as the movie jumps from past to present in a series of flashbacks or montages. The soundtrack is very fitting, and Quentin has thrown in several songs that are so good that they make you REALLY want to own the soundtrack. Something I noticed in this film more than any other is that the music and sound editing here is also perfect. Usually something like that goes mostly unnoticed, but here it's obviously well done, and adds to the twisted and wierd feeling of the movie.There's not awhole lot more to say about this movie. One has to see it for themselves. So I urge you to do so.10/10",10,0,2,1 May 2004
The Last Samurai," I liked it.
","Not really knowing what to expect, I popped this film into my DVD player earlier tonight. I sat down and watched the film quietly during the next two and a half hours, and I was pleasantly surprised. I actually didn't make the 'Dances with Wolves' connection until I came to these message boards. But so what, if the plot of this film is somewhat similar to that off 'Dances with Wolves', we can live with that, can't we? This one is differently pulled off and there are many elements in this film that weren't present in Kevin Kostners epic, such as the battle scenes and sword fighting. As well as the many conversations about honor and belief between the characters.The film starts out with a former military hero Nathan Algren being offered a new job in the Empire of Japan. He is to train the Japanese army, so that they can successfully face off, and fight back against, the rebellious Samurai. The Samurai are against the treaty that the Japanese are about to make with the Americans, since it would ruin their great history. But Nathan is just there to train.However, when Nathan is pitched in a battle against the Samurai, and his Japanese army of poorly trained soldiers are defeated, he is taken prisoner by the Samurai chieftain Katsumoto. Now, Nathan ends up spending a lot of time with the Samurai, learning their ways and how they fight.The movie is beautiful. Everything about it. The production design, to the costumes, to the photography. There is not one aspect of this film that the filmmakers missed out on. The plot is entertaining and entangling, even though some people might be disappointed by the lack of action scenes in the middle part of the film. The ending battle should definitely please the action fans, however, as it is one of the best I have ever seen on the screen. Truly great. Unlike some recent war films, however, this film is not afraid to show how horrible battle really is. That is, the blood has not been cut out of the film...Tom Cruise holds up his character well, and you can tell that the script has really succeeded when in the end you just want Tom Cruise to stand up and chop the head off the greedy businessman. Bravo, bravo. Ken Watanabe also deserves to be mentioned, as his portrayal of the Samurai chieftain Katsumoto is really good. He plays the role marvelously, and makes a believable Samurai. All in all, a very enjoyable film. You should see it, regardless what kind of films you like. You'll find a beautiful film with a great script, and some really good action too. Everything about this film is really good.9/10",7,1,2,29 July 2004
Mystic River," Good... But not that good.
","I had heard that this movie was really good, long before I saw it. When I rented it, I had some high expectations, but nothing that really defied how I would view it. I was more interesting at how it would turn out. I mean, there are some really good homocide/mystery movies (and TV series) out there. Would this be one of them? Well, there was only one way for me to find out. To rent it!Jimmy, Sean and Dave are three friends who are out playing one day. They're just having fun, when suddenly a man dressed a police officer shows up. They take Dave away, telling him they're gonna go talk to his parents. But what they don't know is that these men are child molesters... Dave eventually manages to escape, but the child molesters are never caught.Many years later, when they are all grown up and married and have gone their own separate way: Tragedy strikes. Jimmy's daughter is found dead in a park, and a homocide investigation starts off, with Sean in the lead. It turns out that on the same night that Jimmy's daughter was murdered, Dave did something bad... Noone knows what, except for Dave, but his wife saw him come home all covered with blood. So, something is definitely up.Clint Eastwood directs nicely, different angles, nice colors and everything. The whole thing is very nice set up. Production design, photography, script and so on and so on. The dialoge is convincing, and the actors all do their part well. It's always nice to see Sean Penn in a role, but to have Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins in there as well, is almost to much.I have two grudges with this film: Firstly, it's somewhat slow. At least the latter part of the film. The film ends at about 2 hours and 10 minutes, but it could easily have been 20 minutes shorter than that. My second grudge is when the killer is finally caught, it's not who you suspect it to be. But the reason for that, is because it's a very underdeveloped character who only popped up in two or three scenes prior to that, and there were absolutely no clues about it. It makes the investigation feel a bit 'anti-climactic'. But I'm willing to forgive that. You see, something else happens in the end, and I think this is what we're supposed to focus on. I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to see it for yourself. That is the real end to the film, and not the solve of the crime.All in all, it's a pretty good film, that drags on after awhile. I think that being slow is the worst crime a movie can commit, but it's not that bad in this film. You might not want to watch it more than once tho, so I'd say this is mostly a 'rent' film and not a 'buy' film.7/10",7,0,0,28 July 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Very good movie
","I just rented this movie not to long ago, and at first I didn't really think it'd be that good. But the first few minutes really gripped me enough to sit through the rest of the movie, which was fantastic. It is about a math-genious (excellently played by Russel Crowe) who starts going to some school, can't remember which, where he faces many diffrent kind of persons. Some like him, some don't. His life goes on and soon he is a teacher and falls in love with one of his students and they get married. But soon after that the problems start to occur. John Nash (the math-genius, the main character) has been working for the goverment for some time and has been performing top secret operations. But soon after his marriage he starts to realize that everything has just been something he made up. His schizofrenia has caused him to see images. Or were they really images?From there John Nash goes on with his life after some time spent in a psychatric hospital and the story takes one twist after another. Very, very interesting movie. I have also learned that it is based on a true story (well, not entirely), which is very interesting.The look, the sound and just about everything else in this movie are just superb, and the story is brilliant. Ed Harris and Paul Bettany also contribu te with some of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in a film. A must see for everyone, I'm giving this movie a 10. It deserves it well!",10,0,1,6 January 2003
Carrie," I was disappointed
","The legendary Carrie, which everyone has seen and everyone loves. Man, when I read in the newspaper that it was going to be aired, I just had to see it. When I sat infront of the television, I was somewhat confused by the opening shower shot. Naked girls? It felt like a pretty unnecesary shot, but perhaps someway, in Brian De Palmas mind, it was necessary...The plot is: Carrie White is a girl who goes to Bates Highschool. She's an outsider who has no friends of any kind. The only relation she has is to the gym teacher, who's always nice to Carrie, trying to help her. And then there's her mother, who is an overly religious fanatic who, perhaps, should seriously consider turning to another religion before she dies from praying to much. Carrie has one strange ability, however... She can move things with her mind. Toss objects, unlock doors and open them with a mere thought.
Suddenly, her world is turned upside down as a boy in school asks her to the prom. At first she thinks that it's just another trick, so that the popular kids can get her to the prom and them laugh at her. But as time goes on, she's not so sure anymore... And it also seems that her mind gets more and more powerful.I didn't really like this movie. First, it took off to fast. 50 minutes into the film, Carrie was already on her way to the prom, and we all knew that that was going to be the climax right there. At the prom, we got some character development, but nothing really more. It just drags on, until the splitscreen finale (which I'm not going to spoil) starts. This so called 'legendary' scene, was not quite so good as I had imagined it. It was kind of tame, actually. But for 1976, I can forgive it.The actors do a pretty decent job at their work, but none of them stand out, except perhaps Piper Laurie, who portrays the mother. I really wanted that person to die from the first scene I saw here, and that means Piper did a good job with her. Sissy Spacek plays Carrie, but I really didn't care for her. Nor any other actors. Even John Travolta, who has a supporting role, doesn't really stand out, but everybody's gotta start somewhere, right?
Nothing else is really remarkable about this film, except that De Palma's loooong scenes, makes sure that 100 minutes seem to fly by, somehow. It feels like we are given less, and that it takes to quick for the film to establish Carrie's character, and then plunge her into the prom... Well. I didn't like it at least. But I will give it some credit, for keeping some cool questions unanswered until the end. You'll see. They are pretty much unrelevant to the story, yet interesting.5/10",6,0,2,28 July 2004
Windtalkers," Possibly the worst war movie ever...
","-Some spoilers- There's a rule in Hollywood that states, 'If you're making a war-movie, you better make it damn patriotic'. With patriotic, ridiculous often follows. This film presents it's patriotism in FORM of ridiculous scenes. For example, there's a scene where IL' Nicholas Cage gets blasted and falls to the ground, wounded. Quickly, a group of Japanese soldiers start running towards him, but Nick managed to kill them all in one second... Using one gun... Without even aiming. The scene made me laugh out loud, and could be classified as one of the funniest moments in film-history, ever, but unfortunately this gem is overlooked.Throw everything you know about films out the window. This film doesn't have a plot, or any deep character. It doesn't have any realism, which is customary for war films, nor does it have any good acting. So what does it have? Lots and lots of action. More action than you can imagine, actually. The film only has one purpose, to show off how the brave marines kill as many enemy soldiers as possible. Explosions, gunfire etc. etc.Ed Wood could not have done a worse job than John Woo did when he put this film together. It's simply that bad. Gather your friends, bust open a few cans of beers and enjoy the 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' of the 21st century!",1,41,70,7 July 2005
Gladiator," Ridley Scott knows how to keep the audience interested.
","I've always liked Ridley Scott. I like Alien and Blade Runner, and all of his other films (except for perhaps Black Hawk Down). And I'd have to say this is one of his better films. Simply because every aspect of the film comes together and creates a beautiful, interesting and thoughtful story of a roman general. Plus we get some awesome battle scenes.Maximus is a General in the Roman Army, in the year 180 A.D. He is leading the Roman armies to fight against the barbarian tribes of Germania. After all of Germania is conquered, Maximus looks forward to finally being able to go back home and seeing his wife and son again. But the Emperor has other duties for him. But before Maximus is able to perform those duties, the Emperor is killed and Maximus sentenced to death, by the Emperors own son: Commodus.Maximus manages to escape the clutches of Commodus but finds that Commodus also ordered the death of his family. Maximus is however captured and sold off as a gladiator, and finds himself in a situation where he must fight to survive. But his real goal is to get revenge on the man who killed his family: Commodus.The film is visually stunning. The battle scenes are awesome. The acting is superb. The script is excellent. Everything about this film is top-notch, but what can you expect from Ridley Scott? He directs the film like he knows exactly what he wants and the end result is something you'll want to watch over and over again. Russel Crowe is absolutely fabulous in the role as Maximus. He outdoes himself completely. You really care for his character, and in the end I always find that a tear rolls down my eye whenever the end credits roll across the scene. Oliver Reed (R.I.P) also gives us a great performance as the aged gladiator; Proximo. To bad he died before principal photography had ended, and had to be replaced by a CG Puppet in some scenes (altough I never noticed this while watching the film). Juaqin Phoenix also gives a stellar performance as the insidious and evil Emperor Commodus.The battle scenes are all great. My favorite is the battle between the Roman army and the Germanian tribes, which gives us some good IL' dirty warfare shots of people getting mutilated: The dark ages way. Other great scenes are when the gladiators are forced to play the part of the Barbarian horde in the re-enactment of the battle of Carthage. Hans Zimmers music in these scenes may very well be some of the best aggressive movie scores I've ever heard.All of this, combined with Ridley Scotts excellent visual style and superb directing, makes for a flawless film that should never be forgotten.10/10",9,0,1,18 August 2004
V for Vendetta," It's good, but it's not great.
","I love sci-fi films. And I also love films that depict a utopian fantasy society, or dystopian rundown waterhole. I lump these into two different categories. Utopian society films are usually films where everything seems to be great, but when in actuality there is something very wrong. The public enjoys great health and luxury, but behind the facade the public is being oppressed. Examples like Equilibrium, Rollerball and Brazil come to mind.Dystopian films usually depict a society where everything is just outright wrong, but freedom still exists. The world is, pretty much, a crap hole in either a very literal sense or for the people who live there. The world makes no attempt to cover up the fact that it is a crap hole, and the people don't really seem to mind either. Here we have Blade Runner and Gattaca.The V for Vendetta film falls into the former category, but I wonder if you wouldn't put the comic book in the later category? In the film everything is to black and white. The good guys is too much of a good guy, the bad guy is an over-the-top bad guy and clichés are numerous.If you just watch the film without prior knowledge about the comic book, you won't really care. But if you've read the comic book and know what it could have been, you'll realize that there could have been so much more to this film and a lot of it's faults are exposed. Stylistically this film is very good, but plot wise it's... not so good.We've seen all of this before. A revolutionary fighting to bring down the corrupt oppressive society, where a dictator rules supreme. The twist is that this revolutionary is using modern day terrorist tactics, involving murder and bombings to further his cause. But since the film depicts him as very much of a good guy, his motives are never really questioned by the audience, like they SHOULD be. He's a good guy fighting for justice and revenge, what's not to like? Well, the problem is that we've seen this before. To many times, perhaps. The mere fact that he's using drastic measures isn't enough to make us dislike him.And the bad guy? Well, compared to him, our good guy revolutionary looks like Jesus himself. This makes the film a bit dull, because we can all pretty much pinpoint exactly how the plot is going to develop from scene 1 and in the end we're right.Now, the film is very well made. It's very stylistic and builds up quite nicely. If you like these kind of films, you'll like this one. The acting is great, the visuals fantastic and the atmosphere likewise. But the plot is lacking, and there's nothing really unique about this film.So I suggest you watch this film if you're interested in this theme. But don't fool yourself, there are a lot of films out there on the same subject that are better. Including all of those I mentioned in the first two paragraphs.6/10",8,3,6,10 September 2006
