Your Name.," 10 out of 10!!
","This is my first time writing a movie review, and that proves how great this anime is! The story is original, brilliant, and leaves rooms for the audience to have a deeper thought of what they have just seen. The theme songs, background music are just perfect. Great drawings, attention to details.Please try to stick to the Japanese version (I have heard that they are matching it with an English soundtrack), and avoid any spoiler, even the brief introduction of the movie, it's the best way to learn the whole thing.I haven't seen a movie that great in years, strongly recommended. Just hope that the same thing will happen to me! Please help me god!!",10,2,4,19 November 2016
