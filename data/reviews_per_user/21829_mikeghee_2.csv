Vertigo," Obsessive and Compulsive !
","Ingenious Hitchcock plot involving a San Francisco detective (Jimmy Stewart) who is hired to trail a man's wife (Kim Novak).A work of art that has to be interpreted.  Mine, without giving any details away, is that Stewart is fighting one obsession while relaxing into another. Things get sticky when the two obsessions get intertwined.  The story I thought was so good, it was always making me think.  For example,  at one moment I'm thinking one scenario is impossible but then realize it is possible given the circumstances the characters find themselves in.The first hour kind of drags. A basic set up of characters.   However in the middle of the movie, that is when the plot thickens, then its just fun all the way to the finish wondering what is going to happen.You have to really focus in on this film to know what is going on and appreciate its plot.  If you leave to go to the bathroom or get a snack while it is still playing at a crucial moment, you may find yourself lost for the rest of the movie.Virtually flawless filmaking.Look for the famous Hitchcock cameo in the beginning.",Null,2,4,17 February 2004
Monster," Surprisingly Good but Theron is Too Attractive.
","Lurid but extremely interesting story about a man hating street hooker with lesbian tendencies who befriends a young woman and falls in love with her. The hooker also has a tendency toward murdering her 'johns' and you will see why early on in the film.This movie is supposed to be about a real life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wournos portrayed by Charize Theron.  I think it succeeds in being a very gripping drama and providing a psychological profile of this woman. I was not disinterested at anypoint in the film.The film's only flaw in my opinion is that despite the fact Ms. Theron won an Oscar for this film, she is so attractive in real life, the make up she used in the film to make her 'ugly' did not succeed all the way.A disturbing and compelling film.  Leave the kids at home.  I give it an A.",Null,1,1,15 March 2004
