The Incredible Hulk," Unbelievable waste of money and time
","Some people say, that the first try of a new Hulk Version from 2003 was too much intellectual driven, which gave the film a too complex story and emotional background to believe in and not enough room for action.In fact this new Version of the Hulk theme could not even keep up with the first one in any possible discipline. It lacks nearly anything, except a slightly better CGI. The cast was really promising, but the whole story is totally empty and lacks of any surprises at all. The whole intention of a movie with a believable plot supported by actors and good directing is simply not used in this one.You can easily skip the middle 70 minutes of the film, because everything is so obvious to happen. Compared to the storyline of the first one this new version lacks of any depth and drama. It's like being told a story with a 10 point plan what is going to happen now and then and finally the good spirit wins.So, what is good in this new version? Nothing at all. There is even no real humor noticeable, no emotional ups and lows, and we will never know why Tim Roth did all this silly stuff. I did not like the first one too much at the time i saw it, but in comparison to this new one it's a quite good movie after all.I don't know where the good screenwriters are gone in Hollywood. For this new Hulk there was definitely none involved.",1,38,76,17 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Too much from everything results in 'nothing to remember'
","Well, just how it is with all monster trilogy/sequels 'Pirates...' has to be even more bigger and spectacular as the first two ones. And it is, the movie is far more than two hours long, there are more characters, more tricks and more plot lines.Everything starts really cool and after the first 30 minutes without Johnny Depp we feel still fine with what's happening. And then, Sparrow arrives, does weird one-liners, jokes, moves and everything, and we still feel fine, because we liked the first movie - in a way. After about 50 minutes we still believe there has to be a believable story behind all this, and after about 80 minutes we were confronted with even more mysterious plot lines and desperately hope that everything fits together in the end...But, this does not happen. Instead we are confronted with lots of 'this is my ship, get your own crew, get off my ship, let's enter the other ship, and where is the plot anyway?'. The result is really boring after half of the film and continues 'til the end, which is even more disappointing. In conclusion, there is nothing we can follow through the film, just the hope that a final showdown will solve all our problems. But if even this showdown fails, the whole film remains in our minds as just an bombastic pirate movie-clip with nothing to remember at all.And Johnny Depp? Well, we plays his role just like before, which was basically great in contrast to the other characters and a quite simple plot. But this time - within all this chaos - his character somehow lacks any believable profile, so that he emerges into 'something weird'.Overall, this movie lacks too much of those basic things that makes a movie really watchable over and over again.",4,0,1,19 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A demonstration of bad writing, incompetent directing and awful movie making
","You can certainly enjoy this movie, nothing wrong about that. If you don't care about everything Star Wars was about, don't care about plot, character development, believeability and are not interested in how a good movie may work.The list of awful decisions they did with this movie is amazing. Tons of plot holes and a complete mislead humor on their own destroy any story. The main plot is stupid, i'd rather watch the original Battlestar Galactica, which had more tension than this 2 hours slowmotion space-chase. Commander Adama, please help!The poliltical agenda in this movie is just too obvious and awfully injected. This leads to the complete opposite of what Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy may wanted to include. George Lucas always included some politics in his movies, especially in the prequels, which are far from great, but in these this was done far better as in The Last Jedi.There are so many scenes, that are a complete waste as well as characters. There are 'surprises', which are just included for the sake of 'making things different'. The humor was out of place most of the time and felt like borrowed out of the Marvel Universe. In fact this is a streamlined mess. An obvious mix of Ep5 and Ep6 and left me empty and hollow, as the movie was itself.Here's the thing with the score. On general standards this movie needs to have at least three to four stars, the CGI was good, Mark Hamill was great and you have a 2.5 hour popcorn movie, which is not as boring as Transformers, at least. But due to the total insult this movie represents it only deserves one star if not zero.",1,3,4,26 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Excellent FX - Awful unbelievable storytelling
","after the first episode turned out to be a kids-movie and the seconds one a love story with a not noticeable plot, the third could have been the turning point of the whole beginning of the saga. the story, based on the many secrets the episodes 4-6 created, could have been epic and dramatic. and we all have expected this, regardless the disappointments of the first two episodes.and lucas tried, well he did, but he failed. The complete transformation of anakin into darth vader is just not told very well and believable. on the contrary, most of the good intentions of the movie are destroyed by awfully story telling. It's only the final fight, which does have this dramatic atmosphere, and some really great fx which are worth mentioning in this movie.maybe the problem was simply to put such an epic plot into just one movie and keep it up with enough action. the beginning of the film, in total about 25 to 30 minutes are a complete waste of story-telling-time, and only meant to show how a big space war should look like.I was hoping the dramatic transformation of anakin is told with real depth and with enough drama in it. making the jedi responsible for the death of his wife with all the consequences could have been a good way to go, but instead it's all based upon a pointless fear of loosing her with no real cause behind it all. So all the anger and fear came basically out of nowhere which makes the whole movie unbelievable.sorry george, we all know you have done your best, but you got lost in too much compromises and fx technologies.",3,4,6,2 August 2008
