The Ring," Terrifying
","'The Ring' is one scary movie.  I don't agree with some of the comments on here saying that it wasn't scary at all.  Obviously, if you didn't find this movie scary, then you didn't understand it.  It is a very complex movie, with many twists and turns in it, hidden signs, and subtle disturbing moments. Naomi Watts is wonderful, after seeing 'Mulholland Dr' i couldn't wait to see what she would do next and 'The Ring' definitly fulfilled my wait. All in all, this is a fantastic film, amazing direction, great performances and a very scary plot. *****(out of 5)",Null,0,0,18 October 2002
American Beauty," The Best Movie EVER!!!
","'American Beauty' will go down in history as one of the Classics, which is something this movie deserves.  This is the first movie that has taken real life home situations and blown them out of proportion, but still kept them real. The performances were very strong in this film, I especially liked Mean Suvari's performance,which didn't get a lot of attention.  I also thought that Thora Birch gave a great performance, but of course, Kevin Spacey, he is the man in this movie and just about every other movie he does. For the people who think that 'American Beauty' didn't deserve the Oscar, LOOK CLOSER, and realize that this is one strong and wonderful film.",10,0,0,11 July 2000
Mulholland Drive," Amazing!
","'Mulholland Dr' is one of the most amazing films i have ever seen in my entire life! David Lynch is an absolute genius! I will admit though, that this movie confused the hell out of me! i had to think about for days and days afterwards! but i think now i have some understanding of it! In 'Mulholland Dr' lynch creates a sort of dream like world, where people aren't what they seem. he does this with all his films and i will also admit that i still don't understand 'lost highway' to this day!Amazing, brilliant performance by Naomi Watts! i had no idea she played the two characters until the credits rolled up! i'm very disapointed that she was not nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars this year and the same goes for the film to be nominated for Best Picture. Everyone needs to see this film just to witness the amazing, stunning direction by David Lynch! *****/out of 5",Null,0,1,23 February 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," An excellent film
","'Girl, Interrupted' is one of my all time favourite films.  The acting is brilliant, direction great and the story is inspiring.  I wanted to write a small review on it now because not many people have commented on the great Brittany Murphy.  Yes, Angelina won the Oscar for this film and of course Ryder was great, but the greatest performance was by Murphy.  Murphy plays Daisy, a chicken obsessed, laxitive junkie who's father likes her a little bit too much.  Murphy brings such great depth and sympathy to her character, making the audience feel her pain.  I was disapointed that she wasn't in the film very much because she shined, but the scenes she is in are amazing. Murphy is one actress with great talent that will be around for years and years to come.",Null,3,4,26 November 2002
Am√©lie," Charming!
","'Amelie' is a charming, hearwarming film that I could honestly watch every single day for the rest of my life.  This film is funny, cute and makes you feel good at the end.  This is not your typical dumb love story, it's filled with other plot lines running through the film that all come together at the end of the film.  This is one of the best films I have ever seen, I can't say how much I loved it, because I loved it so much!  The direction is unreal, with many little quirks and speical affects that make the audience smile and laugh. All in all, the perfect film! *****/out of 5",10,0,2,18 August 2002
Donnie Darko," Brillant!
","'Donnie Darko' is one of the best movies I've ever seen, period! It's perfectly messed up, dramatic, funny at times, sad at times and scary at times.  The direction is great, the performances are wonderful, and the story is unreal.  I really recommend this movie to anyone who likes really screwed, messed up movies that actually have a plot! *****/out of 5",Null,0,0,24 May 2002
