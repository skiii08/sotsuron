Antz," I loved it! I loved it! *bounce*
","This charming graphic films about the life of ant(z), is not only hilarious, but fantastically well done.I suppose what enticed me most about the film, was its brilliantly subtle insights into life and the universe around us.Put this feature right on to the 'must see' list, and listen out for the voices of well known stars (incidentally, and i am sure not accidentally, the characters they voice bear remarkable resemblances to them hehehe)WATCH OUT DISNEY!  Hereeeeeeee comes dreamworks... ;)",Null,0,0,11 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is a love it or loathe it kind of film.
","Basic plot outline: Oooer erm... in a galaxy far far away um... two jedi knights set out to save the planet Naboo from the evil Trade Federation who tries to force it's young queen to sign their corrupt treaty.
Review: This is a love it or loathe it kind of film. Advent star wars fanatics will hail it as the greatest film of the century, whilst non-junkies will moan about the weak script and the annoying Jar Jar Binks. I personally enjoyed the film as it created an entire other universe. It's escapism in it's purest form, which is why we go to watch movies in the first place. Sure the script was slightly weak, however if it is seen in the context of the first film of nine, one can see it as a sturdy platform for the future episodes. The special effects were (dare i say) orgasmic, and we all know how much i adore Portman and McGregor. Overall, I think this is one you definitely have got to go see on The Big Screen.",Null,0,1,16 September 2000
Unbreakable," It's a good solid film, but not as brilliant as expected.
","The master of surprise - M Night Shyamalan - is at it again. No, its not as good as Sixth Sense, but is nonetheless a thoroughly enjoyable suspense thriller. Pretty much intruiging throughout the film, though I suspect that upon second viewing it might seem rather pointless. Shymalan casts himself yet again in a cameo role (at least this one can act slightly better than Tarantino). It's a good solid film, but not as brilliant as expected.",Null,0,0,11 March 2001
The Mummy," Something was sorely missing from this film.
","Basic plot outline: An ancient Egyptian curse is unleashed, awakening the Mummy, bringing destruction and terror to all.   It's left up to the treasure hunters and archeologists who awakened him to stop the Mummy, before he wreaks avengance on the world.Review: Something was sorely missing from this film.  The acting was damn bad, and it didn't flow very well at all. Sure the shots were quite nice, but the story wasn't mildly intelligent or intruiging.   Nothing much at all here.",Null,0,1,16 September 2000
Chicken Run," The film had an original concept and a 'blah' execution.
","Basic plot outline: A 'claymation' adventure from the creator of Wallace and Gromit, featuring chickens as the main characters. Ginger is the 'head chick', and she deviously plots to free all the chickens on the farm, preventing an otherwise certain 'Death By Chicken Pie'. After many failed attempts, she meets Rocky, the 'flying rooster', and decides that he holds the key to their freedom. Review: This film was very disappointing. The animation was superb, and the characters were quite cute and funny and stuff. But thats pretty much all there was to it. It wasn't as entertaining as it could have been. The film had an original concept and a 'blah' execution. WAAaaaaAAAy over rated.",Null,0,1,9 December 2000
X-Men," It rates up there with 'Tank Girl' as one of those 'really cool comic book to movie' films.
","Basic plot outline: In a sci-fi twist on humanity, we enter a world whereby people are born as mutants. This enables them to have supernatural powers and abilities, due to permutations in their genetic infrastructure. Two mutants, Wolverine (tortured by a forgotten past), and Rogue (a young girl with uncanny powers) stumble upon the world of Professor X. He runs a secret school whereby mutants can learn to use their powers, unplagued by the prejudices of an intimidated modern society. But trouble is a-brewing at the hands of the Professor's eX-colleague (excuse the pun hehehe), Magneto, as he bands together some evil mutants to prepare for the oncoming war between humanity and mutant. Based on the famous comic book series.Review:  To my surprise, (again!) I really enjoyed this film. It rates up there with 'Tank Girl' as one of those 'really cool comic book to movie' films. I am not a comic book 'X-Men' fan, but I believe that they were pretty much true to the basic storyline of the series. It's not in the league of Singer's 'The Usual Suspects' , or as dark and daunting as 'Apt Pupil' , but basically its a lot of action filled fun. Its got cute people, its got eye candy, its got brilliant effects, its got a coherent narrative. What more could you want?",Null,0,0,24 September 2000
Cast Away," ...yet ANOTHER film masterpiece...
","From the Filmgod who bought us classics such as the Back to the Future Series, and Forrest Gump, comes yet ANOTHER film masterpiece. Top this off with Hollywood Legend and Mr Nice Guy Tom Hanks in the starring role, as well as one of the best screenplays to hit the Big Screen in a long time. This movie is GREAT! Tom Hanks truly deserves his oscar nomination for Best Actor, and I DEFINITELY recommend it. It's subtle, its funny, and it's brilliantly pieced together.",Null,0,0,10 March 2001
American Psycho," It tastes brilliantly cold and clinical...
","Basic plot outline: A devious excursion through the eyes of 'Wall Street Geek By Day', 'Murderous Freak By Night' Patrick Bateman. From a black humour lined obsessive compulsive narrative, we slowly enter the mind of a madman.Review: To my utter surprise, I really enjoyed this film! I was feverently hoping that it would not turn out to be yet another pointless Slasher fliq, and I was not disappointed. It tastes brilliantly cold and clinical, and boasts an award-worthy performance by Christian Bale. He is totally captivating in this role. It's a psychological slasher film, at its best :). Definitely recommended.",Null,0,0,23 September 2000
Being John Malkovich," The most original concept...
","that I have seen in a film in a long time, and brilliantly executed. Diaz breaks away from her screen goddess image, and Cusack revives himself after the yukky ' High Fidelity . One of the year's best, a definite must see. : )",Null,0,1,10 March 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," In essence, it is an encapsulating love story.
","This gorgeous tale emits from a genre called 'Wuxia', which basically means that it is going to take a brain wrap for the common public to totally accept. Wuxia's basic premise is that the story takes place in medieval China, and is filled with fantasy, warriors, magic and mystery. Kind of like a huge Chinese Role Playing Game.The most outstanding feature in the film is the cinematography. It contains the most gorgeous shots that I have seen since Titanic. The Wired Fighting Scenes are brilliant as well, not what most Westerners are used to. We got a good taste of it in the Matrix, a pungent aftertaste in Charlie's Angels, yet now it returns in full flavour to this wonderfully choreographed piece.In essence, it is an encapsulating love story. It is not as linear as most commercial films these days, yet I feel that viewers will be too busy being swept away by the sheer beauty of the film, and the spectacular fight scenes, to get too caught up in 'who did whats and whys'. HIGHLY recommended. See the original (sub-titled) piece.",Null,0,0,11 March 2001
