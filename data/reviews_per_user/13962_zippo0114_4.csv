The Blair Witch Project," They call this a movie?
","Here's a little summary for all of you who think that the movie was 'intense! Frightening! Original!' This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I will admit, certain parts of the movie were scary, and certain parts were intense, but originality? I don't think so. Sure, the movie may have been original, but original doesn't always mean good. You can film something that's never been filmed and called a movie before, and it may be original, but that doesn't mean people will want to pay to see it.The basic thing that makes this film so worthless, is the fact that it's impossible to watch. There are long segments of complete darkness, where you hear whispering but can't even make out what the characters are saying. Who wants to see that? Plus the camera constantly shakes like there's no tomorrow. The images become blurry, repetitive, and boring after awhile. And pretty soon, it's the same old 'chills' that everyone talks about, repeating themselves countless times throughout the movie.Overall: Only see this if you do want to see something that has never been done before. You may think this movie is good, and like it, or it may be your favorite movie, but I can't be convinced of many good points on this movie. See it at the risk of wasting an hour and a half of your life that you can never get back.",Null,0,1,28 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," The best movie, let alone war film, ever made
","In my opinion, Saving Private Ryan is the best war film ever made. It is my personal favorite movie, and I will tell you why. Many people claim this movie is too graphic and violent, but the fact is that it is based on D-Day, an actual event taking place in World War 2. By seeing this movie, you get the experience of what combat in war is like, an experience you can't get from just reading a book. Many veterans and other people have stated that the battlefield scenes in this movie are 100% realistic, and the only thing missing is the smell of the dead bodies. I think Spielberg has done a wonderful job of making a good story out of history, with a great and original plot, believable characters, and realistic events. I suggest you see this movie as soon as possible, especially if you are into World War 2 movies like I am.",10,0,0,23 January 2000
The Longest Day," A D-Day Disappointment
","I was somewhat disapointed after seeing this war movie, but the reason behind that is probably because I saw Saving private Ryan before watching this. Saving Private Ryan leaves quite am impression on you, and other D-Day movies, including this one, have a hard time living up to Saving Private Ryan.A main reason that this movie is so weak is because of it's unrealistic portrayal of D-Day. The film tries to show D-Day as a group of brave American and British men, at peace with God, and ready to fight and die for their country, no matter what the cost, these men were ready to go into battle. This is made obviously clear as John Wayne runs out of his invasion boat courageously at the German bunkers onto the beaches of Normandy, his men following bravely behind him, not once hesitating to find a large obstacle to hide behind. When in fact, the young men who fought at Normandy were scared beyond reality. The invasion boats were covered in puke because the men were so frightened that they were throwing up. Men lost their values, beliefs, and standards for human life in D-Day and the rest of the war. This film tries to portray it as exciting, to make everyone get up, join the Army, and go kill the Nazi's, or whatever enemy America may be fighting now.Which brings up another point that this film is purely American propaganda, trying to support the Army. The reason that this film is so weak and unreal, is most likely due to the fact of the cencorship of the 60's time period. They weren't allowed to show the true brutality of war, and the fact is, they probably couldn't have captured it then anyway.While I did enjoy the film because it is about D-Day and is a good movie, especially for it's time, it makes war look like fun, which simply isn't true. However, I reccommend you see this movie anyway, because it is still quite interesting.",Null,1,5,28 January 2000
Halloween," The only true slasher film
","While other slasher movies have been named the original slasher and horror movies, such as Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I believe that Halloween is the only real slasher movie out there, and that a lot of other cheap movies have been modeled after it. Unlike other movies of this kind, Halloween makes a believeable storyline compared to other slasher movies, and a pretty much believeable killer, where he is not some invincible demon-like character that still doesn't die after 9 sequels. He is actually human and the acting in this movie is pretty good, not like other horror movies, where it sounds as if the actors are reading the script for the first time as they act it out. This movie is very original, entertaining, and one of the most important films to the horror genre. I highly recommend this movie to you, especially if you like this kind of movie.",Null,0,0,6 February 2000
