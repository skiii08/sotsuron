Howl's Moving Castle," Beautiful, amazing!
","I love this movie... I loved it so much I decided to write a paper in my rhetoric class for it :0) It is a marvel of beauty, speaking out for a great cause! (Protecting nature) The director's different style is perfect to catch this very wonderful book (that everyone should read) It is of course different from the book, but still great.It is magic, in more than one way - strong logic and linear storytelling is not to be expected, but, much like a dream, the story has it's own, inner logic.My favorite scene is in the beginning, walking on rooftops.It is a true marvel.",10,2,3,5 May 2006
