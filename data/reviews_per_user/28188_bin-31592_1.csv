Hereditary," Deeply disturbing, shockingly haunting.
","I watched Hereditary with the memory of Toni Collette's rÃ´le in Little Miss Sunshine, a mother trying to navigate her dysfunctional family, keeping everyone together against all odds, the best she could. And really, the stage in both movies are quite similar, on the surface.So I took the bait, commiserated with her grief, felt compassion for her character who, overwhelmed by sorrow, seemed bound for mental folly. And oh boy, I let myself dragged straight into ... HELL. The sick, wicked, black-hearted, vicious, corrupt,  HELL!!!!Seeing each character die, one by one, in the most cruel, most perverse way imaginable, dragging the next in his fall, really is a disturbing experience.If you don't feel empathy for the Grahams, you will waste 2 hours of life. Otherwise, you've been warned.9/10, because the last minute is tad disappointing. In fact, maybe we're lucky it's disappointing? At least, I could sleep. Sort of.Darkness whispers to our ears, through our weaknesses finds a path, and long before we know it, all escape routes are closed.",9,3,7,13 October 2019
