Hereditary," DO NOT (!) believe the hype ...
","As with all films, you could say that the 'last impression' it makes is even more important than the first impression it has made, meaning of course that the way any film ends, has an enormous impact on how the film makes an impact.Thus, the same goes for this piece here. While having watched the film halfway through, i thought about how thus-far, it could have been rated seven stars. It didn't find it that good, and certainly also not horribly bad, but because of the hype surrounding it, i was expecting a major upset from its ending. One that would leave everyone in awe, one that would be able to raise it's just slightly above averageness, to complete supremeness. Though the ending did upset, it did not in a good way.As people were leaving the cinema house, i heard voices of outrage and disbelieve Ã©verywhere around me. It really felt like being part of a flock of victims of a dumb, but gigantic cinematic hoax. As if some kind of sick deal between movie critics was made, to lure a mass of moviegoers into expecting the next poltergeist, but to be then only getting served an even less than average movie.Very offensive and disappointing, to say the least. Before i went to see this film, and based on the lauding reviews, i expected it to maybe get an eight or even nine star rating from me. When i came home, i gave this film a sober six stars IMDb rating, but would i have let my anger over the perceived hoax influence my rating, i would have given it only two stars, and as i'm typing this i'm wondering if i should maybe overdo the earlier rating of six stars with only two stars, as to try to communicate to future potential viewers to stay away from this movie, which they also might want to see because of reading raving reviews.Honestly, i can still imagine me giving this film a seven, or even eight stars rating, if the damned ending wouldn't have been such an anti-climax. Not that the idea of what is revealed in its ending is that pour. It feels more like the let-down is a result of lazy scriptwriting, but above all, some very pour cinematographic choices.",6,0,1,2 July 2018
