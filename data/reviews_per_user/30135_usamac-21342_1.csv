The Lobster," Goes from interesting to boring to mind numbing
","On the first 45 minutes or so very interesting. There were bits of humor where I laughed and the premise made me want to see what happened next. Once he got to the forest area, the pace really dropped off and the movie became fairly dull. I found myself watching my phone to pass the time as the movie pondered on. For the last 30 minutes or so I simply skipped ahead on Netflix because it was so completely mind-numbingly slow and there was so little that really happened. I just skipped to the relevant sections. This movie would have been much better as a 1 hour movie, but at 2 hours it's simply too long and too boring. It's what some people want to think of as a highbrow humor movie when really it's just a boring movie.",3,2,4,9 December 2018
