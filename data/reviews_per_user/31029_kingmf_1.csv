The Blair Witch Project," what's the big deal?
","Take Predator and The Evil Dead, and you've got Blair Witch. Bunch of people in the woods get ate by a thing they can't see. All year I kept hearing about how original The Blair Witch Project was and how clever. So I dropped the 7.50 and saw it. I laughed my ass off through the whole thing, just because they were lost in the woods and they went in the house. That geek from Scream(another highly overrated movie)  told em not to go in the house. Yep stock horror movie conventions are really original. It was however a miracle of marketing, not since the KISS Destroyer era has the world seen a complete crap sold so well. Ok no I take that back those Isuzus are selling quite well.",Null,0,1,31 December 1999
