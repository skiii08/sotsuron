Iron Man 3," A rotten mess *Spoilers*
","Rarely have I seen such a grotesque and hideous film as Iron Man 3. The Avengers set a high bar for the Marvel franchise, it was an outstanding success became the third highest grossing film in cinema history. I am aware that the Marvel films are not to be taken seriously, these are supposed to be fun guy flicks with lots of action and witty one liners. That does not mean however, that every female character is either barely clad, about to have sex, or just had sex. The objectification of woman in this film is extraordinary. What's more they have no brains. Those that have lines are all damsels in distress. Second, the violence. One gets the feeling that Director and screenwriter Shane Black wanted to bring the franchise to the level of Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy. Shane therefore injects all sorts of violence towards innocent people, including a bombing in a city area, incredibly disrespectful due to the recent Boston incident. None of these events achieve the realism of Nolan's dark villains, and just makes the film quiet idiotic. A total let down and a stain on the Avengers franchise. Lastly the villains. According to the trailers and the first quarter of the film Sir Ben Kingsley was to portray the big baddie, the Mandarin. However he turns out to be a puppet for Guy Pierce's character. We are never told why Mr. Pierce's persona is killing all these people. However, would have been much better if it had been the other way round. The Mandarin a big bad guy and Peirce's character the lead henchman. But the ending is the final straw that broke the camels back. In order to declare his love for his wife/girlfriend, Pepper played by an uninteresting Gweneth Paltrow. Tony decides to destroy both his suits and Jarvis. How will he be able to appear in the second Avengers? The whole film seems to have been made by Michael Bay, and that's not a complement.",1,4,10,13 November 2013
