Skyfall," Better For Craigs Standard, But Still Lacking Bond-ness
","I went to see this film on opening night and had medium to a slightly expectation for this film after sparkling reviews from many critics. But having a dislike for Daniel Craig's James Bond he had a lot to prove in my eyes. To explain my position I loved Sean Connery in the role, disliked Roger Moore and was very satisfied with Pierce Brosnan's performance as the suave assassin. Daniel Craig on the other hand does not come across as a cold killer neither does he uphold the suave intelligent nature of a Brosnan or Connery. He is clumsy and spent most of the movie missing people when firing his gun. There are many features to Craig's appearance that suggest he should not have been given this part. He looks tired, old and gaunt, he is too stocky to play the elegance of Bond, he walks in a clumsy non killer fashion and his one liners are terrible (maybe the way they are written or more the way he delivers a line). Well this movie, Skyfall is without a doubt Craig's best outing as Bond, Mendes tried is utmost to recreate a Connery feel to this latest outing, the DB5, the (attempted) light hearted comedy, the old characters. But something was still missing and I think that's Craig himself, he isn't James Bond, he will NEVER be James Bond in my opinion he is a terrible choice and he is dragging a franchise of this quality in this day and age where it should never go. The Skyfall story was hollow and lacked what Bond villains always yearn for i.e. world domination. A personal vendetta is a totally new one on me!! This is NOT a Bourne film this is meant to be James Bond he is meant to be the world's top assassin, license to kill, sleep with any women. Craig is portrayed as useless and unfortunately how much he tries he simply is useless in this part. Looking at the possibility of a further two outings for Craig with the Walther PPK could be detrimental to those who are die hard Bond fans, like myself. I don't want the Bond name to be poisoned as some blithering idiot, who is too useless to hit anything. This isn't Johnny English!!! But back to Skyfall, I liked the use of the music which was almost banished from his other two films (WHY?!?!? I have to say about that effort from the last two directors), the introduction of original characters (who I won't name for people who haven't seen the film) and I liked the change of M, into what looks to be a far better more dominant replacement bring back the days of Bernard Lee, which were the glory days of Bond. Was unsure on Q but he could grow on you, an older wiser Q may have been a better for the film, the story lost itself after the Railway/Court scene, no real gadgets at all...again. Skyfall is a completely different Bond movie than usual, but I'm not sure if it's for the better. Watching Daniel Craig makes me wonder why he is guaranteed 5 Bond films and Brosnan only received 4. He even now still looks younger than Craig does. This film is better, feels a bit more Bond like but it's still not really there. I just think Craig can't pull this one off and it's a shame because he is trying to get there. And one other thing this is NOT the 'best Bond film ever' whoever says these things hasn't obviously witnessed THE real James Bond (Sean Connery)... silly comments!!",6,5,20,27 October 2012
Alice in Wonderland," Disappointing to say the least
","I went to see this film knowing it was a different storyline to its predecessors but i never knew this storyline could be this boring. Johnny Depp again proved he can take on any part and prove to be the best actor about, but his co-stars were nothing short of weak. If you are going to change the storyline it must be bold and brash not undeniably dull and uninteresting. I also thought the 3D made no difference at all, really just a ploy to take your money. If i'm going to spend that extra money i want to see a noticeable difference in quality which was severely lacking from this showing. Definitely didn't have the impact Avatar had on me. Plus points was Depp who gave another good performance and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat put in a top quality performance and really warranted more time on screen. 4 stars to be honest is a very generous score.",4,3,8,10 March 2010
Avatar," A Triumph from Cameron
",A truly brilliant film making success that has set an entirely new level for films across the planet. The 3D experience was truly inspiring and has set a new benchmark for other film makers across the globe. Others have now changed their plans and tried to put their films into a 3D quality but it can never really match it. Stephen Lang should have won the Oscar for for best supporting actor and Zoe Saldana should have won best actress. The academy have really lost the plot this time. This is the Best Motion Picture not only this year but for the past decade. The Hurt Locker got the sympathy vote because it made next to nothing.,10,9,14,10 March 2010
Titanic," Epic, moving and Probably the greatest movie of all time...
","A true moving epic that quite literally moves you off your feet as you are swept into a class driven land of its own. Cameron will never better this film as it is the best he's ever made in my opinion. The acting is top notch, the script is even better and his use of colour, fades, and cuts make the movie a true work of art. The storyline cannot be questioned throughout as it is 100% true which is the true beauty of this utter work of art...I must have seen this film over 10 times and every time i watch it the music is outstanding and use to superb effect throughout the film. This tear dropping epic should be seen by all and admired by all of us. Cameron Avatar was amazing but this is better...",10,1,2,16 March 2010
