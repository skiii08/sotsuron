Requiem for a Dream," The worst movie of all-time!
","Looking through the top 250 movies of all time on this list I thought no matter what I would pick it would be good. WRONG! This movie started bad and just went down hill from there. A story about druggies has been done and overdone in movies like Boogie Nights, which is the second worst movie of all time. Maybe it's just me that doesn't like movies which make you nauseous and just leave you in an absolute awful mood after watching the movie. The only good thing that actually did come out of this movie is seeing the consequences of using drugs. So if you are considering getting into drugs, this is the movie for you. If I could go negative on my rating scale I would, but 1 is the lowest I can go.",5,4,12,3 September 2001
