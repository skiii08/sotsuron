Deja Vu," worst movie of the year
","'Deja vu' is the worst movie of the year. Denzel Washington, in that movie, looks like somebody whose asking himself ' what am I doing here', 'why did I accept to do this stupid movie'. You feel like the actors are making fun of you. The actors are so bad. They do not believe at all in what they're doing. The story is so unrealistic that you'll start laughing. I can't believe that an actor as good as Denzel Washington accepted to play in that kind of movie. I can even say that it's one of the worst movie of all time. DO NOT RENT THAT MOVIE AT ANY COST. I really hope that Denzel Washington will be more caution in the future when choosing a movie to play in.",1,6,12,24 April 2007
Spider-Man 3," 5/5 for F/X, 0/5 for story
","The special effects are incredible. You just wonder how far will the go in that matter. It's so good it seems real !!! But let's face it, the story is simply not good. The story would be good for a bad 'comic book', but for a movie you have to give much more than that to the viewers. Especially after a film like 'Batman begins' with Christian Bale. 'Batman begins' is the perfect example of a well balanced movie : a really good story well put together that holds you spellbound ; a good amount of special effects without overshadowing the story; an excellent group of actors (except for Katie Holmes). I thought that 'Batman begins' was the new standard, that any director, worthy of the name, had to give us a movie as good as 'Batman begins' or even better. But unfortunately it doesn't look like that. I only hope that Christopher Nolan, the director for 'Batman begins', will give 'director lessons' to all the others directors out there.",5,0,0,8 May 2007
