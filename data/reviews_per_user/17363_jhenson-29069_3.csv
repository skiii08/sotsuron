","If you've ever seen the original, and you have even the slightest modicum of respect for originality, story telling and artistic integrity, this movie should infuriate you. Firstly, it isn't really a movie. There is no story. It's basically just a 2 hour collection of different sorts of scares. The brilliance with the original was that it was a story of kids torn apart by a traumatic event, and then brought back together as adults to face their fears and avenge their friend. Great story. But this version was essentially a haunted house on the screen. They abandoned the kid to adult story and just focused on a group of kids getting scared. There was way too much 'comedy' being sprinkled throughout. You know, the lame kind where the characters make some unoriginal comment and everyone in the movie theater bursts out laughing like Dave Chappelle just hit his stride on stage. And the random love stories among the kids that didn't matter or further any narrative. I could write a 10,000 word essay going into the depths of all that is wrong with this movie so I'll stop. The worst of all is watching all of America fall in love with this. It makes me feel like a cynical jerk, but I think really it's just a clear sign of the dumbing down of people on this earth. No one respects or cares about great storytelling anymore. Just give them cheap pop-up scares and they will be happy. It really is sad.",1,215,442,10 September 2017
Interstellar," Possibly the Greatest Piece of Film Ever Made.
","I have watched this movie 4 times.And every time, I understand more that this is quite possibly the greatest film ever made.People will call the pace too slow.They'll say the math and visualizations are implausible.But I am an Astrophysicist. It is what I do. By night I am a movie buff.And in my life I have never seen a movie so accurately researched and so appropriately paced.It needs to be long. We have to explain in great detail.The emotion is perfect. The story is beautiful.For me, Forrest Gump used to take the cake.I think this surpasses.",10,0,1,5 February 2017
Split," Way too obvious.
","From the first 30 seconds of the film, they begin hitting us over the head with the fact that Casey isn't supposed to be with the other two girls. She's the weird outcast. She wasn't supposed to be in the car. McAvoy's hesitation with using Chloroform on her. There were only two beds. His female personality whispering about the 'two girls'. I could go on and on. She wasn't the target.They just continue giving the movie away so blatantly, that it's almost maddening as a viewer. There are four different instances before the beast appears where the personalities literally say 'you are pure, nothing bad has ever happened in your life, I have a special night planned for you', while they are unraveling Casey's rape story.I mean, 30 minutes into the movie after the first clip with the Uncle, I was screaming at the screen saying 'Casey! Just tell McAvoy that you were raped and he will let you go!'.And then all the way to the very freaking end even after he is screaming about his hatred for 'pure' people who have never had a tough life, she STILL can't grasp that all she has to do is reveal her rape. We have to sit there while M. Night unveils the scars on her body, as if it's the next coming of the 'Bruce Willis was dead the whole time?!' reveal. Darn you, M. Night. You clearly treated us like we were stupid. But then again, I guess this generation of selfie obsessed egomaniacs isn't as smart as the late 90's generation.",3,44,104,4 February 2017
