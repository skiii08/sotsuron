Blade Runner 2049," boring, slow, dragging
",This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It started very slow with boring long shots and nothing happening. There are a lot of wasteful moments here. I could easily finish this movies in 30 minutes. I actually got a headache and some back pain from watching this. Such a waste of money.,1,10,19,24 October 2017
