Requiem for a Dream," The only film I have ever seen that was hard to watch
","This film makes you FEEL the characters. You aren't even introduced to the characters and you feel their pain, it's very depressing. Darren Aronofsky did a excellent, and I mean EXCELLENT, job with the camera angles, the effect, the music was great, everything. This film was very hard to watch in some scenes, perhaps because the acting was great, Ellen Burstyn should have won the Oscar in my opinion. I stumbled upon it at FYE, watched it, and never wanted to see it again in my life. I wanted the DVD in the trash because it was that powerful and moving. I turned the film onto friends and family and I hear the same reaction from everyone, 'Man that was sad' or 'It was too depressing.' I highly recommend this MUST SEE film",10,8,14,18 March 2007
Spider-Man 3," This is what we get?
","It all started with Spider-Man number 1, awesome. The number 2, one of the best superhero films of ALL TIME. Then this one, a horribly written film that jumps all over the place more than any film has ever. What was Sam Raimi thinking? People we're dying to see Venom, they couldn't wait to see him, I personally was waiting before the first film was made. This is the villain people want to see more than any other. And this is what we get? Venom is on screen for twenty minutes, and it's played by... whatever his name is which doesn't cross my mind because of his poor performance as the villain. This was supposed to be the best of them all, the grandest, and needless to say, it is the worst. Seriously, a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE FILM. There are too many irrelevant scenes to even count, decent action, good acting only by Toby Maguire and Thomas Haden Church. And by the way, what the hell was that thing that he fell in before he turned into Sandman? We're they experimenting with sand castles? There is no explanation to anything at all in the film to what the hell that was, what and where the meteor came from, there are just too many villains. All I can say now is that they messed up. They messed up big time. This was supposed to be the film that everyone wanted to see because of Venom, HE'S ONLY ON SCREEN FOR TWENTY MINUTES!!!!!!!! THE REASON FOR THAT IS Because Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Harry, Aunt May, and Gwen Stacy all take turns crying in the film, this is the biggest crying fest I have ever seen on film. Every second, someone crys. This is about the relationship more than dealing with the Villain. Peter would rather cry than save people. I honestly thought this film was horrific to watch, and some scenes in the film I couldn't believe we're filmed. Save your money, this film wasn't worth me going to see it Thursday night, at midnight mind you, watching people cry for 2 hours and Venom for fifteen, getting out of the movie theater, and getting home at 3:30 am. Sam Raimi has destroyed this film, blame him.",3,1,3,7 May 2007
Grindhouse," Spectacular
","This film was one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. It is awesome beyone belief. Quentin and Robert have completely outdone themselves in this kickass action packed film that certainly doesn't skimp on the gore. Great acting, and even a few humorous scenes, this is Quentin's best film since Pulp Fiction, and that's saying A LOT. No matter what you have heard about this film in a negative way, it is dead wrong. I want to correct my self, not only one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen, IT'S ONE OF THE BEST. I loved it so much, go see this, it's a long one, relax and enjoy. Also the trailers in the film are hilarious and done very well, a true homage to the great 70's double features. Excellent job Quentin and Robert.",10,2,6,10 April 2007
Saw," i have never been so stunned by and ending in my life.
","'Oh my god!' this is the best twist ending I have ever seen in a movie in my entire life. I was watching it on the couch, and when the twist came, I literally stood up off the couch, and screamed at the top of my lungs. I pointed at the TV and jumped up and down wanting to watch it again and again, Leigh Whannel and James Wan are genius. No movie has ever had this much of an impact on me. If you have never seen this film, watch it. If you have skipped it and went to the second or third, don't watch it, it will be ruined. Brilliant, class A directing, grade B acting, unbelievable ending. I only wish I would have seen it in the theaters. I had my doubts at first, but I found it in my brothers room, watched it, and I am so happy that I did. Goes to show low budget movies with a great story can go a LONG way.",10,0,1,4 March 2007
Happy Feet," what is happening to animated films?
","This is not only the worst animated film ever made, it's one of the worst films ever made. While watching the movie, at no point did I get tuned in to it. It is boring, pointless, stupid, dumb, horrible plot, everything was wrong. The best animated films of ALL TIME are Toy Story, Toy Story 2, The Incredibles, Monster House, Finding Nemo, Madagascar and Hoodwinked. What happened do you ask? Over the hedge, Barnyard and Open Season came out. Then the writer said, how can we add those horrible movies together and make one even worse? One year later, HAPPY FEET, an awful awful film. I don't like George Miller, and this makes me dislike him even more. Stay away from this movie.",1,2,7,1 April 2007
