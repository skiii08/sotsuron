Alien 3," Disappointing
","I like this film for 3 simple reasons. First of all, it's got a great lead actress, Sigourney Weaver who has always proven to be great in the role of Ripley whether she's human or cloned. Second, the film has a really dark tone and a lot of style thanks to director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson. Third and most important, the story shows us the real tragedy of Ellen Ripley's life, how everyone around her, everyone she cares for are taken away from her by the Alien. Still she prevails. The ending left me in shivers because of Ripley's courage and sacrifice. Although all these things could have made a grand film for the series, David Fincher didn't really know where he was going. He just didn't seem at ease and the whole package feels unfinished, sometimes boring. There are very few action or suspense scenes, like I said, the film relies more on drama for it's effect which is great but not for an Alien film. It would have needed more action, more suspense, more terror and victims we care for (except for Ripley of course.)  Although it's got it's share of goodies, Alien続 is mostly a disappointment, especially when you compare it to it's 2 predecessors.",8,15,33,14 August 1998
Alien: Resurrection," Alien=suspense, Aliens=action, Alien続=tragedy, Alien Resurrection=gore
","Although it's got major flaws and some plot holes, I find myself liking Alien Resurrection a lot. First of all, I'm a sucker for horror and sci-fi movies. Second, I LOVE the Alien series, although Alien続 was a bit offbeat in the action department. Third, Sigourney Weaver is incredibly menacing as a cloned Ripley. She's always great to see on screen but this was truly something to behold. and last but not least, I loved the storyline, how they brought the genetic aspect so cleverly. It was truly a new twist on the series, although I wouldn't qualify A:R as a REAL episode in the Alien series but rather a new begining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a great job in bringing his fantastic style to Hollywood. The creatures were cool and scary although I wish we had seen more of the Queen; we still had the horrific Newborn which was truly demonic. Anyway, despite it's flaws, it's still a great film, although it will never be a classic like Alien and Aliens are. Now if only there could be a fifth one with a better script, more character development and more firepower.",9,296,443,14 August 1998
Alien," Milestone
","The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !",9,190,268,14 August 1998
Dark City," Nearly Perfect Film
","I saw Dark City about 5 times now and it has clearly mind-blown me. Of course the FX are astounding (especially the end battle which is epic) but mostly the whole concept of the film. It's scary, troubling and Alex Proyas did a marvelous job in bringing a dark and parano誰d style to the film. I love almost everything about the film except one thing: we are told everything! Whenever there's a question in your mind about the mystery, a character will at one point or the other explain it in a long monologue. Mr. Proyas should have watched a little more X-Files episodes and learn that some mysteries are more mysterious if they are unresolved. I would have loved to be left with some questions to anwser by myself or among friends. Anyway, you MUST see this film, especially if you like comic books, video games or fantasy films. You'll freak out over the end battle. Rarely can I say that I've been moved that much by a sci-fi movie but this one is THE one to see. I wish I had a DVD because the DVD version has tons of cool featurettes to enjoy the movie even further. Until then, I'll enjoy the tape. And so should you.",9,1,2,5 August 1998
54," Empty as can be
","It's funny how many people are attracted to certain films if there's a chance for them to see a pretty face or some nudity. Usually I'm against that kind of behaviour and always try to justify a film by it's other, more important contents. I found myself incapable of doing this with '54'. This film is a big 'So What?'. No climax, no intrigue, no suspense, no drama, no exciting direction, no sex, no mood, no good. I wonder why this was made... Why? What was the intention? Is there a point? Did the characters evolve in any way? No. You're always waiting for something to happen but nothing ever does. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this empty and arrogant Boogie Nights wannabee.",5,0,0,7 September 1998
Aliens," This ain't a film.
","THE sci-fi movie. It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD...",10,604,736,14 August 1998
Jackie Brown," No Fancy Fireworks needed
","Contrary to Pulp Fiction which had a very unusual editing and flashy situations, Jackie Brown focuses more on characters that are basically humans with very focused problems, for instance getting older which is an eminent theme tackled in the film. No one's evil in all this. They all have interestingly real personalities and I felt strangely comfortable watching them talk, eat, kill and argue with each other. Tarantino is an excellent storyteller and I wish I could write dialogues as interesting as his. The film flows with a slower pace than Pulp, with all it's many streched takes and lenghty scenes, but by doing so leaves us more time to grasp the characters with all their differences. A more mature Tarantino. Still loving what he does. And he said it himself before the film came out: 'This one is at a lower volume then 'Pulp.' It's not an epic, it's not an opera. It's a character study.'",10,231,266,5 August 1998
