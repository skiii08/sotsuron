Walk the Line," Review
","'June, June, Junnnnnneee!' - Johnny CashThis movie is about how Johnny Cash became the artist he was. It touches on subjects about drugs, betrayal, and reinventing yourself.
Johnny Cash was a very famous artist back in the days. He was known for many of his hits songs like 'I walk the line' and 'Prison Blue.'
The director is James Mangold. The main actors were Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Whitherspoon, Ginnffer Goodwin. They are all good actors who have acted in big movies.
I really like this movie I thought it was directed good and touched up on all the conflicts and details of his life. It was a real documentary that didn't hide up anything of this life. I would recommend this movie but I would only watch it at school it's not really my type of genere.",8,1,1,5 February 2019

","'I'm just here to play ball' -Jackie RobinsonThis movie is about the famous ball player Jackie Robinson. And all the obstacles he went through when playing baseball. It starts off right after the civil war and people were still really racist and bigotry.
I didn't know much about Jackie Robinson but I found interesting that his coming up with also the beginning of many other peoples. I think this movie was pretty accurate.
The director is Brian Helgeland. Some main actos are Chadwick Boseman #wakanda4life, Harrison Ford, Lucas Black, and Nicole Beharie.

I would totally recommend this movie to a friend and even watch it on my own time. Overall this movie is a great movie with a good life lesson.",10,1,2,5 February 2019

Robert F. Kennedy, Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis
Thirteen days is about the cold war. The director is Roger Donaldson. Some actors are Kevin Costnor,Bruce Greenwood,Steven Culp, Frank Wood, This movie was alright. There are many scenes in which you'll fall asleep. But I guess if you're interested in war movies without any action this movie is for you. I did have some pretty cool actors.

Back to the Future," Review
","'Damn....damn!'
This movie takes place in the past, present, and future. A 17 year old boy gets sent 30 years to the past.
I think that it was really interesting the differences that there were in the different time periods. In the 50's segregation was still going on. African Americans were the waiters and didn't have any rights. In the 80's segregation was over and there was more acceptance. There was even a African American elected as mayor.
The director is Robert Zemeckis and some main characters are Lea Thompson, Micheal J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispín Glover. I haven't seen them in any other movies but I've heard about them.
I really liked the movies lines and plot. They had really funny sayings and the actors weren't that bad. I would watch this movie in my own home and recommend it to some friends even. Overall it was a good movie with very funny dialogue. And a interesting plot.",9,0,1,30 January 2019
