The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best from this year
","I don't know if it is age or I'm getting more difficult but lately it's been difficult for me to walk out of the theatre and feel satisfied.But this movie made that possible. I had my doubts when I went in as I didn't feel like watching another 'Teen' movie (I'm 38 in case you wonder). But 'The Perks of being a Wallflower' just blew me away. The movie just felt so honest, .. deep, and yet simple. The three main characters Charlie, Patrick and Sam feel real, .. but in ways I've rarely experienced in a movie. It's easy to identify with any of them as we all most likely encountered at some point in our life at least one of the issues they face. I can only recommend this movie as it made me smile and I thought back to the movie for days, .. which doesn't happen a lot with movies.",8,2,4,31 May 2013
Deja Vu," Not a bad movie, but ......
","I was quite surprised I have to say. We were a group of 10 people watching the movie. And everybody had a very different point of view at the end of the movie. It ranged from crap to excellent.Personally I liked the movie. OK you have to be in it and follow the storyline in order to keep up. It's getting pretty complicated after the first 20 minutes. If you lost it there, no need to go on.The story is nice, a bit different that what you would expect but nice. I couldn't find too many inconsistencies in the story line going back and forth in time. It was entertaining as well.There's two points that I didn't like about the movie. Who's the terrorist????? When he was arrested he was talking like he knew something that would be important to the story, but we never get to know if he was just talking crap or if it was based on information that the viewer didn't have 'yet'. And at the end on the Ferry he says: ' It wasn't supposed to be like this'. How can he know?? Then there's the final scene in the car where the main actor seems to remember about the past that hasn't happened yet. How's that possible? It's definitely a movie worth watching.",7,1,2,26 December 2006
Point Break," Very very disappointing
","The original Point Break (1991) is one of my favorite movies. It's not perfect but the base ideals of the movie are worth looking out for and trying to apply in life which is why I loved it. When I heard they were doing a remake of that movie I had mixed feelings. I always have those when I see a movie I liked being done over. Sadly this new version of Point Break is a disgrace !! They managed somehow to loose the core essence, the soul of the original and replace it with beautiful vistas and action scenes and a horrible plot. Acting was ..... bad. All this movie did for me was to make me want to look at the original again.",1,7,11,21 March 2016
The Hurt Locker," Definitely one of the best of this year
","If you read the reviews you know what the movie's about, I'll rather explain what I liked about it. It's actually a simple a story with a lot of interesting elements that made me smile at some moments, and think at others. It's certainly not the typical war movie with huge battlefields, but takes a look a some peoples behavior and it's impact on people working around them. There are two or three scenes in the movie that are far fetched and defy reality, but that doesn't really harm the end result. The only thing that I didn't like about it is the one or the other scene that doesn't really add anything to the movie, but these were probably needed to make the movie more attractive to a certain kind of audience.Watch the movie. It's worth your time.",8,5,11,19 October 2009
The Departed," Brilliant movie, excellent acting performance.
","This movie was by far on the best last year.The main cast is excellent. Nicholson and Di Caprio have more complex roles than Damon and Wahlberg. But the 4 of them fit perfectly into the movie. The acting is just wow, ... and the story is actually quite simple in it's complexity. You can very easily see yourself in any of the main roles and 'feel' what you would do in his/her shoes.The introduction was a bit on the fast side but you easily keep up after 5 minutes.There are parts in it when things happen so fast that you're still trying to 'work' out what you just saw the next thing happens that makes you forget the first one. After walking out of the cinema that evening we were all still thinking about the movie for 20 minutes without talking to each other.",8,0,0,15 January 2007
The Thin Red Line," One of my Favorites
","The worst thing that happened to this movie was the date it was released in theatres here in Europe.I have to admit that when I saw this movie in the theatre it was shortly after I'd seen 'Saving Private Ryan'. That made me not like the movie that much as I was still under the awe (if I may call it like that) of SPR. I came out of the cinema a bit disappointed.Several years later I bought the DVD second hand. After a few month in the shelf I watched it and I have to say it's a piece of art. The directing, the music, the pictures are wonderful (as far as one can say that about a war movie). It's the only war movie I saw that doesn't only show war but also what the soldiers were thinking, how the same situation had a very different impact on the different people. Why some of them did the things they did, heroic or horrible.If you're in for a philosophical trip, ..... don't miss this one out.",9,2,5,18 October 2006
Cinderella Man," Great Movie, ... must see
","Wow, .. marvelous movie. It's about boxing, but there is so much more in it. The movie excels at showing how one can have everything in life, and then the next moment you have to do any job you're being offered to be able to get the minimum to survive.Acting is excellent, ..... but the fights are just tremendous. It just feels as if you were in the ring with them fighting. Craig Bierko was the most impressive to me as Max Bear. Russell Crowe and Ren√©e Zellweger are great too. But I was also impressed by Paul Giamatti in his role. This is one of the must see movies.",10,0,1,17 October 2005
