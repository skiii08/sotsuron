Howl's Moving Castle," Hal and Sophie
","The movie struck me deeply, and I felt comfortable with its bright and harmonious colors. About the love's pure fable, ponders over for a long time the good fairy tale, this movie has given one by one the best annotation. The stories of love, freedom, war and peace, even with a vague religious philosophy in them, I thought of Harr's longing for freedom and peace, and was struck by Sufi's optimism and sincerity, that's what I love about Hayao Miyazaki's films, the way he always brings out the best in people in the form of a narrative, like a novel, which is three dimensional and intuitive.",9,0,0,27 March 2020
Zootopia," My dream
","It's one of my favorite movie,it's about love ,big person also will do kind thing ,it's let me moved for the end!",8,0,0,18 March 2020
My Neighbor Totoro," The journey of innocence
","As Hayao Miyazaki puts it, this is an adventure story of fighting without weapons and superpowers. It's not about fighting good and evil. It's about surviving in a society where good and evil are intertwined. Learn human love, play their own wisdom, eventually Chihiro returned to human society, but this is not because she defeated the evil forces, but because she dug out their own life force",9,1,1,20 March 2020
Forrest Gump," The power of pure
","Forrest Gump is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. It is just a movie, so maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. What that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.",9,1,1,15 April 2020
Ratatouille," Anyone can cook
","First of all, this is the best animated movie I've ever seen. Disney's 3 D special effects with Pux is certainly one of the first things to watch, but there's a bigger attraction here, and that's the plot. It's hard to imagine a mouse becoming a chef in a human kitchen, and all of this comes with a human aversion to rats. The mouse's success proves the late chef Gusteau's famous dictum that 'anyone can cook' . In fact, this 'everyone' even includes rats and other animals.",7,0,0,27 March 2020
Spirited Away," Don't look back
","As Hayao Miyazaki says, this is an adventure story of fighting without weapons and superpowers. It's not about fighting good and evil. It's about surviving in a society where good and evil are intertwined. Learn human love, play their own wisdom, eventually Chihiro returned to human society, but this is not because she defeated the evil forces, but because she dug out their own life force.",8,0,0,20 March 2020
Inside Out," Happiness and sorrow are neighbors
","The movie tells the story of a girl named Leili and the emotions inside her head. Leili had lived happily in Minnesota, with loving parents, close friends, and a passion for hockey. Suddenly one day the family moved to San Francisco because of his father's work, but because the new home was not good, they left their friends, and Leili felt terrible about her new life. So Leili decided to run away and go back to Minnesota, where she had been happy, but in the end Leili called it off before the bus left and returned to her new home. This is the real world story of Leili, while in Leili's mind the five emotional villains lead to another series of stories to save Leili from the change of mood from joy to depression and anger. The film has its own artistic originality and fantasy, but it is also worth exploring in psychology, especially in the aspects of emotion, memory and dream.",8,0,0,24 March 2020
Wreck-It Ralph," Friend
","This is a very interesting animation, the main character is not what save the world hero, is not an ordinary little person, he is a villain. But he's not really a villain. That's the way it's supposed to be. It's like, you know, what you need in every movie, a character to play off the main character. He didn't want to do it, he didn't want to be alone in the garbage, he didn't want to ruin it, he wanted to be accepted, he wanted to have friends. Along with the plot, he found a good friend, is a very powerful girl, in fact, the story is very simple, wonderful characters and the embodiment of friendship, we are very cute people.",7,0,0,15 April 2020
Coco," Remember me
","The famous Mexican writer and Nobel Prize in Literature Octavio Paz Panochudo once said, 'death is actually a reflection of life. ' . Death is the highest meaning of life; it is the opposite of life, and it is the complement of life. This is also the value and philosophy embodied in 'a dream-seeking journey' (1949) -- 'the real death is that no one in the world remembers you any more' . In one of the film's gloomiest scenes, a ghost is completely forgotten, and when he dies, the shot glass features a Mexican Tequila. 'It's always important to remember the people you love, both inside and outside of your life. '",8,0,0,15 April 2020

WALLÂ·E," Love the earth
","Pux Is really powerful, and they've managed to pass on their values. End of the world panic, the future of human thinking, feelings, selection, robots, cute animation, lifelike action language... These elements combined, animation can do this state, it is very unlike animation. You see the world the way you see it, but in the end, you're going to agree with the values that come out of that packaging, and you're going to think, yes, they did the right thing. The captain should have insisted on returning to Earth, Wall e should have followed Eva without hesitation, Eva should have fixed wall e, although many movies have similar plots, you may have guessed the plot, but this is an animation, you take this idea, unknowingly forgives the marks. I hope that while you think the movie is really good, you can be brainwashed, exercise, love the earth.",8,0,0,24 March 2020

The Silence of the Lambs," The mystery behind the mystery
","Film with a strong psychological color, the hero and heroine of the formation of the character are described in detail. The film highlights one aspect of STARLING'S CHARACTER: The harrowing images she had as a child at her adoptive parents'home when they butchered their animals. It was because she could not bear the whines of the cattle that she stole away from her adoptive parents'ranch. Pity for the weak became her subconscious obsession and her motivation to get into the FBI and die. She's Dead Tone a serial killer hunt, Jim? Gammy couldn't bear the tragic death of his hostage. She broke into Mason's farm alone because she didn't want Dr. Lecter lynched. The lamb's pain had been a constant urge to do her duty. The film is unique in its descriptive perspective, exploring the spiritual world, the formation and change of character from the perspective of Floyd's psychoanalysis, and peering into the character's behavior from the complex expressions of the unconscious and the conscious, the ID, the ego and the superego, there are a lot of things we can chew on and learn from. But it also seems to mythologize psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, and many places have taken on a supernatural, even grotesque, Hue.",8,0,0,15 April 2020
