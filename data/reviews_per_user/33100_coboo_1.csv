Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is truly a brand new movie
","Well, I would like to say that movie is great! Although it's only and always will be a Hollywood-ntertainment movie, the newest attempts and CG-aided scenes were amazingly cool and attractive.The main thing is that all the creatures(save human) and Droids were almost completely in CG, allowing to add any effect needed to make scenes marvellous. Scenes under water with big fish etc were also in a very large scale.The duels of Obi-won and Qui-Gon VS Darth Maul, were acrobatic and excellent as well. Comparing to the cheap action of Obi-won and Darth Vador in Episode 4, the new one was so exciting.Natalie Portman has not lost her Charisma and beauty from 'LEON, the professional', and is still a shining actress. However, her role of Princess Amidala sucked. The way she tried to speak in a noble-and-polite way was really disgusting. She shouldn't have done it that way. And her 'completely-out-of-her-mind make-ups' were also so ugly. There must have been some other way to act that character. While the other role, the servant Padme was naturally played and beautiful.Samuel L jackson was completely nonsense in the movie. What on earth did he have to do in that role?And the young Anakin was really young. He is a funny boy.So, to finish, I would like to say that we should see that movie as 'Star Wars' and nothing else. Then, we could find much more fabulous things in the screen. I can't wait until the Episode 2.",Null,0,0,26 June 1999
