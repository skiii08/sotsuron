The Rock," Good plot, great characters, brilliant movie.
","A highly ranked general in the US army steals 15 nerve gas rockets and threatens to send them into San Fransisco from Alcatraz to teach the government a lesson for lying about soldiers killed in the gulf, desert storm etc.The only way to stop him is to break IN to Alcatraz. Mason (Sean Connery), is the only person who ever escaped alive, pulled out of Max security to get them in, he is played very well by Connery. Smart, arrogant and full of one-liners you're never quite sure about him.Once in Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), has to disarm them. A chemistry superfreak Goodspeed is way out of his depth and has no idea of what to do in a combat situation, played incredibly believably by Cage this is the character we like the most. Watch for how different he is in the office, and in combat.Ed Harris is masterful as the general torn between duty and honour. One of his best roles to date.I highly recommend seeing this movie. You won't be disappointed.",9,1,1,3 May 2000
The Devil's Advocate," Makes you realize how good an actor Al Pacino really is.
","How many actors are there who could play Satan to such perfection? Al Pacino does no less than a superb job portraying John Milton, a man of power, women and money living in a world with no guilt. A great moment in cinema when he makes his final speech to Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves). But his acting only the icing on the cake of a brilliant film. The script also deserves mention for portraying the devil not as a bloodthirsty monster but as a being of temptation and desire. While not really being a drama but not really being a thriller either, you truly feel for the characters but are put on the edge of your seat at the same time, the second half of this movie will hold you in constant suspense. The nudity and violence are a bit gratuitous but never for their own sake, everything you see is there for the movie, any less and it wouldn't have worked as well.Overall a fantastic film and a must see for all thriller fans and all drama fans. You won't be disappointed.",8,0,1,20 June 2001
Top Secret!," Laughs around every corner.
","This is one of my all time favorite movies. The writers took every pun, double entendre and cheap gag they could find and turned it into one helluva film. Watch it over and over again to get all the gags, I've seen it hundreds of times but still find things I've missed.You won't be disappointed.",8,1,2,6 April 2000
Predator," Hunter vs hunter
","I'm not sure what it is about this movie that makes it so good but it most definitely is a brilliant film. Perhaps it's the fantastic story of this other worldly hunter, perhaps it's the perfect casting of Schwarznegger and the rest of the commandos, perhaps it's the special effects that while not brilliant, are still impressive. Or perhaps a combination.Whatever it is, see this movie. The hard ass portrayal of almost all of Dutch's team, especially Mac and Blain, suits the role perfectly. The scripting of Predators on-by-one hunting is utterly fantastic.I can't possibly express how great this film is in words, just go see it. Now. If you're any kind of a sci-fi fan you won't be disappointed.",8,0,0,28 April 2001
The Usual Suspects," Bet you can't guess the ending, no matter what.
","A truly brilliant film unlike any other I have seen. From superb acting to an intriguing plot, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat or in the arms of a loved one.Kevin Spacey is excellent as Verbal Kint. The actor who plays Keyser Soze is also incredibly well done. I won't tell you who it is though, you have to watch the movie.The film was well cast and definitely deserves a chance. Only the extremely critical could possibly find something wrong with this wonderful film.Do yourself a favour and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",10,0,1,10 April 2000
The Princess Bride," You, your partner, and The Princess Bride - Perfect.
","This is undoubtedly the best movie to watch with a partner. The love story is one of the best I have ever seen, rivalling and possibly surpassing Casablanca. The script that goes with it is brilliant as is the acting and screenplay. Rob Reiner has created a masterpiece that must be watched by anyone and everyone.Some great acting performances by almost all of the cast, watch especially for Billy Crytal's cameo. Andre the giant does quite well with Fezic, the kind-hearted giant, and Mandy Patinkin's performance as Inigo Montoya is incredible.The swordfight scene between Wesley and Inigo deserves special mention as it has been voted the best in any movie by IMDB and displays the talent of the fencers very well. The conversation they have during the fight is also excellent.I cannot praise this movie enough and can find no flaw. Watch it, and watch it again, preferably with girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife. You'll both enjoy it tremendously.",10,1,2,10 July 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," The Perfect Movie
","This would have to be THE best movie that I have ever seen. The story of a wrongly convicted man. And the story of a man searching for meaning. And the story of an institutionalised man. This movie takes several different stories and turns them into one fantastic film.Watch it a number of times to see all the stories come together in an inspiring manner that touches the soul. I can't recommend this movie enough. Morgan Freeman's performance of the narrating Red, and explanations of prison life are truly touching. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy is near perfect, no, it IS perfect.Watch it, then watch it again.You won't be disappointed.",10,0,0,4 May 2000
The Matrix," Welcome to the real world.
","The Wachowski bros have truly excelled in this brilliant film. The direction and special effects are incredible but don't take away from the plot or the acting which is so often the case with this kind of film. All aspects of the film come together so well, the frightening plot, the awesome special effects, the insightful direction, the great acting and the gripping script.Lawrence Fishburne is perfectly cast as the wise leader Morpheus, his character is always cool and delivers some very memorable quotes ('Fate it seems, is not without a sense of irony.') perfectly, every one of his movements is planned and deliberate.Keanu Reeves proves that he still has some acting ability in his portrayal of Mr. Anderson, Neo. Being totally out of his depth for the first half of the movie and then turning into the one who can do it all was very well done.The Agents also deserve praise for their roles. Hugo Weaving could not have done better, everything from the monotone voice to the constant menacing glare was bone chilling. By the end of the film you can really see how much he hates being in the matrix, being a sheperd to the more primitive prisoners.From the sunglasses to the boots, the costumes for each and every character suit the film to a tea. And the sets compliment everything, the interior of the Nebuchadnezzar especially.Overall a brilliant film that is a must see. One of the few I've given a 10/10.",10,0,0,11 June 2000
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Vampires not as monsters, but living things.
","This movie showed us the other side of the vampire, the side that, like us all, is searching for the meaning of it all. The side that loves, that feels lonely, that seeks companionship. Unlike movies such as 'From Dusk Till Dawn', who care to portray vampires as ugly, primitive, uncivilised monsters, we are presented with vampires that yearn to discover the meaning of it all, yearn to move with the times and yearn to see once again the sunrise they have forsaken.The acting by all characters in this film is quite extraordinary, with special mention going to Kirsten Dunst for her portrayal of Claudia. Every facial shot of her expressed so much emotion for such a young girl making us truly believe she really is a much older, wiser, killer. Tom Cruise also deserves mention. Although many tend to see Lestat as a villian, I saw him more as just a vampire who enjoys what he is, unlike Louis who has just come to grips with the endless killing. The fantastic make up for all the vampires, especially Lestat's, also gave much to the film. Quite a brilliant scene when Lestat returns from the swamp playing the piano. Spine tingling!Other excellent points about the film include the soundtrack, following the timeframe to perfection. The costume design, again with special mention for Claudia. And the architecture of everything from New Orleans to London to Paris.For a different, and refreshing view of vampires. See this movie. A brilliant movie on all counts. 9 out of 10. See it, you won't be disappointed.",9,1,2,14 July 2001
Braveheart," Inspiring
","From the start to the finish of this movie you can't help but feel inspired by the acts of pure heroism, passion, friendship and revenge. Mel Gibson in the role of William Wallace could not have been better cast. His acting really brings out the character of a vengeful commoner who unites a nation to bring freedom to Scotland.Patrick McGoohan as the stubborn longshanks made it easy to hate this character, portraying a vicious, egotistical maniac who will stop at nothing to rule Scotland, he steals the show every time he appears on screen, with a wicked glance, a cruel word or a ruthless order.In a testament to the amount of emotion this movie can evoke, I have seen many MEN (especially those with Scottish heritage) cry at the execution of Wallace. There are so few movies that can do that now.Although there is much violence in this movie, it rarely goes over the top and only adds to the harsh reality of the time. Overall a spectacular film not to be missed. Congratulations to Gibson, he's done extremely well as both an actor, and a director.",10,0,2,18 October 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Great in almost every way
","The Coen brothers have outdone themselves with O Brother Where Art Thou. A thoroughly enjoyable movie that takes you back to depression era USA to follow three escaped inmates across the state looking to find a great treasure.George Clooney does surprisingly well in his role of Ulysses Everett McGill, never once slipping out of character or out of accent for even a moment. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were perfect as Pete and Delmar respectively, and were a joy to watch. The often confused Delmar has many of the finest and funniest lines in the film and seems happy to go along with everything and anything. The small parts of John Goodman as Big Dan T and Michael Badalucco as George 'Babyface' Nelson do little more than reinforce the many references to Homer's Odyssey, but are still a welcome addition to the film.The cinematography also deserves a mention with many wide shots of the open plains and fields of they early 1900s, along with radio shacks, town halls and general stores. Each drawing you more into the film.And finally the soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant!! I can't say enough good about this. The fact that the soundtrack was more successful than the film, alone says it all. The pure sounds of blues, bluegrass and old timey are easy on the ears. I would, however, like to have the chance to hear Clooney singing In Constant Sorrow himself (it was dubbed even though he practiced for months), perhaps a feature on the DVD...Overall a film that will have you tapping your foot and crying with laughter. See this film. You won't be disappointed.",8,0,0,26 April 2002
