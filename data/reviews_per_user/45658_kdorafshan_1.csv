Resident Evil: Afterlife," Destroying the franchise...
","It's a 3rd rate movie, with none existent story that all manages to do is combining some music with some stolen characters from other movies like Silent Hill and Matrix and fully destroying the Resident Evil franchise once and for all.Dude, it was not suppose to be a MTV video clip or commercial. Write a story first, then shoot the scenes. It's funny that after this mess, they had the nerve to open the door for the next part too!Although I didn't watch the 3D version of the movie, I must say: Very disappointing experience... Not recommended to the fans. It dissolves any good memory that may be left from previous episodes!",3,2,5,26 November 2010
