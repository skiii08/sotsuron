Changeling," A little heavy handed
","Clint Eastwood has produced some brilliant work as a director. Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby come to mind.But, as with Flags of Our Fathers, he here demonstrates a penchant for going over the top.There were times I felt like I was watching a dystopian commentary on systemic corruption at the hands of the new world order rather than a period piece revolving around a humanly dramatic mystery.Much of the acting is equally excessive as Clint lingers to jab a knife into our hearts in a way that is meant to be grueling but is surprisingly shallow.Such are the consequences of the risks inherent in going deep with dramatic material. The effort is compelling even if the result is lacking in grace.Part of the problem is the complexity of the material, which seems to drift between two different story lines, both of which are given equal weight even though they are barely related, as if one is meant to throw us off the trail of the other - which results in cheaply woven mystery and a plot that loses its way.",Null,0,0,27 October 2016
Mulan," Should have taken itself more seriously.
","I own the video and have watched it numerous times.  I really like this film because mostly because of it's theme and some key scenes that are very moving.What's frustrating about Mulan is that it's a really good movie whose potential greatness is forfeited to the commercial imperative of mass audience appeal.Dramas employ light comic relief release tension.  Comedies employ a smattering of drama to move the story along.  Mulan tries to indulge both to a degree of contrast that is detrimental to its primary genre: drama.
The themes of honor and search for one's destiny are very well explored through the adventures of the heroine Mulan.  The greatest moments in this film are when we see the courage of a young woman facing the dangers imposed both by cultural paradigm and warfare.  We admire her more for dealing with both at the same time.The problem is that too many moments are ruined with a comedic tag and the film's dramatic pace is often interrupted by obligatory slapstick comedy. I honestly don't think this was necessary.  Children appreciate the story and don't need to be pandered to with incongruous comedy.Still, the power of the story itself and the crafting of the main characters manage to stand out and hold their own despite the self-imposed comedic distractions.  If the writers had given their own story the respect it deserves, this would have been a great film.",Null,1,3,10 October 2002
Memento," Almost clever
","I don't like film noir for the same reason I don't like modern art.  Modern art is cool because it is incomprehensible, providing the illusion that indulging confusion is somehow deep.  I've always thought this sort of thing was a kind of joke where the artist laughs quietly at our efforts to inject chaos with false genius.  Or maybe I just don't get it.To be incomprehensible because of intellectual prowess may be admirable, but to be incomprehensible due to little more than obscure confusion is annoying.The problem with this film is that the plot is simply not resolved.  Whether or not this is intentional, I honestly cannot tell.  We are given an explanation in the penultimate scene that is presented in a manner that simply invites us to ask more questions which ultimately go unanswered and leaves the audience to make up their own mind.  If possible.Honestly, this little trick was old a long time ago and has not become less annoying with age.I will say, however, that the film is captivating.  I desperately wanted my answers and enjoyed the highly experimental sequencing.  But the director owes me an answer.  He owes me a story.  He owes me a conclusion. 
And we never get one.  Or maybe I just don't get it.  If you want something that's different and kind of cool in the end, watch The Sixth Sense or Fight Club.  You won't lose sleep trying to figure them out because they actually have a conclusion.",Null,1,3,27 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Much better
","Like many who grew up privately indulging the mythology of Episode IV, I felt betrayed by Episode I.  Episode II is a redemption of sorts, both artistically and technically.Some have commented that Episode II is marginally better than Episode I. This is not true - Episode II is *much* better.  I boycotted Episode II in the theaters and, having seen it on HBO, regret not being able to see it on the big screen.The story and plot are actually interesting.  There's some intrigue and suspense here that keeps your attention.  Characters, both real and virtual, are actually developed and have depth and complexity.  This, to me, was the most significant improvement.  The acting was better, the dialog - for the most part - was better.  I actually cared about these characters and their fate.  Ewan McGregor in particular honed the art of acting opposite a non-existant player.  Hayden Christensen plays Annikan as a young man struggling with a brewing conflict within.  Fits of rage are matched by a valient struggle at reconcilliation as he slowly loses control to the Dark Side.  Annikan arcs from benign mischief to agregious outrage - we know there is something seriously wrong with this boy by the time the movie is over. Compared to the cartoonish adventures of Annikan in Episode I, this portrayal is far more sophisticated and refined.  There are no Oscar (copyright, tm, etc.) moments here, but this is a real movie with real acting and a real story.The integration of the virtual environment has improved, as well.  The environment manages to serve as a stage rather than a seperate character and it's much easier to believe that these people are in the environment rather than in front of it.  It's less cluttered and old-fashioned cinematography and composition are taken more seriously this time around.  The last 20 minutes or so are astounding.  Curiously, the world of Ipisode II is clean to the point of being anticeptic - unlike the 'lived-in' feel of the older episodes. At the same time, ILM still manages to indulge itself on occasion and we are subjected to some video-game sequences here and there.  I really with they would avoid these.Another major difference in Episode II is that George Lucas has taken his world more seriously.  The world of Star Wars is still a bloodless one, but combat in Episode II is more brutal, more savage, more violent.  People and creatures actually die.  Warfare is not taken as lightly this time around, despite the insistance on comic relief interwoven during fights.
And, a sure indicator that Lucas really was listening and tried to improve: We have a lot less Jar-Jar.  He's still there, but not as much and he talks even less.  Jar-Jar has matured some, too.  He's tolerable at least in Episode II.As those of us who grew up with the Force have matured and moved into the real world, so has Star Wars as portrayed in Episode II.  It's more mature. Some innocense has been lost.  But the spirit is in tact.
While Episode I was written for my little boy, Episode II was written for me.  I would have gladly paid 8 bucks to see the real thing.  Probably twice.",8,3,5,19 June 2003
The Aviator," Smear Campaign
","One would expect a movie about Howard Hughes with Aviator as the main word in its title would be about Howard Hughes and his accomplishments in aviation.And one would be wrong.Spending far too much time on Hughes's eccentricities, this film appears to be an attempt to explore psychosis more than anything else. Depicted to the point of hyperbole, the man's difficulties are slathered over this stylish and vacuous portrayal.Meanwhile, the tale of Hughes Aviation is relegated to stage dressing punctuated by a few instances of genuinely exciting feats.If you have any knowledge of the history of Hughes Aircraft or the man behind it, you will be disappointed.Perhaps most indicative of the lack of real interest this movie has in aviation is the simple failure to accurately depict even the most basic concepts of flying. If you throw the stick forward, the plane will not go faster, it will nose over and crash into the ground.This movie throws the stick forward.",4,2,3,20 May 2005
The Last Samurai," Epic fable
","The Last Samurai is a poetic story about redemption, honor, love and the inevitable death of all things.  Ed Zwick weaves a simple tale against the romanticized backdrop of late 19th century Japan when the last vestiges of feudal Japan, and its ancient culture, slip away in the face of Western modernization.The story begins with Capt. Nathan Algren, a cynical whiskey-soaked veteran of the plains wars hawking Winchester rifles to an ignorant audience. The depiction of Western society is vilified to the point of caricature in this film, which I'm not sure was necessary, as the prose of the Samurai culture sings well enough on its own.We soon learn through various flashbacks that Algren is a soldier who has lost faith in himself and his country but still retains the passionate spirit of a formidable warrior.  Spiritually, he is quite dressed up with no place to go.When he is offered a job as a mercenary to train Japanese Imperial troops, he is thrust into circumstances which forge a destiny that finally fulfills who he really is: a warrior who needs something worthy of fighting for. Though duty may call us to sell our soul, we may yet redeem ourselves if but we find the good fight.  Honor best serves that which is honorable, or, perhaps, that which we genuinely love.  These things may be enough to define a life of purpose.The storyline here is not all that clever and is in most respects, quite predictable.  It is the journey of Algren's character within the framework of this yarn that is most compelling and is played to a T by Cruise.
This is a film that is definitely worth seeing.  Though the plot is a touch thin on the ground, the writing is superb, with moral and spiritual questions explored in a thoughtful manner.  The production is mesmerizing and Cruise is well supported by a solid ensemble well directed by Ed Zwick.",8,1,2,26 December 2003
