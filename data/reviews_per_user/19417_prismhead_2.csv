The Ring," Pretty good...but...
","Spoilers!My wife and a friend of ours went to see it last night at a preview. About 30-40 minutes into the movie I was thinking 'Stir of Echoes'. (They have to find out what happened to the little girl and find her body in order to save themselves).Yes, I wrong about that in the end, but it seemed so obvious to me that I was not interested, as I should have been about what was going on.I could follow the movie just fine.  I just did not really care.  They should have kept me guessing more.  Was it the mom? Was it the little girl? Is something else going on?The little twist at the end was great.  The 'video' was very cool.  The special effects and how they showed the two dead people were very good too.I am fine with not knowing exactly what was going on.  I love the ending with the 'conundrum' (making a copy of the video saves you but it will kill more).But I don't think the average moviegoer will be ok with the limited explanation of why the girl was killing people.I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,9 October 2002
Dawn of the Dead," Worth it. Entertaining.
","The original Dawn of the Dead did not win any academy awards .and neither will this version.  But what are you expecting?...I got what I expectedmaybe a little more.Yes, there are stupid people in horror movies.  Get over it. Yes, the character development is not that great.  Get over it. Yes, the plot is not perfect.  Get over it.Minor spoilers:This is a good zombie movie.  You will jump a few times.  You will laugh. (especially, if you pay attention..like when they first get to the mall and the music playing over the PA system is `Don't worry be happy'  and then when two guys first split up and go searching the mall each alone....the music is `Don't want to be all by myself'The movie was fine.  I did not totally like the style of the ending with the credits cut in with the video clips.  It worked fine for the beginningbut not the ending.I would have liked to have seen a little of what was happening with the rest of the US and the World with what happened.But over all, I enjoyed it.",8,0,0,22 March 2004
