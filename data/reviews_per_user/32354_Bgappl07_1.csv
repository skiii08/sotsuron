Child 44," I guess I am the major exception
",I am a big fan of Tom Hardy but truth be told I first became attracted to his style of acting and him as an actor while watching this film I think Noomi Rapace is a very talented actress and she made another movie with Tom Hardy that I am aware of and also saw but at the moment I can't think of the title I do know they work well together and the rest of the cast is phenomenal I think the staging is excellent One gets a very good feel of the drudgery of the Soviet union at the time I think the film itself is well done It actually is one of my favorites I know it's not a blockbuster as Mr. Hardy has made already more than once but acting as usual is terrific. I could be more prolific but plainly obviously I do like this film and it's 5:10 AM and I have not slept yet so please excuse the elementary style of my expression of praiseworthiness !!,9,0,1,30 June 2020
