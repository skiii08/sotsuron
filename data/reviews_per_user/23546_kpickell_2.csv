The Blair Witch Project," Absolute waste of time.
","After all the hype I was utterly dissapointed.  This was so boring.  The ending was lame.  I can't see how anyone could be scared by something so stupid.  I kid you not, at the end of the movie everyone in the theater shouted 'boo'..  I don't know where the people who love this movie are coming from, I saw nothing worth anything in the movie.  The home-video footage was a good idea, but the movie behind it was rather lame.  Don't waste your time.  We were so utterly disappointed that we asked for our money back.  We didn't get our money back, so don't waste yours too.  Go see something else, anything else.  Ugh.  2/10.",2,0,2,31 July 1999
Moulin Rouge!," you'll have a gay ole time
","This was one of the queerest movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not even talking about the 15 fey actors or the lesbian kisses.  It was just very Different.  Sort of like 'Dancer In The Dark' meets 'Shakespeare in Love' with a 'Fantasia 2000' backdrop. ... But I still liked it.  I'm not a big fan of musicals (although I loved DITD), but I am gay, I am part of the MTV generation, and I think Ewan McGregor is very good looking, so perhaps I'm biased.  Even though it took about a half-hour to get into it was a nice story and is surprisingly wholesome queer fun for the whole family.",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
