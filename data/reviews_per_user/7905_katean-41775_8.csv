The Benchwarmers," Comedy gold!
","Laughs all the way through! Watched it in a drama class and everyone loved it (loved it so much that is, that when we never finished watching it, I go home and watch it), recommended it to my friends and it was laughs all night. Now I recommend it to you! Thanks to all the cast and everyone who made this possible. Great work and I hope everyone enjoys it.",9,0,0,28 December 2018
10 Things I Hate About You," Comedy gold!
","Based on the story of William Shakespeare's, 'taming of the shrew', this is not only educational but comedy gold. I'd recommend this to anyone, happily. It helps you understand the play whilst providing fun, laughter and entertainment. No doubt one to enjoy!",10,2,2,30 December 2018
Divergent," One of my all time favourites
","Truly loved this movie, so much in fact that i've come up with some puns which will only make sense to you when you've watched this film (which you'll no doubt LOVE). Enjoy the movie... and the puns! XD they should only take a fraction of your time!Friend: So have you met any cute dauntless guys?
Tris: well I've got Four in mind
*mental high five to self*Friend: I know this girl you should meet
Four: Sorry but I have my PRIORitiesErudite jokes would be like: iodine heard that oxygen and magnesium were going out and I was like O MgHope you enjoyed the bad puns and movie. If you liked this, there are 2 more!",10,1,3,30 December 2018
Spirited Away," Perfection
","I'm not a anime or manga fan, you'll rarely capture me sat infront of the tv watching this kinda movie but I must say this was really good. I don't see why this is rated as a twelve. it is a very perculiar movie but I guess that is what makes it so good: strange unique people and creatures, interesting storyline and in my eyes, fun, funny and family friendly! Perfect and recommended to all. Hope this helps, enjoy.",10,1,1,29 December 2018
The Incredibles," Funny, yep, family-friendly, yep, amazing, yep!

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Right up my Quality Street ðŸ¤£
",Pun alert! Loved this movie and hope you all do/did too! It was right up my Quality Street ðŸ¤£a family fun and classic. Enjoy,8,2,3,28 December 2018
Jaws," Not scary... phew!
","Thank goodness this wasn't scary! I am terrified of horror, can't even watch horror trailers and here I am watching a movie about shark attacks!? Well, my best friend moved 3 hours away from where I live and now lives by the seaside, now dreaming to work with sea life and sharks! She loves them SO much, studying them, wishing to go cave diving.. WITH ME?! Don't know how she even pictured me doing that! XD So I asked my mum what the movie was like. I watched a Keith and paddy picture show version / comedy short remakes of movies (also recommended) it seemed ok, so I check the real movie out. Nope not scary... phew! Not gory... phew! I'd say it is family friendly, being so obviously fake and my screamish friends would agree it isn't really gory. So yeah, great funny, family movie so enjoy.",8,0,2,29 December 2018
The Simpsons Movie," Hilarious!
","Just to point out, this movie has a little adult humour, however we watched this at school (being students either 12-13). I'd say it was a family friendly for its uncountable LOL factor and fun! Recommended to all. Enjoy",10,0,0,31 December 2018
