Resident Evil: Afterlife," The thrill is long gone...
","Its hard to write an accurate review of what I just saw in this movie. A mix of all kind, that are irrelevant to the plot. Storyline is lost in a sequence of zombie attacks, where in you find that some mutants have even evolved. They wear a hood and a huge Axe. Mila tries to act here, but you do notice she isn't giving her best. I don't blame her, because the script has no end. Never ending resident evil...zombies, umbrella, blade 3 villain theft. I do believe this would make an awesome series, but to make sequel after a sequel, it loses its freshness. I like Mila, but Alice here looked like a soccer mom fighting those zombies!Lame Matrix moves compel me to give this movie a 4/10 because we've seen this before. Still, no true conclusion in this episode.",4,0,2,14 November 2010
Iron Man 2," Iron...can't possibly fly...can it?
","Yet another movie for: the kids, man children, comic book worms, clich√© loving public. Everyone else...you're not knowing whats good for ya! This is becoming more and more commercial with each day passing by. How many comic books characters are there? Will everyone get its own movie? I hope not, because Marvel has become stale. It shoves itself on the screen, with the story of some rich guy, army manufacturer, gone berserk and became a guinea pig. In the middle of all that, he crossed a bunch of people including a Russian guy. What? Again with the Russians. Just stop it already. If you can't find a decent villain then maybe you shouldn't make a script. Sure, it was fun like in the comic book during the cold war. I as a viewer don't need to pay to go and see it with my own child and answer him that Russians are bad, because they pointed a nuclear missile in our direction. I don't need to feel bad for my country's politics that led to that, and the picture that stayed in some OLD comic book.RD and Rourke are great actors, but this story could do a makeover.",5,3,6,10 May 2010
Cloverfield," Camera kept filming...
","I've seen Cloverfield, and the film makes you panic. You get in touch with actors just as if you've been there experiencing the thrills that go along the ride. The thrills are unique. I see some people are comparing it to a Blair Witch project, but my thoughts are that they only concur in the fact that there is no sound story line in any of them. Just mass panic, couple of kiss kiss frames, then more panic! Also, the actors are just portraying the fact that they have been isolated and distanced in this huge commotion, having to find each other. Maybe there is some hidden meaning with this movie, like that we are all in the same city but so far from each other at the same time, running away from dangers, trying to keep ourselves alive while people who we love the most suffer from within.All in all a nice little thriller.",8,1,3,12 April 2010
Salt," Needs more salt...
","Strange movie, no doubt about it. Angelina plays a spy that's confused (or not), about her origin. Russians are bad guys like usual, but we all know that for a fact, from western style action movies. Its East vs West in cinematography since the iron curtain. The approach, like everything Lady Pit does, all is superficial and based on actresses good looks. She not only fails miserably here, she even shows a signs of bulimia. CIA looked like a pushover. None of this stuff is remotely real and you can't feel the bond between the character and everyone else. Pit's wife tried to act like she was for real here, and everything went into chaos. Turns out, everyone knows each other from when they shared a diaper. Lame and totally stupid movie, makes Angelina look worse than she already is. I loved her movies back when she played nerdy, sexy, programmer and was in tune with youth needs. Today movies need to make a leap that will change the industry all together, not reminisce about cold war dinosaurs, but if Lady Pit feels like a dinosaur herself...in my opinion, she better disappear, and don't even think about fossilizing.",1,2,7,28 November 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Movie is phenomenal!
","Some would say that there are some quite dramatic scenes portraying anal rape and oral sex, but its the role thats important as is the provocative state of the female hacker with a dragon tattoo. Whats with the girl hackers that's so appealing to see in the movies? They aren't the weaker sex in any way, neither are here as an informant of the digital age. Long story short, Craig is sent to investigate a long ago missing of a young woman belonging to a rich Sweden family. He gets help from an eccentric girl with a tattoo of a black dragon on her back. She is a master hacker, estranged and weird in terms of regular world. She doesn't fit in, but she is so skillful in computers and investigations. Sweden family keeps this dark secret hidden by all means, except one member thats keen to find out the truth. I would like to point out this masterful and very realistic acting of Rooney Mara, that has thrown aside the whole effect of ancient 'Hackers', has earned her a well deserved Oscar. Angelina Jolie, step aside, the new faces are coming and they outshine you!",10,2,7,15 February 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Simply beautiful.
","I've always been a fan of army movie comedies. It makes you think about the reasons for making wars instead of peace and love. Yes, hippies didn't just do drugs, they were also spreading the word of love.I must tell you that you will see a lot of love from characters here. Jeff Bridges is fantastic in his role as an Army Sci Ops commando leader. Stopping a heart of a goat by simply looking at it? With your mind? You gotta be kidding. Anyway, George Clooney here is also in the Sci Ops squad, and uses his gift for good purposes. Trick is, if you use the power to bring good stuff into reality, the circle will move in the right direction. Ewan plays a skeptic reporter that tags along with Clooney, and sees the Force of a Jedi, in someone else for a change. Fun part for me starts with them finding Bill...Jeff Bridges. Message of this movie could be, that we all carry some hidden talents inside ourselves, but we never let them carry us. Instead we limit selves with negative thoughts, postponing the time to nurture them, make them grow.The last part of the movie presents our need to believe that everything is possible in life. Try to find THAT feeling...Boston Soundtrack, More than a Feeling...is what this movie is all about!",10,18,27,27 March 2010
The Mist," Half life 3 hits a Supermarket
","The movie is up to taste if you like being bored to death by preacher characters and the other ones who'd rather take a chance in the deadly mist. Plot is explained during the first 10 minutes of the film. Its a project gone bad and now you paid to see it. Bunch of scary monsters show up and let me tell you something...the most of them are copy from the Half life game. Animation is perfect. Acting is also top notch. But the story progressed into something bizarre. The reactions of people are somewhat too irrational to say the least. Also, the story quickly buried all the loose ends, making everything look professional. The one thing in this film keeps the same pattern and that's a strong religious background.Story end...makes a solid and proud statement. Go watch it.",6,1,4,21 May 2010
I Am Legend," Will is alone and so is this story
","Movie even though it is an action type, doesn't seem that way. After watching it, I can say that all the action is nullified by the amount of Will's time to get into a character. Zombies weren't that great, also. Story is almost generic. The type you'd see on a cereal box, or a cheap comic. Also very poorly executed. Maybe Will feels like a legend, but the movie script sure doesn't sound nor look like one. But I recommend you to see it, because it will give you inspiration for your own movie script, because this one is full of plot holes the size of football stadium.Skip it if you can, story is badly told.",3,4,4,7 May 2010
Thor," Thorld
","This movie is an epic waste of time.After so many repeating sequences of 'Assguard space shooting elevator', I almost walked away in the very middle of the movie. The story, if it were simpler, wouldn't even be considered as a comic book, let alone a movie. Thor and his brother Loki were ridiculous. The costumes are just a reminder of how USA's finest comic fans like to dress up during comicon, which is what this movie is filled with. Lets add some more comment on the story... Odin played by Anthony Hopkins, casts his son on Earth, cursing his hammer weapon so none worthy could use it. Thor meets geeky girl played by Natalie Portman, while his brother Loki discovers he was adopted child of a Frost giant. Somehow marvel superheroes and agencies are being mentioned like S.H.I.E.L.D and Stark (Irony man). This is a highly commercial movie that offers just a few thrills (mostly CGI) and very little real stunt stuff. Thor just waves his hammer and is able to create a tornado, but it all looks too silly and stupid. No nudity scenes made me blush and I felt like I ended up in an awkward situation thinking Natalie would show off herself. Boy was I wrong... All in all, you need to be hammered real hard either in the head or the other way, to even like this movie.",Null,1,2,18 September 2011
1408," Creepy psychological thriller
","Movie is insane. Starts with a lead character who writes reviews of weekend ghostly places, where people go to see a ghost and pay for a night (tourism at its best). He is also a writer, but a lousy one. Troubled character checks in at this hotel in New York, in a specifically destined place called 'room 1408'. Hotel manager is not eager with it and tries his best to get rid of him, but the curious protagonist enters the room, in the end. The room itself is antagonist. No other explanation about it. Those two fight till the very end of the movie. The state of the main mans mind is crushed. Also religious background here is that the leading character doesn't believe in ghosts. Major problem right there, because 1408 is possessed and he objects it totally. Not much story after that. If you love psychological movies with the whole room being evil and occasional Triangle movie moments. Then this is it!",8,0,0,21 May 2010
