The Blair Witch Project," Horror at its best!
","I thought the Blair Witch was one of the most freshest and original horror movies every done.  This just proves that less can definitely be more.  Its good to use your imagination for a change, instead of the unnecessary blood and gore being thrown at you on the big screen.  The cinematography, acting skills, as well as the original screen play has convinced me that the cliche horror flicks ie; stalker with mask; chops up beer drinking, sex crazed teenagers; virgin survives; awful sequel follows; days are finally over.",Null,1,3,23 August 1999
Pitch Black," Not worth 7 bucks.
","Predictable plot, unexplained characters, below par acting and corny writing.  This pretty much sums up the movie. The only good that came out of it was the set designs, cinematography, and special effects.  Vin Diesel performance as Riddick did try to breathe life into the movie, but one person can only do so much. If you are a Sci-Fi movie buff and loved Aliens, please avoid this movie.  It totally pales in comparison.  This film should have stayed in the dark!",Null,0,0,28 February 2000
American Beauty," Good movie, but was it THAT great?
","I purposely waited to see this movie after all the ranting and raving died down.  To my surprise, this movie did not live up those expectations.  Don't get me wrong, the movie did have good performances by the leading cast, especially to the likes of Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. But beyond that it was just an ordinary movie in the life a modeled suburban American family where things goes from bad to worst. Nothing stands out in this movie as an Oscar contender nor does it seems worthy of a Golden Globe crown.  Overall good movie, but not worth all the hype.",Null,0,0,6 March 2000
From Hell," Good adaptation
","Felt the movie was a great representation of the novel.  Very stylistic piece and very enjoyable to watch.  A classic thriller to say the least. And I too saw it at the Toronto Movie Festival, hence why I can comment on it before you :PMake sure you check it out!",Null,0,1,8 October 2001
Pulp Fiction," 'Royale Wit' Cheese'
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It proves that good acting, writing, editing, and a kick-ass soundtrack are the perfect ingredients to make a superb and refreshing film.  Its just one of those films you can watch over and over and never get bored with it. From the memorable dialogue to the unique and impressionable characters; this movie has it all.  If you love a movie that energizes all of your senses, then check this one out.  This truly is American film making at its finest.",10,0,0,26 January 2000
