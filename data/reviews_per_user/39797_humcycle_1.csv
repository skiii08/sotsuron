Scarface," Doesn't get any better than this.....
","DePalma's 1983 version of Scarface,is without a doubt, one of the top three gangster pics of all time (Godfather + Goodfellas would have to be the two others),and one of the 10 best movies ever made. I've seen thousands of movies, and this one has held up ever since my first viewing in'83, and the hundred+ more viewings over the years. Pacino gives the performance of a lifetime, his best ever in my opinion. This guy was BORN to play Tony Montana. Filled with memorable line after line, memorable scene after scene, it has all the making of a true classic.Sure, it's over the top, but I wouldn't want it any other way.Don't agree? 'Why don't you try sticking your head up your a**? - see if it fits!'",10,0,1,10 January 2007
