Million Dollar Arm," A simple feel good one time watch flick...
","I liked it about the Indian visualization but I feel they have put down the culture of India.They have made many scenes which shows them superior.India is a developing country and I believe It will come to the top of the Nations in the very near Future.OK,In my personal opinion the movie has bits of good direction by Craig Gillespie and a clean script by Tom McCarthy.Performances by the lead actors especially Jon Hamm is appreciable.Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal has done well.Special Mention of Pitobash Tripathy for creating bits of Humour and some feel good moments.Lake Bell,even If she does not have much to do,does it pretty well.Happy and proud hear A R Rahman's songs in an English Movie especially the End credits has a Tamil Song.Cinematography has been handled well.I love the Taj Mahal.Over All It's a Feel Good One Time watch movie....",7,0,0,11 October 2014
