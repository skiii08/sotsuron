The Blair Witch Project," Generation Xers head into woods; we view excellent results
","I saw this film last night, LONG after all the hype and reviews were made about it. I settled in with the right mood for any film: no expectations. If you expect too much, you may be let down (take note for any Kubrick film). I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. 'The Blair Witch Project' is one darn good movie.Many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length, its amateurish photography/editing, and its lack of adequate acting. I feel these things MADE THE MOVIE. First, the film has to be at most ninety minutes long: any more, and it would be too long and boring. Second, the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods, listening to the rippling water of the creek, snapping branches under their boots, and hearing things go bump in the night. I greatly admire the use of two video cameras (one black-and-white, the other color) to denote which character is shooting the film. Lastly, the incessant screaming of whiny Heather, the constant complaining of average-joe Mike, and the Dudley-Do-Rightness of Josh make for great acting. Yes, these are regular people and up-and-coming actors from your local community theater, but YOU KNOW THEM. You've met people like them.The biggest complaint, however, comes from the film's supposed 'lack' of scary moments. This film reminds me of the classic horror film 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,' and though not as gory and as shocking as that film, 'The Blair Witch Project' shows just enough fright in the group's search for a way out of the woods, stalked by people and/or things they may never understand. In the older film, the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long; it is even longer here, but the suspense/fright (just as in the older film) begins right from the opening credits: you just don't see it until the film's over. These are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcorders--these are REAL PEOPLE. And GREAT ACTORS. Heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her. Her screams sound real, her cries are genuine, and she is DEEPLY DEEPLY sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary.I really dig the beginning. It seems so real to me I may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia. Heather and Josh pick up Mike, then go to the store for supplies. This opening sequence really packs a punch. These are three Generation Xers out for a camping trip. We all know what happens to them, but we're glued to the screen, intent to know what actually happens.The interviews give us some detail into the Blair Witch legend, but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don't listen. This is wrong. Listening is good. The interviews, which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way, are like movie reviews: the critics tell you what they saw, but mostly they don't want to ruin it for you...unless they hated it.And that's what I'll do. I won't ruin it for you. 8/10.",8,267,406,17 July 2000
Meet the Parents," Amusing...somewhat
","Ben Stiller stars in director Jay Roach's MEET THE PARENTS, a somewhat amusing farce about a male nurse named (yes) Greg Focker, who travels with his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to her family home, not only because of Pam's sister's impending nuptials, but also because it will give Greg a chance to meet her parents and ask her father for Pam's hand in marriage. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, an onscreen couple you thought you'd never see, are absolutely believable as Pam's folks, especially in their first scene with the younger couple. Unfortunately, this is perhaps the film that has made De Niro into a comedic rather than dramatic actor (THE KING OF COMEDY wasn't meant to be completely amusing), and you'll begin to miss the Bobby of old (TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, even the action-packed RONIN).I'll admit that I enjoyed this film, but only in a few scenes. Greg's scene with the female ticket agent on the airplane was memorable, as were the scenes where Jack (De Niro), apparently ex-CIA, hooks Greg up to the lie detector, and where Greg does too much to impress the others during a game of water volleyball.What I did love about the film were its subtle touches, especially in the way Greg is treated, because it's happened to me--it's happened to a lot of us. Ever say something that causes other people to look at you and go, 'What the heck are you talking about?' It's happened to me several times, and it happens to Greg. A lot. That's where the amusement in MEET THE PARENTS lies, and I hope that MEET THE FOCKERS, a sequel due out next year, keeps some of that. 7/10Side issue: the film is apparently based on an earlier (independent) film by screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke. I just hope this film (the 2000 version) wasn't made just to make more $$$ on an older, funnier film. It'd sound too much like a remake that way. Personally, I wouldn't want to see CLERKS remade with hot young stars instead of the New Jersey slackers we grew to love.",7,1,1,6 April 2002
Fight Club," This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time...
","Great book, great film--I prefer the film. Not only does it improve on several aspects of the book, but it is also visually stunning. It's like '2001' without outer space. The 'outer space' we see are in the head of the narrator: his vision of the metropolis in which he lives, the night life, the dark exteriors of bars, the bright headlights on the highway, etc.What is the first rule of Fight Club? 'Don't talk about Fight Club.' What is the second rule of Fight Club? 'Don't talk about Fight Club.' The first two rules of Fight Club are the same--remember the first two rules. The major plot twist (people who have seen the film or have read the book know what I'm talking about) makes 'Fight Club' an original, instant cult classic, right up there with 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Night of the Living Dead', and other cult classics. Many who have seen the film don't follow the rules. If you have seen the film, keep your mouth shut when people who haven't seen it (and who want to see it) are around. Don't ruin this great film for them.But there is more to 'Fight Club'. It is a satire on life in the present day. It comments on consumerism and who we conceive ourselves to be. 'This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.' Tyler says he doesn't want to die without any scars, well, neither do I. 'Fight Club' tells us to make an impact on our lives, on today's society, on the future's society. Hopefully, though, we'll learn to make an impact beneficial to everyone. 'Fight Club' beats out 'Eyes Wide Shut' as my favorite movie of 1999, even though Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director.",10,0,1,24 November 1999
The Shining," Kubrick's Kafkaesque style of writing makes 'The Shining' a perfect horror film.
","In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick discussed Kafka's writing style--to him, Kafka's stories are 'fantastic and allegorical, but his writing is simple and straightforward, almost journalistic.' Kubrick didn't hesitate to point out that all the films that have been made of Kafka's work 'seem to have ignored this completely, making everything look as weird and dreamlike as possible.' Kubrick made a note of this in his film 'The Shining.''The Shining' seems to be the simple story of a family of three watching over a large mountain resort hotel over the winter. However, it's more than that--it's a horror story dealing with the supernatural and the fantastic, elements Kubrick felt make up the 'golden age of the 20th century.' The film depicts life in the Torrance household as quiet and ordinary, with Jack as the aggressor in any arguments that may occur. Kubrick's adaptation of the novel by Stephen King (a clever but unserious work) is both satiric and serious, bringing about elements of the unconscious in scenes where Jack, Danny, and Halloran all have 'shinings,' or visions. Kubrick brings his blend of surrealism to the screen when he makes the world of the unconscious real, making schizophrenia in Jack's mind the focus of the film. The film itself starts out as a sort of brochure for the Overlook Hotel, told simply, yet with underlying tones of madness especially in the voices of Jack and Danny. And in this story, Jack's madness erupts without a glimmer of special effects or makeup, simply through Jack Nicholson's excellent performance.Surreal visions occur early in the film; we see Danny's shining of the elevator gushing out blood, an artery bursting in the Hotel body. Jack's mind is at first normal, real, during the interview with Ullman and during Closing Day. We watch him as he suffers writing block--sleeping in, messing around with his typewriter (or not), bashing the tennis ball against the wall, etc. This is all told very simply but with a tone of surrealism, as the hotel slowly takes over Jack's mind. His talk with Lloyd seems real, just two guys having a conversation, only the character of Lloyd is not real, but a figment of Jack's imagination. We the audience then feel that everything we see is all in Jack's mind, that what we're watching onscreen is the mental breakdown of a failed and embittered writer. Only when Delbert Grady frees Jack from the freezer, and apparitions appear in full form to the rest of the Torrance family, do we realize that the film has been a horror story after all, completely with ghosts and blood and suspense. This is Kubrick's style, in the spirit of Kafka--writing simple and straightforward yet with something deeper we may not initially see.",9,1,2,25 May 2000
Rudy," Inspiring film.
","'Rudy' is an inspiring film. Rudy not only had to make the football team, he also had to get good grades so he could transfer to the University of Notre Dame in the first place. Great performances from the major actors. Also, great relationship theme between Rudy and his two major friends, the big D-Bob (Jon Favreau of 'Swingers') and the black Fortune (Charles S. Dutton).",7,2,4,24 November 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Journey Beyond the Stars
","2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is one of the most exploratory and daring science fiction films ever made and one of the best overall films made in the latter part of the 20th century. The combined vision of Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, basing the screenplay on Clarke's novel, created a visual and aural masterpiece closer to realism than any science fiction film that preceded it. The film was released in 1968, at a time of political and social upheaval: while the Apollo space program headed closer and closer to the moon, young men were being drafted into Vietnam and the voices of college students around the country began to be heard.2001 was (and perhaps always will be) unlike any other science fiction film. It begins with a rendition of Richard Strauss' `Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)' slowly building up as the opening credits appear during a lunar eclipse (as each sphere overshadows the one preceding it). For the next seventeen or so minutes, we are introduced to `The Dawn of Man.' A group of apes struggle to survive in a rough African landscape. (It should be noted that humans portray these apes, so realistically that it seems like we are watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel.) The apes live in a waterhole; the only source of water for miles, the waterhole is the apes' paradise. This then becomes the locale for conflict between two groups of apes. The main ape (called `Moon-Watcher' in the novel) unleashes his `discovery' (bone as weapon) on a member of the other group. Soon we are introduced to the monolith, a mysterious huge black rectangular slab that will serve as a link between the four parts of the film.In one of the most famous jump cuts in cinema history, Moon-Watcher hurls the bone into the air; it rises and turns slowly, transforming into a bone-shaped satellite. This sudden evolution, from ape to man, will remind us of the bone, and will introduce us to the next `discovery' of man: technology. Like the bone, the satellite is both a tool and a weapon; the data collected by satellites can easily be used for destructive purposes.In the second part of the film, `4 Million Years Later,' we meet the first `actor' in William Sylvester, who portrays an intentionally bland Dr. Heywood Floyd. Floyd is more politician than scientist, as he dismisses rumors (brought up by Russian scientists) of an epidemic outbreak at the lunar Clavius Base. This part of the film portrays lengthy scenes of Floyd's ship docking, first at the wheel-shaped space station, then on the lunar surface. Within, life is made up of politicians and scientists within white walls, mechanical doors, and bright lights. Outer space, meanwhile, is silent and black. And breathtakingly beautiful. The lifelessness of the human characters in 2001 is intentional, because WHAT WE SEE is the true star of the film. In the  `Jupiter Mission-18 Months Later' sequence of the film, we meet the bone-shaped spaceship Discovery, a representation of man's achievements in technology; two astronauts, Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), both of whom man the ship while the other three astronauts are in hibernation; and perhaps one of the most memorable characters in film, the HAL 9000 supercomputer (voiced by Douglas Rain), a living computer (to us, a red glassy eye) that has the ability to think on its own, and thus can make its own decisions. The Discovery depicts man's life in outer space, more so than the second part of the film: a place for exercise (Frank jogging), leisure (Frank playing chess, Dave drawing sketches), and research (the various work the astronauts do on the ship). HAL 9000 can be both a tool (serving as the protector of Discovery) and a weapon (eliminating those interfering with the mission, which we will soon discover). The film offers a lot of emotion in the character of HAL 9000. HAL is the central character of this part of the film. As a computer, he cannot repress his emotions for the sake of the mission (as Dave and Frank do, having been trained in the space program). Only when a vital component of the communication system seems to fail does HAL discover his own imperfection, and the mission is ultimately jeopardized. A revelation into the purpose of the Jupiter mission (and a revelation into the purpose of the monolith) leads us to one of the most stunning, fascinating sequences caught on film, as Dave descends from the spaceship Discovery and enters Jupiter's atmosphere in the final part of the film, `Jupiter-And Beyond the Infinite.'2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can be a major disappointment, especially now that we have reached it but are not traveling to the moon during summer vacation. Clarke used the year not because he felt we would be excavating monoliths on the moon by the year 2001, but because it's symbolic, it IS the year of the new millennium, the year that will continue for us the life begun in evolution. We will one day realize the effects of 2001 the film, and when that occurs, life to us would seem very ordinary.",10,1,2,1 January 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Cult classic.
","'A Clockwork Orange' can be the scariest film you've ever seen, because one day our society may end up like the one seen in the film--a place where ordinary people are afraid to walk outside even in the daytime, where innocent young women can be taken from the streets and raped, where the government itself doesn't seem the perfect solution. Sound familiar? Perhaps in twenty years, you'll be staring into the blue eyes of Alex while he asks you in his Nadsat slang if you value your life.Possibly Stanley Kubrick's best film after '2001'--but who can put Kubrick's films into any particular ranking when they're all so excellent? 'A Clockwork Orange' is not a 'cool' film in any sense. It's not sick or offensive or bad. It's a social commentary on life, and the book on which the film is based is even better--though the film is perfect because of its visual look of the near future. 'A Clockwork Orange' is already a cult classic--and future generations will watch it and hopefully learn from it.",10,1,2,24 November 1999
