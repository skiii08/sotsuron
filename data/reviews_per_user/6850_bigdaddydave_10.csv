The Blair Witch Project," fantastic for those with imaginations
","(Spoilers)I really cant stand the opinion that this film is 'boring' or 'not scary' However, I have a theory on this.Everyone is familiar with the way films are now so ingrained in the public imagination that 'film conventions' now provide basis for our reality, as opposed to reality.  Examples including space ship 'explosions' that would, in fact, be silent implosions.
The same is true of horror, people think to now be scared you must JUMP and have some tangible monster.  This film completely goes against every corny horror film convention.  It is the anti-horror film (though not a parody)The genius of the film is that people are scared of walking through woods alone at night, and you don't know why.  So this film relates it to your fears and then places you in the middle, its all consuming, and you definitely feel you are there.Another criticism is of the 'whiney girl' and the 2 students arguing. This was probably the most clever aspect.  The fact is people are scared of the unknown, and after the third night visit they know they are going to die, but heather only admits this 5 minutes before the end of the film.  They try to suppress   their emotions (as real people would) and tensions fray. This is also the only film I have ever seen where I could truly believe the actors were tired hungry and scared.I always argue with my friends about this film, , mainly about the action taken.  'I would follow the river and run' Would you?  Run alone through the woods? I wouldn't.  'i wouldn't go in the house'  so you would leave josh? who is still alive?To summarise the film is scary genius, its simple tool is making it real to me, and every other imaginative person.  Do you like special effects and crap films? MATRIX! do you like something different, and terrifying? Blair Witch it is.I could have made this, so could you.  We didn't, I'm glad they did.",9,1,2,22 October 2002
Requiem for a Dream," powerful
","'did you rnjoy that film?' 'it was ok.' 'did it make you feel.....' '....like i wanted to kill myself. yeah'Conversation with my friend after this film.Such strong imagery, such a well developed story.  Its strange, but it reminded me of lawrence of arabia, so much beauty in the shots, so much gets said without being spoken.I know the film isnt 'accurate' but that doesnt stop it from bringing you down, depression just comes over you as you watch the charecters fall into despair.  A very effective piece of visual story telling.great film.",Null,0,0,10 February 2003
50 First Dates," watch a great film about a day repeated: Groundhog Day
","This movie suffers from a bad case of ACS (American Comedy Syndrome) where the writers are too scared to create a straight comedy, but have to insert a load if sentimental pap. But it's a ROMANTIC comedy I here you cry! Well, if the film didn't intersperse random gross out humour into the proceedings you may have a point.There is of course the obligatory gay character, oh how we laugh at a German saying he loves sausage! Oh a giant walrus is sick, how hilarious! She is beating someone with a bat! Will my sides remain together!?I will forgive a lot in comedy films as long as they are funny, this isn't (with the exception of scenes involving Sandler's Hawaiian friend)It struck me how similar in concept this film was to Groundhog Day, but whilst the former was a well told story with an ultimately profound message, this is just a B grade RomCom that fails the ultimate test (being funny).",Null,0,0,27 September 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," awesome
","How many films can you watch more than once a year and still enjoy?  Or a month, or a week.  I honestly belive you could watch terminator:2 BACK TO BACK and still enjoy it just as much, it is unbelievably fantastic.I feel the main reason for it is this is an action film with a story that is intelligent, the interworking of the first film is fantastic.  But at the same time it never takes its self too seriously, and has some darkly comic moments, which go un-matched.  Examples:  The knife through whining husband, 'chill out, dick wad' 0.0 casualties!!  It goes on and on!!I see people ragging on the secial effects, and i think that is the most rediculous thing i have ever heard.  If you want special effects replacing fun, waste money going to see some crappy over hyped film like the MATRIX(truely awful) if you want to see a story enhanced through visual aids, whilst never replacing story or action, T2 is your film.In fact, dont read this.  Go out and buy T2, now.  If you die without seeing this, i pity you.",Null,1,1,6 September 2002
American History X," over rated
","I cant believe this film ranks so high on IMDB top 250!Its just too easy, the director thought 'racism = bad.  Will get character who is racist (bad) and make him change his ways (good) it shall thus be labeled a 'fantastic performance'.All the black characters are portrayed as Saints, who are hard done by. This is an insult to the intelligence of the audience.  Are we really supposed to believe that someone who is so engrained with hate as Norton could change his whole out-look on society in 1 year, no I think not.Other problems include an over dramatic ending, and just the way i could tell this film was designed to 'push the right buttons' in just the same way as any bond film, or arnie flick.An issue that needs to be examined with real intelligence, not by this film.",Null,1,2,5 January 2003
28 Days Later...," very very good
","~little spoilers~This is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time!  I absolutely LOVED the shots of empty London, probably most Americans wont get just how fantastically difficult these must have been to engineer, but they truly do set an uneasy tone.The zombies are good as well, nice and fast and silent!  Pretty much like someone had gone `these zombie things are ok, but how could we make em' better!'If you like this film you may be interested in reading a book called `Z for Zacariah' its s similar idea, done differently.  I get the feeling a lot of these comments criticising the film for copying others before, is less criticism and more people showing off about there film knowledge.  Whatever floats your boat!I liked it all, except, perhaps, the end 10 minutes.  After the point where she could have killed the leading man.  I  REALLY would have liked to have seen her kill him, as he was infected.  Then become infected herself.   The last shot of the film should have been the little girl cowering in the back room with everyone closing in.However, as my girlfriend pointed out, I was the only one that would have liked this, so well done Danny Boyle for making something good at the cinema!",Null,0,0,6 November 2002
Saw," Good, not perfect
","Let's keep it short.Playing like a cross between '7' and 'the Cube' saw is a horror/thriller.The film is flawed, some of the acting is a little poor and some of the logic is strange but I really enjoyed it. It had some fresh ideas and was had a great atmosphere and some genuine intelligence, the best example of this was the reverse bear-trap scene.It also contained a nice ending.I would rather watch a film that excelled in some areas and was weak in others, than a mediocre on all counts pre-packaged piece of Hollywood dross.Give it a try, I'm sure it will have more of a lasting affect than Shark Tale.",Null,0,0,10 October 2004
A Clockwork Orange," a film with depth
","A great film, its probably the only film i couldnt make my mind up on immediately after seeing.  Im not in to hard-core analysis, but this film gets you thinking in a big way.In one way the film is itself (violence deemed too bad for society, so artificially censored) true of both film plot, and film.  Maybe this was the plan, when we debate whether the film is too violent, we are also debating the film plot.Clever stuff indeed.This film also seems to have somthing that gives an unusually high number of intelligent comments, be they praise of criticism.  There is a lot to this film, but thats not to say you will like it.",Null,1,2,31 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," may tricks
","I am not a fan of he first matrix.It seems to me like everyones cristicisms of this film are the same as my criticisms of the first film.  Namely the whole flawed concepts and bad acting.when special effects are used to sell a film, they move from part of the plot to a simple 'trick'.  This film is a bunch of tricks, put together not very well.I hate the geek culture.",Null,0,0,28 May 2003
The Matrix," unanswered questions?
","i must admit i don't have the love of this that many people i know do.Keanu is not cool, i'm sorry.  WHY is he exactly so much smarter than everyone else?  It IS a geek film, its all about computers and the like, but to make it cool they use bullet time and such.  Just never worked for me.I found the 'deja vu is the matrix going wrong speech' hillarious, many think it was clever.Over rated by a far.",Null,0,1,12 March 2003
