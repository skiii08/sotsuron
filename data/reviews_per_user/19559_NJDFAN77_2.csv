The Blair Witch Project," This was a pretty good movie although it was not scary
","The Blair Witch Project was an excellent movie considering the circumstances (low budget).  What worked best was the idea of not having a script- it encouraged originality from the actors and made their emotions appear realistic. The movie was not as scary as I had expected but the feeling was eerie.  This is a must see movie because the plot is interesting but if you want to be scared out of your wits, this is not the movie for you.",Null,0,1,27 August 1999
Happy Gilmore," My favorite movie ever- by far the best
","This movie ruled.  That is all I have to say.  Oh yeah- watch it, buy it, support it.  A classic movie.  Not one to be missed. 10Should have been given movie of the century consideration.",10,1,1,21 January 2000
