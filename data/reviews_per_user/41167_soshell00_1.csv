50 First Dates," frickin cool
","this movie really got to me in a good way it was funny and very sweet adam sandler and drew barrymore mesh so well in this film you start wondering why they're not together in real life. i loved the music (some of which reminded me a lot of the wedding singer) but the overall feel of the move was a good one. I'm not a critic, not by any means, so if you watch movies and tend to pick on them for every little thing, just go live under a rock. but if you go to see 50 first dates, believe me, u won't regret it. you'll come out feeling good. i give it a 10",10,0,0,22 June 2004
