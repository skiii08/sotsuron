The New World," Visually stunning, historically inaccurate
","While the scenery was stunning and the story was palatable enough my worst fears were confirmed - the writers and producers of this picture decided to put a romantic spin on Smith's relationship with Pocahontas. This aspect (as well as one or two others) are not true to history - Pocahontas was 12 years old when she met John Smith and they did not have a romantic relationship. I felt that this film was not that easy to digest until after John Smith had left for England - and not because of Colin Farrell's portrayal of him (which was excellent)but because once the farce of Smith and Pocahontas' relationship was out of the picture things became a whole lot more accurate and subsequently more enjoyable. This said, The New World is far more accurate than Disney's Pocahontas, although I enjoyed Disney's film more than this one.",4,1,4,25 March 2006
