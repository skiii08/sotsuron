The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Powerful, honest, and pure... you will be blown away!
","The longer this movie goes on, the more you are drawn into the characters. I have never felt something so strong from a movie before. It was fun, awkward, exhilarating, dark at times, and completely overwhelming. The main character Charlie(Logan Lerman) is shy, but completely likable. Even though the film is sometimes awkward, it works and flows seamlessly into the next part of the film. Charlie is very articulate and a phenomenal actor. Same goes for Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. I have not read the book, but I felt they played their parts perfectly. The dynamic friendship between Charlie, Patrick, and Sam was pure. I just watched it, and am considering watching it again. If you think this movie deserves anything less than a 9, you are out of your mind.*** Note I have never reviewed a movie before, and do not think I have seen another that deserves a 10/10.***",10,1,2,31 March 2013
