The King's Speech," Excellent.
",I didn't expect to like this film due to the genre but I enjoyed it all the way through and it had some funny moments even if they weren't to be :). Colin Firth does an incredible job with this character and his Oscar was well deserved!,8,0,0,29 January 2018
Baby Driver," A must see film!
","Baby Driver is without doubt the best film of the year so far. An amazing soundtrack in which some of the songs I had never heard of, made the car chases incredible to watch. Edgar Wright has done a brilliant job with this film, well worth a watch!",9,5,11,25 August 2017
The Imitation Game," Not 100% accurate, but a brilliant representation of Alan Turing's life.
","After watching The Kings Speech I grew more interested in watching wartime/period dramas, this one was excellent. Yes it may not be 100% accurate but it is still a great film with a gripping story-line. Knightley and Cumberbatch have done a fantastic job with this film. Strong 8/10",8,0,0,15 March 2018
50_50," One of the Best!
","This is undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all time, it has a perfect balance of comedy, drama and romance and has some really funny moments but is also quite sad.",9,0,0,29 January 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," A Brilliant Sequel!
","A brilliant sequel to the first film, again with lots of action and badass fight scenes. This film may have been almost better than the first one!",8,13,26,29 January 2018
The Island," One of the best Michael Bay films!
","I enjoyed this film from start to end, a nice amount of action a long with a strong story-line. I really liked Ewan Mcgregor's character and I thought Ewan played him Marvelously!Very underrated, definitely deserves to be at least a 7.5. The only thing that spoils the movie is the product endorsements but still a great film!",8,1,1,25 August 2017
