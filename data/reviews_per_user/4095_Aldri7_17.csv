The King's Speech," needed more
","The King's Speech was nicely photographed and gave us some insights into the period leading up to World War II. But the story was too narrowly focused on its principle subject and could have really benefited from a sub plot or diversion to give us some contrast and more historical insight. So yeah, it was a bit boring. Predicably the movie begins with a badly given speech and ends with (oh sorry, I guess this might be a spoiler here) a well given speech. Is this a spoiler? Ha! Anyone could have predicted that, so I don't see how it could be! But anyway, worth a look but pretty much what you get is what you would expect to get. Don't look for any surprises.",6,16,29,6 February 2011
The New World," what was the point?
","I can't vouch for the historical accuracy or inaccuracy of this movie, only the entertainment value. For me, historical information if it is presented well is entertainment. Documentaries are entertainment. This movie was not entertainment. Pocohantus was very beautiful in an mysterious, exotic sort of way, but having the camera spend so much time focused on her was like saying 'look, I have nothing much to say here so just stare at her instead'. Which I did, but like all eye candy, there is no nutritional value. Yet I wanted nutritional value with my movie. This proved exceedingly hard for another reason - the settler's dialogue almost needed subtitles as badly as the Indian's dialogue. I could barely make out what they were saying at times. Meanwhile, Capt Smith mutters when he speaks at all, apparently as mesmerized into muteness by Pocohantus as much as I was.I didn't stick around until the end as it was getting late. I do think that there was a germ of a statement trying to get expressed in this movie, trying to get out. Something about how supposedly 'primitive' savages are really far more advanced in many ways than supposedly 'civilized' settlers. It would have been nice to see this theme developed with real historical insights, but unfortunately the director was too captivated with Pocohantus and the love story to allow much time for that.",4,1,4,17 April 2006
The Polar Express," a little like the Wizard of Oz
","Going to see The Polar Express might be a nice way to escape any holiday blues you could be suffering from. If you don't go to movies much, you will be amazed at how far computer animation has progressed. During a good portion of the movie, I sat mesmerized by all the life like snow, animals, machinery and, of course, characters, all of whom, except Santa himself, appeared as one would expect for a movie of this genre. Otherwise, expect a rather weak story with predictable dialogue and a pretty heavy dose of morality thrown in just in case you were contemplating being a bad boy or girl this season.A trip to the north pole, heh? Substitute 'Oz' for 'the North Pole' , and 'The Wizard' for 'Santa' and what have you got? No, on second thoughts, don't even try to compare this movie to the Wizard of Oz, which was far more entertaining in every respect - story line, character development, music and last but not least -drama/suspense. (Yes, anyone who has reservations about taking their 4 year old to see 'The Polar Express' should remember how scary the Wizard of Oz was.). Anyway, I was amused when the train got to the North Pole to hear music that sounded suspiciously like the music that plays when Dorothy first arrives in Oz. Look closely and you will find many other parallels, especially towards the end of the movie. But despite the breakneck animation and train misadventures through snow and ice, Dorothy's journey down the yellow brick road was far more harrowing. All of this was made possibly by Dorothy's misdeed - killing the Wicked Witch of the East, which hung a death sentence around her neck.No death sentence hung around the neck of our hero in 'The Polar Express', though, who's only crime was not believing. And he was just one of many - who knows why the other kids were on board. I guess to me thats were the story line kind of faltered, in that it gave insufficient cause for these kids to be getting bused to the North Pole in the first place. Without that, all of the misadventures and morality lessons they encountered along the way seemed a bit contrived. Which is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie. I did, but my expectations have been lowered substantially over the years. What I regret most of all in movies these days is the way that gimmicks and high tech action have replaced real suspense and drama that develops naturally from the story line itself. I was happy not to see sea monsters snapping at the train in 'The Polar Express', so I should give the director some credit for showing restraint there. Still, the movie in my opinion needed a convincing story outside of the dream - one to lend urgency to the train ride and likewise make the return home more meaningful. With that, I would have given it two thumbs up.",Null,0,2,3 December 2004
Oblivion," some good, some bad
","'Oblivion' is one of those movies thats hard to review without writing a spoiler. I'll have to be careful...OK, lots of people have written reviews here complaining about how this movie is a rip off of so many other Sci-Fi movies like 2001: a Space Odyssey, Tron, The Matrix, Blade Runner, Wall-E, Independence Day, etc. So maybe thats the bad news. But the good news is that all of those movies were good movies, so at least here you can count on Oblivion NOT being trashy like the Alien series, etc. I mean thankfully, we have Tom Cruise, and playing a role too in which he must confront and understand his own existence almost like Bruce Willis had to do in 'The Sixth Sense'. So you will be forced to think a little bit, but it shouldn't take Sci-Fi veterans that long to get the catch. We've been down this road too many times now.Anyway, Tom plays Jack Harper, a technician entrusted with maintaining power generating equipment and drones on a post apocalyptic earth. Who he actually works for is for you to figure out. Who Jack Harper really is is also for you to figure out, as well as for Jack, who is not really all there mentally. Now, IF Jack can remember whats been wiped from his memory, and many are counting on him being able to do that, he may be able to save earth from the aliens that wrestled control of it from humanity. There is still time, but only if a secret plot intended to bring him to his senses works. Thats the story, anyway. OK, but is this enough to carry the film? Its a very lonely place where Jack works unfortunately, and we must first suffer through a pretty dull opening 45 minutes before anything really interesting happens. Here he is paired up with a beautiful assistant (Andrea Riseborough) but with virtually NO other support structure which is bizarre. So of course they make love. There seems little else to do and no one is watching anyway. But I found all of this boring and tedious. Meanwhile Jack stalks the planet like a Swat team member. Looking for what? Scavs? What are they doing there? Slowly, a plot does begin to unfold, though, and soon nothing is as you thought it was in the beginning. Meanwhile, we've got some nice but not earth shattering cinematography to enjoy, an atrocious music score to listen to, and not a whole lot in the way of dialogue from anybody thats not military-talk. Yawn........Oh, and there are these drones with those blinking red eye-lights. Eventually though, the minimalistic plot a la 2001: a Space Odyssey turns existential when a spaceship with mysterious cargo crashes and we get to scratch our heads a lot. Meanwhile, I like the flashbacks to NY and the 'oasis' which was green, but inexplicably so given the seeming absence of any other life on the planet. I kinda don't have a clue as to how the shack and all that memorabilia got there, so it was almost like a dream. Maybe it was. Maybe it wasn't real at all, but a state of mind, like an eden. Jack visits the shack early on like a man returning to his childhood. Without his memories, though, what draws him there? Some strange attraction he will eventually come to understand, I guess, and a garden of eden and rebirth it will prove to be ultimately. So, but thats about all I can reveal though, and you will have to see the movie to find out what really happens. I can tell you though that Jack does fall in love, or re-falls in love, which reacquaints him with his human side. Its a love kind of like in 'Avatar' - a dual 'love of woman/love of nature' kind of love. And of course, from there, just like in Avatar, we go right to the battle which climaxes the movie.So yeah, its a rehash - I admit it. Avatar mixed with 2001: A Space Odyssey mixed with Independence Day mixed with Wall-E, etc. I'm glad that we never got to meet any real aliens though, which turned out to be one of the interesting little twists in the story. But overall, all of that thought provoking mystery surrounding Jack and his love and his past doesn't quite make up for the fact that so much of this movie is predictable visually, musically, and technologically. Morgan Freeman gives us his usual nice performance, but otherwise, we don't get much insight into the folks that he leads. Their plight? Their pain? Not really revealed, unfortunately. And lastly, ANY movie who's main character's name is 'Jack' is going to dredge up memories of Titanic for me and WILL YOU PLEASE STOP REPEATING THAT NAME and calling it out over and over again! JACK!........JACK!........Call him Clarence and maybe you won't feel so compelled to cry out.Thank you....",6,1,3,13 May 2013
North by Northwest," fun to see again
","The greatness of North by Northwest may be measured in part by its imitators. Two of my favorite movies, both made since 1959, are 'Silver Streak' and 'The Sting'. Both were very popular movies that borrowed heavily from it. It is easy to look back now, see the scenes with Cary Grant on the train, and say ' I've seen this before'. Sure, in 'Silver Streak', which had Gene Wilder and Jill Clayburgh trading sexual innuendos across the dinner table ('I give great phone' was one line) just as Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint did. Or to watch the climactic gun battle between Robert Redford and Paul Newman in 'The Sting' and have the same reaction. Both of these movies, made in the 70's, were big hits, but how many people knew that Hitchcock deserved half the credit? As I watched this movie again (hadn't seen it for a long time), I was also struck by Martin Landau's understated but captivating performance. Based on his work in this film, he would have been just right for the part of Mr Spock in Star Trek, a role that Gene Rodenberry wanted him to take. Cool and emotionless playing next to James Mason, one can definitely see the Spock in him.",8,0,0,28 August 2006
American Beauty," way overrated
","I have seldom had as much trouble watching and liking a movie as I had with 'American Beauty'. Recently I bought the DVD due to the film's excellent reputation, then sat down with eager anticipation to watch. But about half way through, I turned it off. If the ending was brilliant, then I guess I made a mistake (and my apologies for reviewing a movie I did not watch all the way through)OK, so is this a serious, arty film, or parody? I never did figure it out. Excellent music in the beginning helped lead me to believe it was more of an arty film, and through an early scene in the gymnasium, I was doing OK. But then things started to go steadily downhill. First there is the disastrous relationship, which defies any logic, between Kevin Spacey's character and his wife. If you liked 'Raging Bull' (I didn't), this relationship is for you. Because the two are at each other's throats from the very onset of the movie, one never actually gets a chance to find out what started it all. Sure they are politically mismatched, but we are also expected to believe they are sexually mismatched as well, something that was not so easy for me to understand. But at any rate, I guess we're expected to just swallow it all and believe..Soon after, we are introduced to an odd assortment of characters, some conservative and some liberal. Its obvious who the director favors, and I have no problem with his bias as I am not as fond of cheerleaders and military men as I am of arty types either. But did we really need to get hit over the head with such crude stereotypes? Ever hear of subtlety? Now suddenly the arty film is beginning to look more like a National Lampoon parody. Not only is the cheerleader a LITTLE slutty, for example, but she is the MOST slutty cheerleader you have ever seen. I guess I'd just rather this be more implied than forced down my throat. And so it went with the other characters as well. Now I'm starting to lose interest in the movie.......but then the moment came when I suddenly realized what this movie was REALLY about - an autobiographical tale about a young filmmaker, presumably the writer or director himself, at a young age. This becomes apparent when you see how much sensitivity and depth is given to the characters Ricky Fits and Judy Burnham as their relationship progresses. Yes, it was touching at times and well done.But I guess its just not what I expected to see nor why I bought the DVD. The socio-political message of a suburban family gone berserk, of alienation, of 'normal' and 'crazy' getting reversed - this is not exactly a new theme. This has been the stuff of Hollywood in one form or another for decades, and its no wonder as it's there that all those 'crazy, alienated' creative people eventually end up. Watch any M*A*S*H episode and you will see cheerleaders and military men trashed, suburban lifestyles (Frank Burns) mocked, and sensitive (or crazy) souls deified. This is profound and new? And so since none of this surprised me or caused me think deep thoughts, I was mainly left to wonder what else the film had to offer besides good music.Maybe I just didn't wait long enough to find out, but then again I just couldn't handle all the screaming nor the 'no holds barred' approach which often made it come across more like crass parody than important film-making. And as for the glowing reviews to be found elswhere at IMDb? - I think the authors are just as deluded that they are being profound as the director of this film was.",3,1,3,8 March 2006
Wreck-It Ralph," good family fun
","Wreck-It-Ralph is a cute animated movie from Disney about a video game bad guy who decides he wants to be good. In the video game world that is created here, characters are shown to be like actors and actresses in a studio, playing roles for the benefit of their quarter carrying customers - generally preteens. Anyway, this I thought was fun. So Ralph is like an actor fed up with playing bad guy roles. Rather than wreck things, he wants to be a hero for a change. Built like the incredible Hulk, he yearns to be able to use his strength and wrecking power to do good, not bad. The plot then is built around finding a way for Ralph to be able to be this hero.The set up is engaging. Ralph find he can't really be the hero he wants to be in the game he is presently playing, so he 'walks out' and enters some other games in the same arcade. Meanwhile, we go behind the scenes to a place that looks like Grand Central Station where game characters come and go, mingle, and spend their spare time when not 'on the set' i.e. not playing their game roles. In other words, when no quarters are inserted in the machines, Ralph and other 'cast members' can be found 'backstage' like actors taking breaks. Its all kind of cute in a way. And with the set up the way it is, it also makes possible migration of characters to different games. This is where the plot takes off. Also, when game characters leave their game for whatever reason, the game is declared 'out of order' and all characters are affected (i.e. put out of work like being laid off). So, this is the world we are introduced to here, and is what makes the story function and have some logic to it.OK, so Ralph leaves his game, putting it out of commission, and searches for one where he can be a hero. His first try fails, but in his second attempt, he meets an unfortunate but engaging little girl trapped in a CandyLand type game called 'Sugar Rush' who is in need of a hero. Meanwhile, his fellow characters from 'wreck-it-Ralph' come looking for him. Also, some insect like monsters he inadvertently unleashed in his first alternate game get transported to CandyLand also where they eventually wreak havoc. So, in the end Ralph gets to be the hero he craves, saving his little girlfriend while defeating the villains, both imported and 'indigenous'.And so what we end up with here is a little morality play about good and bad and how love can change everything. You see Ralph is a big crude dude and no one loved him in 'Wreck-it- Ralph'. But in 'Sugar Rush' he is able to get a fresh start, find love, and put his wrecking power to positive use. And so eventually we learn that Ralph is a softie at heart and simply needed some love to feel good about himself. In the end, the hero's medal he craved takes a back seat to the love he found during his quest for that medal. Thats good as I didn't want him to become 'good' just because he found himself a little piece of gold to hand around his neck. It was looking that way for a while...Anyway, I am not a gamer, but you can see that throughout the movie there is much homage being played to gaming. The plot is well thought out with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. And the journey through CandyLand was fun with lots of humor thrown in as characters stumble across the sweet landscape. So, all in all, throw in some good music and visuals, and I found the whole trip entertaining.And if you remember 'The Wizard of OZ', expect to see some references and parallels to it in Ralph's journey through CandyLand. Its as though Ralph traveled to OZ in search of a wizard (King Candy) to give him a medal only to find that through love and good deeds, he earns it naturally. Same lesson - you don't get something for nothing. I think it was on purpose that we come to wonder at first if Ralph can be 'good' simply by stealing medals not belonging to him. No, he has to earn them, and eventually he does.",6,1,4,23 November 2012
2012," not very memorable
","You would think that something as cataclysmic as the end of the world would be memorable (that is if you were to somehow survive it). But I'm sorry to say 2012 is not a movie I'll be discussing for weeks and weeks with my friends and family. That is because mostly its a rehash of recent epic disaster flicks, especially 'Titanic', where the question of 'how to survive the sinking of a luxury liner' is replaced with 'how to survive the sinking of a continent'. But I better not go into any further detail without a spoiler alert here.....Anyway, the movies starts out reasonably well, and there is tension from the start. I think both the senator and Woody Harrelson's character worked quite well. There is trouble brewing beneath the earth, and only geologists and conspiracy freaks have any clue as to what is going on. Not a bad premise for a movie there, but then enter John Cusack and family to contribute the 'human element' and things start to go seriously awry. I mean, the world is coming to an end, and do we really want to spend most of the movie experiencing the pain, sadness, loss and heroism of that spectacle through the eyes of this insipid family? And is their harrowing journey to China really an act of heroism, or is it an act of narcissism? Well, its not heroic if you are only out to save yourself. Meanwhile, as city after city crumple all around them, Cusack and son are joined by a host of wealthy people from across the planet who will carry forward mankind's presence on earth. And herein lies the main problem with the movie: There is no personal story nor tragedy amid the ruins and decimated parts of the planet itself. There is only a story of escape from that, and an escape facilitated by wealth. I mean, the wealthy few were never shown to represent mankind at all. There was no formal selection process nor endorsement from the multitudes, no official send off. They just sort of snuck away, figuring no one would be around anyway to mind that they alone, through the power of their wealth, had the means to survive. So this was sort of like a 'Titanic' theme only in reverse. Imagine celebrating and cheering on those lucky Titanic passengers who managed to bribe their way onto lifeboats while leaving thousands behind to die? So, but I don't know if this movie even deserves that much analysis because it just doesn't seem like a whole lot of thought went into it, period. The special effects weren't bad with LA's destruction the hands down winner in that department. But I was actually ready for more, and would have gotten a kick out of seeing NYC go down in similar fashion. But no........we have to take care of the rich people instead, and show the world how important it is that they survive above all else. The fact that the last hour or so of the film contained almost NO scenes from the decimated and destroyed part of the earth was especially bothersome. The vast multitudes had their coffins nailed shut with barely a tear shed. Contrast that to the amount of time spent later on exploring whether or not some fat cat's poochy would be saved, and you get my point. Towards the end, I found myself flashing back to movies like 'The Towering Inferno' and 'The Poseiden Adventure' as well as 'Titanic'. In each we had wealthy people surrounded by disaster and tragedy. But only here were those involved IMHO undeserving of any support or emotional connection on my part.On occasion, though, I did feel moved while watching this spectacle, especially when there were helpless old folks on the telephone from far off places. After all, telephone calls to loved ones is something you could easily imagine taking place during such a crisis. But I did not tear up while watching the contrived and 'hearfelt' scenes later on. It could have been compelling - the survival of mankind in a cataclysm such as this is a story worth telling. That this movie succeeded in totally trivializing that experience by making it dependent upon the 'heroics' of a ten year old kid and his dad is quite a cinematic blunder.",4,2,4,25 November 2009
Good Will Hunting," somehow it works
","Good Will Hunting is an improbable film about a young man with an unbelievable IQ and gift for mathematics. Set in Boston, Mass, it deals will many issues that I found prevalent in that city when I was growing up 40 years ago. Everyone, rich or poor, wants to be 'smaaart' in Boston. No one wants to be a 'fucking moron'. So, here you have everyone's secret fantasy brought to life, especially if you are a 'southie' from the poor part of town. And that fantasy is to be able to outsmart the MIT and Harvard boys. Will Hunting does just that, and the fact that he is a janitor at esteemed MIT only serves to further illustrate the class conflicts that only his prodigious talent can penetrate and overcome. Now I think that many people watching this film did not find Will's character to be believable. But Will is first of all a Boston native and so I believe that the movie is somewhat autobiographical or at least the expression of a fantasy of his. This makes the movie work for me as he is able to be himself with all of its contradictions - angry and foul mouthed but also smart and wanting the world to know it. He embodies well the Boston I remember with all of its class tensions. Intellectuals hold a place of great respect there, but they also can be resented and envied. That resentment is what fuels Will's ambition and gives the movie a sense of believability. Could this happen in real life? - sure, but only if the gift is toned down somewhat. Yeah, but thats Hollywood and you have to expect that his talent would be trumped up a bit.Anyway, so I enjoyed this movie on many levels. In particular I loved Minnie Driver and believe that without her, things could have fallen apart very easily. I don't think her relationship with Will was awkward or forced. Smart girls often fall for less fortunate guys. This was one of the more satisfying relationships in a movie I have seen in quite a while. And Robin Williams puts in a strong performance although if you are from Boston you know he's no southie. He is, though, a little like Popeye the sailor man - still a force to be reckoned with. Did he and Will have to bond over fart humor though? Seems they could have worked on that a bit...But Good Will hunting is overall a well written, thought provoking drama that explores a lot of issues and relationships surrounding class, career ambitions, personal triumph and tragedy. No one escapes unharmed and there are no gods in the end. The fortunate are humbled, and Will can never escape his past. This is Boston. Here we end up with a compromise of sorts where several individuals from completely different backgrounds teach each other a few things about life and grow as a result. Now if you had told me the storyline before I saw the movie, I would have been dubious that it could work. But because you had two up and coming, talented individuals writing and acting from the heart, a sensitive director, some good music and nice city shots, this is a movie I would watch again for sure. Two thumbs up.",Null,0,1,6 January 2012
Lincoln," spellbinding or boring...
","While watching Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' tonight, I tried not to get too bored and so from time to time I would pinch my arm, reminding myself that this is an important, historical epic. Fidgeting slightly, I thought to myself that what I really should have done was bone up on my history BEFORE going into the theater so that I could write a though provoking review afterwards. I mean, I don't mind films like this one as long as I can approach them from the proper frame of reference. And so let me just say this to anyone interested in going to see this film: It is deep and political. You have to actually listen to the dialogue and challenge yourself to think. Otherwise, there is no point in you being in the theater.But is it worth it? Taking on that challenge? Well, the film did not succeed in stirring up a lot of emotions and feelings inside of me. I wanted to feel proud or patriotic when I left the theater, but I didn't. Scenes showing crowds celebrating after the 13th amendment passed didn't bring on the goose bumps. So, in a nutshell, all of that effort I put into listening and understanding what was going on didn't really lead to any payoff. So here's the deal...'Lincoln' is about a man, and as a story about a man it excelled on many levels. Daniel Day- lewis was exceptional in his portrayal of Lincoln with all of his shrewd political talent mixed with humble roots. He truly gave Lincoln heroic qualities and succeeded brilliantly in setting the man apart from his contemporaries. it was all there: the gentleness and kindly soft spoken manner. The humor and self depreciation. The oratorial skill, shrewd politicking and occasional fire and bombast. Simply put, Day-Lewis's Lincoln was every bit the brooding, humble, towering figure we all know and love from our history books. Well done, everyone.But unfortunately, 'Lincoln' was not so much a biography as it was a film about the passage of the 13th amendment to the constitution abolishing slavery. Pretty dry stuff, in other words, which was unfortunate. I mean, as a story, there was not a lot there. OK, you need votes. You need to wheel and deal a little bit. And of course there are other players too - some of whom are on your team, and some of whom are not. So, but If you enjoy courtroom antics, politicspeak and legal debates, perhaps this might have kept you entertained throughout most of the movie. Unfortunately, I don't that much though. And the ending is a foregone conclusion despite attempts to hype it up. The amendment passes and everyone goes home, right? So now what we have is not a stirring biography about a man but a not-so-stirring story about an historically important political victory. IMHO, that was a shame. So with that in mind, how could the movie have been improved?Well, to tell you the truth, I really don't know. The problem is that treating the slavery issue sympathetically but without any pandering, condescension nor 'bleeding heart' sentimentality is not easy. To Spielberg's credit, black's appearing in the film are given understated roles and treated with great dignity and respect. White senators on the other hand are often shown to be grimy, disreputable, tempestuous and rowdy. OK, I get the point. But still, something was missing here, and to me that was context, i.e. no one really showed us what a world with slavery was like and how it would be so much better without it. We do see scenes from the civil war, and the carnage there forms an important backdrop to what is going on in the White House. But that is somewhat divorced from the slavery issue itself. The reality went sort of like this: Slavery lead to the war which lead to the 13th amendment. But in the movie we just see the war and the 13th amendment. Tie ins to slavery are there, but they are somewhat of an abstraction. You don't FEEL the tie in in other words. I think that is my point. And without a tie in, I didn't get that feel good vibe when they counted the votes in the end. Could the movie have benefited from having a more prominent black character? Possibly, but it would have had to have been handled delicately to avoid the 'bleeding heart' problem. I guess I don't know who would have been up to the challenge here. You would think though that Spielburg would have been if anyone was. But anyway, so Lincoln is a movie that is a bit hard for me to recommend and comprehend at this point. Maybe I need to sleep on it. As a portrait of a man and a time, it often succeeds very nicely, and you will smile at the humor, the sets and choreography, and the knowledge that a master of the cinema is behind it all. But the plot revolving around the 13th amendment was static, predictable, and devoid of any real tie in to the very issue it was attempting to address. Stepping back a bit and doing a better job of relating what was going on inside the offices with what was going on in the surrounding countryside would have given the plot more meaning. I mean, I'm all for senators negotiating, debating and trading barbs, but an entire movie devoted to that can get a bit tedious.EDIT: and one final point - these days any movie about a world not of our own (Sci-Fi, fantasy, historical, etc) ought to include at least some CGI, IMHO. Show us a CGI panorama of DC, in other words. We do see fragments of the city, but you don't really get a sense of place here. Just my opinion..",6,2,7,19 December 2012
Avatar," predictable visual feast
","I finally got a chance to see Avatar today after several failed attempts due to snow, crowds, theaters only showing it in 2D etc. Below are my impressions which assume you already know the story and maybe have formed your own opinions already.First of all, I agree with everyone that complains about the lack of dialog and the predictable story. I remember when Titanic first came out and people were complaining back THEN about how insipid was the script and Jack's character, etc. Well, Jack Dawson was much better fleshed out as a character than Jake Sully! I mean, it seems our standards for dialog have dropped another notch in the past ten years. Jake is an appealing character, and I think pretty well suited to the role. He also narrates the story a bit. But he basically is not given even a moments worth of meaningful dialog (unless you consider lines like 'count me in' and 'teach me' meaningful dialog) I think they could have basically scripted him as mute as well as paraplegic, and the movie would not have had any less impact. This is remarkable when you consider the deep, personal crisis he confronts midway through the film. Oh well, we must not let anything get in the way of the visuals...Anyway, the story unfolds very quickly here, and we're not given much time to think about characters. I felt like I was being immersed in Pandora before I was really ready. Its always nice to build a little suspense and audience expectation up before going some place so fantastic. Unfortunately here, though, the wonders of Pandora were treated in a pretty matter of fact way, almost as if we were expected to already know a bit about it. I think it would have really been nice for Grace (Sigorney Weaver), the primary advocate for the planet, to show a little more excitement about her world and a little less jaded attitude. I mean, if Pandora was the star of this movie, it was not given the reverence it deserved by Grace. That reverence was reserved for the Na'vi, but their's was from a wholly different perspective, being that it was THEIR world and the only one they have ever known.But on to the main plot here - politically, what you get with Avatar is a healthy dose of left wing morality. A VERY healthy dose. Western man rapes a planet and threatens an indigenous culture in the process. THis sad tale pits a cocky soldier thug (Stephen Lang) and military industrial complex dweeb (Giovanni Ribisi) against the Navi, a noble, indigenous tribe of Indian-like people. The princess of this tribe is Neytiri who is both strong and confident as well as sexy and emotionally fragile. Her 'West Side Story' love affair with Jake, the reluctant warrior, is what adds personal triumph and tragedy to the story that already is designed to tug at your heartstrings quite a bit. You are suppose to cry for the Navi, and I imagine many did. Others undoubtedly saw this as blatant political propaganda and squirmed in their seat. But If you were in the latter category, it might have been best for you to just skip this little morality tale all together. This was not a military propaganda film. THe 'good guys' - mother nature, the Na'vi, tribal values, etc triumph in the end.Anyway, but superimposed on the main plot is Jake's personal story and his relationship with his Avatar. This I thought was fascinating and one of the movie's main draws apart from the visuals. I thought that what really facilitated Jake's conversion to the Navi lifestyle and his political about face was the thrill he got from having legs and mobility again. This theme of returning to ones childhood and/or to a more primitive state (but more robust physically) is a key to understanding the love interest and from there, the conversion Jake experiences. The 'love' Jake suddenly finds himself experiencing is really a love of nature and of his youthful, more athletic self. Disabled as he was, who would not want to return to the garden of eden and be given a second chance at life? So I enjoyed this sub plot which played a key role in bridging the fantasy and the reality, the animated and the non animated characters and bringing unity to the story. Well, I just remembered there is a limit on how much you can write in a review. So, on with the visuals. The visuals were stunning like I expected, but one does not get a good sense for the overall scale of it all. Were they traveling miles, hundreds of miles, or what? And, well, the floating mountains just kind of didn't really make much sense from a ecological point of view. So this lent more of a fantasy element to Pandora than one based solidly in science. And as for the plant and animal life, I preferred the plant life. The luminescence was kind of cool and made the Na'vi's lives seem mystical and enchanting. But the animals were crude and hostile by comparison (except for the 'horses'). And they were also not well suited for the rain forest environment either. Basically, they just stuck big, fast, aggressive game animals into a thick, wet forest, which I guess is why so many of them kept running into trees...:)So in conclusion, Avatar is a visually stunning, well made film but with a predictable, time honored love/war theme. Thankfully, the Avatar sub plot though is refreshing and breaths originality into the romance. But overall, maybe the best thing about Avatar was that it introduces us to a totally new world and teases us with the potential for some really great sci-fi movie-making. So we'll see what develops in the way of a sequel...",Null,0,1,11 January 2010
Titanic," aging well
","So much has been said about 'Titanic' , pro and con, I doubt I can add much to the discussion. I am one of those that has seen it numerous times (at least a dozen) and watching it now is a lot like putting on a comfortable old shoe. The nostalgic quality of the film was always a big draw for me anyway, and now, seeing it again brings on a sort of 'double nostalgia' i.e. a nostalgia both for the movie itself as well as for the time period in which it took place. We all know who Rose was or rather who she represented. She was the 'Miss Liberty' that appeared on all the coins of the era, and whom also was the inspiration or model for the Statue of Liberty. At the moment she proclaimed her freedom in the movie, in fact, she traded her tight corsets for the same free flowing gown worn by those early feminist icons. I think a lot of people missed that point and instead took to making negative comments about her weight, etc as though an actress with a super model bod would have done a better job of projecting that Miss Liberty persona. Anyway, the more I see the movie now, the more I love both the old Rose and the Kate Winslet Rose. Young Rose wasn't an overly strong person through much of the movie, but that to me was consistent with the types of relationships she was in. I can see some wanting a sexier Rose, while others, a stronger and more assertive one. But to me, the balance was just about right as it had to be for the movie to succeed.Otherwise, there are many other things I still marvel at while replaying this movie over and over again. For example, nine times out of ten, long movies suffer from problems related to pacing and holding the audiences attention. But Titanic's 'take it slow' approach was in my mind a stroke of genius, not a fault, and the pacing was magnificent in the first half (pre iceberg). Paradoxically for me, the second half of the movie actually contained some of the 'slowest' scenes, with 'slow' being a relative term tied to one's expectations. And then there is DiCaprio's Jack, and my only lingering regret with regards to this movie. Maybe I was wanting Matt Damon for the role. I don't know. But Jack's mix of humble roots and Paris sophistication was just too hard for me to swallow. It reminded me of how super sophisticate Hawkeye Pierce of 'M*A*S*H' was actually from.......Crabapple Cove, Maine? This is Hollywood wanting to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. Jack did have to be an artist, though, because that was central to the plot. But his humble roots was to me just a case of 'balancing the ticket' politically, so to speak, and was irrelevant otherwise. Anyway, Titanic is still a beautiful and moving film to me. Sure, I might have toned down the cheesy aspects of the romance and cast a more mature and believable Jack, but the real achievement here lies elsewhere. People use terms like 'timeless' and 'enduring' when describing movies such as this, and yes they are clichés. But when applied to a historically based film they have real meaning. Implicit is the requirement that such a film span generations and appeal to filmgoers from across the decades. Titanic accomplished this beautifully in a unique and powerful way. As serious historical epics go, I suppose this movie will never be a heavyweight. But yet it still has that power to endure in one's psyche - almost as much as the original disaster may have endured in the memories of those that experienced it first hand.",8,2,4,22 April 2008
WALL·E," wow
","Wall-e is a great movie, entertaining in every respect. I saw it by chance last week, and I was overwhelmed. Its one of those movies that everyone can enjoy - kids, grandparents, everyone. I won't go into the details here as that would probably be a waste of time. But the best part for me is how the story unfolds and how you come to understand and see what is going on without any dialog to support it. That is the beauty of this film for me - the detective work that is required on the part of the viewer in lieu of any dialog (until later on in the movie). Us human beings are naturally curious creatures just as Wall-e is. Without dialog (which in most movies these days isn't worth squat anyway), that curiosity is intensified, and I for one really enjoyed the challenge here of deciphering messages encoded in body language, etc instead of being spoon fed a predictable plot. And it wasn't a predictable plot. By the time I started seeing the fat humans careening around the space station, I began to understand what was going on, and I knew the plant carried by Eve was an important part of the story. The rest of the plot then soon fell into place (along with some dialog now). When that happened, I smiled and felt very satisfied. Cute movie. Very fast paced (almost to the point of being dizzying). There is that familiar twist sometimes where the robots come across as more human than the humans. But more than just acting like humans, Wall-E and Eve were childlike. Their muteness combined with curiosity made perfect sense then as a small child is also mute and curious. And also, just like children, their lives were full of discovery and mischief. Neither were particularly 'self-aware' meaning we do not know if they knew or understood who they really were nor what their place in the universe was. But they did understand emotions - love in particular. That ruled and the big picture - man's role in all of this as their creator and all - was not of much concern to them. So all of this I found refreshing and fun. I would really enjoy seeing this movie again. In addition to the story, we also had good music and some pretty cool visuals. And to anyone who would have rather replaced the 'too-cutsie' love story with lots of action and violence - I say 'look, pal - take your pic among the hundreds of animated, fantasy and sci-fi movies that glorify action and violence, and then tell me we can't, FOR ONCE, focus instead on love and a positive message about mans place on this planet.' Thats all I gotta say -",7,0,1,22 August 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," one thing I didn't like
","I don't disagree with the vast majority of folks that have seen this movie and found it to be excellent. But instead of chiming in with more rave comments, I'll mention the one thing I thought could have made it a better film.I think the director had a choice as to how to portray the two chief villains, the warden and the head prison guard. He could have modeled them after well known American villainous types, or he could have used a Nazi type model. He seemed to have chosen the later which I felt was unfortunate. Maybe some would disagree, but I perceived them both as Nazis as I watched the film. The Warden's steely intellectual manner reminded me more of a sadistic Nazi doctor than a bible thumping Christian. And the prison guard was very teutonic looking and handsome rather than looking like the brutish American stereotype that I would have preferred. I guess its a minor point, but given the rave reviews this movie has gotten, I felt it deserved mention. I would have been able to identify with the banker's suffering even more with more believable, American villains rather than ones that seemed calculated to evoke memories of WWII prisoner of war camps.",8,1,3,16 March 2005
Prometheus," a forgettable mess
","I hate to sound cynical, but I couldn't help thinking (as I left the theater early) that someone has gone to an awful lot of trouble to create a movie and a whole theory of evolution just so as to lay a little schlock horror - sci-fi on everyone. Prometheus is basically just that. The whole Alien series is, in fact, arguably just that. And so try as one might to find a little meaning here, to find comfort and some peace of mind about our place in the universe, I just can't. I can't get past the main 'raison d'être' or reason for the existence of this series. Its to creep you out, basically. Always has been. So prequel or no prequel, (and expect sequels to this prequel I guess) - what should one expect now and in the future? BTW, what do you get when you make a sequel of a prequel - you get the ORIGINAL MOVIE BACK! Heh heh, well maybe eventually, but of course no one would stand for that. In any case, unless someone wipes out the entire Xenomorph population, horror - sci-fi is what you are going to get, plain and simple. Slimy aliens invading human bodies, plain and simple.Which is not to say you can't TRY and elevate the bottom line here. Lord knows, they've gone to a lot of effort to do that over the years. It does help some, but in Prometheus, the story is so weak and poorly thought out, its hard to care. I've enjoyed reading about Space Jockeys and Xenomorphs and really its an elaborately thought out world. But none of this gets translated from print to movie here as the visuals take over, adding a superficial gloss to everything while smothering any depth and insight. Yeah, the visuals at times were nice, but cynical me also looked at them like they were mainly a set up, i.e. setting me up to think I was going to see a movie more akin to 2001: a Space Odyssey than a horror - sci-fi one. This kind of ticked me off, actually. I mean, I'd enjoy spending an evening contemplating our origins as 9ft tall, hairless creatures that look sort of noble and serene. Except that I can't connect spiritually to them at all not knowing anything about them other than the fact that they are careless with their bioweapons. What does this all say about our lives here on earth? Our future, our destiny? Nothing that I can tell..but do try and avoid grabbing cobra like reptiles when you see them in the future.So, but I tried to like Prometheus at the onset. I was in the mood. But there was not a kernel of quality, original filmmaking for me to grab onto. Man travels to a distant planet to investigate his species origins here on planet earth. OK, what else? They send a team of young and seemingly talentless individuals as well as some corporate types. What else? They start getting attacked by the same slimy creatures that killed off their species ancestors. Will we ever learn?? Anyway, I did notice that the blonds here were sort of the bad guys, almost like Nazi stereotypes. Why, I don't know, but Ridley Scott does like to equate teutonic looking gods and goddesses with androids. He did it in Blade Runner. But bad guys too? - I mean, what was their motive here? That was never really explained too well. Anyway, and the rest of the characters were even more forgettable. They did inexplicable, unscientific things. They behaved like amateurs. No one really seemed to have a well defined role nor credentials to back it up. Most of the time, they seemed to react to their surroundings more or less like children - prodding and poking things to see how they work, etc. And you know what, I almost found myself saying 'they deserve to get attacked by alien reptile creatures!'. As descendants of noble looking but careless 9ft humanoids, perhaps that is their fate. And is that perhaps OUR OWN fate as well someday? While others may have somehow found a deeper philosophical message in all of this, that is mostly what I left the theater concluding - that we humans are nothing more than careless, warm, oxygen breathing cavities for opportunistic slimy creatures. We are, after all, the stuff of those poor, unfortunate Space Jockeys. And that is the comforting message that I will sleep on tonight. Its not about Religion nor our exalted place in the universe. Its about victims and predators. And that man had to travel millions of miles just to find that out is really depressing. Why couldn't everyone have just stayed home and read a good novel about man's achievements here on earth instead? Thats kind of what I wished I had done tonight anyway....",3,17,33,12 June 2012
Happy Feet," penguins are cute
","Penguins are so cute and human like, it must be irresistible to want to make an animated movie about them. Ever wonder what penguins do all day long down there in the Antarctic? Just stand around like folks at a bus stop? Not anymore. Thanks to Mumble, who was practically born tapping his feet, they now dance. Why? Well, the reason is a little confusing.......Mmmm....lets see. Dancing is fun and most likely keeps the feet warm. Dancing also angers the elders, which in Hollywood is always a good thing. But besides that, I guess its just cute to an eight year old - an eight year old that can whisper in daddy's ear about how horrible it would be if something were to happen to these cute little critters. Heaven forbid! They must not be allowed to starve. After all, we need the entertainment and what other critters walk around on two feet like us, wear tuxedos and have such cute little chicks? But can cute and dancing save them all from annihiliation? Thats the million dollar question.Anyway, I didn't really feel the need for much of a plot here. I can dig two hours of great animation and scenery and music with no plot at all. I loved Winged Migration for example, a movie that came to mind during a couple of scenes. So in otherwords, others can argue about the political message and the stereotypes and all that. But I was preoccupied more with things like the poor choice of musical numbers and how I really couldn't tell any of the tall penguins apart except for Mumble. And the dancing? It really wasn't all that inspiring. So in essence, what we were left with was a movie that was basically about penguins singing and dancing, but with neither inspiring music nor inspiring dance. Oh well......nothing like going with your best punches and then missing both of them. So what memorable moments did this movie leave me with, then? What themes touched my heart? Those chicks were so cute in the beginning, I almost started to cry. And I also think that having another race of Latino penguins was a definite plus. But the love story, on the other hand, fell flat because I never bonded with any female penguin, and because Mumble did not really seem to be as interesting in attracting a mate as he was in saving his fellow penguins from starvation. And where was our hero's redemption in the end? His crowning moment of glory? It was mostly lost in a sea of gyrating penguins, who were too busy grooving to the beat to remember who to thank. We know who saved the penguins, but did the other penguins know? Overall, I'd give this effort mixed success at best. I don't think it was bad, but it missed in important areas where it should have made sure it hit the mark (music, dance). I didn't even mention the computer animation, which was very satisfying as i expected. Anyway, cute penguins are nice, but I don't know if I would have bothered to save them without more inspired song and dance.",Null,0,2,4 December 2006
Contact," some flaws
","Contact is a movie I have seen many times, and through it all, I have learned to sort of ignore all of the irritating, poorly cast male characters and focus on the big picture - the movie's positive message, the sophisticated plot and the often stunning visuals. So its always been a mixed bag for me and another case of Hollywood transforming a book into something that would probably shock the original author. Contact may have been a book written by Carl Sagan, but the movie is all Jodie Foster. And as a vehicle for Jodie, it was well conceived. But Jodie's incredibly strong on screen persona is not easy for everyone to digest. And worst of all, it tends to rubs off on everyone else that is cast to play along side of her here.Anyway, Jodie is Dr Ellie Arroway, a brilliant, lonely, obsessed and tempestuous astrophysicist. Since the death of her Dad when she was a youngster, there has been a big wormhole sized hole in her world, and she attempts to fill it by searching for life on other planets. This very personal story is then weaved together with an intergalactic one involving not only all of humankind but otherworldly beings as well when she succeeds in making first contact with aliens from the Vega star system. They want to say hello and send down a taxi (which we must build ourselves) to ferry some lucky individual to the center of the galaxy for a rendezvous with......God? Anyway, only one person gets to go, which, although it makes no sense from a practical point of view, fits well with the movie's theme which is an exploration of one woman's very personal, spiritual journey. One very bright but socially inept young woman.OK, now perhaps because those that wrote the screenplay knew that Jodie's personality would not go down easily with everyone, they actually wrote jokes about her confrontational, 'pain in the ass' style right into the script. That way you were at least told up front what to expect and it was OK - Dr Arroway is a seething mass of conflicting emotions, veiled and not so veiled hostilities, and childlike obsessions that often go beyond normal logic or reasoning. She doesn't always get along with others, particularly men, and particularly anyone that tries to control her. Instinctively, every male to her is either a loving father figure or someone just trying to jerk her around. Well, predictably, I guess, this is why all of the male's cast here are either jerks or Dads. Or sometimes both :) But does this make for enjoyable movie viewing? No, most of the time it doesn't. Not when you have actors like Tom Skerrit and James Woods cast in painfully confrontational roles and given incredibly lame scripts, playing jerks opposite Jodie. And neither does it work for me regarding Ellie's blind friend Kent, who I found irritating. But I reserve most of my scorn for Ellie's love interest, Palmer Joss (Played by Mathew McConaughey), who somehow manages to combine jerk/leering/frat boy with godlike/father/saintliness, and does it with a straight face. I mean, WTF? Who is kidding who? Well, Ellie seems to be attracted to both sides of this chameleon, though. I mean, it took lines like 'that must really chap his ass' to get her attention initially, but down the line, she also bows down to 'you could call me a man of the cloth', as if, by now balancing the ticket, she just might have found herself her perfect man? I don't know, but Palmer's White House 'Spiritual adviser' connections are ludicrous. Couldn't they have cast someone less of a hunk for this role? Someone more cerebral? Jeff Bridges, perhaps?Anyway, I no longer laugh out loud at these sillier casting perplexities, and enjoy the movie for its originality plot-wise and for the science, the mystery and the journey into space. This is where Jodie is most at home anyway, not in the social arena. And ditto myself when viewing this movie. There is much to enjoy. A cool space transporter powered by strange technology that looks like a giant atom. A message from space that must be decoded. And without writing a spoiler here, I must say there are some unexpected plot twists along the way that will entertain. But ultimately, what it comes down to is Jodie and her relationship with all of these men, both the jerks and the dad's. Jodie frets and glares at the jerks. But in the presence of the Dad's she is soft, vulnerable, feminine and childlike in awe. I kind of find this to be a little disquieting, as though she never grew up, never accepted her place in the world amongst all of her peers. Maybe her journey, though and the fulfillment of her spiritual quest will settle her down. I think that knowing that might be a relief to us film goers, anyway. Knowing that Ellie Arroway, if she were ever to resurface in a sequel, would be a little mellower and forgiving towards those of us less Godlike than dear old Dad. And then maybe the jerks would disappear too...",7,0,2,11 June 2012
