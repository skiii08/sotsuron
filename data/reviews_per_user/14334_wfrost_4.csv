Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Love it? Not me!
","I suspect this a movie you either love or hate and I'm firmly in the latter category. I love a good comedy and I'm no prude, but I can't enjoy someone making a complete ass of themselves.As Borat Sagdiyev, Sacha Baron Cohen pretends to be a native of Kazakhstan visiting the United States to marry Pamela Anderson and bring back to his people his new found knowledge of American culture. The fool as a comic device has a long tradition in theater allowwing the audience to laugh at an inferior's mistakes. It is also humorous when a clever satarist makes those he encounters who see him as ignorant are revealed as foolish themselves. The movie fails when Baron Cohen plays both the fool and the satirist acting as a fool.The journey across country in an ice cream truck is one of the few elements of wit without being offensive. Of course these days offensive sells.",1,14,29,26 April 2007
Skyfall," A Disappointment
","Those expecting the James Bond they have enjoyed in the past may be disappointed. Bond, played by Daniel Craig in his third time in the role, lacks the confidence, the swagger, skills, and tactics of the character's previous incarnations.After an ineffectual struggle with Patrice, a hit-man, Patrice, Bond is mistakenly shot by Even, another MI6 operative. Rather than undergo a thorough government sponsored therapy, he just drops out of sight. Once he returns to MI6, he must undergo tests to determine his fitness. He flunks the physical, but is reinstated to duty by M (Judi Dench).Bond's original mission was to retrieve a hard drive containing the names of every NATO agent currently operating undercover. Though this Bond is a protagonist, rather than a hero, the story has a real villain, Silva (Javier Bardem), who has the stolen hard drive. Silva appears to have almost unlimited resources and skills; his planning is so precise as to bring a subway car crashing into a tunnel where he is pursued by Bond.Silva is eventually killed by Bond and the hard drive recovered. But Bond's secondary mission -- to protect M while using her as bait to lure Silva out of hiding -- is a dismal failure. Bond takes her to his family home (Skyfall) only to see M killed and his home demolished because he greatly underestimated Silva.More human? Perhaps, but not the man I came to admire.",5,6,14,15 January 2013
Inglourious Basterds," I can't recommend it.
","Yet another fantasy WW II film in which Hitler and the high command of the German military are killed by a small group of American troops. Yet it's not really a feel-good movie like 'The Dirty Dozen' because the smarmy, sadistic SS Colonel Hans Landa never receives his due.Tarantino seldom feels the need to exercise restraint but here, at least, the killing scenes are relatively few. He has also refrained from including vampires, werewolves, and zombies.I can't fault the acting (although Pitt appeared uncomfortable with his southern accent), the music, the costumes, or the cinematography, but there is nothing here to set it above other films.",4,1,2,4 July 2013
Seabiscuit," A children's show with a PG 13 rating.
","The acting, musical score and filming are fairly high quality, but this 'feel good' film lacks sophistication.  It is a children's show with a PG 13 rating, and thirteen is about the right age for viewers.",4,2,6,2 August 2003
