10 Cloverfield Lane," Almost brilliant, but ....
","It starts off very well, and for the most part it's very well played and directed. A tense, psychological thriller about a woman who wakes up after a car crash to find herself in the doomsday bunker of a man who tells her there has been 'an attack' and the outside world is not safe. Has he saved her from death, or is there a more sinister explanation? Unfortunately, towards the end, after she escapes, the film completely changes genre and the last 15ish minutes become a ludicrous sci-fi alien invasion. Had it ended after she got out, I'd be thinking at least an 8, maybe a 9, out of 10. Sadly the ending completely ruins it.",5,1,2,6 June 2020
