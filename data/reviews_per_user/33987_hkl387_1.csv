Lucky Number Slevin," Common, stupid, over-styled copy of copies
","To sum it up: style over content *** wannabe Guy Richie style *** ridiculous wannabe Tarantino dialogs *** desperately trying to be funny *** stupid twists and plot holes *** cliché characters, cliché dialogs, cliché violence, cliché everything *** shallow and highly unrealistic *** bad acting, especially by Lucy Liu *** extremely overrated at IMDb *** So, if you have more than a minimal knowledge of movies, and have read more than 30 books, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is just another pathetic copy of pathetic copies of mediocre bulk thrillers, straining after effect in every second. This is not a movie you want to watch, this is an insult to your intellect.",2,4,11,1 May 2007
