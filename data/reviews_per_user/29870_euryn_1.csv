The Expendables 2," This film blew me away!!
","I went into this film thinking it was going to be a bit of a train-wreck. I didn't enjoy the first film as much as I was hoping and so had no real hopes for this. How wrong I was. The cast (I will spoil some major cameos so be warned) is incredible in this, each main person has good screen time and delivers crude and comical dialogue in equal fashion. The explosions and and destruction are as you would expect; incredible. The violence and gore is top notch but is not at the horror film 'bloodbath' level. Spoilers!!Chuck Norris steals the show with his brief appearances, Arnold Schwarzenegger comes a close second with puns and guns a plenty. Jean- Claude Van Damme has some impressive scenes, the best is seeing him kick a knife into the chest of his enemy. Sly Stallone is good here but it is his lack of directing here that makes the film flow a lot more than his past work.End Spoilers!! The only complaints I have would be Van Damme's character is not as good as it could have been, no background to him (but then again with an action film like this, you shouldn't expect to much). Bruce Willis also doesn't live up to my expectations. The self referential remarks throughout the film are good but do take you out of the moment. Go into this film with an open mind and you will have one hell of a ride. I was sweating by the end of the film I was having so much fun!Enjoy and rate! The Phatman",8,2,4,25 August 2012
