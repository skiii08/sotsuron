The Sound of Music," Lovable film, unlovable male lead
","I have to question this Captain von Trapp character, a retired Naval officer, who is always acting to people around him, including his own children.He lets the kids under control by hired governess (Isn't it against the law not sending them to schools?), so he has time to fool around with rich baroness, an equally pretentious character. You can imagine how he supports his huge property without working. After the new governess, Sister Maria, appears in his premises, he finds her his new target and dumps the baroness, then succeeds in winning this innocent nun's love with another performance. (Look how he acts to Maria under the moonlight in the garden)I like all those music numbers and the family's three youngest girls in the movie very much, but this Captain von Trapp is really a phony. Plummer and director Wise should take most of the responsibility.",9,6,15,22 August 2002
As Good as It Gets," As Bad As It Gets!
","Trio of star are at their worst playing irritable characters in the movie. One minute they'd be nice to each other, the next minute they'd be mad at each other without any apparent reason. The performances are exaggerated to the Nth degree.Nicholson still acts with that too-familiar sly manner, but runs out of steam this time. He's thrown out of the restaurant where Hunt works for bad behavior, but after a few scenes, he sits in there enjoying his meal again. It's either the restaurant owner or writer-director of this movie is out of his mind. Besides, do you believe a waitress can have long chats with customer without getting warned by her boss?As for the story, there're not enough events to sustain it; just full of ludicrous dialogue from irritating characters. The Oscar winners of this film should have learned how to make a better romantic comedy from 'It Happened One Night' (1934).",1,24,66,26 August 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Nagging, Inc.
","The film's advanced computer technology is certainly great to see, but Pixar artists are forgetting one thing: their characters are too talkative - almost nonstop talking from start to finish.The audiences want to see MOTION picture, especially children in non-English speaking countries. How many climaxes are there in this movie? I think only the final chase sequence is thrilling enough for most people. Cute dialogue isn't equal to good script. That's the reason I like ANTZ better than A BUG'S LIFE, and SHREK than MONSTERS, INC.I suggest Pixar filmmakers take some lessons from traditional Disney animation features. Hope to see a little improvement in their next project.",7,0,2,6 December 2002
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor, Hollywood style
","The film's amazing battle sequences are murdered by its foolish love story, which seems more like a TV commercial. If we skip the first 80 minutes of the movie, its rating would be much higher.Aside from the cliched story, the studio has to use good-looking male leads to attract female audiences. Predictably, the guy who got second billing must die so that to solve the love triangle.The most unbelievable part of the film is a pilot could take off with a nurse without permission from superior officer. Moreover, he then proceeds to screw her in their military base freely. (What are those nets for? some set decoration!) The screenwriter must have learned something from THE DEER HUNTER, because he also let two childhood pals enlist in the same squadron for plot convenience. Obviously, the director and the writer don't know anything about military service. I suppose beautiful photography and realistic special effects are much enough for them.When fighting the Japanese in the sky, our two heroes keep yelling at each other through radio. They're certainly the most talkative pilots in film history. Perhaps they were playing computer games while filming, that's why they're so excited!There is, however, a very true moment: nurses are being shot at by Japanese planes while running in the street. Would they actually shoot at women? Yes, indeed. Anyone who knows a little about how Japanese soldiers did to Chinese women during the war would firmly believe it.",5,0,1,16 December 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," One Bad Acting
","Everybody talks about the film's stunning fight scenes and fantastic music score. I have something else to say:Chen Chang, as Ziyi's barbarian lover, is totally unconvincing. His makeup can't hide his boy accent; his performance can't match up with other 3 stars; his role unnecessary; his lines become unbearably poetic after they fall in love. If the subplot involving the relationship between Ziyi and Chang were removed from the film, it wouldn't hurt the narrative a bit.Near the end of the movie, Chang is put in Wu-Dong monastery by Chow Yun-Fat to wait for Ziyi. When she arrives, they make passionate love in western style (again). I must point out it's impossible that she could stay in his room due to strict rules in the monastery.Then comes the bizarre ending as Ziyi jumps into the river from a bridge high above. Chang Chen, who stands beside her, doesn't even have any response to her suicide. He just looks at another direction like wood. Ang Lee should have had a better judgment when choosing an actor.",9,0,0,19 September 2002
Life Is Beautiful," Imaginative Nonsense
","Roberto plays a very, very nice guy. He speaks lots of supposed-to-be-funny lines, unfortunately he's the only who laughs. Roberto marries a very, very nice girl whom he adores like a princess, then they have a very, very nice boy. This Jewish family is perfect.The tearjerker formula is to throw the happy family from heaven to hell, so they're sent to Nazi's concentration camp naturally. The very nice daddy lies to his very nice son that this is only a contest game. Upon seeing those miserable prisoners wearing dirty clothes, this bright boy is still idiotic enough to believe daddy's words. The actor-director's trick is that no one in the background is allowed to say a word except himself, so the boy wouldn't hear any complaint from those poor Jewish.Everyday Roberto and other prisoners are sent to work, he simply hides the kid in their bedroom where there's no food, water, or toilet. I suppose there's no need to explain how the kid can survive to the viewer either.Though the depiction of concentration camp, built purely from Roberto's mind, is quite laughable, he claimed the movie is a fantasy about 'power of imagination.' Ironically, it ends with a voice-over saying, 'This is my true story.'The simple-minded movie is covered up by its beautiful score and fools millions of audiences, including members of Academy Award who use to think a foreign language film is definitely a great film.",3,3,7,25 September 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Empty Style, Empty Film!
","Kubrick's last film is an empty work, no matter how some critics try to complicate it.The problem of this movie is that nothing really happens. The camera follows Tom Cruise all over the places, just to show off lighting and cinematography. Everybody is moving and talking in slow motion. What a waste of time and money!",1,2,4,4 June 2002
Paths of Glory," Actor manipulator
","Stanley Kubrick tended to manipulate actor like puppet to serve his camera, that's why I never like his work very much. He had been eager to show off his mise-en-scene ability, which became more and more obsessive in his later films.Early in this over-praised movie, two generals, played by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready, has a conversation about attacking German-occupied Ant Hill. Kubrick makes them walk around in the room without any motivation, just to move the actors so that he can pan his camera to reveal the well-designed set.Later, Kirk Douglas is talking to someone on the staircase of the headquarter, Macready walks up and joins him, then they move higher while carrying on conversation, so the camera can change its angle to pick up other parts of the huge set without cutting. After their dialogue is over, Macready steps down the stairway. (Why he leads Kirk to walk up in the first place?)Not having military background, Kubrick doesn't know soldiers don't talk that way. If a general wants to talk to a colonel, he would simply yell, 'Hey, colonel, come over here!' He would never go to a subordinate officer in real life. Moving the actor up and down for no reason seems rather ludicrous.",7,2,5,31 December 2002
The Deer Hunter," Overrated Nonsense!
","I can't believe that The Deer Hunter won five Oscars, primarily because its story doesn't make any sense.First of all, I'm positive that the writers of this film don't know anything about military service. How can De Niro and his native friends get drafted in the same platoon? It's impossible that Uncle Sam would make such an arrangement for them pals.Secondly, Meryl Streep and some friends are gathered in their home town to welcome De Niro as he is returning from battlefield, but he avoids seeing them. How do they know he's coming back if De Niro hasn't phoned them earlier?Thirdly, De Niro has a hard time finding one of his comrades, John Savage, who is hospitalized and doesn't want anybody to know his miserable condition. Yet Savage has been receiving 'American money' from Christopher Walken in Vietnam. How does Walken know where he is? especially when Walken is already half-crazy at the time.You can't make a film without real experiences. This Vietnam War turkey is miles behind Oliver Stone's Platoon.",3,10,16,29 April 2002
The Producers," Terribly overrated!
","The opening title scene is a little funny, but not the rest of the movie. The performances are, especially Zero Mostel's, extremely overacted which belong to the night club, not on the screen. Mel Brooks never learns that 'less is more' in terms of film acting. His funniness is somewhere lost between light comedy and slapstick.The entire movie is like a stage play. Every scene drags too long. I can hardly finish watching it. Wonder how it got an Oscarr Award for Best Screenplay?",3,13,24,4 December 2002
Rear Window," Why Leave the Door Unlocked?
","There are always forced ending climaxes in Hitchcock's films, such as the on-time rescues in North by Northwest and Psycho, and this film is no exception.In Rear Window, James Stewart has a cast on his leg, but that doesn't mean he cannot move at all. We see him standing up when Thelma Ritter comes to give him a massage. We can also assume that he takes care most of his meals and goes to the toilet by himself. But when the murderer finds out where he is and comes over to teach him a final lesson, Stewart just sits there listening to this guy's footsteps. There's certainly enough time for him to 'walk' or crawl over and lock the door of his apartment.I do admire Hitchcock's cinematic ability to handle a story about a character who is confined to the wheelchair, but it seems that he never paid his attention to the logic of the plots too much.",8,2,5,2 May 2002
Heat," A masterpiece?
","The narrative of mental and physical duel between Pacino and De Niro is expanded to include needless subplot of other robbers' private lives. It becomes more and more boring except that memorable shootout in the street after bank robbery.Pacino spends the whole picture chewing gums and shouting at everyone in sight; Kilmer is as stiff as usual. Diane Venora, as Pacino's wife, always speaks in a low tone while Pacino's voice over the top. It's irritating to watch these two actors in conversation, because the viewer has to adjust the sound volume continuously.On his way to the airport, De Niro suddenly drives off the highway and gets to the hospital to eliminate a traitor who worked for him. After he finishes the job unconvincingly, Pacino finds him on the street and chases after him. It's absolutely ridiculous that they can run from the hospital to the airport without cars. More silliness in the final showdown: De Niro is stupid enough to jump out of his hiding spot to be shot by Pacino. I wouldn't say the film is a masterpiece.",6,1,5,8 September 2002
