First Man," Amazing in how they made a moon landing boring
","You would think that documenting an amazing accomplishment would make for an engaging movie. But nope, they managed to somehow put me to sleep.The problem is that the events are portrayed as such a monotone and disengaged matter that I found myself looking at the phone every now and then.",6,2,2,16 October 2019
It," Random scenes and its' over before you know it
","There's no direction in this movie, we are shown random scary scenes and then it's somehow over. Does not live up to the hype.",5,0,4,10 May 2019
The Irishman," Well done but drags on and not really engaging
","As usual Deniro, Pacino and Pesci shine in this epic movie chronicling the life of the irishman.I really wanted to give 10 stars but it has the following issues:1. Dull and disengaged storytelling. Shootings, bombings, stabbings are all just an everyday occurrence and I wasn't really on the edge of my seat.2. Needs more factual details on the story. I would have liked it when it ended to show newspaper clippings, real world pictures of the characters or even some kind of paragraph explaining what happened to the people in real life.3. Drags on a bit too long, some scenes could have been cut4. The self-narration is a bit too much. I prefer the story to literally tell the story instead of some voice-over.That being said I'm not disappointed it is worth a watch! I found it quite interesting providing details on how and why Jimmy Hoffa was so popular.",8,4,9,7 December 2019
Bird Box," Beginning and Middle Parts are good but the ending, not so much....
","The story is quite gripping and not boring at all. I like how it jumps from different time point so you can get a good idea of how life progresses in the apocalyptic world.And ironically not seeing the creatures makes it even more scary and engaging. I almost felt like the characters trying to deal with the terror of avoiding seeing them.Only bad thing is the ending... how did that nurse somehow remember Malorie's full name after 5 years of chaos? Nurses deal with thousands of people and it's just way unrealistic to remember even their full names. Oh and how about how Malorie had been calling her kids Boy and Girl and then all of sudden decides, eh, forget it, now I'll give you names?Plus I wonder, how did the blind people survive? Wouldn't the saviors have shot them up? I know that blind people can't see the creatures why wouldn't the saviors decide to the creature's bidding?Overall great movie but not perfect and would've liked a more realistic ending.",7,0,3,23 December 2018
Doctor Zhivago," Beautiful but boring
",The scenery and sets are very well done. I love the snowed in mansion at vladyvostik.But the story itself is lacking. There's not much going on and drags on.,6,0,2,20 November 2019
Toy Story 4," Amazing CGI and the story was all-right
",Not the best movie ever but entertaining. The graphics are amazing.,7,2,6,23 June 2019
12 Strong," 12 Cliches
","1. Soldier spending time with his family before getting shipped out2. Newbie military guy acts like he knows everything3. One-dimensional bad guy4. Close calls in which you think the good guy died but then he comes back like a miracle5. Explosions for the sake of it6. Moment of courage in which the good guy charges ahead and somehow survives7. Never runs out of ammo8. Foreigner distrusts american guys9. Soldiers promise that they will come home10. Child weeps at seeing her Dad back home11. Banter among soldiers12. Bad guys fall at first shot
Disappointing really, this is the perfect movie for trump supporters.",3,1,6,25 May 2019
Black Panther," Am I the only one taking crazy pills?
","Seeing as how this movie beat box office records and rottentomatoes rates it at 97% I was eager to watch this movie.But after enduring this simple formulaic story I am wondering, am I taking crazy pills? True the CGI is amazing and the cast is all-black but the story... there is quite a bit missing. Maybe the movie critics got bribed by Marvel to boost the ratings but I can't see how this got such high ratings.The storyline reminds me of those children's books in which there is barely any character development. 'See the dog run, the dog barks. The End' In this movie we have a bunch of one-dimensional characters and simple situations. 'Bad guy wants to destroy the world, stop bad guy. The End'I found myself checking my phone and dozed off several times. It just isn't that great. Better luck next time Marvel.",3,3,5,16 September 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fun at the end but drags on in the beginning
",The first hour I was checking the time to see how much longer I have. I do understand there is a setup for the scene and mood but it just beats around the bush a little too long.But the last 45 minutes of the movie is when it starts getting good. For a comedy I never really laughed but it's quite a fun thriller.,7,0,0,21 June 2020
