The King's Speech," Royal Slush
","If one needs proof that Americans have an inferiority complex when it comes to anything stamped 'Made in the UK', look no further than this steaming pile of pretentiousness which gets my vote as the worst Best Picture ever.Here's a bit of info I picked up in Film Appreciation 101: in order for there to be drama, there must be conflict. The 'conflict' in The King's Speech is the bitchy (and probably gay) archbishop learning that the speech therapist treating the Duke of York (aka Bertie) is an unqualified quack! Well, I knew that when the quack had Bertie rolling around on the floor screeching like a banshee!And this will come as a shock to these twits, but Edward's hook-up with Wallis Simpson was more than a quickie at the Quickie Mart. But instead of being given an idea of the turmoil triggered by their liaison, we get Edward acting like the petulant Golden Boy forced to marry the Coyote Ugly he banged in Daddy's Caddie. The reason for the opposition was because she was divorced, or as Daddy puts it, 'has two husbands who are living still'. Would he have felt better if they were dead?To say the characters are two-dimensional is an insult to two-dimensional characters. Bertie is a repressed wuss with Daddy issues. Edward is a feckless wuss with Daddy issues. Logue (the quack) is an elitist wuss with Daddy issues. Bertie babbles like Lenny Bruce on an acid trip whenever he gets his knickers into a bunch. I seriously doubt that ever happened. Ditto, Bertie and Mrs. Bertie being allowed to leave the confines of their gilded cage without so much as a Bobby in tow.But what really made me want to hurl was the whole German thing. Logue advises Bertie not come to the throne as King Albert because 'Albert' sounds too German. Bertie did not come to the throne as King Albert because Queen Victoria declared that no successor be crowned as King Albert out of regard for Prince Albert.By the way, Victoria and Albert were - you guessed it - German!",2,8,21,9 January 2012
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The King of the Neo-Cons!
","I doubt the critics praising 'Borat' would be caught dead in the same room as Rupert Murdoch, Premier of the Evil Empire a.k.a News Corp. Ditto the equally-smug, self-righteous Sasha Baron Cohen. Yet they are now indebted to The King of the Neo-Cons for unleashing this 'masterpiece.' I'll let the irony of that sink in!How does using the plight of the peoples of Eastern Europe mock Americans' preconceptions of them, as critics insist? That Cohen reduces them to nothing but clichés - and paid the natives a pittance for their cooperation - says a lot more about him than he thinks it does about us!I won't give Cohen a pass for his despicable rendering of Jews because he is Jewish. There is such a thing as being an anti-Semitic Semite! Borat's anti-Semitism tells me Cohen needs to see a psychiatrist instead of deluging us with his self-loathing.Most of the skits were obviously staged, and some were just gross. Again, how are our preconceptions mocked or challenged by Borat jerking off in front of a Victoria's Secret, chasing strangers to kiss them or unleashing a chicken he keeps in a suitcase on a subway train?Are we actually to believe that Borat has never heard of Jesus? Kazakhstan is 47% Muslim, 44% Russian Orthodox, and 2% Protestant. Guess they've never heard of Jesus, either!As far as the 'outrageous' wrestling scene -- yawn! Why were Borat's naughty bits blacked out but his son's weren't? One more issue for Cohen's shrink to sort out!Borat speaks Hebrew to Azamat, and Azamat speaks to Borat in Armenian; needless to say, they shouldn't be able to understand each other. In case anyone cares - and Cohen certainly doesn't - Kazakh and Russian, the designated language of inter-ethnic communication, are spoken in Kazakhstan.The 'message' in 'Borat' is obvious and nothing new: America is one seething cauldron of stupid, hateful and violent sub-humans. I guess this explains why Borat lusts after Canadian Pamela Anderson instead of Texan Anna Nicole Smith, who also had tattoos, big fake boobies, and Fruit Loops for brains. If I could sue to get my $3.99 back, I would.",1,7,15,9 May 2007
Requiem for a Dream," As Nancy Reagan would say...
","A black deaf-mute drug lord gets blown to smithereens by a white hit-man posing as his limo driver!Allow me to congratulate Darren Aronofsky for kicking that obnoxious poseur, Quentin Tarantino, right in the crotch!Unfortunately, Requiem for a Dream goes downhill from there. The split screens and hyper-fixes get old real fast. The plot is all over the place. I won't go into detail because the Hated It posters put it better than I, but I will add this: In a moment of clarity, Harry realizes Sara is addicted to diet pills and tells her to stop because 'they're no good.' Is he hearing himself? Of course not. So, why does he bawl like a baby in the cab?'The dream I'm referring to in the book is the great American dream: prosperity, property, prestige, etc. And the fact that it'll kill you dead. Striving for it is a disaster. Attaining it is a killer' said Selby, no doubt, while on his way to the bank! The irony is Requiem for a Dream isn't about drugs, it IS a drug. It's Buñuel on crack stuck in a Z-Grade Grand Guignol.",2,4,7,15 October 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg does Soderberg...
","and the results are deadly: a technically flawless but self-righteous, humorless film maker, he is utterly incapable of embracing the joy of this cat-and-mouse chase, much less, appreciating the delicious irony of Abagnale's post-conviction life. Ironically, the usually-bombastic (and equally self-righteous) John Williams manages to reign himself in; his score was such a surprise, I though someone else had done it.Although DiCaprio tries mightily, Abagnale remains a selfish punk not worthy of our sympathy. He lets his father, for whom he launches his crime spree, drown in debt while he makes off with suitcases stuffed with cash. That Sr. has no problem claiming to be a Medal of Honor winner in a pathetic attempt to secure a loan tells us he wasn't above accepting 'help' from Jr.Which leads us to Hanratty, who is not only self-righteous and humorless, but mean. He takes a perverse joy in telling Jr. what happened to Sr. And he wonders why Jr. escapes from the plane!The ER scene should have been written thusly: Jr. storms in like a general, talks to Mom while examining/comforting the boy, respectfully asks the interns for their diagnosis, forces himself to soak up the blood from the wound (which we get a gratuitous close-up of) while trying desperately not to pass out! That would not only have been funny, it would have displayed Abagnale's moxie and pluck. Instead, I found myself hoping he'd rot in jail.When Jr. is given a bogus check by the FBI agents, he notes that the paper is not perforated. Since we never learn how he mastered making bogus checks or obtained the tools needed, we must assume that he wasn't working with paper that wasn't perforated, either! How this minor detail got past the 'experts' at the FBI (and Spielberg) is not for us lesser minds to ponder.",3,4,9,28 December 2002
Marie Antoinette," Off With Their Heads!
","While it's true that Maria Theresa instructed her daughter to be nice to Madame du Barry, the real reason isn't made clear. Madame had supreme influence over Louis XV, and - after helping bring about Choiseul's downfall - she seriously threatened the Franco-Austrian alliance. I don't know which was funnier: Mercy-Argenteau telling Marie to make nice with Madame or him getting cheesed because she didn't read the brief on Poland! And why is Marie being told to make nice when Louis's guests openly diss Madame at dinner?Marie and Fersen were not lovers (despite rumors at the time), and it is outrageous to insinuate that he fathered Louis-Joseph. Who knows if the real Fersen actually strutted around the battlefield like Napoleon (the funniest thing in the movie), but any sympathy I had for Marie I lost when Coppola had her put out for this Swedish meatball!Coppola has Marie smoking weed and at least two guests snorting coke! Although that would explain A LOT, there is no proof that she or anyone else in her posse got blasted on anything stronger than champagne and bonbons!France backed America for one reason: to stick it to her arch-enemy, England. I assume Coppola insinuates that we caused the Bourbons' downfall to please the Bush-haters, but to no avail: the Bush-haters at Cannes booed Francis's little girl right out of the theater!Coppola blew a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Who wouldn't kill to film at Versailles? But it could have been shot on a sound stage for all I knew. 50% mess, 50% acid-trip, she doesn't even try to weave the music in so that it jibes with what we're seeing! Some critics have opined that she was trying to convey Marie's state of mind. That would have worked had Marie been played by an actual actress. Instead, we get Dunst, whom, I'm convinced, was born zonked. Schwartzman is downright laughable as Louis XVI. Thirty seconds of these twits, and you understand why there was a Revolution! Dare I say it, Marie-Antoinette deserves better.",2,3,5,2 April 2007
Meet the Parents," darqness hits it on the head
","with his review. I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing that I wanted to tell these people to go 'fock' themselves. I guess it's partly because I grew up being picked on. But, as he states, the characters, except for Dina - the classic 1950's mom - and Greg, are mean. Not just mean, vicious. And, I couldn't understand what he saw in Pam. As others have noted, she seems to be rooting for him to 'fail.' Only at the end did she stand up for him (sort of). Indeed, she still seems to have feelings for Kevin (especially now that he's loaded).But Greg is no prize, either, and a rather slimy prize too boot. When he blows up, though understandable, his tantrums come out of nowhere, and when we're supposed to get an idea as to his inner feelings, Ben 'I'm No Bobby DeNiro' Stiller gives us blank looks instead. Just as I couldn't understand what Greg saw in Pam, I was just as baffled as to what she saw in him.",Null,4,6,26 May 2003
Shakespeare in Love," Will and his Wee Willie!
","I know it's fiction, but you'd think that they'd get a few things right. Shakespeare lived in Bishopgate outside London at the time he wrote 'R&J'; there wasn't any reason to have him living in a rooming house within the city. Burbage's home was The Theatre, which was owned by his father, James; he wouldn't move to The Curtain, which was also owned by his father, until 1597. But, I digress...Ned Alleyn married Philip Henslowe's step-daughter in 1592, making the men partners in The Rose. Alleyn ran the productions and Henslowe handled the money. Even if they were in trouble, it's unlikely that Burbage would have come to the rescue since James Burbage, literally, kicked Alleyn out of the Burbage company when he accused Burbage of cutting him out of his share of the profits. And the real Alleyn was 6' 7'! But, I digress...I never bought that this Will Shakespeare wrote the greatest plays in the English language: he is a self-centered, unprincipled, horny jerk for whom everyone is a means to an end. He should have tried out for the British track team, with all the running around he does, instead of torturing us with his delusions of genius! And what's with the Mad Max get-up? But, I digress...How did Viola learn of the audition when she wasn't at the bar? How did the Queen know Viola was 'Master Kent' when she was a last-second replacement for Sam? Why didn't the Nurse investigate the ruckus in Viola's bedroom? Why didn't Wessex break his contract? He could have sued for damages, and De Lesseps would have been ruined. And Will just happened to be in the same church in a desperately-cynical attempt to save his immoral mortal soul Viola was at, praying for HIS immoral mortal soul? Give me a break!Shakespeare in Love is overrated (and overheated) tripe, complete with plot holes big enough to drive a platoon of tanks through! But, I digress...",2,4,9,3 February 2002
The English Patient," A great love story?
","Sorry. Katharine and Almásy are two very self-absorbed people, their encounters are anything but romantic, and there is no compelling reason for them to seek each other out: Almásy is a surly jerk, and Clifton worships the ground Katharine walks on. She initially breaks with Almásy not because she loves her husband (notice how quickly she recovers after realizing she is a widow), but fears what will happen to her social standing.As if being asked to root for these twits wasn't bad enough:1) How did Almásy know that Katharine told Clifton she wanted to return to England?2) Trying to get Madox to turn around, Almásy shoots the flare behind him. Despite Almásy's assurances to Katharine, it's a mystery how Madox manages to find them.3) Caravaggio asks Almásy if he killed the Cliftons. But since he was told of the circumstances of Madox's death, he must have been briefed on them, too.4) Assuming they found Clifton's plane, how did British Intelligence locate his body after Almásy buried it?5) How could the Nomads find the thimble, but not Katharine?6) Katharine and Almásy had hooked up by December 1938. Germany invaded Egypt in February 1941, but was driven out by November 1943. Almásy gives the Nazis the maps so he can get back to Katharine, gets shot down, then pops up in Italy in 1945?! Forget that we're supposed to buy that nobody suspected they were doing the nasty for over two years! Either Katharine was in the cave for two years (not likely), Almásy was cared for by the Nomads for two more years (even less likely), or Minghella screwed up the time line big time (a lot more likely.)But what really drove me nuts was: 7) The British couldn't possibly have mistaken 'Almásy' as German because Hungarian and German do not have a common ancestor. Ironically, English is a Germanic language.I read that when Saul Zaentz bought the rights, he 'assured' Michael Ondaatje: 'Don't worry, we'll f***-up your book.' One doesn't have to read it to tell that he succeeded.",2,8,15,13 February 2003
The Girl Next Door," $3.99 PPV I'll never get back!
","I just PPV'ed this, thinking it was different from other teen comedies. It wasn't 'American Pie' sleazy, but it operates on the same slippery slope.Danielle says she wants to escape her past, but she dresses like a tart, doesn't object to Kelly's re-entering her life, willingly works a porn convention, has no problem taking Matt to a strip club, and has even less of a problem enlisting her 'friends' to 'help' him. If she were really serious about making a fresh start, she'd be working a legit job, call the cops the second Kelly showed up, and dress like a librarian!Matt's moral compass is even more off! How do you go from resolving to lead a moral life to win a scholarship to deciding the only way you can save the day is by having on-camera sex?Hirsch looked like an underage Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cuthbert a young Deborah Harry, which made their characters' hook-up downright creepy. It doesn't really matter since they had no chemistry.Heck, when the most appealing character in a movie is a 'fatherly' porn king, what does THAT tell you?",2,2,5,8 October 2004
Finding Nemo," fishy
","The critics are gaga over this, but neither myself nor my 6 year old were. I was disturbed by how Marlin was ridiculed for being (understandably) over-protective. While the 'can do' attitude toward his handicap is heartening, Nemo remains the same brat he was when he put the story into motion. 'Nemo' struck me as anti-family (strange to say about a 'family picture') in how the parent was the one was expected to grow up, not the child.It had some scary moments. The 'whale talking' got old real fast. But, the anti-American jab (which got the biggest laugh) was outrageous. Hollywood hates Bush so much, it has to shoehorn its politics into the one place where it doesn't belong! Here's a weird idea: how about letting children have a childhood, and save the Bush-is-Hitler stuff for the grown ups?",3,2,5,13 June 2003
Alexander," Ollie's Folly!
","Caught this on PPV. 'Alexander' is a big mess! The inconsistency is nothing short of staggering as epitomized by two death scenes: the guy getting beaten with a severed head was cool; the elephant getting medieval on Hephaistion was just plain silly! Throw in Anthony Hopkins as the Travelocity Gnome, Val Kilmer as The Town Drunk, Angelina Jolie as Boris Badenov, Rosario Dawson as Catwoman, Colin Farrell as Shirley Temple, and you've got yourself one hum-dinger of a snooze-fest!Some think Stone is drawing parallels between what Alexander wrought in ancient Persia and what Bush has begat in modern Persia, but that's being kind! Ollie's Alexander is a Mama's Boy with a Daddy complex. How this sniveling brat conquered the known world with his Abercrombie and Fitch Army is not for us lesser minds to ponder. And he has such a pathetic need to be liked, he wants to bring the peoples of the world under his boot so he can free them? Yeah, right! The real Alexander never granted those he conquered freedom or even the semblance of self-rule, and was interested in nothing except his own glory. In short, Alexander the Great was a tyrant in liberator's clothing, just like Ollie's buddy, Fidel Castro.",2,7,10,19 September 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Ride 'Em Cowboy!
","Although based on a story written by a straight woman, directed by a straight man, starring actors who are straight (one of whom is dating his movie wife), 'Brokeback Mountain' has become a litmus test for society's tolerance of the so-called gay lifestyle. It reminds me of the self-congratulatory hoopla over 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,' a film made by the very people who saw to it that blacks never played anything more substantial than maids and train porters! Such films exist solely to make the elitists look good and feel good -- which is why it will make out like a bandit on Oscar night!The filmmakers want you to conclude that Jack and Ennis don't get to live happily ever after because of 'intolerance'. Oddly, this 'intolerance' demands that the boys choose to betray those fool enough to love them. If they weren't such selfish pricks (give Ennis points for feeling bad about the sheep being killed while he was, uh, busy), I could have gotten on board. But each treats his wife like crap, and Jack sleeps with other men! Don't give me the line that the boys they 'had' to marry: Ennis could have broken his engagement, and it was perfectly acceptable back then for a man to be a 'confirmed bachelor'. And when his true love dies, is Ennis devastated? Hardly! His run-in with that bear had more depth!As for their 'historic' hook-up, you'll find more explicit stuff on basic cable! The boys never show us their 'fishing gear', but the girls show us their 'bait' -- that's Hollywood's idea of progress, kiddies! Worse, the movie utterly fails to convey gay love as natural, what with all the jokes just begging to be cracked about the boys eating beans and sleeping with sheep!If the story was about a guy and a girl or two girls, would the movie condemn the lovers for betraying his/her partner, or excuse the affair? When the elitists regard minorities as fellow human beings instead of cynically patronizing them with pretentious tripe like 'Brokeback Mountain', then they can consider themselves enlightened.",3,32,99,26 December 2005
My Neighbor Totoro," a real gem
","'Totoro' is not like American toons. It takes its time and there are huge gaps when nothing happens. But if you hang in there, you and your munchin will be rewarded with a sweet, smart movie about the meaning of life and the innate need for family and friends. I was impressed at how dead-on the dynamics of sibling relationships were portrayed, especially in light of what the girls are dealing with. Indeed, the girls the kind of well-rounded characters you simply don't find in American cartoons. My 5 year old, a die-hard MIB nut who was convinced that he would hate it, was captivated from start to finish. If that's not reason enough to get it, then I don't know what is.",Null,1,2,2 August 2002
Juno," Stupid is as Stupid does!
","I don't want to spend a lot of time on this as I'm just SO cheesed I bought the hype, so just a few observations:1) What idiot saddles their kid with a name like 'Liberty Bell'?2) Juno has sex because she's bored? As Retard boyfriend observes, that's how mothers and teachers get babies!3) What 16 year old references Soupy Sales or has pictures of Prince Charles and Glen Campbell on their bedroom wall? Puke!4) 'Pork swords'? Double puke!5) Planned Parenthood is re-imagined as run by the DMV, then the step-mother lets the ultrasound tech have it for having the nerve to observe that babies raising babies is not a good idea.6) Mr. Jingles wants a divorce because Juno has unleashed his inner Kurt Cobain? I'm surprised Ms. Prissy Britches didn't accuse him of making 'music' with her!7) Dad assures Juno that someday she'll be in the hospital 'on your own terms'. Guess he missed the part about her jumping Retard's scrawny bones was on her terms!8) The father and step-mother agree not to tell Retard's mother the awful truth? The father later gives Retard a pat on the shoulders instead of beating the holy hell out of him? What planet are these people on?!9) Retard shows absolutely no interest in the pregnancy nor ponders his impending fatherhood. But he suddenly shows up at the hospital all concerned? Give me a break!10) The messy little episode behind them, Juno and 'the cheese to my macaroni' take up where they left off, as if she just had a cold and not their child!11) Change your name to something clever like Diablo Cody, the critics and the Academy will kiss your no-talent ass, too!",3,25,44,17 May 2008
Midnight in Paris," The Misadventures of Gil The Groupie
","Caught this on Showtime the other night after seeing it a few years back, and was reminded of why I found it such pretentious clap-trap. As in 'Celebrity', Allen taps yet another young blonde-haired, blue-eyed man to be his WASP doppelgänger, and surrounds him with obnoxious WASP elites. We're supposed to sympathize with him and his 'plight'. Only problem is Gil The Groupie (aka WASP Woody) is a such whiny, insecure twerp, despite being a successful screenwriter ('Adaptation.', anybody?), you want to deck him!For reasons I didn't get, Gil The Groupie wishes that he could have kicked it with The Cool Kids of 1920's Paris, when Paris was, like, cool. One night, while wandering down a cobblestone road, Gil The Groupie gets his wish. What's more, The Cool Kids welcome him into The Club instantly; no one so much as asks: 'Who is this guy?'. Forget that none of The Cool Kids (Joséphine Baker, Djuna Barnes, Juan Belmonte, Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dalí, T.S. Eliot, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, Man Ray, Gertrude Stein, Leo Stein, Alice B. Toklas) were kicking it in Paris at the same time, Allen mocks these figures by reducing them collectively to the same shallow cliché as their new amigo.Gil The Groupie finds himself in competition with Hemingway (whom Allen seems to have a bizarre obsession with; he gets more screen time than the rest of The Cool Kids put together) for the affections of Picasso's, ahem, 'muse'. Why any woman would give either of these jerks the time of day is beyond me, but then, the 'muse' is doing the nasty with Picasso, King Of The Jerks, so her standards aren't very-high to begin with! Anyway, the 'muse' is supposed to be this Little Girl Lost, so we're supposed to sympathize with her and her 'plight'. Only, we don't (I didn't, anyway): One minute, she's throwing herself at Gil The Groupie; the next, she runs off with Hemingway to Africa (!). After Little Girl Lost pops back up in Paris, Gil The Groupie gives her a pair of earrings, then they wind up in the 1890's because Allen has run out of ideas (not that he had any to begin with), where they find themselves kicking it with The Cool Kids, Belle Époque Version (Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec). When Little Girl Lost declares that she is staying in the 1890's, Gil The Groupie replies basically 'whatever.' This is the love of his life, but he just goes 'whatever'?! Huh?! Did I miss something?! In case anyone cares, Belle Époque began some 20 years before Little Girl Lost declares 'it's the start of the Belle Époque'. But, I digress.What had me screaming (aside from him finding Little Girl Lost's diary in a bookstore, and how Paris - one of the filthiest cities on the planet - is always freshly-scrubbed in the movies) was how Gil The Groupie tells everyone that he's from the future, yet no one asks for proof! He could have blown their minds by showing them his 'masterpiece' on his laptop. But I digress (again). Such jaw-dropping stupidity really makes you question your faith in humanity.",2,1,3,4 July 2019
Crash," Annie Proulx was right
","When 'Brokeback Mountain' didn't win Best Picture, I sarcastically told a friend the voters would be accused of homophobia. Sure enough, not only did critics see closeted Bushbots in the Academy, but so did 'Brokeback' author Annie Proulx, whom, during the big hissy fit she threw in The Guardian, named 'Crash' 'Trash.' I won't waste my time commenting on Proulx's idiotic rant, but she was right about 'Crash', which I finally got to see last night.The racist cop saves the black woman he assaulted?! The Persian shop keeper shoots point-blank at the Latino locksmith but misses because the locksmith's daughter is his angel?! The shop keeper just happens to be the father of the coroner who has to break the news to the black cop about his punk brother who got offed by the racist cop's partner, who kept the husband of the woman the racist cop assaulted from getting blown away by his trigger-happy cohorts?! The white trophy wife learns her 'best friend' is the Latina maid she hates?! I don't know what was worse, the absurd and utterly insulting coincidences or how it ends with the Cambodians being tossed onto one of the worst sections of town like garbage with $40! Can't we all just get along, my ass, Paul Haggis! Avoid this wreck!",1,7,15,4 April 2006
Nacho Libre," The Flatulent Friar!
","Nacho Libre starts out OK, but quickly jumps the tracks, thanks, in no small part, to Jack Black's raving id, who thought up this, ahem, project. Forget the icky idea of Encarnación giving The Flatulent Friar the time of day, if you think babes like that actually wind up becoming nuns, I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested in!Some critics have opined that Nacho Libre is racist, but it's too stupid to be racist. It can't even be bothered to follow the rules of lucha libre or tell us about its traditions and culture. Instead, Black and Jared Hess are more concerned with depicting the luchadors as pricks, and I'm shocked that César González - who plays Ramses and is a real-life luchador - didn't set Black and Hess straight!Silencio uses a tombstone pile-driver on Nacho in the Battle Jam, which is illegal, as is the luchadors beating Nacho and Esqueleto with their belts! Also, Ramses would have been disqualified for ripping off Nacho's mask, and Nacho could not have won by pinning Ramses outside the ring! Señor González, why the hell did you go along with this garbage?!The showdown between Nacho and Ramses is an exhibition -- meaning both are paid squat! So, the next time we see our hero, he's tooling the orphans around in a bus that was last used on The Partridge Family. He must be pimping Esqueleto out to every ample-sized lady in Oaxaca!The lone thing that saves Nacho Libre from the permanent 3-count is the soundtrack! I am, I am!",2,1,2,4 July 2008
Capote," The Truman Show!
","As I read the script on-line, I thought 'Capote' needed a trim. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn 'Adorable One'; here, he is 'Mr. Shawn'.Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke?), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters. It's one thing to fudge the facts, it's another to drop the ball: the executions were carried out between 12:45-1:19 AM, April 14; Truman is shown at the prison 22 HOURS LATER!I was totally underwhelmed by the 'acting'. Keener doesn't even try to sound like an Alabama native. The way Cooper kept shouting 'Alvin!', I was waiting for the Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly, but a pathetic suck-up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time. When Hoffman whines about being 'tortured' by the endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out!",2,4,7,6 May 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Dragon Lady!
","I haven't read the book, so don't jump on me if I seem ignorant on some things. Anyway, do you want to know where this lost me? Miranda bringing Andy to tears because she couldn't get the Dragon Lady a flight out of a hurricane! Nigel then tells Andy to stop whining, then decides to turn her into a Fashionista? Yeah, right!The twins are as evil as Momma (no surprise), but why would they try to get Andy sacked by trying to entice her to come upstairs?Andy quits because she realizes she did to Emily what Miranda did to Nigel! But that car did that job for her. Besides, Emily is such a bitch, Mother Teresa would have gladly mowed her down!Christian didn't have to get the Harry Potter for Andy, and he didn't bed her until after she broke up with Nate, so I didn't think he was the prick some other posters do.What makes Miranda think all those people would actually go with her if she left Runway? Why didn't Irv call her bluff? Hell, she costs him $300,000 a day! We're supposed to feel sorry for her because the latest Mr. Priestly told her adiós? I don't think so!",2,1,2,12 January 2007
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Raiders of the Lost Arc!
","After years of hearing this film praised to the skies, I finally got to see this last night, thanks to our buddies at TCM.For the benefit of you budding actors, the following is a blow-by-blow account of Maria Falconetti's portrayal of Joan of Arc, considered by many critics to be the greatest performance in the history of film:Goes into Pop-My-Eyes-Out-of-My-Sockets Mode. Then cries.Goes into I'm-Feeling-Sorry-for-Myself Mode. Then cries.Goes into Lomotomized Zombie Mode. Then cries.Goes into Bobbing Head Doll Mode. Then cries.Repeats modes like a broken record. Then cries. A lot.Joan of Arc was a female George Patton, someone who knew how to kick ass and take names. Falconetti's Joan is a blubbering wack job no one would follow into a pillow fight! Oddly, the only time Falconetti stops the blubbering wack job bit is when Joan is about to be burnt to a crisp.The ending is a stupefying orgy of violence and bizarre camera angles. There is even a shot of a baby nursing, complete with full-frontal boobie! And the guy in the Mountie get-up lording over Joan's execution is a hoot! Where I can score some of that crack Carl Theodor Dreyer was smoking?",3,19,47,14 March 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Stan Lee's Buffalo Chips!
","After suffering through Stan Lee's latest offering of buffalo chips, aka Thor, Epix finally got around to showing this last night.I have a lot of problems with this, namely how we're supposed to buy that a scrawny runt who couldn't cut it in Basic turns into Rambo the moment he's pumped full of some radioactive crap. That he always know exactly what to do. That he never hesitates, never has a 'my bad', and the crap coursing through his veins doesn't affect him one bit. In real life, Scrawny Runt wouldn't have had a clue, his body would have attacked the crap coursing through his veins, and he would have been dead by the time he was popped out of his pod!The Bad Guy, a Nazi gone rouge, has a ray gun that, literally, evaporates everything it's pointed at. So, he builds this complex deep in the forest, houses 400 Allied soldiers, goofs on Wagner, and waits for the right moment to unleash Hell. Makes sense to me, too. Moreover, the Good Guys know all about Nazi Rouge and his plans to unleash Hell. Huh? If Hitler had gotten his hands on the ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction, do you think he would have been holed up in the forest somewhere, goofing on Wagner, and biding his time? Hell, no!After nearly two hours of this ham-fisted nonsense (and Tommy Lee Jones looking really, really constipated), we are treated to a close-up of a pair of eyes with the longest lashes you have ever seen. Is this a Maybelline commercial? No, it's Scrawny Runt lying on a cot, waking up as if from a bad dream! Moments later, he's running down the streets of present-day Manhattan (my idea of a bad dream), and runs smack into Samuel L. Jackson, who informs Scrawny Runt that he's been 'asleep' for 70 years! So, why isn't Scrawny Runt at some a top-secret location being defrosted and debriefed? Because that would make way too much sense! Besides, Mr. Lee needs him to peddle his newest bag of buffalo chips, The Avengers!",2,2,3,30 April 2012
The Aviator," Do your worst, Mr. Scorsese!
","After his former boss became a barking-mad recluse, Noah Dietrich wrote a book claiming that he was the power behind the throne upon which sat Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. That is pure bunk, but Martin Scorsese apparently bought it. No hint of the genius who parlayed his inheritance into a multi-billion dollar empire. Corporate titans Simon Ramo, Dean Woolridge and Tex Thornton all cut their teeth at Hughes; Dietrich didn't find them, Hughes did. Yet Marty couldn't manage to squeeze this into his opus.I also wish he hadn't worked from a retread of A Beautiful Mind. Like John Nash, Hughes was a racist, anti-Semitic prick who carried on with both sexes. When The Master is made to nip at Opie's heels, something is very wrong! It was perverse to make Hughes this Great Hero, complete with semi-happy ending. Even more perverse was the shot of the projector making the big creep a Christ figure.The casting was horrid! My boxer looks more like Ava Gardner (reimagined as a whore that can't be bought!) than Kate Beckinsale! And I was constantly distracted by Cate Blanchett's mile-wide mouth and hoary vocals. Was she playing Katharine Hepburn or Martha Raye? Howard bought Kate The Philadelphia Story, the property that turned her career around, after she left him and before she met Spencer Tracy. Yet Marty couldn't manage to squeeze any of this into his opus, either (or get the facts straight). Still, when she exits, The Aviator loses its pop. And all DiCaprio, the perpetual 18 year old, proves is that he has this thing for screwing his forehead into knots. Does his forehead have an agent, and how much does it get per knot?Hughes was married while making Hell's Angels, but the Mrs. is nowhere to be seen. Marty really dropped the ball here. Ella Rice was his college sweetheart. Exploring their relationship would have opened a whole new side to Hughes. What made him want to conquer aviation, movies and golf? Your guess is as good as mine.Audacious and gorgeous as only Marty can do it, The Aviator would have been a masterpiece if the script had been written by a writer who could actually write, then started at minute 105. That's when Poor Little Rich Boy slams his shiny new toy into a Beverly Hills neighborhood. It has to be the most incredible plane crash ever put on film. The previous 104 minutes are a bore.",2,3,6,14 October 2005
Justice League," Makes 'Batman v Superman' look like 'Citizen Kane'
","$300 million was spent on this. All the good $300 million could have done, and Warner Bros. threw it at Joss Whedon, who took over after fellow hack Zack Snyder dropped out after the loss of his daughter (he is credited as the director as he helmed the principal photography). Warners turning to Whedon to complete a film featuring Wonder Woman after he was blasted on social media when his rejected Wonder Woman script was leaked unto an undeserving world was an irony lost on them, I'm sure. The beef I have with superhero movies (aside from idiot studio execs throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at hacks) is NONE of them are faithful to the original origin story: the Kents adopted baby Kal-El from an orphanage; Diana competed against the other Amazons to become Wonder Woman; Bruce Wayne saw a bat come through his window as he was brooding in his study. Here, Snyder and Whedon 'outdo' themselves by trashing not one but two superheroes: Aquaman is now a tatted-up boozer who can't communicate with fish, and The Flash is now a whiny Soy Boy who exclaims 'Oh, snap!' And like the rotten cherry on top, the Villain has an Oedipus Complex!Then, there are the plot holes. Yeah, a superhero movie just isn't a superhero movie without tons of plot holes. But Whedon and co-hack Chris Terrio (who won an Oscar; how in God's Name did THAT happen?!) seem to take a perverted delight in trying to out dumb-and-dumber Snyder: God-awful CGI; slow-motion sequences which will make you beg to be waterboarded; ripping off nearly every Si-Fi film from the past 20 years ('The Matrix', 'Lord of the Rings', 'Thor'). Barry and Victor exhume Clark's grave in the dead of night? Superman has memory loss after being brought back to life? The henchmen of The Villain With The Oedipus Complex tear through Russia, but can't tear the salt box a family lives in to shreds? Did The Villain With The Oedipus Complex set up shop at a defunct nuclear reactor in Russia so that the little girl who lived in the salt box could play with a flower on a radioactive LSD trip? Makes as much 'sense' as anything else in this tripe!But the real crime against humanity is Dumb and Dumber wasting the charged chemistry Ben Affleck and Gal Godot unleashed in 'Batman v Superman'. I was anticipating Batman and Wonder Woman hooking up (or realizing they are soulmates, at the very least), but in 'Justice League', they act as though they hardly know each other -- and don't want to!Seeing how Whedon has made a second 'career' out of his seething hatred of Trump, I'm surprised he didn't manage to shoehorn some jabs at Agent Orange. Perhaps he did, but his overlords decided that was a Bridge To Nowhere Too Far (Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central opines Snyder's 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman' predicted the Trump presidency, but he gives Snyder way-too much credit for brains AND talent!).At any rate, I don't blame Whedon (or Snyder) for this as much as I blame Affleck, who has managed to do the impossible: make George Clooney the second-worst Batman ever! One of the producers, Affleck hired Terrio to write 'Argo', for which Terrio won an Oscar (how in God's Name did THAT happen?!); no doubt, he convinced Warners to tap Terrio to pen 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman'. After the $75 million Warners had to eat when Affleck's opus 'Live by Night' arrived in D.O.A., why the former Mr. Jennifer Garner hasn't been tarred, feathered, and run out on a rail is beyond me!As Shakespeare would have put it, this 'is a tale, told by an idiot (in this case, three idiots), full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'.That whirring sound you hear are the Warner Brothers spinning in their graves!",2,1,4,10 July 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Bo-Ring
","Since the info in the prolog is repeated throughout, that was a waste of 8 minutes that could've been used to get the story going. Only problem is, the story never gets going -- just a bunch of characters you never get to know (and, hence, never care about) who never stop yapping as they bumble through adventures they would otherwise have avoided were they not so collectively stupid! Frodo is especially dense: a lad who insists on tempting fate at the worst possible moments because he can't begin to fathom the power the Ring holds. Elijah Wood's acting seems limited to how big he can bulge his eyes out of his sockets! And if Peter Jackson proves nothing else, it's that he's the second coming of George Lucas (insert your 'Attack of the Clones' joke here.)",Null,0,0,12 August 2002
Cold Mountain," cold..... burrrrr!
","I was really excited about seeing 'Cold Mountain'. Alas, like most movies I'm really excited about seeing, it was a letdown! Were it not for that miraculous invention called a DVD, I think I would've put my head through the monitor, I was so bored!I closely watched Kidman and Law when they meet because their characters are supposedly 'destined' for each other. Yet Law's face showed anything but dumb-struck love, while Kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as if we don't get it, cornball banjos mark her every entrance), and so over the top, it was all I could do not to laugh! Ironically, her performance serves to highlight just how stiff-as-a-board the leads are.Ada nearly starves because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. More perplexing is why didn't any of them stay on as Ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) it was a very dangerous time for Negroes (as they're politely called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Heck, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And for all of Ruby's practicality, when she dispatches Ada's 'evil' rooster, that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickens!By the time her beloved finally returns, Ada doesn't need him or anyone else -- which is the big joke! Indeed, she may be physically intimate with Inman, but her real intimacy is with Ruby, who has turned Ada into an Über-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, as they left Inman behind?I doubt that Minghella recognized this as he was too busy making an anti-Bush movie. Inman tells us he is 'like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie', and Ada's father says 'I imagine God is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument'. These 'observations' are historically inaccurate and insulting. While slavery was the basis of the South's economy, the reasons for the War were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was 'a lie' (in fact, most in the rank-and-file were indifferent to it). For filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious.Structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. Law and Kidman are miscast, and have zero chemistry! The script is little more than half-baked dialog, and an egregious bunch of clichés and banalities. 'Small moments like a bag of diamonds?' Ugh!",2,29,57,23 July 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," The Biggest Loser
","The self-help guru who can't help himself. The burnt-out wife who serves KFC every night. The foul-mouthed, horny Grandpa. The gay suicidal college professor. The Nietzsche-worshiping slacker. The pudgy girl who dreams of being Miss America. The VW bus that breaks down every 5 minutes. Stop me if you've heard all of this before!Why does Richard want to be Tony Robbins when he grows up? Why does Dwayne think that not talking will make him a fighter pilot, and why would such a non-conformist want to join the military to begin with? If Proust was such a loser, then why is Frank a Proust scholar? The cop overlooks Grampa's rotting corpse, but gets a boner over the porn? The pageant runner has no problem with the JonBenet wanna-bes, yet blows a gasket when Olive gets her Super Freak on? Gimme a break!The 'plot' hinges on a message left by Sheryl's sister that Olive has become a replacement for the Little Miss Sunshine regional winner. Does anyone ask why Little Miss Sunshine didn't call them? Does anyone ask how Olive will be able to enter the pageant without proof? Does anyone ask how she could be considered beauty pageant material to begin with? Heck, no! Instead, everyone piles into the VW so she can get there by Sunday!

North by Northwest," Sorry to be a party pooper, but...
","it's never explained how Vandamm was able to use the estate without poor Mr. Townsend's knowledge. Why does Thornhill pulls the knife out of Townsend's back as he tells everybody 'I had nothing to do with this'? And a photographer just happens to be there when he does? In his quest to rectify the case of mistaken identity, Thornhill assumes Kaplan's name and all but uses his credit cards? THAT makes no sense! Eve deliberately sends Thornhill off to his doom (the crop-dusting scene), yet a few minutes in her hotel room, and - after some barbs at the auction - all is forgiven? Give me a break!Hitchcock never could shoot mattes or studio 'action' so they don't distract the viewer, made worse by the inconsistency in his exteriors (Eve at the plane was clearly shot in broad daylight, even though it's supposed to be late night.) And the Mt. Rushmore sets are so phony-looking. The script repeats information: Thornhill proposes to Eve as they cling to Mt. Rushmore, then calls her 'Mrs. Thornhill' as he pulls her up a few minutes later. And Thornhill allowing two thugs to muscle him out of a crowded restaurant without so much as a struggle? One yell for help and the movie is over.",4,23,46,20 April 2003
Doctor Zhivago," not the master's best
","This is one of those very flawed great films. It's structure is like that other 'epic love story,' 'Titanic.' Like 'Titanic,' it's told in flashback by a character to someone he is trying to convince. And, like 'Titanic,' the teller can not possibly know most of what he's 'telling.' Rose was not privy to the meeting in which the architect tells the captain the ship's going to sink or Jack's poker game or Cal's conversations with his bodyguard and the sailors, etc., but we see these anyway, as though she were a witness to it all, when she couldn't possibly have been. Yevgraf couldn't have known about Lara's life before she met Yuri or the particulars of Yuri's trip across Russia or of the others he shares the box car with or of his life once he gets to the Gromeko house or of Yuri's ordeal at the hands of the White Russians, etc., but we see these anyway, as though he were a witness to it all.The second-biggest problem is Zhivago himself -- this guy is a wimp! He is so passive, you can't believe he found the nerve to approach a publisher. The Bolsheviks take over his house, he loses his post and is 'reclassified,' he and his family are forced to move across country, his poems are banned, and he doesn't bitch once! The only time he shows any backbone is when he throws Komarovsky out of Lara's flat, which comes out of absolutely nowhere.The third-biggest problem is the casting. Sharif is too exotic to pass for someone from Zhivago's part of Russia, and Julie Christie is too mature to pass for a girl of 17. Tom Courtenay, like Leonardo DiCaprio in 'Titanic,' seems, at times, young enough to be Lara's child instead of her fiancée. However, Guinness is perfect as always, and Steiger is so wonderfully creepy, it's hard to watch him.Aside from it being way too long and 'Lara's Theme' being played ad nauseam: Why is Komarovsky addressed as 'Monsieur' when he's obviously not French? What happened to Lara and Strelnikov's daughter? Why does Komarovsky keep coming to Lara/Zhivago's rescue, even saving their lives at one point? This is critical because we're told he later abandons their child in a the middle of a riot. And, why does everyone speak with a British accent? I HATE that.",Null,4,10,16 February 2002
Ratatouille," Rat-a-phooey!
","La ratatouille niçoise is a vegetable stew. Its name comes from 'ratouiller' ('to shake') and 'tatouiller' ('to stir'). That Brad Bird tries to pass off ratatouille as a casserole should tell you exactly what he thinks of those silly enough to shill out their money for his latest 'masterpiece'!But Bird-Brain lost me WAY before that! How does Remy know how to read? How can he identify foods he's never stuffed in his face? Granny blasts the holy hell out of her house to try to blast Remy and Emile to kingdom come?! Come on! And Remy just happens to wash up at his idol's restaurant? How convenient!If someone doesn't claim to be Gusteau's progeny within two years of his death, the place goes to Skinner. Huh? Gusteau (or at least his ghost) is shocked to learn that he actually has progeny (given just how porky this pig is, that really IS a shock)! It won't take a genius to figure out that Linguini is The Chosen One, but why would his mother disclose this to Skinner instead of to Gusteau's lawyer?When The Chosen One doesn't give Remy the credit he thinks he deserves at the press conference, he lets the colony have at the food! Having learned his 'lesson', The Chosen One lets Ego in on who made his delicious ratatouille! All of this is beyond dumb!Which brings up another plot-hole-you-can-drive-a-tank-through: after the press conference, Linguini forces Remy to take a 'time out'. Remy returns to the restaurant, but after it's closed. How did Linguini manage to cook that night without Remy? Don't ask Bird-Brain that, or his little pinhead will explode!Ball-Busting-Bitch Colette falls for Girly-Man Linguini? LOL! The less said about the other idiotic clichés Bird-Brain tries to pass off as characters, the better.I can't believe the praise the critics heaped on this given the pretentious screed Bird-Brain shoehorns into Ego's review. The film looks spectacular, but, as Uncle Walt's ghost would have told Bird-Brain, the '100% Animated' tag he obnoxiously tacks on at the end does not mean 100% CGI!",2,11,29,21 January 2008
Days of Thunder," as silly as you'd expect
","As others here have noted, this is 'Top Gun' on wheels, complete with screeching guitar at the 'big' moments. It also suspends disbelief: if a doctor slept with a patient, she'd be fired, stripped of her license, and shipped back to home in disgrace. But here, as in TG, nobody even questions the affair. Indeed, it's interesting to watch this with all that's gone down: Cruise divorced Mimi Rogers (for which she must be eternally grateful) shortly after filming and took up with America's Newest Sweetheart, then dumped her when the 50/50 clause of their pre-nup was about to kick in. But don't feel too sorry for Nicole: she reportedly got Tommy Boy to cough up $65 mill, then walked off with the Oscar. What's interesting is that, even at this early stage, she had better chops than he ever will, as evident by their scenes with that old ham, Robert Duvall. The Nicole/Duvall work are the only good thing about it; the rest is dreck.",1,5,11,30 March 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The Emperor has no clothes!
","I know I'm going to get slammed for this, but sorry:The script was horrid, even worse than 'Gladiator,' which also nabbed an Oscar nod. Come on: a legendary sword is stolen by a spoiled brat, and retrieved by its guardians, who try to put said brat on the path of righteousness. That's it! The fact the brat is a girl is what's supposed to make us all go 'whoa!' And, as if the writers knew how trite that was, they decided to torture us with an incredibly long flashback sequence that's even more boring than the main story!That critics overlooked the weak story line and God-awful Pokemon dialog strikes me as patronizing and more than a bit racist. Were this made by Americans, it would've been slammed big time! And it sure as heck wouldn't have bagged 4 Oscars!It was obvious the actors were on wires. Yeoh's run across the roof reminded me of the race between Clark Kent and the train in 'Superman' -- it was that stiff. Why didn't Lee correct this, because everything depends on us being totally sold on the characters' ability to fly?With the exception of the fight in the restaurant, the fights get tiresome. The 'love story?' As the saying goes, crap or get off the pot!Were it a 30 minute short, CTHD would've been killer: the costumes and cinematography are to die for!

The Illusionist," Just an Illusion
","Though it was better than most movies I've PPV'd lately, it was overly-written, and you could see where it was going a bazillion miles away while driving a truck through the plot holes. If Leopold, Kronprinz von Österreich-Ungarn (that's more High German than is in the film) has immunity from prosecution for any crime as long as the crime is committed on Imperial Property (which sounds more than a bit loopy), then why does he blow his brains out? I would have shot Uhl, then told the police that he had confessed to killing Sophie as part of a plot to overthrow the Imperial Family (or some such nonsense), and that I had just dispensed justice (or some such nonsense).Why does Junior need Sophie, an Austrian, to win over the Hungarians? If he has killed before, then why the sudden uproar over the 'demise' of the stiff-as-a-board Sophie (especially as played by the stiff-as-a-board Biel)? And why does Junior want to overthrow Daddy when he's next in line? Makes sense to me, too!I was bothered by how Junior's guests openly mocked him. That, kids, is treason, and, in the real world, they would have been dragged out of the palace by their snooty heels, and shot!The film is as gorgeous as the leads are lame. Norton, Biel, Giamatti and Sewell speak with some quasi-British accent, while the supporting cast sound like refugees from an Aussie stock company.

No matter the situation in this movie - that the man who has befriended him is his father; that he is to become a father; that his foster mother has died (the body count here puts Jason and Freddy Krueger to shame) - Pitt reacts with a blank stare! I bet when Angelina informed him that she was preggers the first time, and Pitt responded with that stare, she got Lara Croft on his retarded ass!The clichés would make the folks at Hallmark puke! And the explanation of the 'fates' which 'conspired' to destroy Daisy's career when, in fact, she had no one to blame but her fool self, was obscene! Even more obscene is the portrayal of African-Americans as a bunch of wide-eyed rubes who scream 'Praise Jesus' at the drop of a hat!'Curious' how Blanchett's face was airbrushed, but Pitt - who has an 'I am SO hunky' moment on a motorcycle - doesn't get the airbrush treatment! From '1962' on, he looks exactly the same (complete with that stare)! Also 'curious' is how Benjamin catches The Beatles on Ed Sullivan, but was AWOL when JFK's head was blown off three months earlier! He was also out to lunch during The Great Depression, Germany's assault on Murmansk (while he was IN Murmansk!), The Cold War, The Civil Rights Movement, The Moon Landing, and Vietnam, just to name a few minor events.Why wasn't Button reported when he snatched Benjamin? How could a black woman get away with raising a white baby in the Jim Crow South? How could the 'old' Benjamin bone a whore like an 18 year old on Viagra? How did he know Elizabeth's hubby was a spy? Why does Daisy accept him bailing on her, then accept him showing up years later? Why does he expect her to take care of him? Why does she keep him a secret from their daughter? Why does he talk like a Toaist Nike commercial? How is it that he never registers a blip on anyone's radar? More importantly, how does this hack Eric Roth keep getting work?If F.

Million Dollar Baby," Sucker Punch!
","900 years ago, the Britons invaded Ireland with the intent on eliminating the Irish race. Those who weren't enslaved were killed. Irish women were forcibly mated with Scottish men so that they would bear Scottish children; their descendants are the Protestants in Northern Ireland. I mention this to give an idea of how utterly insulting it is for a person named Maggie Fitzgerald to be ushered into an arena with bagpipes! But, hey, why do you expect her Gaelic-reading trainer to be up on Irish history when he doesn't even notice that her robe should read 'mo chuisle,' not 'mo cuishle'?Why doesn't Frankie just visit his daughter, and ask her what the hell her problem is? Maggie gets a title shot, but no reporters show up at the gym, nor does she get a single piece of fan mail! Even before she gets to that point, Maggie should have gotten representation, and Frankie should have been dealing with promoters, but I guess Don King and Bob Arum don't do girl fights! Even those who don't follow boxing know that the stool is put out after the fighter reaches his corner! Frankie doesn't raise hell with the boxing commission after the fight! Maggie tells her family to shove it then dies without a Will, automatically leaving them her estate!But it was her 'If I'm too old for (boxing) then I got nothing' that's the real hit below the belt! Go to college? Join the military? Find a rich old geezer? Forget Billie (and Frankie's 'sage advice' to 'hit her in the tits'), that no options are presented to Maggie is proof that Eastwood has a serious problem with women! Why critics kiss Dirty Harry's ass, but refuse to call him on his misogyny is beyond me!The narration, chocked with stupid metaphors, is useless!

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Boy George's Big Lie!
","So what if the Verona cables proved there were Communists in our mists, and Khrushchev's memoirs confirmed the Rosenbergs committed treason, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' will make those who share Boy George Clooney's world-view (especially Oscar voters) want to hug themselves.The irony of using African-American Dianne Reeves to underscore the 'crusade' being launched by Murrow and his lilly-white staff is totally lost on Clooney. He isn't much of a director, either: the pacing is sluggish, the scenes are poorly blocked, the characters are not fleshed out, and a sub-plot goes nowhere. To top it off, he decides some gay-bashing is in order. That Clooney socks it to Liberace, of all people, and is being given a pass by the media, is despicable.McCarthy did not create the blacklist; he did not blacklist Larry Parks for naming names and Zero Mostel for not naming names and Faye Grant for speaking out at a colleague's funeral while 'friendly witnesses' Ronald Reagan and Gary Cooper went on with their lives -- Hollywood did. CBS blacklisted numerous artists as well, which Murrow surely knew of, but Clooney ignores. He provides very little background about the hearings or any historical context; he hopes those going in won't be up on the minutia.He uses McCarthy's claim of 200 card-carrying Communists in the State Department to lead the audience to believe the basis for the 'witch-hunt' was false. Eisenhower finally put the brakes on McCarthy, partly because of his police-state tactics, but mostly because he had set his sights on the President's cabinet. And, despite what Clooney insinuates by closing with Ike extolling the virtues of American society, including the right to self-determination, he never publicly denounced McCarthy.At one point, Paley says McCarthy wants William F. Buckley to do his rebuttal to Murrow's attacks; Clooney doesn't tell you that Murrow refused because he knew that Buckley would have ripped his pompous ass to shreds in a debate.Too bad Boy George didn't explore instead how the Fourth Estate destroys innocent lives - as Richard Jewell and Wen Ho Lee can tell you - without fear of reprisal. But what do you expect from a self-righteous twit who declared that Charlton Heston deserves to get Alzheimer's? I don't care what your political affiliations are, no one deserves to get Alzheimer's!And, how cheeky of Clooney not to mention that Time magazine's founder Henry Luce backed Tailgunner Joe. Could it be it's because his baby's distributor is a subsidiary of Time-Warner? Nah!",3,18,49,6 October 2005

After you stop laughing, remember how Tommy moves from one rock piece to the other? He does an inverted swing so that he winds up as though he were being crucified!

But then, that would make way too much sense, and 'sense' is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having!Say what you will about Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Don't tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting 'Come on, come on, hit me' à la Jack? Batman doesn't turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed 'agent of chaos', every one of The Joker's actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up 'chaos' in the dictionary!Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but let's be real: if he hadn't died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldn't have sprung up, and he wouldn't have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said!And it's 'close to the vest', NOT 'close to the chest'!

Elizabeth should be tweaking Darcy in the scene where he's at his desk, but Knightley delivers these zingers like lead balloons! This was how Elizabeth and Darcy courted, movie people!Then it just dragged on and on! When Darcy makes his big speech, I couldn't stop laughing! Only Judi Dench (bless her!) got that Austen's opus is as much about the class system as it was about two people who'd rather slit their throats than admit their love! I had no idea why this Elizabeth and Darcy hooked up, and I didn't care! Another PPV $3.99 I'll never get back!",2,4,9,31 May 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Charlie Kaufman is not The Second Coming
","Caught this last night. I ask those proclaiming Charlie Kaufman The Second Coming to remember the card sent to Joel's friends asking them to not tell him Clementine had him zapped. Seeing him again neither re-triggers her memory or fries her brain, so what possible reason is there NOT to tell him? And what about the woman with the mementos of her dead dog? Do these 'geniuses' send out cards informing Buster's pals that his mistress has had him zapped, so please don't mention it to him? It's the stupidest plot device I've seen in ages!The nature of the sub-conscious is never explored, or how memory is intertwined with thought, or how the most random sight, smell or touch can trigger the most deep-seated memory. We not only dream of people (and pets) no longer a part of our lives, but of people we've never met. How do you zap that? And what happens if a person somehow reconnects with what they had zapped? Kaufman doesn't even begin to address any of this.He then trots out his trademark Twits Behaving Badly: the minions raid Joel's fridge, smoke pot, and dance on his bed with the stereo full blast; Mary tries to seduce Stan; Patrick swipes Joel's gift for Clementine so he can score with her; the Doctor zaps Mary's memory so his wife won't find out they've been playing doctor! Yuk, yuk!Kaufman also has a serious problem with women: Clementine, as are most of his heroines, is a total wack job who should never be allowed to reproduce, and Joel (a passive-aggressive wuss if ever there was one) shouldn't apologize for stating the obvious. After all, relationships are supposed to be based on honesty, especially when the truth hurts!",2,4,10,20 March 2006
La La Land," Better Than I Expected... Which Isn't Saying Much!
","Aside from the clichÃ©-ridden 'plot' you've seen a bazillion times, I was reminded constantly that people who have 'made it' are playing people trying to 'make it'. Had this been cast with people who actually need that 'big break', I might have been able to forgive the clichÃ©-ridden 'plot', and hopped on board.Gosling and Stone have zero range, and their roles make their 'abilities' only stick out like sore thumbs: can't sing; can't dance; can't act. Seriously, how much did Stone's team pony up for her to bag an Oscar? She is an 'actress' playing an 'actress', but couldn't convince me of even that! And Gosling is nothing but droopy locks and a grin. Unfortunately, 'thanks' to Eva Mendes, we can't ship Droopy Locks back to Canada until she kicks him to the curb or their kids turn 18!Four more beefs:1) Stone skips town because her 'brilliant' one-woman show flops, forcing the theater owners to eat the money she owes them; that DOES NOT happen in real life.2) Who the hell blows beaucoup bucks on a band with NO SHOT of charting in the Top 100?!3) Gosling proclaims that jazz is dying -- which 'explains' the hordes of 20-somethings at his jazz club!4) I lived in Boulder City. The name of the library is... the Boulder City Public Library! The film's assistant prop manager is supposedly from Boulder City, but didn't set the hack - sorry, director - straight, I assume, because she didn't want to lose her job.Speaking of jobs, Earth to John Legend: don't quit your day job (whatever that is).",2,1,3,6 October 2017
The Red Violin," Out of tune!
","'Le Violon rouge,' which I just caught on IFC, is gorgeous, but as lame-brained as a Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster. But hey, if we were following logic, the film makers wouldn't have an excuse to blow millions of other peoples' money!Forget figuring out how it found its way to the monastery, I expected the teacher to take it after he learned it had been buried with his Mozart wanna-be (all that hard work he put into the kid for nothing). Instead, in a truly laughable montage, some gypsies rob the grave, fiddle with the violin, then sail to England, where it's given it to a Mick Jagger wanna-be in exchange for being allowed to stay on his lands.Our 'hero' next pops up on a ship with a destitute Chinese seafarer. By now, I didn't bother to wonder how a destitute Chinese seafarer wound up with this priceless object for fear what was left of my brain cells would explode! So do the Western music-hating Maoists toss the violin into a bonfire when they find it at the teacher's house? Heck no, they hold onto it for at least 30 years until they consign it to a Montreal auction house! Makes sense to me, too! That's when Mr. Bad Ass Himself, Samuel L. Jackson, decides it'll make a really neat present for his kid!As if the film makers decided to see just how lame-brained they could get, what does the curator do when she realizes the violin up for bids isn't THE violin? Nothing! Here's hoping she and everyone else (especially Mr. Bad Ass Himself) can land jobs at Wal Mart after the winner realizes he got hosed big time!",3,6,14,19 November 2005
Some Like It Hot," 'No pastry, no butter, and no Sugar!'
","After being sanctimoniously warned by Joe about his lust, why would Jerry help him woo Sugar by allowing Osgood to romance him, especially after blasting Joe for his Junior act?Sugar thinks Junior is loaded, but he's such a jerk, why is she so willing? How could Joe fit into Beinstock's clothes? How did he know what kind of clothes Beinstock had packed to begin with? How could Jerry fit into the bellhop's uniform? Why did everyone accept Joe and Jerry as women except Spats and his thugs? Despite the fact that Mulligan is there, and the hotel is a public place, Little Bonaparte orders a hit. Makes sense to me, too!How did Sugar know Joe had gone to the pier after he was chased out of the ballroom by Little Bonaparte's goons? And even if her bicycle was jet-propelled, there is no way in hell she could have gotten there before he, Jerry, and Osgood shoved off!But it's so terrific and so perfectly executed with its perfect cast, you're more than happy to forgive its many faults. While I loved Monroe's performance, this pup is Lemmon's all the way! The scene with Monroe in the train berth and with Curtis after their dates make me scream every time!",9,7,11,2 September 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Dumb and Dumber!
","If you're going to make a film for grown-ups, treat the audience like grown-ups. Instead, Opie extracts the aspects of John Nash's life and person he decided we grown-ups couldn't handle. Gone is Nash's racism, snobbery, arrest for indecent exposure, history of violent behavior, messy relationships with both sexes, the woman and son he abandoned, the voices that told him aliens were transmitting messages to him via the New York Times, the repeated stays at various loony bins, the nine months he spent wandering Europe trying to renounce his citizenship, the fact that Alicia divorced him in 1963, and that their son is schizophrenic. In short, gone is everything about Nash that made him such a enigmatic yet despicable human being to begin with.The whitewashing doesn't end there. Parcher calling Joe McCarthy 'an idiot', and proclaiming how the atomic bombs 'evaporated 150,000 people' has no business being in the movie, as such 'opinions' were totally foreign to most Americans, and certainly to those who worked for the government (even those who were figments of one's imagination).Crowe as Rain Man and Connelly as the Long-Suffering Wife does not tell us what kept (and keeps) Nash and Alicia together. The cruel irony that a man who finessed a mathematical theory of rational behavior should succumb to insanity is totally lost on Opie and fellow hack Akiva Goldsman. Instead, they suggest that if you learn to 'ignore' your imaginary friends, then you will be 'cured' of whatever ails you. It's a false and outrageous notion.",2,10,19,17 February 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Brangelina!
","The problem with 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is not the rope-a-dope script, the flatter-than-a-pancake delivery by the too-yummy leads, or even the misogyny (is 312 the number of people Jane has offed or slept with?), it's the reason John and Jane find themselves on their respective agencies' hit lists: why it takes five (or six) years for their bosses to decide that John and Jane being Mr. and Mrs. is 'bad for business' (whatever that means) is beyond me!Because John already knows what Jane does when they meet (he sees her slip the knife she just used to dispatch The Barracuda into its sheath), the whole premise of the film is bogus. Even stupider is the idea of the agencies jeopardizing the lives of countless of innocent people AND allowing the FBI to buy their ruse, just to take out two of their own! So who's trying to take out John and Jane at Home Made: his agency, her agency, the FBI or all three? Your guess is as good as mine!Though Brad and Angelina are no Butch and Sundance, and they didn't give me a single reason to like them, I found myself actually rooting for them, which, in light of what's gone down, sickens me. When Bruce Springsteen decided to humiliate his wife by flaunting his affair with his backup singer, I remember the overwhelming reaction was a collective: 'You go, Boss!' I remarked to someone at the time that if Madonna cheated on Sean Penn, she'd be crucified by the same retards who were giving Springsteen their seal of approval. To see the dance the media did around Brad's adultery is to realize the hell Jennifer would have been put through had she decided to do the horizontal mamba with the co-star of her latest film. The more things change, sadly, the more they stay the same.",2,1,5,14 January 2006
Ice Age," cold... in more ways than one.
","Who decided that characters getting pummeled, squished, slammed, zapped, whacked, and impaled is funny? Yet, as I cringed while Scrat and Sid were forced to endure one indignity after another, the kids and parents around me were laughing their butts off. Somehow, this didn't surprise me.Although it implied some of the violence and death, I found 'Ice Age' to be unusually cruel. I was especially disturbed by the dodo bird sequence. It was not only historically inaccurate, it was vicious. Good thing they've been extinct since 1681, otherwise, Fox would be shilling out mucho dinero to the dodos and their lawyers. And, the watermelon concern also has grounds for a big-time lawsuit as well.Shamelessly manipulative and paint-by-the-numbers, it's no better than Disney's recent offerings. Manfred's story was an obvious play for our sympathies, but he's not likable to begin with, so it was hard to empathize with him.My hopes were raised when Diego comments that the baby will become a hunter and he might, someday, hunt them! But the film makers didn't have the guts to explore the moral and ethical questions just raised, especially in light of Manfred's story. It reminded me of the soldiers in 'Saving Private Ryan' discussing the stupidity of 8 guys risking their lives to save one then the issue being dropped: it was patronizing and insulting.And why did they add on that coda? Talk about cold! Hadn't Scrat suffered enough? Leave the poor thing (and his acorn) alone!",3,5,10,16 March 2002
Stranger Than Fiction," Dumber Than Dumb!
","The wacko novelist whose idea of research is fantasizing about what it would be like to jump off a building. The assistant the publisher sends over to make sure the wacko novelist meets her deadline (only in the movies are novelists wacko and have deadlines). The obsessive-compulsive bureaucrat who owns a wristwatch that has a mind of its own! The Bohemian capitalist who apparently thinks 9/11 would have been avoided had Osama bin Laden been pummeled with her cookies! The literature professor who doesn't know that comedy and tragedy are genres, and is so obsessed with the wacko novelist, he has built his sham career on her nauseating ditty 'Little did he realize.'Just when you think it couldn't get any stupider, it does. IRS auditors who never use calculators. Wrecking crews that tear down the wrong building. A stranger who sets his watch four minutes too fast but doesn't tell the obsessive-compulsive bureaucrat who asks for the time, then is at the bus stop the next day just in time to save the brat who cuts in front of rush hour traffic because - you guessed it! - his watch is four minutes too fast (you would think that his watch would *know* it was four minutes too fast and re-set itself, but I digress)! The only good thing I can say about this exercise in nit-witted self-consciousness is that I saved $3.99 I would have blown watching it on PPV.",2,2,12,13 October 2007
The Reader," Sympathy for the She-Devil!
","As one poster put it, The Reader is pretentious cheese. Stupid, pretentious cheese! Only in the movies does a girl who finds a boy drenched to the skin and puking his guts out not ask him for his number so that she can phone his parents. Instead, she washes the vomit off the cobblestones (first things first!), gives him a hug (huh?), then walks him home as it begins to snow! After 5 minutes in bed with scarlet fever, the boy tracks down his angel of mercy, spies on her, shovels coal for her, gets naked for her, then lets her have at his scrawny, underage bones. Only in the movies.The scrawny, underage bone-jumping continues throughout the summer without anyone wondering where the boy goes or what he does or whom he does it with. Turns out Scrawny Underage Bone-Jumper is (surprise!) not exactly the kind of girl you'd bring home to Mother. But since she's played by Kate Winslet, whom, like Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, and (in her salad days) Helen Mirren, drops her drawers the way you and I breathe, what scrawny, underage Boy Toy (who gets his own naughty bits moment when Winslet scrubs him down) is going to have a problem with that?So what's my problem with this stupid, pretentious cheese, aside from Winslet's God-awful geezer make-up? For starters, the German characters have British accents! Hey, you guys are getting paid good money to be in this stupid, pretentious cheese. Would it kill you to do a German accent?Fiennes's performance consists of 'I'm constipated!' and 'I'm really, really constipated!', while Winslet's is one great, big 'Look at me! I'm acting!' She-Devil, who is tried for allowing a church full of women and children to burn to the ground, bawls like a baby as she watches a children's choir perform? Spare us! And when she is told that she's getting a promotion, Winslet looks as though she wants to throttle somebody (maybe her agent)!Fiennes, whose lone resemblance to Boy Toy is that they're both zonked, gives a woman, whom, as a child, was one of She-Devil's 'charges', She-Devil's life savings. I didn't know which was more patently-absurd: giving a woman who lives in a 7-figure Manhattan flat a tiny wad of bills or her telling Boy Toy to donate the 'blood money' to a Gentile literacy group (Jews, she snootily informs him, hardly have a problem with illiteracy!), but she'll keep the tin that it came in. Wait -- isn't the tin tainted because it contained the 'blood money', and, worse, it seriously-clashes with the decor?",3,4,12,27 March 2010
Hancock," It's a Bird, it's a Plane, it's Lame-Brain!
","It may interest those praising Hancock for having a black superhero that the original script, which is online, doesn't specify his race. He's just your garden-variety sleaze who drinks, smokes, swears, screws, and lusts after Mary, who doesn't have superpowers. The Ray character is a department store security guard named - are you ready? - Horus Longfellow! In short, the script was retooled-by-committee so that The Fresh Prince could play action hero! Goody-goody!Does anyone find it funny how a movie that suffers from massive bouts of homophobia would have a scene of its star lying on his stomach... on a cot... in a jail cell... with his backside straight up?As Spiderman can tell you, superheroes get paid squat. Even Batman, with all of his bazillions, has to work for a living. So, how does our hero earn his keep? Uh, now that I think about the scene with that ho in the trailer, forget I asked.Just how ridiculous is Hancock? Mary warns John that she'll kill him if Ray learns of her superpowers, then they have the obligatory downtown showdown, causing millions in damages. Makes sense to me, too.Ray is a successful yet properly guilt-ridden white liberal who treats Hancock like a 2 year old. Even how he thanks him for saving his life is despicably patronizing.John and Mary have been on-again/off-again since 4 B.C., but they're toxic to each other? Sounds like a typical relationship. That bit of info is followed by an idiotic monologue about how 'they made us in pairs'. Who were 'they'? How and why did 'they' choose John and Mary? Being 'made in pairs' means that John and Mary 'are' identical. Did 'they' give John and Mary the ability to morph into different races and ethnicities or was that something that they developed? What happened to our lovebirds between 4 B.C. and 1850? More importantly, why do I care?When John didn't tear into Ray and the other retards for ignoring the railroad crossing signals, the film lost me. John should have let the train 'teach' them all a lesson. I know I would have!",2,1,5,23 June 2009
Hitch," Stupid Cupid!
","As if the Fresh Prince playing cupid wasn't stupid enough, this self-proclaimed 'cure for the common man' spews out the most inane bits of 'wisdom': Look her in the eyes! Hear what she isn't saying! Focus! Focus! FOCUS! I lost it when we learn what led Sugar Bear to become Tony Robbins. Uh, when a guy gets screwed over like that, he doesn't turn into Cyrano de Bergerac, he turns into the Marquis de Sade! I never bought that Stupid Cupid could get the hots for that ball-busting bitch (but seeing whom Mrs. Fresh Prince is, I digress). I thought it'd make more sense for Stupid Cupid to hook Porky up with Ball-Busting Bitch while he tried to score with Paris Hilton.Starz -- if you want my $12 per month, you gotta do A LOT better than this!",2,1,2,22 April 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 'If you're not with me, then you're my enemy!' 'Only a Sith deals in absolutes!'
","Finally caught this on PPV. As reams have been written about this final chapter, I'll be brief.Some want to see Palpatine as a stand-in for a certain world leader, and refer to the above exchange as 'proof' Georgie-boy shares their view. But they're giving him WAY too much credit! Lucas is a hack, period! Plot, dialog, character development, logic, and cohesiveness are concepts he has proved time and again totally escape him! It's no coincidence his best films have been written and directed by others. 'Only a Sith deals in absolutes!' And a Jedi doesn't? Since when?Speaking of plot and logic, if Anakin had a working brain cell, he'd play the Jedi and the Sith against each other, sit back as they destroy each other, then take over what's left of Dodge as its undisputed, all-powerful sheriff with no prune-faced hunchback or pointy-eared green midget to answer to!There were times I felt I was stuck in a bad video game (the showdown between Anakin and Obi-Wan); other times, the visuals were really cool (Obi-Wan and Grievous.) The inconsistency of the CGI could stand as a metaphor for all six episodes!But what really sent me was how easily the Jedi betray their lofty ideals at their moment of crisis. Instead of bringing Palpatine to justice, Windu goes vigilante, and Obi-Wan abandons Anakin as he endures utter agony. So much for Yoda's lectures on how fear and hatred are fast-tracks to The Dark Side, yadda, yadda, yadda.Watching Hayden Christensen, I could only think of the injustice of it all: thousands of actors have more talent in their pinky than this guy has in his whole body, yet he has a place in movie history because he happened to be at the right place at the right time!",2,1,3,3 January 2006
The Good Shepherd," Baa, Baa, Baa!
","Ever wonder how 10 - count 'em, 10! - Oscar winners can make a mess of a movie? Me neither, but Robert De Niro has been 'kind' enough to provide the answer!I don't know what was sillier: Matt Damon mud-wrestling before his Skull & Bones buddies and getting peed on for his troubles, Angelina Jolie - whom famously slept with another woman's husband - getting all huffy over Matt's fooling around, or the Hitler-loving Professor teaching Matt how to be a spy! Oh, and did anyone else wonder how Vito Corleone wound up head of the OSS in this WASP Paradise?Racist, sexist, homophobic, and boring, The Good Shepherd not only has the most lavish shotgun wedding I've ever seen, but throughout the 22 years it covers, Matty-Boy doesn't age one bit -- must be that burr he has planted firmly up his dull, snooty ass!",2,2,7,14 May 2007
The Queen," I couldn't stop laughing!
","I confess that silly me allowed myself to get caught up in the orgy of grief after Diana got all smashed up because she didn't buckle up (let that be a lesson to you, kids) until I watched George Clooney hold a press conference to self-righteously slam the media for their 'role' in her death, then the celebrities at the funeral waving to the crowd as though they were at a premiere! Who the hell invited Richard Branson, Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg and Elton John, I wondered? Then it occurred to me this was what 'Shy Di' was all about: a frivolous, utterly shallow creature whose concern for the less-fortunate lasted as long as it took the cameras to get her good side!'The Queen' is a total goof: Blair babbling like a schoolboy; the Mrs. shooting blood out of her eyes at the mere mention of the Royals; Campbell getting a boner every time Blair's popularity spikes; Charles's reaction and his crocodile tears at Diana's casket; the Queen Mum and Philip popping off like a pair of drunken sailors; the stag in slow-motion (a sick metaphor for you-know-who). It all ends with the PM patronizingly praising his Monarch on a job well-done, only to be warned that he, too, will suffer the peoples' wrath if he doesn't watch it (a jab at Blair's support of Bush)! Who cares if any of this actually went down? I couldn't stop laughing!",2,9,18,9 June 2007
Vanilla Sky," I love me! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
","Finally saw this on Bravo last night. Cameron Crowe wants you to think 'Vanilla Sky' is a remake of 'Abre Los Ojos,' but don't you believe it! It's actually a coked-up version of that 'Seinfeld' episode where Jerry meets his soul mate, and finally realizes why all his prior relationships have failed: 'I've been waiting for ME to come along!'David is a selfish prick, which is why he demeans the giving Julie as a 'f--- buddy.' As if the gods hear his prayers, selfish prick Sophia crashes his party. Jabbing him with put-downs until he's punch-drunk with lust, they hit the sack and she coos: 'Do you love me? I mean really love me. Because if you don't, I'll just have to kill you.' Oh, you crazy kids!Because this is Cameron Crowe, our hero is obliged to tell us who his favorite Beatle is. This wouldn't be because Paul McCartney wrote the theme, the best song he's cranked out in ages? Unfortunately for Sir Mop Top, the Academy decided to finally end the comparisons between Randy Newman (bless him) and Susan Lucci (bless her).In a display of shameless narcissism, Cruise does English Patient-Lite because he knows the critics will give him brownie points for 'taking risks.' Among the masks he carts around like Linus's security blanket is a lavender one! Is Crowe daring to poke fun at his producer and those I'm Not Gay lawsuits he tosses around like confetti? Boy Howdy!And I don't know about you, but Penélope Cruz morphing into Cameron Diaz is definitely NOT my idea of a nightmare!",2,2,5,15 October 2005
La Vie En Rose," Sacré Bleu!
","Observations from watching this yesterday:1) This Édith Piaf is a cold, heartless bitch, unworthy of any sympathy! She lost me when she told her begging mother to 'Eat sh*t!' Yeah, Mom abandoned her, but that was plain vicious. So when Pop (looking like Fidel Castro) lets his baby get smacked and hauled off by Asso, I cheered!2) Little Édith befriended by two whores in Grandma's brothel, only to have her torn away from them by Pop in a reenactment of the Elián González raid? Not even Spielberg is that shameless!3) Édith as an adult looks like a crack whore, then Madonna in 'Like a Prayer', then a drag queen doing Judy Garland as The Hunchback of Notre Dame.4) Édith is never shown in a recording studio, yet a montage shows her records being pressed. That's a real neat trick!5) Édith's movie career is ignored.6) Édith's association with Communists and the fact that she performed for the Nazis are also ignored.7) Édith complains that the Americans don't 'get her', yet they give her a standing ovation. Guess the Frenchies who give her standing ovations here didn't 'get her', either.8) Édith being in awe of fellow self-absorbed chanteuse Marlene Dietrich? Please!9) Cerdan beat Tony Zale to win the Middleweight Title on 21 September 1948; the caption that tells us Édith is in New York says '1947'.10) The fight has Cerdan towering over Zale. In fact, they were the same height (5'8') and roughly the same weight (154).11) Édith's wailing and wailing AND WAILING over Cerdan has to be the campiest moment since the 'no more wire hangers, ever!' bit in Mommie Dearest.12) 'Non, je ne regrette rien' was written in 1956, yet Édith didn't know of it until it was played for her 4 years later? Yeah, right!",2,20,38,7 January 2008
Amélie," Crazy!
","Another reason why you should never buy the hype. Aside from the Gnome, everyone is crazy or irritating or unpleasant or all three. The narration was pointless. The cinematography and editing and music were nauseating. Paris, one of the filthiest cities on the planet, is unrecognizably spic and span! But what really had my panties in a bunch was how Jeunet teases us with Nino smiling at the photo booth repairman, but doesn't have the guts to go through with the homo-eroticism he just threw in! Instead, Crazy Boy Nino finally (and I mean finally) hooks up with Crazy Girl Amélie, and they (and the Gnome) live crazily ever after!BTW, unless you get off reading microscopic print, don't get the DVD -- it'll drive you crazy!",2,7,16,17 August 2002
V for Vendetta," V for Vapid
","Those who've dissed Alan Moore as a sour-puss for refusing to give his OK to V for Vendetta should read what he told MTV: '(My comic) has been turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country... (The film) is a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neo-conservatives - which is not what 'V for Vendetta' was about.'Indeed, I was reminded of the guys who flood the blogs with cries of Impeach Bush, as if actually booting him out will make the world safe for Ding-Dongs again. Impeach Bush, and guess who gets to be Prez? Elmer Fudd Cheney! In other words, V isn't very well thought out. Stuffed like a turkey with pretentious diatribes only Harold Pinter could love, it is a boring exercise in didactic propaganda meant to appeal to the narcissistic fantasies of teenage boys, complete with the hot babe falling for the nerd! It wants us to believe that we are living under a totalitarian regime. The irony that no totalitarian regime would ever allow V to be made is lost on those behind it! Try making a movie in Cuba that takes potshots at Papa Fidel, and see how far you get!All I got out of V is that: 1) Natalie Portman wants to be Joan of Arc when she grows up; 2) the Wachowskis know how to blow things up real good; and 3) $50 million doesn't go as far as it used to! Too bad V doesn't share the romanticism of Larry Wachowski, who left his wife for a dominatrix and now lives as preoperative transsexual Laurenca! Now, THAT'S a movie just begging to be made!",2,12,34,17 March 2006
