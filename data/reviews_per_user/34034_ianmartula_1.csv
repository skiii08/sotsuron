Hereditary," Don't listen to the haters !
","This was genuinely one of the first Horror movies I've seen in theaters that made me want to buy another ticket right after the movie ended. If you pay attention to the storyline, this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps at least 3 times during the run time. The ending is twisted and can't be forgotten, as when I saw it in theaters, it made me stand in my seat with disbelief. 11/10 if I could give it that score.",10,2,5,1 January 2020
