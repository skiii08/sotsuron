Scarface," Cult
","An instant classic, a cult film for every film lover in the world.A film that will stay in the history of cinema for ever, for it's over the top violence, it's crude but sometimes very funny dialog and especially for the performance of Al Pacino, that I consider has one of his best, and maybe the best performance ever given by an actor. I also consider Scarface has Brian De Palma's finest film, from the stock footage opening to the introduction of Tony Montana in a close up all the way to the fall of the character and the bloody final, everything is just perfect, from the light to the music.Scarface for me is one of the few films that people must own on DVD or at least watch once.",10,0,1,4 June 2007
Grindhouse," A Masterpiece
","I'm from the Netherlands and the film here is being split.But I had the chance of seeing it has a double feature during a trip to New York.I loved the film, a pure experience at the cinema, some people might think it is a guy film, but it is not, it is a film for everyone who loves movies.About the films.Planet Terror, my favorite : Pure Mayhem, so over the top, so outrageous that it is great. A homage to the old grind-house film, with loads of gore and action.Death Proof : Much Slower, I really didn't like it to much, I think Tarantino made an actual grind-house film instead of paying tribute to the genre, and that is the problem because grind-house films where bad films to begin with.Now the trailers.Machete : Great character played by Danny Trejo.Werewolf Women of the SS : My favorite, outrageous and in the vain of Isla she wolf of the SS Don't : Really funny Thanksgiving : Really looked like an old grind-house trailer.I think Grindhouse will go down in history has a cult favorite.",10,0,2,3 June 2007
