Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For the love of God, please remake this movie (and the following 2 sequels)..
","No, I AM NOT a random Trekkie blasting Star Wars franchise, rather I am a die-hard Star Wars fan. First time I watched this movie, apparently I wasn't that smart. I thought it was good enough and worthy of SW franchise. Move forward 20 years later, however, when I tried (albeit cautiously) to re-watch this movie, I found this movie was really UNBEARABLE and UNWATCHABLE at the same time. Watching this had been my cross to bear. I was never the one who walked out of movie no matter how bad it was but thank goodness this time I could just pause the streaming and come back the following days. It took me about 7 days and a pink eye to finish this movie finally.Plot was too thin. No background whatsoever about Naboo let alone Anakin's father whom he might inherit his uusually high midi-cholorian presumably. Jar Jar was everybody's perennial opposite of acquired taste. He as worse as the screen time progressed. He was so legendary that everybody who ruined something would be refered to as Jar Jar of SW (yeah that included you, Jar Jar Abrams).I would petition the studio to withdraw this un-intellectual property and give refunds to people who bought DVDs or soft copies and later REMAKE the prequels in its entirety. No future generations should endure the agony of watching Schmantom Menace...",1,0,6,24 April 2020
Captain Marvel," You don't need to watch this movie before Avengers End Game.
","I had high hope for this movie. Girl power. Checked. Tight suit. Checked. Kick-ass fire spitting hands. Checked. But that was all. The script is super weak. Supporting characters are disappointing at best. I was expecting Sam L. Jackson to kick some serious aliens' asses for the first Marvel movie that put him on the major spotlight. I hope Jude Law would redeem himself after the last disaster with unwatchable Fantastic Beast movie but he also failed spectacularly.
In short, behold: This is the definite weakest link in the Marvel Universe. This would make Aquaman an Oscar worthy picture.",1,37,62,9 March 2019
Knives Out," Excellent movie, but ONE thing bothered me....
","Well acted, scripted... fun for all the mystery lovers out there. However I had ONE issue that came to mind, a while after I returned home from the movie. I would've given it a perfect 10 otherwise.After the injection incident, Harlan carefully plotted an elaborate exit strategy for Marta which would take him at least 10 minutes to explain. He would've died within that time frame if the medical explanation held true. BUT he didn't die... should he wait another while before ending his own life? He would've realized everything was FINE with him afterall. But then again, the movie wouldn't have been made. My bad...",9,0,6,10 December 2019
Dunkirk," Great Disillusion... Complete Snorefest...
","Ok, the consensus is if it was Nolan's then it has to be Gold.WRONG!!!I am not a critic, but I am a fervent movie lover. I love Nolan in Batman Trilogy, Interstellar but I TRULY hated Interception and of course this movie. On a positive note, this movie is a CURE to INSOMNIA.",1,6,8,9 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Thanks to endgame, random fat guys with beer bellies can be Thor at comic con and it'll be okay...
","First, I am a HUGE Infinity Wars fan.. I even collected expansive statues re-enacting the epic battle in my shelves (after winning infinity style war with my wife of course).As predicted, the Director made the end sappy enough for some to shed tears. I was shedding tears myself on the account I would never make the insane amount of money the actors (main casts) did. The first two hour was a total drag, it was as if the Director owes 3 hours to the audience or maybe in a more sinister manner they believe epic movie should run at least 3 hours (Hence... 3 hours 1 minute including credits).My major concern was the TIME TRAVELING plot which disregarded paradoxical continuity. Again, I am not a hater. I just found it highly inefficient if not plain stupid to have the remaining Avengers to go back in different TIMEs and PLACEs to collect each individual stone (the SOUL stone requires SACRIFICE!... duh). Would it be easier if they just went BACK in TIME (along with Captain Marvel this time) to the planet where Iron Man & friends battled Thanos and stripped him off the gauntlet which was already full of stones? If they did this, there wouldn't be any needs of casualty. Vision would be spared. Scarlet witch wouldn't need to be as traumatic then.Well, TIME HEIST damage has been done, but AGAIN:
1. Why didn't the future Nebula died instantly when she killed her PAST self? Turned out JC wasn't the only one to get resurrected afterall.
2. Why on earth did Iron Man have to conjure the gauntlet onto himself while risking DEATH? Why can't he instead put the gauntlet on Captain Marvel or HULK (who did it once and survived) or Thor and let them SNAP the hell of it? They were sorta IMMORTALS member of the Avengers with strength that most likely will withstand the impact anyway. But no, Stark had to get the end credit.
3. Finally, LOKI should've been brought to LIFE as the TIME TRAVELling thing would cancel out the event in which LOKI was killed by Thanos.I felt like this was an anticlimax to the flawless Infinity Wars... sorry Stan. If you want a better time traveling movie, go see 'Back to the future' or even 'Hot-tub time machine'.. and 'Bill and Ted's excellent Adventure'",7,227,563,24 April 2019
Godzilla," Combo of Mediocre acting (yes you, Aaron Taylor Johnson), Weak Script, Bad CGI.
","Clearly the studio made a HUGE mistake by casting the always weak Taylor Johnson. That dude can barely act. His unbelievable expression just ruined the movie in its entirety. This, in addition to weak script, uninspired performances by other actor like Olsen, Watanabe and extremely short Godzilla screen time had just cost me 2 hours of my life.",1,1,4,13 September 2019
