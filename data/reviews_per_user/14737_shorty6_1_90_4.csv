Lucky Number Slevin," Shock and Awe
","Josh Hartnett plays the role of Slevin a man mistaken as a friend of his Nick Fischer if only that were the whole story...Bruce Willis plays his usual role as a calm and collected bad ass. Morgan Freeman plays one of his few roles as an antagonist. A story of revenge, deceit, double agent, and love. Every second of the film is important to the plot don't blink or you'll miss an imperative piece of the story. The movie starts with heartbreak then moves into a story that has no relativity to the beginning then at the climax everything is turned on it's head and you are completely lost until Slevin explains it all while getting revenge.",10,0,1,27 August 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Finally and NOOO!!
","I am the same age as the actors were when they started putting out these movies and yes I thought they were great as they were coming out, but now the actors as well as I are older and the happy/creative/fun/moral to the story movies are boring to us now. I love how dark and how the 'even in the world of magic' things aren't perfect these movies have become. I can't wait to see the second part to find out what happens these movies have become real contemporary thrillers and I look forward to seeing what happens next. I haven't read the book so I don't care if everyone dies in the end it will still be a fantastic trip.",Null,0,0,8 January 2011
Warrior," Captivating
","So two brothers Tommy who has recently returned from war and Brendan a former fighter who has a family to support and are the sons of an alcoholic former boxer start fighting to earn money. Brendan wants the money to save his family's livelihood and Tommy is fighting to earn it just to give it all away to a widow of a fallen comrade. They are both portrayed as protagonists however to me it seemed that in the end Brendan came out looking like the selfish ass in the end. The final fight makes me so angry because there were so many opportunities for Brendan to do what he did during the fight before the fight. Tommy's lack of taking credit for his heroic actions and him taking responsibility for something that wasn't his fault makes him the selfless protagonist the one you root for because he is so selfless, honorable, and heroic. Brendan is the person you cheer for because he is the underdog. In my opinion Brendan only won the fight because he was a cheap and manipulative fighter not a better one. The story of hate and forgiveness was sweet.",7,0,3,20 March 2012
Magic Mike XXL," Surprised at the negative reviews
","I thought this movie was great. I mean you have to remember to take it for what it is a break from reality. This film focuses on the bond between the 'colleagues' not really sure what to call them but it focuses on the problems within their friendships and more on their back stories. I feel the movie does fine without Matthew McConaughey, and benefits from the removal of the characters 'The Kid' and Brooke. I enjoyed the addition of Zoe and her friends. I found that Jada Pinkett's scenes added nothing to the movie left me feeling that her character was pointless. I laughed so hard I'm talking tears streaming stomach cramping laughter for a good portion of the movie it was very enjoyable. I actually prefer the sequel to the original. I feel part of what makes this movie so good is that unlike The Hangover 2 they strayed away from the original plot.",8,2,6,29 July 2015
