The New World," Heavyweight Kitsch, Cliché, Mumbling and Boredom
","This film started with some whispered voice-over, continued with mumbled voice-over and never stopped with mumbling and whispering... There where some beautiful shots of landscape. And for sure Q'orianka Kilcher is totally sweet, but all this is drowned in mumbling, whispering and waggonloads of chliché.You have to listen to sentences like 'Who is she?' or 'Who is he?' about 12.000 times because the actors are not speaking but continuously thinking trite bullshit.The native Americans are called (very p.c.!) naturals, not savages, like the first settlers probably would have done, and they are depicted as real childlike and naive 'noble savages'.Pocahontas is so deeply natural, constantly talking to her mother (nature!), so completely in balance with her environment that you get sick of it. And she is so holy and pure that she purifies the soul of every men falling in love with her.And civilization is completely evil and destructive. John Smith is turned into a martyr because he realizes that he is responsible for the corruption of the pure and innocent soul of America, instead of realizing that he just behaves like a stupid asshole. But the script turns his letting-her-down into a saving-her-from-evil. Yak! The music is terrible. It does not fit the time, the scenes or whatsoever.There are dozens of highly illogical scenes that just do break the continuity. Once Pocahontas is at the coast, than she is hundreds of miles upstream, in one scene the settlers and Indians are killing each other, in the next they are just staring at each other with no visible victims of the former battle, in one scene the Indians take Georgetown, burn it to the ground and kill the inhabitants, in den next the Indians are again outside the palisades, the people of Georgetown are still alive and are on the watch and so on...And when Smith finally returns to England and visits Pocahontas, now called Rebecca, he still is dressed like coming straight out of the wilderness with greasy, filthy hair and ragged leather clothe...Why 3 stars instead of 1? Just because of Q'orianka Kilcher and Christian Beale. And the fact that she finally turns down the really annoying Collin Farell who just looks like a beaten dog throughout more than 2 hours...",3,3,4,4 April 2016
Passengers," A good idea ruined by Hollywood-action-stereotypes
","In the last years most SF-movies just deal with dystopies, one darker than the other. If you grew up with Buck Rogers and Star Trek and like SF-worlds that offer an alternative way of living or at least some perspective, you will like this one - until it finally turns into crap. The plot is great, the acting is fine, there are a lot of good ideas in it, a lot of good visual effects (a swimming pool during a failure of artificial gravity...) and there is even an essential ethical issue in it - actually the moments when SF really unfolds its potential.But finally it turns into one of those completely implausible action flicks. SPOILERS: The idea that the two main characters (passengers!) are able to save the gigantic vessel is somehow far fetched in the first instance, but it could have been written in a way that would have made it plausible. If there would have been just some minor, little damage, some insignificant computer error the story would have been working. And it would have been more SF! It would have been a comment on the naiveté of men, to put their lives in the hand of machines. But, no, it has to be the impact of a meteorite! And an overload of the fusion reactor! Holes in the shell plates of the ship! And completely destroyed computer panels! And everything has to collapse right in the moment were they discover the damage! So they (a writer and a mechanic!) repair the computer within several minutes (!!!) And they know how to cool down the reactor (!!!) Find a little hatch on the outside of the gigantic ship within a few minutes and know how to open it (!!!) Then the guy is able to survive the blow-out of a fusion reactor, shielding himself with a small door (!!!) He is not even catapulted out into the vast empty space but is levitating just within reach around the ship with a cracked helmet (!!!) and she is able to get in to the space-suit so fast that she still can save him within time. Then they live happily ever after. In a paradise garden they planted on the spacecraft. With gigantic trees that had just 89 years to grow. And birds (wtf?!). Where does this bird in the last scene come from? Did it grew on a tree?Conclusion: A fine SF-movie in the first half ruined by stupid blockbuster standards in the second. What a waste of money and talent.",6,5,11,28 February 2017
Aquaman," Just terrible
","Horrible script, computer game dramaturgy, cliches galore, unbelievable naive character building, unconvincing cgi overkill... Just awful.",1,5,11,30 April 2019
Knowing," Another piece of well made fatalistic propaganda
","This film is certainly made by people who know how to make good movies. The acting is good, the director did a good job, the editing is fine.The big problem is the ideology behind it: It shows mankind just endangered by catastrophes - and finally destroyed by a catastrophe. Aliens choose kids to forecast this catastrophes: people killed by plane crashes, killed by tornadoes etc.But what about people killed in wars, people killed by starvation, people killed by pollution? The truth is: mankind is no victim of fate, and to save it we don't need higher forces - aliens or gods, whatsoever. What endangers mankind is man made! We are no victims, we are the offenders! And only we can stop the man made catastrophe that once will kill us all!Movies like this are poisoning the mind and they turn people into resigned passive sufferers instead of waking them up to make the world a better place!",3,0,4,26 June 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men mutating into hypertrophic blockbuster
","Where are the good times gone? The X-Men used to be the best marvel-merchandise. OK, the third movie was crap. And there were some flaws in some of the other movies, but still were they good enough to hope for more. In vain. X-Men: Apocalypse has some severe flaws. The make up, especially of the villain, looked ridiculous. The casting of the antagonist was also bad. He was just one more of those cynical, smirking megalomaniacs. His alter ego in the first scene had a far stronger and more evil presence. The new Jean Grey is just horrible. And what became of the real cynical Magneto? He is just a nice guy who had to suffer and chose the wrong side - just for a short while. But one of the main problems: the super-powers are completely out of balance. Magneto is able to alter the magnetic field of the entire earth, Apocalypse is able to destroy and rebuilt a city within seconds, Quicksilver is so fast that he could cope with everyone at once... and the Beast? And Wolverine? Well, they can jump around a little bit and are somehow faster than ordinary man and... that's it. And that does not work for me. Ah, nearly forgot something really stupid: Xavier enters the mind of Apocalypse to fight him with his psychic powers. How? His psychic-self punches Apocalypse's psychic-self into the face. Subtle and brainy, isn't it?",5,1,5,10 September 2016
Sing Street," A fairy tale full of errors
","This is a movie made for young people with all the ingredients they need: pop music, love story, a little family trouble and school environment with all its highs and lows. And for sure: a strong reference to recent fashion. So there is not much to say about the whole plot. It is simple and told straight forward. No surprises, no twists.Besides that the version of the 80ies given by the director is somehow distorted. There are a lot of errors in historical facts and fashion: the two brothers talk about MTV, but the story takes place in 1985 and MTV Europe was founded in 1987. And by that time it could only be received via cable which was very seldom, especially in poor Ireland. In one scene the protagonist tries to be a Robert Smith imposer and wears a donkey jacket. But this kind of jackets were usually worn by skinheads in the 80ies.But first an foremost the movie misses the spirit and feeling of the 80ies. Because the feeling of the film is just pure postmodern present age. The music played is mainly pop music the kids were listening to. But the old brother of the protagonist, some weird and misplaced 90ies slacker, is giving all those kiddy-pop-records to his younger brother as if they were long kept treasures. It would be more likely that this guy either would have listened to Birthday Party, Billy Bragg, Wire or some other post-punk underground stuff or still to music from 'his' time, the late 70ies.The protagonist changes his design and musical interest like his underwear. But the 80ies were characterized by commitment, credibility and integrity. You chose once if you are mainstream or subculture and than you stuck to it. If you chose to be punk you'd never switched to be new-romantic on the next day. But that is exactly what the characters in the movie do. And it is a way of thinking that perfectly reflects pop cultural habits nowadays that derive mainly out of ignorance.I played in my first band in 1985 and it definitely felt different - the time, the music, just everything. So if you had your share of the 80ies, forget about this movie. If you are 15 and don't give a damn, enjoy it. But don't expect to learn anything real about the 80ies.Because it is just a fairy tale with some poorly placed accessories.",3,7,20,10 November 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," perfectly and witty made propaganda
","This movie is a real nuisance. It is very well written, funny, has a perfect editing, good dialogues, irony - but transports a nonetheless crude ideology of war and the esthetics of weaponry and death. Thus it insults the intelligence of anyone who is not into ego-shooters. It pretends to undermine clichés but finally consists out of nothing else. What a bitter disappointment after great movies like the latest X-Men etc. Are the other people who rated it so well really not aware of its message? Wage war at any cost against your enemies! No need to understand their reasons! Fight till death! Thats cool! And, surely, protect the holy values of the American family.",4,8,19,16 December 2014
Life," Alien + Gravity = Cliché & Emotional Exploitation & Propaganda
","There is actually little more to be said than that.The SF-plot is old and lame. The characters are just as deep as absolutely necessary. There are a lot of goofs and illogical incidents.But the worse, as in Gravity, is the pornographical exploitation of emotions like pain, deadly terror, fear of losing your family etc.pp. We see the characters mourn, suffer and shiver, just interrupted by action sequences.And the message? The legitimate feeling towards the alien is hate. The final consequence is to call on mankind to wage total war against any life forms from Mars. And, for sure, there is a hero who tries to sacrifice himself to kill the alien bastard and safe the planet. Yeah! Kill them all, by all means, be a martyr! Is that really the message we need in our present day world?",1,7,16,9 June 2017
Annihilation," Big disappointment
","First of all: This was ment to be an adaptation of a piece of literature, the frst book of Area X - the Southern Reach - Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer. In this respect the movie completely fails. The writers of the screenplay try to interprete a highly complex story and solve the riddles of a weird surreal SF-novel which prominent quality is to stay mysterious and unsolvable.
When they got their weak explanation together they reinvented the whole thing according to their interpretation, not according to the book!
So if you expect to get something just near the visions of Jeff Vandermeer you´ll be horribly dissappointed. 
If you expect something else you´ll probably get something quite unsatisfying as well, wrapped in a real cheesy production design. At least, Natalie Portman and her male counterpart do a good job.",3,1,3,14 April 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," Fake & phony Folk
","Because there is so much wrong about this movie it is hard to choose with which flaw to start with.It never feels like 1961. It never looks like 1961. It doesn't sound like 1961. It does not deal with the Greenwich Village folk music scene.  It is not a portrait of an artist. It has no story. It has no arc of suspense. It has no character to connect with. It has no development of characters. It has noOkay:Let us start with the main character and its impersonator: Oscar Isaac. Every minute of the movie he looks like an H&M-Model of 2014. His stylish beard is 2014. His frustrated and cynical habitus is 2014. Even the way he wears is shawl is 2014.  His central conflict is that he screws up everything. Not to forget about his ex-partner that threw himself of the bridge, but there is no story developing out of this. So the central conflict is that he is a depressed asshole? But not only the script leaves him as a blank sheet of (grey) paper. Also Oscar Isaac is not able to give his character any depth. He seems to be indifferent about anything: his ex-lovers, his parents, his friends, the political issues of the time and even about his music.And here the roots of next big error are hidden: The folk scene of the early sixties was most vivid, new, exciting, political, enthusiastic, social. People had an attitude! Llewyn Davis has none. The folk scene in this movie seems to be some dull melting pot for bored ridiculous freaks sitting around in dark cellars doing nothing else except whining and selling out. You never get the feeling of it to be the musical outcome of the beat generations efforts and the preparation for the groundbreaking things to come in the late sixties! In one dialogue Llewyn Davis even says that he considers himself to be part of the entertainment business'! And that is what the folk scene of that time absolutely was NOT! When Dylan electrified his sound in 65 he was accused to go commercial and to become a part of the entertainment business. A lot of people actually hated him for this. In their eyes he became something that wasn't 'folk' anymore!Well enough. This movie does not deserve to waste more of my time.In the end the whole flick looks like it was made to demonstrate how depressing, dull and meaningless live has been before the invention of the smart phone...I hope the Coen Brothers will recover and create descent movies again.",1,36,66,10 June 2014
The Great Gatsby," Unbearable 'Kitsch'
","This is the most worst adaption of the wonderful novel that could have been made, ever. Gatsby's villa is a CGI-fantasy-nightmare. The (unneccessary!) attempt to point out the timely relevance of the story with a horrible Hip Hop- and Electro-score is just pathetic. The character of Carraway, who should be deluded by Gatsby and Daisy, is completely misinterpreted as the only one who really can understand Gatsby. Gatsby himself is not anymore this exciting ambivalent character, caught in his own pipe dream, not able to cope with the fact that past is irrecoverable gone, but a martyr, a victim of a cruel world that is oh! so degenerated - except him... And Daisy? A stupid little girl with a nice stupid face, far too young for the character. Even the way things put in picture is horrible! Just everything about this film is so horrible! If you want to get to know The Great Gatsby, read the book. Or watch the quite decent 1974 adaption with Mia Farrow (as a brilliant Dasiy!) and Robert Redford as Gatsby. It has its flaws as well, but it's quite close to the gist of it.",1,7,12,2 May 2014
