Deepwater Horizon," Bland movie
","A bland movie based upon a real event. A movie on legalized corporate murder, with zero repercussions, to the responsible parties. Not worth acquiring nor viewing, in theaters, as their prices are too high. Internet movie rental will achieve bang for the buck. Another so so movie, if you have time on your hand, and a superior choice is not available.",4,0,0,28 March 2017
La La Land," Excrucriating slow moving
","A excruciatingly slow moving movie. A movie for patient viewers. Not worth the time nor expense, for hyperactive folks. Decent acting, hopefully, these actors, and actresses will get better movies, in the future. Avoid viewing in theaters, due to their high cost, & freebie bed bugs, etc. Go for low cost Internet streaming, where possible.",3,4,6,25 June 2017
Arrival," Surprising
","Spellbinding, for one that did not read the book. A pleasant surprise, not what one would have expected. Definitely worth the current online video streaming rental prices, and for DVD, when the price falls below ten dollars. Theaters are a waste, given the freebie bed bugs, overcharges, along with the fact that one cannot stop, and rewind, or replay portions of the movie. On the movie worth seeing list, in the absence of a better one.",9,1,5,14 March 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Not worth the current cost of a theater ticket
","A bland so-so war movie. A movie based upon true events that could have been told in 30 minutes or less, instead of over two hours. True events or stories usually do not make great movies. Too bad the actors, and actresses got stuck with this so-so movie, definitely not going to help their career. This movie is not worth the current cost of a theater ticket, spend the funds on something else.",2,15,29,25 February 2017
