Blade Runner 2049," WEIRD. Sci-Fi fans will love it. Others no.
","This is a very slow and weird movie. If you are a Sci-Fi fan you will love it. If not, you will probably not watch is all the way through. It is slow, throughout the movie. The last 20 minutes are the most exciting and really the highlight. The ending was not exactly well done. But this is an opinion. I saw the original and thought it was good. This one is not the same. Too much scenic nonsense and not a lot of information. Would have been nice to first understand the characters. Just not that well done.",6,2,3,17 July 2018
The Irishman," Long and boring
","Its another Godfather type movie from Scorsese. And all his buddies are in it. DeNiro is his usually self acting like DeNiro. Sorry I do not think he is a great actor he just plays the same character over and over again. Pacino loves to yell so he was good playing Jimmy Hoffa. But of all the actors Joe Pesci should have won the Oscar for best actor. He was superb!! Overall the story was good, but way too long. Of course history was re-written in the movie at various parts to make it more interesting to viewers. Added violence always helps. I did speed up some parts because I really could not believe DeNiro as an Irishman even with Blue contact lenses. But its Scorsese's movie so he chose the cast. If they cut an hour out of the movie it would have helped. Better yet, if they got more youthful actors rather than 3 aging 70+ year olds to play the part of the people in the movie who were actually suppose to look like they were in their 30 and 40s that would have helped a great deal more and saved a ton of money on make-up.",5,2,6,31 March 2020
American Hustle," A movie for people with 2-digit IQs who believe its an artsy movie
","Crap! This movie was a joke. It was like watching what one would call a B movie. Have no idea why people would like this flick, but i guess they have no idea what good movies really are and are probably people who think American Idol is a good show too. Really a waste of time about several dysfunctional morons but this is what Hollywood produces and what the Academy Awards like, dysfunctional people in a movie so it makes those watching it feel better about themselves. Hey, have to say i was around in 1978 when this movie took place and while there were some people who were dumb, they would still have known this movie was garbage.",2,5,7,22 March 2014
1917," Good movie, not a great movie!
","I am probably one of a few who thought the movie was just OK. It kind of like the British version of Saving Private Ryan although the story is one-dimensional and it takes place decades earlier during WW1. Yes, the directing was great, the acting was also excellent, but the storyline was not that great. Suspenseful, yes. But you pretty much know where it is going the whole time. Sam Mendes wrote it based on stories he remembers his grandfather telling him, and he also dedicated the movie to his grandfather. If you like war movies you will enjoy it. For me, I like a variety of movies and while I do like war movies , this falls short. Sorry. Although when you compare it to the garbage coming out of Hollywood (they cannot make a good movie) 1917 is Great by comparison!",7,1,2,31 March 2020
Silence," Slow and boring garbage
","If you are a history buff perhaps you can suffer through this boring movie. Watching it at 2x its still slow. Just a dud in plain English. The book is slightly better, but again you have to be fascinated by the subject. If not, its of little interest and for many a waste of time. Scorcese noted he wanted to put this movie together for 20 years. I think he should have waited longer. Its garbage!",1,4,7,17 July 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Boring and slow
","OK, I saw this years back and bought it on Bluray to watch it again. For me its still boring and slow and I am one who likes Sci Fi, one reason why I gave it 2 instead of 1 stars. I guess you have to really believe this is an artsy movie and read all the BS commentary by the critics to believe this movie is worth watching. There are many parts that are without any dialog, some very silent without any sound, several times you might think your TV is on mute, but the reality is that the movie was designed that way. Having seen several of Kubrick's movies, I cannot say any were very good and for me this is a major dud. But hey, if you find watching paint dry to be exciting, this movie may be ideal for you. For those looking for a bit more entertainment or perhaps a plot that makes sense, look somewhere else.",2,2,7,4 June 2014
Mudbound," Misery loves company and would love this miserable movie
","This is a movie that focuses on the worst elements in the south before and after WW2. If you like movies that show how miserable people can be to each other you might enjoy watching this movie. You know where the movie is headed a mile out and it slowly gets there, too slow for me and far too long. In the end, all you get is a miserable feeling and wonder why people would produce a movie about the miseries of people. Then again, miserable people might be the ones who produce miserable movies that show people at their worst. Waste of time.",2,9,25,10 January 2019
Joker," Not as Great as the Hype!
","Sorry, I watched this movie and it was very dark and so slow. It was more about how someone mistreated can become a psychopath than it was about the Joker. Not at all like Gotham or even earlier Batman movies. Sure, Joaquin did a good job of acting, but the movie was a drag and unless you really get off on watching nut jobs it was certainly not entertaining. Hollywood loved it because they like blood, guts, and sick people. Besides, there are so many terrible movies coming out of Hollywood, even a mediocre movie gets a 4-star rating because the others are just so bad. In this movie, there were some parts that were soooo slow I used 2x just to move things along. It helped. Could not wait for it to end. This is a dreary movie and not entertainment. Hollywood movies just get sicker and they like it.",4,7,17,11 February 2020
Creed II," An attempt to remake Rocky 4 falls flat and predictable from miles away.
","Very very predictable movie. The Plot can be seen from a mile away. This movie is a remake, and not a good one, of Rocky 4. The movie will be entertaining to some, mostly teenagers, who will most likely enjoy the awful singing of Creed's girlfriend in the movie along with the awful rap music, and the overuse of street slang throughout the movie. Thank goodness for fast forward. You are better off watching Rocky 4, a better movie with real music and a movie that is far more entertaining than this predictable trash.",3,3,6,13 March 2019
Son of Saul," Not as Good As Expected.
","Not as good as expected. The movie may be artsy but the storyline stinks. It's is not a documentary, but a fictitious story of Saul, a worker at a camp deciding that a dead boy is his son and what he attempts to go through to bury him is thin. Yes, the scenes in the background are horrific, something the artsy types at film schools like. But the movie is slow, limited dialogue, and a lot of long scenes were so long, you can speed things up with fast forward and miss nothing. Basically the movie falls flat and is a waste of time. I give it two stars because the background scenes that depict the horrors from a perspective of Saul are well done. Do not like the shakiness of a hand-held camera that had to track this perspective throughout the movie, or the full screen format, one can overlook those. Overall there are far better movies about this period such as Black List or the Counterfeiters. And if you really want to learn more about this period pick up the book Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl who chronicled his experiences as an Auschwitz concentration camp. Or Auschwitz: A Doctor's Account by Dr. Miklos Nyiszli who was spared from death because he was personal assistant to Dr. Josef Mengele, known as the infamous 'Angel of Death.' These are real stories by real people. There huge difference between this type of reality (the books) and a fictitious movie.",2,27,49,30 April 2016
Green Book," A very good and entertaining movie.
","This was a very good movie, not the best , but considering most of the others movies the last few years have been garbage, this is one well worth seeing. The movie is entertaining, music is enjoyable, and overall it will make you feel good. It does not portray New York Italians as very bright, which is not really fair, but does show a friendship can develop between people from different backgrounds regardless of their ethnicity. Of course a good part of the movie shows how bad it was in the south with Jim Crow in effect, and rightly so, but I was happy the movie did not make that the only focus like the movie Mudbound (a depressing movie). This movie is well worth your time to see, and both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were superb in their respective roles.",6,1,2,15 March 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Trash, simply Garbage. Watching laundry spin is more interesting
","AWFUL!! After the first 20 horrific minutes of watching this garbage flick I started fast forwarding to get it over with and see where it would go. The movie never got better. It was all blow 'em up special effects, stupid dialog, and a number of the scenes were sped up and looked silly with people moving in fast motion. Whoever directed this should go to director's school. I think Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron needed a paycheck. Worse they probably did not read the scripts before saying yes. Do not waste your time with this garbage unless you desperately want to see lots of special effects. Watching the laundry spin in your washing machine if more interesting.",1,11,23,24 September 2015
The Great Gatsby," Among the worst movies of the year
","Plain and simple the movie is awful. I painfully watched it over 2 days as my wife wanted to see it. The cinematography is all over the place and the movie is like watching a cartoon with living characters. To add insult to injury they added Rap music to a movie that takes place in the 1920s. I think the producers were on drugs when they release this piece of garbage. If you are among the twenty somethings that liked Moulin Rouge, or enjoy the annoying Quentin Tarantino movies you may like this. If you enjoy good movies this is not for you. Put it like this, watching the laundry turn in a dryer is more interesting than this movie, and the acting is just as good.",1,49,90,20 October 2013
