Blade Runner 2049," A Could-Be Holographic Joyride
","Before reading this review, bear in mind I've never seen the first Blade Runner, but with all the hype, I had to see the sequel. I do see mixed reviews from diverse groups of people who expected a lot from this movie and got what they wanted and vice versa.It had potential to live up to the high bar that was set...and I wanted it to be amazing...but when you put all the components together of this drawn-out movie, you get a solid six. The visuals were fantastic (in fact, every single shot was masterfully done), but the story line, to my surprise, seemed almost endless and going nowhere at times. If you stick it through though, it isn't the worst movie you've seen, neither the best. It's very exhilarating in the dystopian future portrayal of technology, but the movie as a whole wasn't done well enough to make it absolutely breathtaking as a sequel. This film's plot is nothing but lengthy, filled with little to no substance. Some scenes are heavily unnecessary. And though there were gorgeous visuals, they were bogged down by the excessive screen time they had. There was plenty of time to develop a solid story line (almost three hours), but maybe that was the point. Frame by frame it was beautiful, but line by line it was exhausting.However, it is a film that makes you feel like you're living in a dream. Take that how you will.'Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real.' - the only piece of insight that I hold on to from this film, as said by Jared Leto's character, Niander Wallace",6,4,7,14 October 2017
