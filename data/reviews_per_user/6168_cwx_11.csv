Mission: Impossible III," At least they tried?
","What a funny film. For one thing, when you've got Ving Rhames asking Tom Cruise, 'so did you sleep with your little sister,' one can't help but like the filmmakers are playing some weird games with the whole Cruise/Holmes unpleasantness (for the record, Cruise never answers the question). There are a whole host of problems with this film, most of which revolve around the notion that Cruise is primarily motivated by these two women whom we hardly ever see on screen, and in the case of the more clearly romantic relationship, what we do see inspires little more than a feeling that it'd be better if we got back to the action.And yetÂ… maybe the 'motivation' bit worked as well as it was supposed to, because after some long stretches of boredom in the first half, I found myself a bit more caught up the closer we got to the end. I don't really know if that was because of the story, or just because the setpieces were more exciting. What I did find fascinating was that someone thought you could actually wring some suspense from 'will Tom Cruise be successfully resuscitated?' I mean, seriously guys? Of course, one can always hope to be proved wrong!",5,0,0,20 May 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Today's nonsensical formula
","At least it wasn't bad to the point that I was angry I had paid money for it, and if anything, it means that I can now bash non-Pixar CG animated output without admitting that I haven't seen much of it. In fact, it was interesting to see what the formula for these megablockbusters is nowadays.Of course there's celebrities, but some of them are so D-list that you wonder what the possible advantage of hiring them over actual voice actors really is. There's an attempt at wry humor, but it strikes one as ultimately revealing the failure of the writers to be as clever as they think they are. Sure there are some inspired bits, like the little critter chasing the acorn, but even that bit wears out by the end, and they tend to have no real connection to the rest of the film.The worst of it is, the animals here are just ugly! When I see something like this, I just think back to The Lion King and wonder how we managed to go so far backwards in terms of representing animated fauna. The plot is nonexistent; there's supposed to be some impending whatever, but mostly it's just a backdrop for some drawn-out, seen-it-all-before romance. It's really odd that this is what passes for entertainment, family or otherwise, nowadays.",2,5,7,7 May 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Good, but unsound
","This is one of those movies that seems solid and entertaining, then starts to crumble a bit when you think about it afterwards; however, it still holds up for the most part, and the main purpose of a movie is to keep you interested while you're watching, after all. The first problem is the title, which also implies that Meryl Streep is the main role, rather than protagonist Anne Hathaway who is, in fact, effectively plays an interesting character rather than just a sounding board for another virtuoso Streep performance (which isn't to say that Streep isn't good, either).The main problems mostly lie in how Andy, Hathaway's character, deals with her dilemma; should she stay true to herself or fall into the fashion world? This isn't as lame as it sounds on paper, especially since they managed to convey some sense of the aforementioned fashion world's glamour to someone like me who by default reviles every aspect of it. This, however, might mean that I sympathized more with her plight than someone who, say, never had any qualms about 'fitting in' at all costs. However, the weakness of the detractors seems to sap this film's moral clarity, as does its eventual mutation from a series of critiques of a whole industry to a mere interpersonal conflict; of course this is inevitable in Hollywood film, but the way this happens in this movie decidedly muddies up and changes the entire issue at hand. Of course, a film like this wants to have it both ways, but one hopes at the very least that when several characters describe a size 4 as 'fat,' the filmmaker means to attack that perspective. A lack of clarity on this issue is a lot more unforgivable. All that said, I did find it to be compelling and well-played.",6,1,2,6 July 2006
Collateral," Jamie Foxx's real breakthrough
","There's no denying that the flawless style of Michael Mann is the main reason this movie is as remarkable as it is. However, this is also the movie that made me a big Jamie Foxx fan, even though I've still never seen Ray. Much like Damon Wayons in Bamboozled, I sensed both times I watched this film that Foxx was basing his role off of one of his comic personas, specifically the passive loser. Spike Lee talks on the Bamboozled DVD about using comic (black) actors in dramatic roles because he believes they're capable of more (and probably because he hopes to redeem the buffoonish portrayal of blacks in film) and he was right; he just had the wrong guy.Wayans never managed to rise above the level of preprogrammed comic persona, whereas Foxx, despite my initial skepticism on the first viewing, does a fantastic job at slowly progressing his character through a sometimes-ludicrous series of transformations and epiphanies, mostly revolving around how he both reacts against and is molded by Tom Cruise's villain character (and Cruise-as-villain seems rather prescient now that people have turned against him; today, Foxx might well have gotten the top-billing he deserved).I've read criticisms about the plot in spite of the style, but honestly, I'm not bothered by any of it, not even the ending that I've seen criticized the most frequently. What I love about this movie is that it's a mainstream film that beats most art films at their own game. It doesn't actually have to be so polarized. Imagine that.",10,0,0,20 July 2006
Velvet Goldmine," Interesting stuff, shoddy presentation
","I really wanted to like this colorful flick about glam rock, featuring thinly-veiled portrayals of two key figures from the time and an ostensibly-fictionalized intimate relationship between them. Unfortunately, the film is a mess despite the great music, the trippy performances and the compelling recreation of a classic subculture. Todd Haynes tries to slap some faux-Citizen Kane writing-an-article narrative onto what is otherwise a surreal, drug-induced haze of rock and sexual ambiguity, and while the journalist has his own story to tell through flashbacks, this only serves to throw us more off balance as we try to figure out which of the three male leads is supposed to be the protagonist. Haynes' work is frustrating because he can't decide whether to go for narrative or non-narrative, surreal or realist, linear or non-linear, and instead, he just goes with 'all of the above.' What this leaves us with is a wealth of good content made tiresome by the awkward, fractured structure of the piece.",5,4,6,13 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Everything happens for no reason
","This movie pretends to be a sequel to X2, but ultimately, this film builds on the bones of what came before, rather than on the solid, already established foundation. Characters are dismissed with perfunctory waves of the hand, or 'revealed' to have always been the exact opposite of everything we were told before, specifically in the case of Jean Grey. The treatment of Jean invokes the worst excesses of comic books (namely, retroactive continuity or the 'retcon,') while losing whatever emotional pathos was involved in the source material.Most egregious, however, is the finale. The X-Men rush into defend something without really explaining why it's important, and their goals and the stakes they are playing for constantly shift. While you never quite get to the point where the story doesn't make sense, it's safe to say that the motivations never make sense, if only because there are no motivations. There are certainly some good action scenes, but overall it's hard to enjoy this even as mindless action because moronic director Brett Ratner gets so bogged down in the process of pissing on all the plot lines and characters that he inherited from Bryan Singer's vastly superior work.",3,1,2,27 May 2006
The Illusionist," Not much there
","So is this a mystery film, a fantasy film, or what? Well, rather than successfully blurring the boundaries of genre, this film just seems to be a confused muddle of several genres, including the period piece. It's actually hard to speak in much detail about the film without spoiling it. What I will say is that while I enjoyed the character who played the main role in the film, I felt that some more focus on the other characters might have made the goings-on more meaningful. I also felt that the film suffers greatly right up until the ending, as it starts to appear even more pointless than it really is just for the sake of an interesting ending. While the 'German' accents of the Austrian characters are actually not half-bad, they are still woefully unnecessary (if you want it to be authentic, film it in German!). Finally, there's the 'small' matter of using Asian people as props in search of some mystical shorthand; I think it would be disingenuous to say that this is only supposed to work within the film. Overall, while not a painful experience, it was largely forgettable and not as clever as it was meant to be.",4,1,8,19 September 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Not just a cash-in, but marred by the star
","Overall, I quite enjoyed this rendition. What it lacks in thoroughness and in acting (compared to the BBC), it makes up for with production values, which are thankfully not put to use. The cinematography is quite beautiful, especially when regarding the English countryside where some key tableaux occur, and the dinginess of the Bennett home is keenly brought into view in a clearer fashion than I've seen in most Austen interpretations. Finally, Joe Wright has a strong style, with some signature, abrupt reaction shots and other little flourishes I'm not knowledgeable enough to name, and ultimately, this helps the film be a worthwhile contribution rather than a half-assed cash-in type of remake. Kiera Knightley, however, did bug me, especially in the opening part of the film, which made me feel that, despite her age, she might have been better cast as Lydia, someone she probably resembles more closely. Every time she crinkled her nose laughing, she seemed to convey a lack of depth that didn't fit her character. I imagine marketability was, to put it lightly, the main reason for her inclusion.",7,2,4,6 June 2006
The Da Vinci Code," So pointless the con of the audience
","I have read that some evangelicals are hoping to use this film to lure 'em in and then convert them once they're hooked. This is brilliant because, while this film appears to be subversive, it really buttresses the church's appeal, because the biggest threat to faith today is not radical reinterpretations, but profound indifference.The interpretation presented here certainly has its attractions. I wouldn't mind if it were true, and so I can see why many want it to be true The filmmakers, though, want to imply that revealing this interpretation would change faith, while hedging their bets a bit in how they present this, but by this they just show that they don't understand faith, which does not have that much to do with kooky historical riddles.It doesn't help that said riddles hold far too much resemblance to the kind of deliberately-outlandish puzzle solving found in the Adam West Batman, in which connections and conclusions are drawn out of thin air. Other problems here include the tendency to spent several scenes getting us nowhere and then give us half of the entire mystery in a big monologue, Tom Hanks' astonishing, mind-numbing flatness, the incoherence of the present-day conspiracies and betrayals, and so on.",4,0,2,28 May 2006
The Untouchables," Flashes of brilliance
","Perhaps I was just frustrated because this film brings up some ideological issues, but then turns out to be largely visual. Or perhaps I don't respond well to the cloying nostalgic music and acting, even. There was certainly one really strong sequence, taking place in a train station in the final half-hour of the film that actually really bored me at first. I think perhaps that some of what Brian De Palma tried to do for suspense struck me as indicating lack of momentum. Certainly at the beginning of the scene, I found myself largely wondering what I was supposed to think was going on, and I'm not even sure if that was deliberate. It probably contributes to the thrill when the confrontation does ensue, but maybe there's a smoother way to do that, especially when regarding the particularly lethargic.Certainly, the colors are very rich, and there are some masterful shots, which all shows a good level of artistry. Maybe I just expect my action to be too fast, or maybe this is really more of the Disney version of cops vs. mafia, ambiguous morals and hardcore violence aside. Of course, Costner's inevitable woodenness doesn't help much.",5,1,3,19 June 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," Good direction brought down by the script
","It can be a little frustrating seeing a 'spy plot' unravel to the point where you realize there wasn't much of anything there at the center of it. It's especially frustrating when the ending comes with 20 minutes to go, and you don't even really feel the need to see what happens afterwards. Luckily, this film has a tremendous amount of visual style, and it's almost surprising to me that this was enough to make me enjoy the film, as I'm not always a big fan of the 'handheld camera' thing when it comes to action films. In this case, however, the jolting camera was an important part of the action and of the character, such as it was. I think ultimately, this is a very forced sequel that doesn't justify its undoing of the last film's ending (while also relying too much on the audience's knowledge of its predecessor). Most of all, though, I think it's a pretty clear case of a good director, Paul Greengrass, having been saddled with a half-assed script.",7,0,3,1 June 2006
