The Equalizer," Denzel is a BADASS
","I went into this movie with an open mind as Denzel is ageing and this movie didn't have much hype. I left throughly impressed and would go back and watch it again. Denzel plays a very calm, respectful and polite older man who frequently visits the local coffee shop where he reads books and chats with a young girl who is into some pretty negative stuff in her life. (Prostitution) He acts as a father figure to her and tries guiding her in the right direction in life. Just as this happens sh*t hits the fan and that's where the action picks up. You find out quickly that he possesses some 'special' skills. Basically this is the type of movie you can't help but get behind and cheer for the good guy. He exacts revenge on everyone who does him or his friends wrong. He does so in a very savage way and uses odd weapons to get the job done. (Rarely uses a gun) Throughout the movie you're shown how great of a human being he is, as he constantly tries helping less fortunate people get ahead in life. The villains are cast very well and give you the impression that they're no one to mess around with and surprise you with intelligence. However a villain is a villain and you know how that ends. If you want to see a truly badass movie with a ballsy tough guy this is the movie. It's not 100% action all of the time but that's what makes it great. Lots of buildup to the ass whoopings! 9/10",8,3,12,30 September 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," A boring action movie
","It's hard to believe there is such a thing as a boring action movie, but this is it. The movie is 2 hours of car crashes mixed in with a bit of fighting. There is no plot, no interest in characters, no given reason for the fighting. This could of been a great landscape if laid out and described better. I really had no idea where they were or why earth was the way it was. It was tough to choose a side and root for one over the other as neither side was properly laid out for the audience. As far as I know both sides were 'bad' and they were fighting over gas and water control. A little bit of back story would of been great, I love movies that have a distinct before and after taste to them. We really had no glimpse into the life of the villain and what made him the bad guy. He had the perfect look and voice of a villain but really didn't shine in that role very much. I was expecting something amazing and left with a bad taste in my mouth. 2 out of 5 of us fell asleep during the movie, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. One hour long car chase is enough, didn't need to see them turn around and go back for another hour!",1,41,89,26 May 2015
