Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not to be compared to Episodes IV, V, & VI
","This movie is incredible.  It simply is not to be compared to the other episodes.  Why?  Because it takes place at a different time than the other episodes.  Additionally, comparing it to the other episodes just cheapens them all.  In order to give this movie its own rating, you must push all thoughts of the other episodes out of your mind.I particularly enjoyed the costuming.  Amidala's wardrobe is stunning with all its complexity and grandeur.  The scenery is also very beautiful:  you get glimpses of an underwater world, a planet which is just a giant city, as well as vast desert world.Yes, there are moments that drag.  For instance, I thought the pod racing was a little too long.There are also a few chintzy moments:  the announcers at the pod racing, some of Jar Jar's actions and comments.But overall, this is a visually stimulating and breathtaking movie.  It deserves to stand on its own, and not be bogged down by comparison and contrast to the other episodes of the Star Wars saga.  Personally, I can't wait until all the episodes are complete, and I can watch the whole story from beginning to end!",10,5,7,20 May 1999
