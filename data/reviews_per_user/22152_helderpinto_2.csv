Blade Runner 2049," Who would have guessed Blade Runner would get the sequel it deserves.
","But it did, Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel we didn't know we needed.I've been avoiding any media in regards to this movie until i saw it today. I just realized there's 3 shorts for it out, but watching it after was interesting too, allowed me to fill a few gaps, such as who's the blind guy for instance. I went in with zero expectations, I've been so disappointed with Hollywood lately, with these trends of remakes and sequels, I went in borderline cynical about it. It didn't help that just before the movie they played a trailer for the DC 'avengers' and another pacific rim??From the first frame and the first strings of music of Blade Runner 2049 my eye lids just opened wide, this is one visually amazing and striking movie, so many hidden meanings in the dialog, in the set pieces, in how they light the shots, in the emotion of the music, the nuances of the acting, it's a pretty masterful movie in nearly every regarded for me, apart from minor things. I didn't feel Blade Runner needed a sequel at all, quite the contrary, but you know what, I felt that every person that worked on this film had a huge respect for the original movie, i really felt they worked on this and knew they had to honor the artists that came before them, and it shows. I'm considering going to imax to watch it again if i find the time, some of the scenes here need to be experienced in a huge screen and with a killer sound system. My inner nerd is pretty damn satisfied tonight! Congratulations to Denis Villeneuve, he should be proud he made a masterpiece, don't worry about all the headlines regarding this movie flopping in the box office, because Blade Runner 2049 will sell for 30 years, just like the original did, this is how cult classics work.",10,4,16,23 October 2017
Gravity," Walked in with pretty mild expectations, walked out with jaw on the floor
","OK... I wont go as far as saying I'm a movie aficionado, but I watch loads of movies since I was a little kid, and I can say with a fair amount of confidence this movie will go down as one of my favorite and memorable movie I've ever watched!I don't want to over-hype it for you guys, I guess one of the reasons I've loved it so much is because I walked in into the imax room with pretty mild expectations and walked out with my jaw on the floor. I felt that little tingling sensation you feel when you walk out of a roller coaster, and thinking to myself 'shiet, I wanna go again!'Just... go watch this movie! And if you can, go imax+3d or at least 3d! I've always been very skeptical with 3d in movies but this is some of the best usage of 3d i've ever seen, you'll know what I mean when you watch it!GO WATCH THIS NOW!",9,5,9,6 October 2013
