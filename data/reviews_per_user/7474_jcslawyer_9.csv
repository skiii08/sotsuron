The Lobster," Pretentious poo
","This movie was ok until mid-way then it lost steam and fell into a pool of acid that dissolved the story into pretentious mush.I went to film school, so I'm not surprised there's a following for this movie. I definitely liked Colin's performance and the setting was perfect. But other than that, it was just kinda boring and didn't know where it wanted to go despite having cues built into itself.Nothing felt organic. As if the filmmakers were trying to fit elements into the movie for the sake of it, but with no true purpose. Wasn't my cup.",3,1,1,7 June 2020
The Ring," Definite creepfest
","Despite some flaws and limpness in the middle of the movie, this is still a great horror movie. I have to think back when I first saw it and thought it was incredibly creepy. Samara is a great villain. It relies on some jump scares, but there's this air of discomfort that permeates throughout. The only time in the movie you feel part of the real world is the intro. As soon as that ends, you're pulled into this dreamlike series of scenes that paint a terrifying and hopeless story for the characters. The colors in the movie appear so washed out so as to remove you from reality so you question whether you just watched the tape....If you've never seen, you're missing out.",8,1,1,26 June 2020
Green Room," Great, intense thriller
","The synopsis sounded pretty generic but the movie is anything but. Intense and violent. Great acting, great writing. You'll be on the edge of your seat. Gets going well, and pacing is great. If you're in the mood for a great lil flick, do not miss the chance to watch this gem.",9,0,1,4 May 2020
28 Weeks Later," Bit overrated
","Don't get me wrong, it's a decent sequel. But it's not mind-blowing. It continues from the first pretty well, but adds a different story that makes it a good stand alone.But again, I don't want to give a sense that it's more than just a pretty good sequel. If you liked the first, you'll like it. Worth an eve view.",6,0,0,26 June 2020
The Mist," Liked but...
","I liked this movie a lot. It's not that scary, but it does explore darker sides of human nature....as most Stephen King stories do. The mystery of the mist and what lurks is only part of it. There's the question of who's the real monster? Actual monsters or people when faced with danger in close confines. I like how there's a great exploration on blind following and obedience.That being said, nothing stays with you more than that harrowing ending. I still think about it to this day. I'm not even giving it away, but the fact that I'm telling you that there's an ending like this means I need to add spoiler alert.",9,0,0,26 June 2020
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," So disturbing, but more than meets the eye
","This is on the list of most disturbing movies ever. But it's not disturbing for the sake of it. There is an underlying exposition of a fascist government and it's ability to control to the most depraved extremes. I don't need to go into the plot, just don't watch if your skin crawls easily.Apparently based loosely on the Marquis de Sade's eponymous story, it feels dirty...it feels icky. You will not finish the film feeling happy, relieved, redeemed, or satisfied. You will feel that humanity is capable of terrible things and sometimes for no real reason other than they can. It shows what happens when people blindly follow terrible people and abandoned their own sense of decency. The following orders defense will never work. When you've become an accomplice you ate equally guilty.This movie has depth, but it's not an easy watch. It's not for a simple eve with a date. I can't imagine watching this with anyone other than fellow film students or a significant other you've been with for years.",8,1,2,3 April 2020
Parasite," Pretty good, but hyped more than necessary
","Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. I just don't see why it's soooo hyped. On the other hand, I appreciate this type of dark comedic movie getting recognition even if by the Academy. I stopped watching the awards years ago because the movies are sooo predictable or pretentious or big budgety but not a lot of soul. So by that standard, and the fact it introduces more people to the awesome world of Korean cinema, this movie is really good.The story is great, the characters were fun and you got to know each, and the acting was spot on. The settings were great as wel.I thought it was a sci fi flick, but I truly knew nothing about it. I was expecting a thriller like Bug or The Fly or something weird like that. What I got was not disappointing. Very quirky which reflects the work of the director who brings an interesting flare to movies. He's definitely developed his signature style and I think it will make people visit this portfolio.Again, very good movie. But won't change your life. It may stick with you a little afterwards, but it will fade so you can move on to the next.",9,2,2,10 May 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of my all time faves
","This movie still creeps me out as much as it did when I was a kid. This is just plain and simple a classic horror movie. The story was original, the characters were relatively likable enough that you feel bad for them, and the atmosphere is just creepy. I don't know how, but watching it still makes you feel like you're in a dream. The town was so generic and I think that not having the familiarity of a big name town makes one feel lost or uncomfortable. There's this quiet discomfort that you feel from the moment the movie starts. Sure, the ending-ending is schlocky as all get out, but I can forgive based on the rest that preceded it.Freddy Kreuger is a legendary villain, slasher, and character. Pure evil and terrifying. Although his 'character' cheesed out in later entries, you can still watch this and remember just how nee and fresh that kind of character was. He's not the guy under the bed, outside the window, or in the closet. He's in your dreams. Something you can't avoid since your body will eventually give way to slumber. Then you're on his turf and he can manipulate it however he sees fit. You don't get any scarier than not being in control of something that's happening in your mind.I could go on for days about this. It's one of my fave horror movies. I'm not jumping on a bandwagon of nostalgia either. I've been watching these since I was a kid. I just recently got around to signing up for imdb so I can rate and review.If you need an introduction to the horror genre, this should be high on your list....though not necessarily your first as you may not want to keep going!! Jk, but seriously.",10,1,1,9 February 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Love this movie
","If you love the dark comedy plus gratuitous violence genre, and if you add a sprinkling of james bond, you got yourself a nifty movie. I was hooked from the first few and loved all the way to the end. Colin Firth was literally born to play Harry. Mark Strong is awesome as Merlin...especially if you enjoyed his antithesis role in Kick-Ass (done by the same folks). Don't think twice about whether you're in the mood to watch. Just watch.",10,0,0,24 January 2020
