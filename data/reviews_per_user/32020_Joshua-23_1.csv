The Blair Witch Project," It could have been worse...
","Quick summary - lots of laughs while waiting for something to happen. 
Longer view - The acting is pretty good, I'll give it that.  The character 'Heather' has a VERY annoying interview style, but aside from that the three main actors give convincing performances.  The marketing is spectacular. The soundtrack needs some work (hee hee).The problem being there is NO PAYOFF, real or implied (yes, I am capable of appreciating subtlety).  In the mercifully short 82 minute running time, I was reasonably 'scared' for about 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I was either laughing at the dialogue (this should go in the comedy section when it makes it to video) or imagining how this film was going to freak me out (not even close, I'm afraid).As the credits rolled I told the friend I was with 'WE could have done this. And made something that was GOOD.'  I will not let this be an empty statement.  I'm finally going to write a screenplay, get funding, and shoot a movie.  So I thank all the 'Blair Witch' crew for inspiring me to 'show 'em how it's done.'All in all, I paid $7.25 and wasted about an hour and a half of my time. Much less time and money than I invested on my last girlfriend (now if you want to hear a SCARY story...)",1,1,3,4 August 1999
