The Mask," A deeply flawed film - which children should not see.
","I first saw this movie when it came out. It was hyped and it delivered - I enjoyed it. For it's time it had a lot of very good special effects. It left us with the immortal 'Smokin''! and 'Somebody stop me'!Carrey is average as the nerky bank clerk, but as The Mask Carrey is terrific and very funny.Over the years I've grown to regard The Mask as a kids' film - but here's the big problem; The Mask is most definitely not a children's film!!!I sat down and properly watched The Mask for the first time in years and was really quite surprised and disappointed at what I saw; It's very violent. For example; The Mask/Ipkiss (a good guy????) goes for revenge on the garage workers who humiliate him, and one character is hospitalised with an exhaust pipe clearly stuck up his rectum. He then goes on to rob a bank! There is some pretty ripe language - short of swearing, but only just! Pretty much all of the adults, including The Mask/Ipkiss, are BAD role-models who do pretty bad things to each other. The comic-like setting is not comic like enough, and children will only see the nastiness, not the irony.So - Despite its billing, The Mask is not a kids film. What does it offer adults then?Well, there's Cameron Diaz, who is very easy on the eye, reminiscent of Jessica Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). In fact Diaz even strikes very similar poses to Jessica, probably deliberately. She does quite well with a silly character and script, a very good first outing in a big movie for her.But that's about it! There's nothing of substance here for adult viewers. The film is cartoon like on all levels; The story is weak, dialogue silly and infantile. The setting - 'Edge City' might as well be New York, don't know why they called it Edge City. There's lots of pointless stuff like this, which isn't funny. Also not funny is the epi-centre of the film; The CoCo Club - which is guarded by nasty bent thugs and in spite of the glamorous dressy people outside all fighting to get in is not a place to aspire to. Not good for any children watching, not good at all. Worse still - the 'Hero' Ipkiss/The Mask is desperate to gain entry in order to chase after Diaz. Not somewhere a Hero should be looking to go - not something children looking for a 'Hero' or adult role-model in general should see.There are lots of bad guys, bad guys working for bad guys, working for bad guys - and they all smoke! Even Diaz works for a bad guy - which makes her a bad guy too. The cops are silly and seen to be so. Then there's The Mask who seems to be a good guy but is a bad guy quite a lot of the time. He takes the Mickey out of the bad guys, but then he robs the Bank that his alter ego Ipkiss works in! The Mask packs lots of weapons too and in one scene uses a 'balloon' machine gun to shoot up a knife gang which come after him to try and mug him. Not for children! Sure - The Mask is funny - but he is NOT a classic goodie, not a 'Hero'.There are plenty of scenes with overt violence which are much too strong for children under the age of 11-12. The worst one is the huge shoot up at the Club near the end; there is plenty of blood, plenty of holes in chests. Not good for children, not good at all!So - this film fails to be kids classic, which is really what it should have been. It fails to entertain adults on anything more than a simplistic level. I've given it 6 because Carrey is excellent as 'The Mask'. The film very occasionally shows the viewer the humour in what it might be like if you could really do what your inner self tells you you should do. But so what?",6,0,5,12 April 2011
First Man," The inner journey to being the first...
","Just got home from watching First Man.I'll disclose straight away that I am a HUGE student of manned space flight. I've seen the Apollo 11 capsule and Neil Armstrong's X-15 hanging from the roof of the Smithsonian in Washington. I've visited Cape Kennedy 3 times and done all the tours. I have read many of the astronauts' books, including Andrew Chaikin's outstanding 'A Man on the Moon'. Obviously, I am also a huge fan of the HBO series 'From the Earth to the Moon'. On top of all that - as a 10-year-old, I sat and watched completely gripped as Armstrong made the famous first step. I admit though, that I hadn't read 'First Man'.So, what about this film? Well, it's not about going to the moon, although you could see it like that if you wanted to. So - what is it about? Now we get to the thought-provoking part; it's not clear.... I think it's about what the inner journey for Neil Armstrong might have been like. A lot of this is left up to us as we see what he experienced, and how he dealt with it.Looking at the film, it's obvious that there is something quite de-humanising about everything surrounding space flight. Astronauts rely completely on machines; machines are our way into space, machines dominate every aspect - right down to enabling us to breathe. We are strapped into this machine - and it goes...The space flight and launch sequences are brilliant. You and I are never going to experience being inside a Gemini capsule during launch - but First Man takes you as close as we are going to get. These rockets are scary and dangerous and it takes special qualities to fly in them.Then there is an aspect to the film which is on another level again; and this is that, perhaps, for Armstrong, the whole personal journey of going to the moon, and being first was for him an unreal and out of body experience. After all - what can possibly prepare you to ride one of the most powerful and sophisticated machines ever built to another world? The answer is nothing can.Armstrong in the film realises this. He is in a ground-braking and extremely dangerous line of work! The film shows this well. Test pilot, astronaut - Armstrong is very good at what he does. His role in saving Gemini 8 from disaster is shown. Had that mission ended in death for himself and Dave Scott, the whole history of the exploration of space might have turned out very differently, i.e. the Russians might have gotten to the moon first. In fact, he is so good, that he is the one chosen to solve the final problem and overcome the fraught challenge of flying that first moon landing.Also, there is the personal dimension. Armstrong is a family man - but his line of work brings him close to death on many occasions. This is not lost on Jan, his wife. Her portrayal, by Claire Foy is excellent and believable. She tries to be supportive, but it is impossible for her too. Because the business of going to the moon is so difficult, so technically challenging and dangerous, so reliant on machines that could fail - the Apollo astronauts themselves all thought that they had a one in three chance of dying on a mission. All the wives and partners knew this too, particularly after the Apollo 1 catastrophe - which wasn't even in space.OK. So, what about the film??? Well.... I liked it - but then I have deep knowledge of this subject and am always happy to watch films or shows about space. If I step back though, I can see why and how this movie might leave a lot of people cold. Why? Well, because Armstrong is shown rather dehumanized and abstracted from everything he is so profoundly absorbed with. A lot of viewers may not like the Armstrong of this movie - but I suspect that this portrayal is quite near to life. He is not shown here as some gung-ho all-American hero. Far from it. He is almost machine-like in his application to what is required to solve the problems and deal with the inherently dangerous business of going to the moon. He displays few emotions. It is unclear whether he is trying to protect himself or the people around him though this behaviour. Either way, Gosling's Armstrong does not grab you as someone you would enjoy going to the moon with. Sure - you'd get there safely - but after 10 days in space with him, you wouldn't know him any better. Armstrong would be in the Lunar Module with you - but he would be on his own inner journey.Essentially, First Man is about just that; Armstrong IS the one who has been chosen to do these things first. Why? Because he has been identified as having the qualities required to carry it off. Once chosen, he has to find a way to deal with the enormity of the technical challenge of the first landing AND the personal challenges of keeping his real life together in the face of huge danger. First Man is a film about how one particular person handled the inner journey required. The viewer is left to reflect on it.",9,0,1,27 December 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Disappointing to the point of irritation
","First of all let me say that in general I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. But this one left me cold. I've given it a day or 2 to think about it and I've decided that this is not a very good film.Now we all know that Tarantino knows his cellulose - and there is homage throughout all of his movies to some of the greatest films of all time. We know already Quentin! Why keep doing it! Isn't it about time you moved on? For me the worst point of this movie was its counterfactual content. Everyone of a certain age and intelligence knows that Hitler blew his brains out in a bunker in Berlin in 1945. But I wouldn't mind betting that many watchers would have skipped out of the cinema thinking that World War II came to an end in 1944 because of some huge explosion in a cinema! Not so.Now defenders of this movie will probably claim that 'it's an art movie - anything goes'. Okay fine. But it is still a movie. Art films don't have to be counterfactual, but they can be fictional, example, Babettes Feast, Jean de Florette, Once upon a time in the West, they still tell stories fantastically well and look brilliant. You can also have art movies that are factual, for example, the Passion of Joan of Arc, Amadeus. These are some great movies! But Inglorious Basterds doesn't hold a candle to any of these - not even in the same league. Why? On this showing Tarantino has reduced the war movie to a comedy. It's a very odd comedy, a violent comedy, a character's larger-than-life comedy. But it's a comedy nonetheless.Tarantino is trying to do a lot of things with this film. For one thing, he is making a statement about the power of film and its propaganda qualities. For another he's trying to say, ' yeah, the Jews had it rough'. Yes Quintin, we know already. He's also trying to say people will sell each other out if the price is right. Okay, we know. You told us before.The film just doesn't hang together. But then Tarantino films can have separate stories running within them, Pulp Fiction being the classic of this type. Pulp Fiction contains larger-than-life characters and is hysterically funny. I didn't want for this movie to be a comedy especially since it begins with the brazen ( and predictable) murder of a basement full of Jews hiding from the Nazis. Okay Quentin you got my attention. But then the film descends into comedy and parody and homage and we've seen it all before.One thing you can say about this film is that it is full of tension - there are long scenes with dialogue. Always nice in a movie that - dialogue, and usually Tarantino films have quite good dialogue. But this just doesn't go anywhere - it's just unbelievable silly nonsense. The only character we care about - Soshanna - is somewhat surprisingly gunned down.Tarantino is a very gifted filmmaker and storyteller. But I think he needs to get over himself. He needs to stop taking the film watcher for granted. Even the music, good though it is, is borrowed. War has in the past been been a vehicle to some of the greatest movies ever made. But this most certainly is not one of them. Disappointing.",5,12,20,15 November 2010
The Hateful Eight," Tedious
","Quintin, oh Quintin - what have you done!? This is predictable tedious rubbish. It's actually boring!! The pity of it all is that here we have assembled some good acting talent, some good possibilities, and, actually, a talented writer and director. It's all lost though. Lost in the meaningless, predictable posing and tripe. Shame!As with Inglorious Basterds, this film totally overdoes itself. (Please also see my review of that film here).We don't, or at least, I don't, want to watch silly macho posing. I don't want to listen to dialogue that, frankly, I could write myself. I don't want to accurately predict the outcome of the film by the end of the first ten minutes. I don't want to sit and have Tarantino waste my time as I watch his silly sense of humour unfold with such monotonous nonsense.... Yawn!Only two things save this film from a rating much lower than the one I've given it here. 1) The original score by Ennio Morricone is excellent. And, 2) The setting in a frozen Wyoming is good - harsh and beautiful.But that's all folks!",5,3,6,5 September 2017
The Adventures of Tintin," OK, well...Mmmm, but don't take children under the age of 10 to see it
","Lets start with the bad parts....Straight off - let me say that the rating of 'U' is wrong. It should be 'PG' at least. Example; A man is shot dead in the doorway of Tintin's apartment and there is blood all over a newspaper. Call me old-fashioned - but this is most definitely not what I want my 8 year old to see. He didn't particularly want to see it either. There are a lot of machine guns, shooting and male posturing. There is not one female character, not a single one, that could have softened this film.I was disappointed too, with the portrayal of Captain Haddock - who is shown as a shocking messed up old drunkard. I grew up in the 1960's with the cartoon version of this and the books and I don't remember him having such an issue with drink. In the film Haddocks' drink problem is shown more than it needs to be, and it crosses over the boundary into the glorification and humourisation of alcohol. Having lost a brother to drink I didn't find it humorous in the least, and as such I didn't want my son to see it either.So,why the 7/10 rating? Well - it looks GREAT! Really clever innovative imagery. Worth seeing just for that alone. The story is pretty good and age appropriate for children. The action is fairly relentless and the film captures a lot of what was good about the original French books and cartoons. Every good story covers a lot of ground and 'Adventures of Tintin' certainly does that. There is a lot of the Indiana Jones movies reprised in this film, and I liked it for that too.Overall - this is typical Spielberg, actually - not particularly good Spielberg. It doesn't need the alcohol and the shooting, it did need a female character of some sort. It's OK OK, well...Mmmm, but don't take children under the age of 10 to see it.",7,1,14,26 October 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," I wanted it to be better somehow
","I've seen all of the Harry Potter films and read the first 3 books. Going to the films has been a big movie event for us ever since the first one was announced all those years ago. I really enjoyed the first couple of 'innocent' romps.For my money though - and I have to say this - Rowling had no way to foresee the immense success of the first couple of books. They are fun, fresh and you want to find out more - so you keep reading/watching. Then it started getting serious - and a worldwide audience grew and required satisfaction. This is where the writer began to search for deeper issues, more complexity, more 'poke'. The plot lines begin to get stretched deep and moody, the author is trying to get to things which she never anticipated ever having to write about, because she never thought there would ever be any demand for any later works. She tries hard with the elemental Good Vs Evil thing and through interesting characters and connections manages to get to the 4th book out. I put Book 4 down because the whole concept had run its course by then. I didn't need to read anymore.Book/Film 4 is the point where my patience wears thin. So you can imagine that by this film I'm going along because Harry Potter films have become a habit - they have punctuated my life.I didn't really enjoy this film - it's not there to be enjoyed. It's a bleak, dark, thankless watch which has not one jot of the joy and fun of the early works. Sure - there's a war, sure, the badies are winning, sure - our heroes don't look so bright and shiny now that they don't really know what they are doing. But I found that I hardly cared; I wanted to, but I didn't.I'm assured that the film is very true to the book; and this film will satisfy devotees of the books (like my wife...). But it just didn't do it for me. I watched it as someone who has seen all the films and felt the need to watch this out of a sense of completeness. I'm not going to say I was disappointed - I like the screen Harry Potter and want to see how he and his friends develop and perform as characters. Given the content I don't think that the film could have been any different to how it was; I just wanted it to be better somehow.",6,0,0,23 November 2010
American Beauty," American Beauty - A near life experience.
","As some other reviewers have commented - this is a truly remarkable film, a one off.It grazes, in some cases rather deeply, the placidity, the complacency, the inauthenticity of the middle class, middle age experience. A wonderful film which opens doors just enough for us to get a peep at something uplifting - and then that experience is dashed.There is violence just below the surface, murder even. Yet there is passion, deep-seated need. Above all this film gives us a near life experience.The acting is - well; superb. Spacey rightly gets an Oscar. He dominates but does not carry the film. Wes Bentley gives an amazing performance. At the time I was sure he was destined for great things.Superb soundtrack - brilliant screenplay.There are so many superlatives for this movie. A must see.",10,0,1,16 September 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Great fun!!!
","I haven't seen any of the previous Mission Impossible films - but I used to love watching the TV series back in the 1970's. I have just come out of watching 'Rogue Nation' at the Ziegfeld in NY and I was surprised - a great film, great entertainment! It may not be to everyone's taste - but I really enjoyed this. It's true to the format of the original TV series, has really explosive action and builds good tension - which is modulated, rising and falling throughout the film to an excellent crescendo.Excellent special effects - excellent chase scenes!Great fun!!!",9,0,2,17 August 2015
The Lego Movie," Awesome!
","What a GREAT family movie! Just watched this again as we bought the BluRay when it came out. Didn't have the impact (of course) of the big screen experience - but still great fun.This film absolutely rips along at high pace - such that even those with an attention span measured in nanoseconds would find it impossible to wander off.The opening scenes in the city and building site are truly eye-popping, especially when seen on the big screen. These set the tone for the visuals which truly are AWESOME. The people who made this film need the Oscar for what they have done here. The visual impact is off the scale and sets new standards.I won't spoil the story with any form of description - but I will say that there is something here for everyone. Huge chunks of this are hilarious (eg, Batmans 'song'!).The Lego Movie is reverential to imagination and creativity in words and film - as the makers understand that Lego enables creativity and that films and books are great sources of inspiration. I will list the homage paid to some great films/TV series and stories: The Matrix trilogy, 2001 a Space Odyssey/The Time Tunnel (falling down the portal), Alien, The Blues Brothers, Bruce Almighty (Ok - that's not such a great film), Westerns in general, Batman, Star Wars, Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin), Toy Story. There are plenty of others - these are just the ones I can think of.This film is really REALLY good for all viewers - do not be put off by any presupposition that this is 'only for kids'. It may be - but watching it will certainly bring out the kid in you....I'm not going to give this 10 out of 10 because that would put it in the best films of all-time category (like, Casablanca or Remains of the Day, or Toy Story). Nevertheless, this film rates a 9 and is.... AWESOME!!!",9,0,2,27 July 2014
Cars 2," 'Kill Lightning McQueen'!............Inappropriate.
","I really like Pixar films, but I've always regarded 'Cars' as the weakest Pixar offering - I would give that film 7/10.Now this one - Cars 2; I verged on actively disliking this film. I particularly disliked the call - given by the Baddies; 'KILL LIGHTNING MCQUEEN'. I'm sorry - but this just isn't suitable for the very young following that a film like this is bound to attract.Not only this; there is a lot of blasting and blaming, cars fall into the sea and are evidently drowned. There is quite a lot of low/medium level violence. I didn't like any of that and I think it's inappropriate. There are actively nasty dislikable characters.The film itself is weak. It's sort of about misunderstandings and friendship, I think. But it comes out all twisted.OK - It's fairly fast moving, it's very colourful. But on the other side - it's silly and actually a bit boring.The first cars film was very mild and child-like, but Cars 2 goes in quite a different direction, a direction I didn't feel comfortable with. I'm surprised Pixar have come out with a follow-up like this, it's not like them.I can't recommend this film.",5,3,6,28 July 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Unsatisfactory
","I am a long time Star Wars fan. Not a nerd - just a movie goer who has a lot respect for the franchise. As a 19 year old, I saw 'A New Hope' in The Dominion Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, London in early January 1978. I have grown up with this stuff, and can quote every line form the original trilogy.So, you can imagine how greatly it disappoints me when I say that I found Episode VIII Unsatisfactory.!'£$%^& SPOILER ALERT !!!')£*$&A lot things about this film are just plain wrong, just plain don't add up. There are too many missed opportunities. Worse - the opportunities that are taken actually mess things up and twist them. It's frustrating to watch, and disappointing.I wanted to find out more about the ways of the Force, and how Rey might acquire and deal with these. I wanted to see Luke as the sage Jedi Master, doing what Yoda asked him to do; 'pass on what you have learned...'. I wanted to see so much that was promised in 'The Force Awakens'. But it wasn't there.Instead, I was treated to forced (and poor) self-reverential humour, characters that didn't grow together in adversity (and they do in Eps IV, V & VI). There is no 'life' in this story. It doesn't gel.Somethings do work well, but the problem is that the things that work well, are not the things I wanted or expected, to see. Chief amongst these is the encounter between Rey and Luke on the island. Luke has repudiated the Force and withdrawn from it, fearing his lack of control. Just as Obi Wan believed that he had failed with Anakin, so now Luke believes he has failed with Ben Solo. Even this isn't handled that well. Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is a profoundly conflicted character (acted better than Anakin, btw), but it is not clear why there is a 'Force Connection' between him and Rey? Snooke claims that he created this link, but this doesn't really seem credible, especially after Kylo dispatches him with Lukes light sabre. Who/what is Snooke? We don't find out.The climax featuring Luke and Kylo is very good - but then the writers go and spoil it by what happens next. As soon as we see Luke on the island and hear his music and see the two setting suns, we immediately sense that he is going to follow Yoda and pass into the Force. So it proves. That is by far the most surprising and disappointing thing that happens.I'm not bothered about the other characters, that I can't even name, who appear overblown and stiff in comparison to Luke, Kylo, Leia and Rey. I'm not bothered about the predictable and sometimes banal action that follows. I AM bothered about the fact that Episode IX now will only have Chewbacca, The Falcon, R2-D2 and C3-PO to work with. I can't really see where Star Wars can go from here.Finally. Bless you Carrie Fisher - you will always be our Princess. RIP.",5,1,2,27 December 2017
Con Air," Total and utter Trash
","Oh dear oh dear. Just watched this absolute JOKE of a movie.What is the point of this movie? None. Silly macho characters and dialogue. Nonsensical story and setting. But the worst feature has to be the acting. Nobody, not even this star-studded cast, can do anything with this. They don't even look as if they are trying, they are just hamming it up.Every cliché imaginable - surely this film is a deliberate send up? But maybe not??? Some top acting talent is right here. But what could any of them possibly have been thinking of - Cusack, Malkovich, Cage. Why were they so desperate to make chumps of themselves? Who knows? It's garbage - total and utter trash.",1,7,15,6 August 2011
Despicable Me," Despicable - no just DIRE !
","This film is TERRIBLE.Ordinarily I wouldn't waste my time even writing a review on trash like this - but - this is supposed to be one of the movies of the moment, movies of the year even. Don't waste your money - It's just dire....It just does not in any way shape or form hang together. Characters, such as they are are pointless creations. There is very little humour in here because the 'story' (I'm promoting it by suggesting it has a story...) just doesn't work as a vehicle for any gags.I went with my 7 year old - and he got restless. As for me - I fell asleep, and I wasn't woken up by any howls of laughter from the audience.I love animated films of all kinds - so it saddens me to say that Despicable Me is just a DOG of a movie. Don't bother.",3,8,24,26 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fitting finale
","I didn't particularly like DH Part 1 (see my review), but I DID like Part 2! All Hell breaks loose as He Who Must Not Be Named and his legions fall on Hogwarts in an attempt to destroy Harry Potter. It is all out War! There is a very high body count....This film is a blur of battle scenes, which are very very good and dark conversations and broodings. Central characters come to their full powers and interact well. The main themes of the whole epic saga are maintained, served and played out to fitting conclusions. It's all actually pretty darned good! There's not much I can say or want to say about the detail of this movie. The whole vast scale of the 'Harry Potter Project' comes to fruition superbly here.I would definitely recommend this film.",8,0,0,28 July 2011
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Brilliant fun!
","This is brilliant fun!!! So many reasons to watch and really enjoy this. As it starts its relatively okay Bondish silly stuff. A Kingsman is a kind of Bond type 'hiding in plain sight' kind of hero replete with weapons, gizmos and über combat skills. Then we start to see the 'makings' of Joe Public - a bloke like you and me. This is the story of how he becomes a Kingsman.The scene in the pub is brilliant...!!! Slowly but surely a 'Kingsman' is made. Kick Ass central is the destination of this train. You won't want to get off.... It does get silly - make no mistake, Samuel L Jacksons character is just daft and it all ends up in silliness! But that doesn't matter!!! A Kingsman is born and it's all cool - right down to the final scene in the pub. Don't miss this its brilliant!!!",9,4,7,5 June 2016
