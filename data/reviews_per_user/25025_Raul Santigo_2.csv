The Blair Witch Project," Score one for 'shaky' cam
","Score one for 'shaky' camPicture this:  You are in a darkened movie theatre, surrounded by the usual suspects.  There behind you, in his usual place, is the idiot kicking your chair.  The giggling teens are down in front, just where they should be. And the couple next to you is noisily plundering their giant barrel of popcorn with metronomic efficiency.  But it doesn't matter.   Because soon, safe in the hands of a reasonably competent filmmaker, you expect to be magically transported to a beautiful, surreal world in which an interesting story unfolds. But suddenly, instead, something pops on the screen, which has the look and feel of your uncle Bob's vacation video.  I mean, it's all there: the shaky image, the lens's flares, the jagged transitions.
Well, welcome to the new age of cinema.  Because now, thanks to the Blair Witch Project, the bar has been sufficiently lowered so that virtually ANYONE can make a movie.  In fact, as long as one is willing to disregard certain cinematic standards - or, standards in general - all one needs is a camcorder and, well, not much else.  Because here's the deal: that crappy video is supposed to make us think this is real.  Get it?
So class, what do we learn from this latest attempt at cinema verite?Well, the first thing is you obviously don't need special effects to fill the seats The second thing TBWP proves is that you don't need actors either.  Just three typical twenty-somethings will suffice, who look, act and talk - by and large - pretty stupid.In fairness though, that's also one of the good points of this goofy tribute to bad video (a fair amount of the time, the screen is actually blank.): the dialogue and behavior of these three young people is authentic and believable.  And so is the group's gradual descent into a kind of  Lord Of The Flies morale-crisis - especially when the trio of 2 young men and their ballsy female leader begins to realize they are lost.Despite being occasionally effective however, you'll find the story itself to be barebones.  Basically, here's the setup:  these three aforementioned yokels go into the woods to do a documentary on the Blair Witch, a subject of some fairly scary local folklore. By the middle of the film, it appears as if they really do find something dangerous.  In fact, aided by intentionally inferior production values, the film generates a creepy frisson throughout so that finally every tree in the forest looks suspicious.But trust me, the scariest thing about this rip off is how boring it is. Indeed, as we are drawn toward the inevitable cop-out ending, all I eventually wanted was to see these 3 lamebrains get killed - hopefully in the most horrible and disgusting manner possible.  That's how annoying they - and this movie - become.Actually, I lied about the scariest thing in TBWP.  The ultimately frightening horror of this movie is the way major reviewers are fawning over it, comparing it to Psycho and other classics.But I digress.  You really should still see this baby - hopefully in a theatre That way if anyone asks you if the Blair Witch actually 'gets' anyone,  you can show them your ticket stub and say, 'Yup.  She got me - for $5.00.'As for the producers of the inevitable rip-offs which will follow, 3 words of advice:  DIGITAL IMAGE STABILIZATION.",Null,0,1,8 November 1999
American History X," Bloated and violent commentary on racism is showcase for Edward Norton.
","Movies given to excesses of almost any kind can be forgiven,  provided they adopt an ideological position - even an unpopular one. Unfortunately, movies can also simply be given to excess.  That is more or less the case with American History X, a bloated, gratuitously violent film about home-grown racial bigotry.Derrick Vineyard (Edward Norton) starts out as a shy, bookish boy whose father peppers his dinner-time conversation with mild racial epithets. Dad's ignorant extemporizations, along with the circumstances of his death, are supposed to help explain Vineyard's transformation from a Wally Cleaver-like character to Ward and June's worst nightmare - the leader and eloquent spokesman of a group of Venice Beach skinheads.   But what about the Beaver?Derrick's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) plays the innocent foil, a vulnerable, ideologically labile teenager whose idolatrous admiration for his older sibling is painful to watch.  After Derrick commits an especially heinous crime and is sent to the gray-bar hotel for 3 years, Danny is left on his own.  Predictably, he becomes a skinhead himself and falls under noxious influences - Cameron (Stacy Keach at his unctuous best) - while older brother Derrick becomes the bride of at least 1 inmate (watch for a particularly harrowing 'bridal shower scene.').  Danny's champion during this sojourn is the school principal (Avery Brooks),  who still believes the kid is salvageable.This is non-linear, trendy  filmmaking at its best, rendered with flashbacks, black and white sequences and slow-motion cinematography. Interestingly, the real-time action takes place over  roughly a 24-hour period, during which time a born-again Derrick (released from prison and transformed back into a good guy) must deprogram younger brother Danny before its too late.  Meanwhile, Danny has to complete an essay assignment given to him by the principle, which the latter hopes will provide an epiphany for the boy and make him see that racism is a bad thing. Duh.Interspersed with all of this are many admittedly  powerful, gut-wrenching scenes, highlighted by  Norton's inspired performance, Furlong's believable naivetÃ© and Keach's subliminally homoerotic portrayal of an aging neo-Nazi messiah.  Elliot Gould also appears in flashback and does a nice turn as a prissy ideologue who further fuels Derrick's hatred (though hardly accounts for it).You'll also arrive at the ending before the film does -- because it is essentially given away at the beginning -- but you won't be bored.  Nor, for that matter, will you be very inspired.  You will simply remember some of the scenes.  Perhaps we all should.",Null,0,0,12 May 1999
