The Perks of Being a Wallflower," a great piece of art with important issues!
","I have read the book before and when I saw the film I was fascinated. Never before have I seen a book-adaptation with so much love for details and in such an artistic way! The film is definitely a must-watch, since it is about some very important issues. I loved how the film was binding together so many emotions- from isolation and abuse to fun, love and friends. The greatest lines from the book were all in the film and it was built up really touching. I think this film can relate to any of us in some way since it includes various different topics. Another great point of the film was the music- all the songs were chosen perfectly and with these pieces of art and the great camera work this film is in my eyes underrated and would deserve a lot more attention. I can only advise you to watch this film, it is really worth it!",10,0,2,14 August 2016
