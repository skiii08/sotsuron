Hereditary," A 6, with 1 extra point for Toni Colette's acting.
","I watched this film with high expectations after many people said it's the scariest film they've seen in a while. I came out very disappointed. The plot in this felt like a 6, maybe 6.5, one of those horror films you can say 'oh yeah, I've seen that' and wouldn't mind watching it again for kicks, but I wasn't at all glued to my seat. Throughout the whole film, I never stopped asking myself 'why was there NO police investigation carried out following Charlie's death? That's felony DUI right there.'That, and that alone, not even the whole Paimon cult thing, served as a constant reminder that this is nothing but a work of fiction. And I also felt that Peter was reduced to nothing but what seemed like a plot device. He was always no more than a medium for delivery, and that he was.I have to give an extra star for Toni Colette's performance, though. That otherworldly scream and reaction genuinely felt like it's how a mother would react upon discovering the headless body of her little girl in her car.",7,1,2,30 June 2020
Split," A showcase of McAvoy's talent
","A brilliant parade of McAvoy's diverse acting skills, really. That's all I have to say",8,0,0,3 June 2020
Sing Street," CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED
","It's criminal how underrated this film is! All the songs are great, and the storyline was so in tune with reality. I went in to see another teen movie about the struggles of reaching your dream, but I got so much more. Life in a broken home, blind devotion, repairing friendships, it was all so beautifully done and all seemed really smooth.I can understand that certain elements of the film may not make it suitable for worldwide distribution (the romance between two minors is prime example), but damn. This is criminally underrated, and arguably more enjoyable than the other musical film that stole 2016.",9,1,1,8 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Insulting
","I created an IMDb account specifically to add my 2 cents on here.I don't even know where to start. The lack of proper, well-written character depth, the boring plot, or the fact that recurring characters bear no resemblance whatsoever to their counterparts in previous films??First gargantuan mistake in my less-than-humble opinion, is when General Leia Organa floated in space - presumably taking advantage the Force. Except the Force does not work like that at all, and being in vacuum space with no air support or space suit whatsoever should've killed her.The new support character was made with minimum effort, and the acting was barely tolerable. She later ended up pushing Finn out of the way when he was ready to become a martyr in order to save whoever remained of the Resistance - he was READY to sacrifice himself for something bigger than himself, or the world he ever knew. But NOPE, gotta have a cheap non-memorable love story on the side, eh?Then, the cheap tagline of 'the spark that will light the fire that burns the First Order'? What film does Rian Johnson think he's directing, the next Hunger Games?I gave an extra star for the pogs. They're cute, as are the robots. But even then their appearances were kept to a minimum.I can't believe how insulting this is to the original creators of Star Wars, and the fans who have grown up with it, or grown up loving it.",2,9,12,3 February 2018
