Deja Vu," 10 out of 10
","I went to watch this movie yesterday with a couple friends.Nobody even knew what the film was about we just went.I was surprised actually I didn't really want to watch it,I preferred to watch Casino Royale anyway the plot starts to get very interesting.This had one of the most well written plots I ever witnessed on film.All of us were just glued to the screen with rapted attention.The acting was good,the plot,the special effects,technology,script...I cant find anything wrong with this movie.IT WAS JUST TOO GOOD!I would recommend that if you haven't seen it GO AND WATCH IT NOW.My bf was freaking out for nearly an hour after we left the movie about how good it was.He even said it was better than Saw 3 and he's a huge Saw fan.This is definitely hands down one of Denzel Washington's best films.Any movie with Denzel is just on.I give this movie a 10/10.I love this movie and I think I would buy it on DVD when it comes out also.Definitely one of the best films of 2006.",Null,0,2,2 January 2007
The Notebook," Best Romantic Film!
","This movie to me anyway was the best romantic movie I have seen.It was so touching I actually had to hold back tears.I watched it a good couple times and I still don't get tired of it.The message is simple true love never dies no matter how hard you to try to move on and forget it.And even though you forget it there is someone there to remind you of it.One part of the movie that made me angry was the mother hiding the 365 letters Noah wrote to Alli.Money over love is total bull**** in the end love is triumph and I couldn't believe she put through her daughter through that pain thinking she was doing her good.Why not let her live her life make her own mistakes?Who knows she might come out happier in the end.In which she did she had a life filled with endless love.The ending was good,I felt that it was better they both died together.Noah wouldn't have gone on without Alli and Alli would have forgotten who she was.Thats how love today should be not tainted but society.I believe love back then and love now are totally different.It seems more real and less complicated at times.If you haven't watched this film I would highly recommend that you do.It maybe a chick-flick to some but it was truly touching and worth the time.",10,1,3,16 September 2006
Glory Road," Take It
","I believe this was an incredible movie.You could feel the passion,the determination,the drive of these fine young men to win this game that made basketball history.To them it was definitely more than just a game,to them it clearly was their life.Josh Lucas acted pretty good in this movie,you actually believed he wanted to make the talent of the underdog black players known not only to themselves but to the rest of the world.Near the end of the movie when the players shouted 'TAKE IT'I got goosebumps because I knew they were gonna win.There was no way anybody could stomp that determination they had at the precise moment.This movie is definitely a must see,it is truly an inspiration not just to black players but to all basketball players,that if you have talent make it known that you do.",9,0,1,1 June 2006
Click," Click was funny as hell!
",Click was soooooooooooo funny.Oh my God even a person without a sense of humor would have definitely LAUGHED and LAUGHED at this movie.I know I did it was worth my $12.50.O dear Jesus from beginning to end my boyfriend and I laughed.Honestly we thought this was just gonna be another make out session.However we turned out to be wrong just this once.I swear every time I hear the phrase 'Are you shitting me?'I burst out laughing.Most of Adam Sandler's movies are funny but have no depth or meaning really this one however actually touched me and the kiddies could actually learn a lesson from it.I would recommend this movie to ANYONE its truly funny stuff.This has to be Adam's best!,10,1,7,18 September 2006
