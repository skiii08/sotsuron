The Blair Witch Project," Much ado about nothing
","I know thousands of people have commented on this one already, so perhaps another comment made by me is as big a waste of space as the movie itself. I can honestly say that I have seen very few films worse than this one on a big screen, if any, but the Haunting is a contender. Me and my girlfriend at the time laughed at it, and it's not supposed to be a comedy!",Null,0,1,29 September 2001
