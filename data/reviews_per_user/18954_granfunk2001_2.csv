Blade Runner 2049," What happened?
","The slow turning ceiling fan.
Atmosphere.
The MUSIC....just a bunch of blaring noise in 2049.
All were missing.
No character development.
The movie itself at least was believable, but we the people want characters that we can associate with. Decker was one of us. K was, well, K. Robot. I understand the plot and it was nice to have some mystery to figure out, but this movie was NOT Blade Runner. OK for a Syfy movie though but..........try again. do better.
