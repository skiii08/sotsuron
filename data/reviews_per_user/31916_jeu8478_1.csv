Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," See it for yourself
","Star Wars:Episode I: no movie released in the last 20 years has so divided people as to its merits, and caused such intense derision and anger among its viewers.  I am one of those who feels compelled to defend it, not because of its place in the grand scheme of things, but rather because I just feel that it's a good movie.  All I can say is that viewers should decide for themselves.Why do I like one of the most ridiculed movies in a long time?  First of all, it's a great adventure.  Many remarks have been said about how 'The Phantom Menace' doesn't feel like Star Wars, but in truth, it has the sweep of the best Star Wars films.  It takes place on three worlds, all different and amazing to behold.  The characters find themselves in diverse situations.  Another reason that I like it is that it sets up what we've already seen beautifully.  You can actually feel remorse that small mistakes in characters' decisions will lead to the deaths of many people, as well as the Jedi.  You can see the Emperor to be, Senator Palpatine, scheme his way to greater power.As far as what people think is bad, many have gone out of their way to criticize the movie's dialogue.  To them I say, it's a fun science fiction movie, not a Shakespearean play.  People also criticize Jar Jar.  Well, he is kind of annoying, but believe me, he'll grow on you.  And if you didn't like the movie the first time, watch it again.  It will grow on you, too.I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,24 October 2001
