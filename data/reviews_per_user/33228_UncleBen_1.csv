Requiem for a Dream," Painfully Beautiful
",A truly wonderful movie about a 4 people who descend into the depths of drug hell.  Very powerful performances and outstanding direction abound.  Aronofsky blends the real and dream-like into an amazing picture.  Highly recommended.  I can only hope it somehow finds a wider audience.,10,0,0,18 November 2000
