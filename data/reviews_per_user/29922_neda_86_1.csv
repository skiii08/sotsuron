Requiem for a Dream," One of a kind!
","I would like to start off by saying that this was a great movie, the story, music, act and their unique way of shooting. I saw this movie with no expectations, thinking it would just be another junkie movie. I was wrong, seriously wrong. The story itself was very touching and it made me feel like one of them in the movie!... really a movie I'd recommend //Neda ;D",10,0,0,21 January 2003
