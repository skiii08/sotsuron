Hereditary," Strange and Haunting
","I watched this last night and it kinda freaked me out. 
NOT, because of the plot and events... which familiar stuff to anyone who has watched a lot of horror films... but because of the way it does things... the raw emotions on display and the pacing that defies Hollywood convention. It's disturbing in how it removes certain comfortable cinematic standards to amp up the horror. Most of the horror here is expressed between the characters... not running from some rubber monster. 
It takes risks, I'm sure a number of viewers saw comedy where I saw horror... saw bad acting where I saw performances I'm not used to seeing in American films. 
This isn't an overtly 'BOO!' scary movie... no jump scares... it's a slow build to a haunting feeling that stuck with me till... well, it's still with me. 
It's not for everyone, I saw it alone because I knew my friends aren't horror fans and wouldn't 'get it'. But it's above and beyond what I hoped for going in (knowing pretty much nothing about it). Anyway, great horror movie... if you love horror movies like The Haunting, The Witch, The Invitation... things without overt in-your-face monsters and BOO! moments.",9,2,5,25 June 2018
12 Years a Slave," Well-made but that's about it.
","I don't really understand all the praise this film has been getting. It's not a 'bad' film by any measure... but it doesn't really say anything new, or say anything old in a new way. It's basic message is 'slavery was bad'. That's it. The main character is just a victim and a witness. He doesn't transform or overcome (it's up to a time-traveling white man to save him). He's not particularly admirable or craven... or anything. He's just kind of there, taking in all the cruelty and insanity around him. It would have been far better to have concentrated less on the too-familiar beatings and humiliations and show us more of his life before and after the kidnapping/horrors he endured. As it stands, there's not much context. What is shown of his prior life seems almost ridiculously Utopian (the North was NEVER free of racism) and afterward... well, we don't get much despite some notations that suggest the REAL story might have been his attempts to use the legal system to find justice for the crimes against him. Really, I think the focus of this movie is on the wrong parts of the story... indicting the usual suspects and familiar villains rather than the smug racists in the North who refused to help the man find any real satisfaction.",7,6,13,23 February 2014
