The Blair Witch Project," i wish i had asked for our money back!
","to make this short, it was a complete waste of our money.  i have not seen a movie this low in quite awhile.  i wish i had a buck for every time the f word was used.  remember folks, if you can't come up with the words for a decent dialog just throw in the f word and a few choice others. i know the purpose behind the camera work but it was bad also.",1,0,3,1 September 1999
Titanic," EXPECTED MORE
","i did enjoy this movie, but with all the build-up that surrounded it i expected the mother of all blockbusters.  it wasn't.  it is an enjoyable view but not earth shattering like i was expected to believe. bob",8,2,3,12 February 1999
