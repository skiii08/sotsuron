Ford v Ferrari," Fantastic Cinema
","This was good! VERY GOOD. Finally, a film that's not a comic book. A film about complex characters that still hits all the high notes that you want in a movie - moments of humor, moments of emotional depth, and an exciting final third act as you root for your heroes to win the big race that the entire movie has been building up to! More movies like this, please.",9,2,3,30 November 2019
The Disaster Artist," Pretty Funny
","James Franco is great in this. At first, it almost feels like you're watching a Saturday Night Live skit as you watch his character - real life Tommy Wiseau - try to make it in Hollywood alongside his friend Greg (played by Franco's real life brother Dave). Tommy Wiseau isn't just weird. He's bizarre. So bizarre in fact that you question if he really acts like that. But look him up, and yes he does. And James Franco's commitment to the performance makes it work. It stops feeling a like an SNL skit and starts to feel like you've entered the Twilight Zone of Tommy's life. The main question I had in my head was Why did Greg (who seemed pretty normal) want to be friends with Tommy? Was it just the money? Watch it and draw your own conclusions.",8,0,0,22 January 2019
Arrival," Thought-provoking but slow
","This is a slow-moving, cerebral movie that in the second half moves with more urgency and intrigue. If not anchored by such a strong performance by Amy Adams, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. Though at times I found it slow, I never wanted to turn it off, because the central question of the movie - WHY ARE THE ALIENS HERE? - is compelling enough that you have to stick it out to find out the answer.",7,1,1,23 March 2020
The Nice Guys," Lots of laughs and fun action
","One thing I love about this movie is that it takes all of the standard action film moments and turns them on their head (often making those moments more realistic by poking fun at them). For example, when Ryan Gosling's character falls from the stairs onto a table during a big chase scene, he hits the table and rolls to the ground very hard and very awkwardly. This film starring Gosling and Russell Crowe is smart, silly, and meta.",9,0,1,16 May 2018
