Raiders of the Lost Ark," Greatest action adventure of film indusry
","A movie worth watching over and over. It has it all, adventure, drama, comedy, horror, fantasy...
The score by the great John Williams gives us a well known theme.",9,1,2,4 October 2019
Rocketman," Bad Fantasy Musical about Elton without Elton singing
","Two things dissapointed me. 1- Elton John´s songs are Not performed by Elton John. Taron may be a good singer, but Queen didn´t make the same mistake in Bohemian Rhapsody. Rammi Malek didn´t sing Queen´s songs. Listening to Mercury and Queen loud in a movie theater was amazing.
I can´t say I paid to listen to Taron sing Elton´s songs.
2- This also reminded me a lot of Michael Jackson´s Moonwalker. Another senseless musical with a script made for children. It did have awesome musical moments though, but the rest was crap. At least they should have left Elton´s voice in the songs to at least enjoy those musical moments.The scenes are random also, so it´s also confusing. And Elton John levitating while playing piano?? Sounds like a MJ idea for a movie.
I should have watched a documentary about EJ instead.",4,12,27,8 June 2019
Us," Bad movie
",This is a bad movie. Don´t waste your time and money believing in the fake reviews. It has no interesting plot or story. Aside from some funny dialogues I was really bored.,3,1,4,26 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Great sequel
","I like both DC and Marvel movies and this one is as entertaining as the first one perhaps even more. 
It nods so many films and characters such as DC comics (Batman v Superman: DoJ, Justice League, Green Lantern), Marvel (Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, X Men First Class, X Men Origins: Wolverine, Logan), 007, The Passion of the Christ, Panic Room, Flashdance, The Goonies (starring Josh Brolin), The Karate Kid, Terminator, Basic Instinct, Interview with the Vampire, Yentl, Frozen, My Little Pony,Top Gun and so many more. ItÂ´s happens so fast you have to really pay attention to it.
It even has at least 10 cameos in it.

Justice League," Great movie but too short for a superhero movie
","Great movie even without Snyder's cut it makes a great film. I as millions of fans would love to watch Snyder's cut though.The downside is that the movie was too short for a superhero movie, even more for a multi-super hero movie. It seems it was WB execs who made that decision and not the directors. Many of great scenes were left on the cutting floor which we hopefully expect to watch in Snyder's Director's Cut blu-ray edition or an extended edition. Fans are gathering signatures to get the original JL cut. So let's hope we get to watch it later.It has great score but at times I felt I was listening to a Tim Burton film, I prefer Zimmerman's better for DC movies.Spoilers ahead:Another downside was that people were expecting John Williams 'Superman Theme when superman joins the fight against the villain, which would have been awesome to listen to (people are expecting that here as same as for the most recent Bond movies, the Bond music in the middle of the movie). When the man of steel is brought back to life you can hear a bit of the superman theme but in a darker tone. You can listen to it in the soundtrack.We were also expecting superman to wear the black suit.There were funny and cool moments like:1- Elfman used his 1989 Batman Theme again in Justice League. 2- A green lantern scene fighting in the movie (and dying) and we see the ring flying in search for a new Green Lantern which we expect to see in JL2. 3- The Superman vs The Flash race credits scene. 4- And the scene with Deathstroke credits scene. 5- The original Jimmy Olsen from 1978 scene saved by Cyborg (which unfortunately didn't make it to theaters) but you can watch it in the trailer.Some of us notticed Superman's digitally removed mustache, I blame the entertainment news for letting us now, so we paid more attention to it.The main villain, Steppenwolf seemed a little cartoonish and I don't think he made a great villain.But even with these downsides the movie was a lot of fun and definitely worth watching again.",9,0,6,29 November 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Slow unlike his previous films and an homage to Sharon Tate
","I have seen the previous 8 Tarantino films and he always has A actors in them. I thought I was going to like this one but it was painfully slow and with no sense at all. The acting was great, cinematography too, there were funny scenes including one with a guy playing Bruce Lee (this event never happened in real life) and fans of Lee might be outraged and laugh at the same time with this unreal but funny scene.
The last minutes of the film were really a Tarantino movie with some of the gore and violence thatÂ´s been in his previous movies (I am not a fan of gory nor violent movies at all, but I find QTÂ´s funny and quite different).
it seems OUATIH was made because of his love and nostalgia to good old films from the 60s and 70s and for the ending, he created a timeline on the Sharon Tate fate because I assume, he wanted to do an homage to Sharon and the other unfortunate victims.",5,6,15,27 July 2019
The Lion King," Rip off 1950´s Japanese Kimba story
","Many people in the west, don´t know that the beloved Lion King story most people know was actually a stolen idea (yes, Disney stole the idea) from a 1950´s japanese story named 'Kimba: The White Lion', name sounds familiar? The rest of the characters are also from the original asian version created by the late comic artist Osamu Tezuka (1928-1989) creator of the famous comic Astroboy.
Going back to the film it is not better from the 1994 version at all, not even the music.",3,7,14,27 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Snoring suring climax
","Slow boring movie. I rather watch 2 mosquitoes fight for a drop of blood. 
Typical movie where a kid saves the day. 
There was even a guy snoring during the climax of the movie.",3,4,8,11 April 2018
Hotel Mumbai," Crude but great movie
",This film based on tragic true events is very crude and gory but unfortunately thatÂ´s real life sometimes. it keeps you on the edge even though there are a few scenes that are not believable like innocent people going around the hotel without being notticed by the terrorists.,7,0,14,2 July 2019
Sicario," An awesome instense movie
",One of the best movies I´ve ever seen with a soundtrack that makes you feel as if you´re there. Scenes are brutally realistic and intense.,9,1,2,17 September 2018
The Disaster Artist," Why Franco....Why??!!! A bad movie about a bad movie
","I don´t understand why this movie has high ratings unless these reviewers are fans of The room, one of the worse movie ever made. And talks about academy awards? What??!! Is not 127 hours, people. 
I liked other films from the Franco bros, and the rest of the cast but this...naaah
The actors from The disaster movie...sorry, artist, wore fake wigs and fake beards in the movie, this I also never understood. Was this to create an ambiance of a lousy movie or what?
And I don´t understand why we don´t know Wiseau´s origins (birth place, birth date, where he got his millions. I wonder why the IRS never que$$tioned him??) Did the IRS got money from Wiseau for IRS ¨charity¨?",2,4,9,2 January 2018
Joker," More than a thousand fake reviews givin a 'masterpiece 10'
","Even before the movie came out there were over a thousand reviews giving a 10 and claiming it was a 'masterpiece' so how can you rate 10 something you haven´t seen?? Fakes!!
It´s a great movie but definitely Not a masterpiece, it´s a modern taxi driver, a slow movie in many parts but still a good film and Phoenix was definitely great.
The movie is Not about the comic´s Joker but it is interesting to watch the approach being a psychological drama which fits into todays mental health issues in U.S citizens.
Putting aside that it´s slow and Not accurate as in the comics is definitely worth watching.",7,2,13,29 October 2019
Creed II," Remake of Rocky II, III and IV...who´s next Clubber Lang´s son?
","First of all, I think the Rocky (the 6th one I didn´t like ´cause it was too depressing) movies had everything, not what we see nowadays.I felt this movie as remake mix of Rocky II, III and IV because it uses very similar, almost identical scenes, plots and even dialogues and music !!!As a non-Rocky movie, it would have been good, but Creed II went down the ¨revenge plot (Drago)¨ road and used a lot from the Rocky movies and felt ordinary.Now who´s the next contender, Clubber Lang´s son?",6,1,2,15 December 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," One of the best comedies in recent years
",This movie is so fresh and funny and one of the best comedies in recent years. It followed a mini movie and after this movie there was a TV series. The TV show has some funny moments but neither of these can be compred to the movie.I truly recommend it.,9,0,0,13 June 2019
