Requiem for a Dream," A look into the ugly, true world of addiction
","After hearing about how depressing and surreal this film is, years and years later I finally watch it. I've never been put into the state of shock I was in after watching this movie; The reality of addiction and self-destruction that is put into this film has left a distressing impact on me that no other film has ever done before. This is one of those movies that you would recommend to someone in a heartbeat but also a movie that you would advise someone to stay away from because of the emotional impact it leaves on you after; It's also a movie that you would have to watch at least once as many people have said.
Absolute masterpiece, all I can say.",10,12,13,25 October 2018
