Black Swan," Aronofsky is evolving ..... without losing his roots! Wow!
","Nina is an aspiring ballet dancer. All she strives for is the role of the swan in swan lake. Playing the white swan doesn't seem to be the problem, rather the black swan develops into an obstacle. After the director of her school tells her to be the next swan Nina falls into a twisted daydream battling yet welcoming her dark side.The story is as simple as it is complex at the same time. But the joker of this film is definitely Aronofsky's typical pace-play, cut, camera and most of all: sound design! Especially the sound makes this film exceptional - while on one hand it is filled with beautiful classical music performed mostly minimally (piano) and on the other with dark distorted spheres, back-hair-raising-sound effects and very creative transitions to support the cut pace. Aronofsky quotes himself without forgetting to show development and exactly those 'once missing elements' make this film very mature and yes, indeed a worthy Academy Award contestant. In my opinion the film sometimes had scenes stretched a little too long while it could have celebrated others to a larger extent. Overall it was very impressive to see a film that can't really be compared to anything I have ever seen. Sure, the story is not the most original but in this case it's more about how it is told. The triangle Portman-Cassel-Kunis works just perfectly - carrying this film with all its beauty and horror. If you trace back the history of Darren Aronofsky's films this one definitely marks a milestone. It is the combination of elements he was experimenting with in the past - and now put together to a wonderful intermezzo! I'm impressed!",8,0,1,27 February 2011
Transformers," so sad...
","As a kid I was totally hooked on those mystery robots that can transform and fight their epic war. I owned at least 20 Transformers, always watched the animated series and just couldn't wait to see them on a 'real' screen.The more I hoped, the more I got disappointed. In fact, my friend had to keep me on the seat during movie because several times I was about to get up and leave the theater. Why? In fact very simple...Maybe I was looking for that old Transformer feeling I had when I was a kid. Well, it didn't come back at ANY point of the movie. Instead I got sprinkled with a film without any logic, intelligence nor uniqueness. People told me that this is the next barrier of film, no, it isn't. It shows very well how you can damage a great story with a redirection of the cash flow of the makers. Here ALL the money flowed into special FX, full stop. The cast is exceptionally dull, shallow and underdeveloped. The script is so cheesy that a 10 year old could have written it (maybe that's the target audience but how is a ten year old supposed to get nostalgic on this one?). Some excerpts of what I found 'head shakingly' stupid: <ul><li>Robots that talk in Ghetto slang </li></ul><ul><li>A secret service that is so secret, not even the state knows about it </li></ul><ul><li>Soldiers that shoot shoot shoot and just don't seem to notice that their actions have no effect </li></ul><ul><li>The whole arsenal of the US military is 'shown off'! </li></ul><ul><li>Robots trying to 'hide' from the target's parents and behaving like amateurs. </li></ul><ul><li>The 'character' of the little evil spybot is just too similar to the spiders in 'Eight Legged Freaks', making noises like a baby. </li></ul><ul><li>The people behave like in Jerry Zucker movies: stupid, illogical, immature, ... </li></ul><ul><li>If you have seen Bad Boys 2 or The Island you will notice extremely strong similarities considering the action. Actually it's just a repeat. </li></ul><ul><li>Why do you always have a clear look at Megan's tanned breasts?</li></ul>When the movie was finished I was close to crying. I felt like I was robbed of any feeling or nostalgia that I had about the 'Transformers'. I decided to erase this movie out of my memory though it has done a lot of damage already. I gave it five points because it looks expensive, of course the action is well filmed (although edited a little too fast at some points), the robots move really convincing and the impacts they have on the environments also appear very real. Still, it just doesn't help the film to be enjoyable... Hollywood, what have you become?",4,1,4,24 September 2007
