Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why, please tell me why....
","What is everybody crying about, of course it's not THE ULTIMATE MOVIE, we all were waiting for?? But how could it be.But I want to give it a second shot. I'm not gonna watch it anymore till the Episode III has arrived. And only then I want to watch it again, Episode I - VI back to back. Then maybe you've forgotten about in the 12 hour marathon, or you'll see that it's the boring beginning of an otherwise great, extremely long movie called 'Star Wars'I hope so....",10,12,17,16 January 2001
Forrest Gump," A wonderful movie, but...
","I really liked Forrest Gump the first time I watched it and I still do like it.But can someone explain to me why it won 6 oscars, including best picture and best actor, in the same year that The Shawshank Redemption & Pulp Fiction were released. Forrest Gump is a good movie but it isn't in the same league as TSR or PF. Will the academy ever apologise for this mistake and many others? I think they should.Tom Hanks was good, but the real winner was Morgan Freeman. Robert Zemeckis did a great job, but what Quentin did.....WOW. Forrest Gump is a wonderful film, but in this year against Pulp and esp. Shawshank it shouldn't have won.This (Forrest Gump) is a great indication that the academy awards don't always get it right, this comes mainly through the hype which surround some movies therefore maybe the oscars should  be held a year later when the hype is gone. (Titanic vs. L.A. Confidential another example) Then the real winners will win hopefully.1994 was a great year but the academy got all the main oscars wrong (best actress was Natalie Portman for Leon), what a shame.Nevertheless my rating for Forrest Gump is 8/10",5,2,5,24 September 2000
Cast Away," Hanks' Tour de Force
","Just saw this movie a couple of hours ago. Let me get straight to the point. This movie is not good, it isn't bad either but it doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. The first part (introducing the character(s)). We meet Tom and Helen, Tom is a sleazeball yuppie who only cares about his job, Helen euh... has no character. I didn't care about either one. The second part (plain crash) this was good, but not as good as the 'ALIVE' plain crash, but it had it's moments. The third part(Tom only on island part 1). This is were the problems lie. It's very very slow, it's all about the nature cinematography (if you want to see this, please rent or buy THE THIN RED LINE) it was nicely done but not perfect. Tom Hanks is a good actor, but I simply do not care if, I know he is alone on the island, I know he will make a fire, I know he will learn to break coconuts, I know he will make an imaginary friend, (all seen in the trailer), but there's NOTHING more. This trailer ruined the entire film. That's why this part is very boring. The third part (Tom on island 4 years later and escaping). This part I enjoyed, we see a man who was spend 4 years of his life alone, of course he's cracking up, wouldn't you, but this part isn't long enough, In the beginning we only see the first weeks/months of his solitude, if you really want to see character development it had to be spread out more over the years, not only the first and last month. The last part(Tom and Helen meet again) some good parts (his sleeping on the floor/his disinterrest for being wet and the towel he gets) but mainly bad parts. The dialogue with 'Stan' for not being with him when his wife died, and the scenes with Helen Hunt. So what do we got : Tom Hanks' role was good (oscar-nominated worthy, not winning) and another Robert Zemeckis film I just didn't get a real good feeling about.(Forrest Gump and Death Becomes Her being the others)",6,1,1,24 January 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Truth, beauty, freedom, love
","I finally got around to see this film, I thought it would be a good film, boy, how wrong I was, it was a great film.It's a love story, but not only about love for another human being, but also for the love of art. Art in any sense, music, cinema, architecture, etc. Whichever form. All is being brought to us by the almost forgotten form of cinema, musical. The film-musical had it's prime during a time of depression and war, which main purpose was to give a little joy to the people. During the fifties and sixties, they tried to make them a little bit more serious or to take big Broadway productions to the screen. But by the summer of love the musical was as good as dead.So now we enter the 21st century and a whole generation doesn't know what movie-musicals are all about. They have never seen films with Gene Kelly - Judy Garland - Fred Astaire. What Baz Luhrman did was great, create a modern day version of 'Singin' In The Rain', a film packed with modern classic songs. 'Moulin Rouge' is the same concept as 'Singin' In The Rain', old songs covered in a new story. The only distinction is that Baz Luhrman also gave the old songs a make-over. So we have a musical for the MTV-generation. It was a bold idea which happened to succeed perfectly.Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent were wonderful. The art-direction, cinematography and costumes were spectacular and the choice of music terrific.In my eyes you can only hate this film, if you loath music or cinematography. But for me these forms of art are a basic human need, just like oxygen, food, water and love.'Moulin Rouge' a lust for the eyes and ears. 10/10",10,0,1,18 October 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Of The 90's
","The Shawshank Redemption is the best film of the 90's. And probably the most beautiful film ever. For a long time I thought Pulp Fiction was the best of the two, but as time goes by I've learned Shawshank is the better.This is a film that will be remembered and loved for all-time. It doesn't matter if you see this movie today, next week or in 10 years time from now. It will always have this effect on people it has right now. It took a while for audiences to really appreciate this film, because they didn't understand that 'hope is a good thing', but knew that 'life was like a box of chocolates and didn't know what we're going to get' later that year.'Hype is a bad thing, maybe the worst of things'The only bad thing I can think about is the dutch translation for the novel by Stephen King which is 'De Ontsnapping' and I'm NOT going to translate it for all those who haven't seen it yet, cause it gives away the final twist.I hope more and more people will love this film. I hope films like this will be made. I hopeRating 10/10",10,0,0,25 September 2000
