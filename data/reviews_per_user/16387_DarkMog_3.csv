Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," While it isn't perfect, it is sure a lot of fun to watch.
","The reviews about this film have been mixed; several people have said that it lacks severely, but I disagree. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace proved to me that there is still magic left in the movies. There is also something in it that I found very enjoyable: a distinct lack of cynicism. Movies and television shows today, especially comedies, are so cynical that it seriously gets on my nerves sometimes. It's nice to see something with even a slightly uplifting outlook on life, considering the fact that movies such as the 'The Matrix' (which was excellent) have had a distinctly unhappy, depressing view of society. Granted, the script isn't great, but has it ever been?  Part of the fun of the Star Wars series is the 'gee-whiz' type of script that all of the films have had.  You aren't going to find anything deep or profound, but you are going to find that you are having a good deal of fun just sitting back and watching.  One last thing: Jar-Jar. Jar-Jar is the movie's only real bane; they should have simply taken out the Chewbacca-type role and not have had him in there. He adds nothing to the story, and succeeds only in appealing to the very young. Despite this small fact, 'Phantom Menace' entertains, and proves that the best movies are the ones that are fun to watch.  You can bet that I'm going back to this one.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
Pi," Odd, not exactly enjoyable, but interesting.
","Pi is an extremely odd movie.  I considered it the equivalent of reading Neuromancer by William Gibson:  it's only enjoyable if you resign yourself to the fact that you probably won't understand most of what's going on. Pi is about a lot of things, really; it's about a mad but brilliant mathematician trying to discover the secret of the number, it's about a group of religious Jews trying to find the secret to communicating with God, and it's about teetering on the brink of insanity.  It's well worth renting and sitting through, despite the fact that it's barely understandable, although it's not the type of film that you want to watch twice.",8,0,0,22 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Still great fun to watch after all these years.
","Star Wars, truly, is one of the greatest films ever made.  Not because of great acting, not because of a great script, but just because it is pure fun.  Everything about this movie is enjoyable; the plot is a good old adventure story, where an unlikely hero saves the galaxy.  However, even with it's standard plot, Star Wars catapults itself to a higher level than most adventures.  First off, it has amazing special effects for its time. Even though it was made for only $10 million (pennies compared to some of today's blockbusters), it still shines through with very well-done visuals, especially with some of the alien costumes.  Needless to say, this movie inspired an incredible cult following, as well as four sequels, two Ewok T.V. movies, a horrendous Christmas Special, and too much merchandising to count.  All in all, this is just one of those movies that I like to watch over and over again, one that almost grows better and better with each viewing.",10,0,0,22 May 1999
