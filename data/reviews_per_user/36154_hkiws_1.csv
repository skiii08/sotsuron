Deja Vu," artful pictured, technically brilliant presented BOREDOM
","The movie starts in the middle of the war on terror. A super-gangster has been able to burst one of the prestigious flagships of the army into little pieces. Over 500 killed and thousands injured. Starting in aesthetically slow motion and scenic soundtrack the movie worsens continuously . An selected AFN-guy is starting to take part in the investigation and what follows is a eclectic clash of time-travelling action-sequences and more or less predictable interventions into the path of time. The unconvincing plot wants us to believe that a time-machine could have been developed without making use of it - and that just because of a more or less disinterested government and scientists. Unnecessary violence, yelling of pseudo-exciting and pseudo-scientific rubbish as well as thrilling intimations of being burned alive, being shooten and brought to death by cars doesn't necessary lead to an good action movie - at least not when served in the context of a plot that insults the intellect of the thinking spectator. Luckily the time window of the machine isn't opened to the genocide of Rwanda or Nazi-Germany - but that's the only thing to appreciate about the setting.Will the AFN-guy be able to save the free world and experience the mysteries of love?
