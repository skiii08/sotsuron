The Avengers," Big, Noisy, Heartless
","Great anticipation. Great cast, terrific writer/director. What could go wrong? Plenty.I suppose the challenge of presenting the The Avenger's assembly was a thankless chore. So much needed exposition, the Marketing Department's requirement to wow audiences, the pressure in creating a summer blockbuster. And that's the issue; a blockbuster was concocted rather than a film with heart in the tradition of the Marvel-Film. (Or any film with damaged characters.) The first 30 minutes are a slog. The last headache-inducing in much the same way the noisy Transformers films were (Transformer's action being the template for the coda of 'Avengers').Mr. Whedon forgot to truly assemble these divergent superheroes. Tossed off one-liners do not replace or exemplify heart and truth. Instead, we lurch, uncaring, between sequences: this one belonging to Iron Man and Captain America, the next Hulk and Thor. Ms. Paltrow must have enjoyed a (multi) million dollar pay day for a few minutes of screen time. Mr. Hiddleston becomes tiresome in a one-note part. In a lapse, Ms. Johansson bears no trace of Russian accent. (Guess Rosetta Stone should be congratulated.) The amazing Mr. Renner (with two pages of dialogue, tops) is simply a placeholder, as is Thor, whose continuing grudge with brother Loki is toothless. Missed opportunities all.There are a few bright spots. Mr. Ruffalo as both the troubled Banner and Hulk, and the unforgettable Mr. Downey whose attitude is enough as he delivers the best lines. Forget the rest. They're interchangeable and disposable.Yes, it is fun and top notch in FX. So what? Any big budget, FX driven film lays claim to those same superlatives. The result here is a disappointment. Maybe Whedon should resurrect Buffy.Maddeningly, way too much but not enough, much like the coterie of villains in 'Spiderman 3' where Peter Parker's struggle to own his responsibility is lost in the noise. Mr. Whedon is not the first director to lose sight of story in whiz-bam-boom, and here he's not sure-footed in the execution. Maybe Avengers II (pre-sold with the Skrulls) will be better now that we (kinda) know more about these assembled superheroes.Technically, the 3D showed a few seams: grainy and indistinct. This seems part and parcel of conversion in Post rather than in capturing in the format.There's no sense asking you to pass. You've probably already seen it. Dissenting voices are few, but please carefully consider before reflexively braying, 'IT'S GREAT!!!'",4,6,23,8 May 2012
Black Swan," Trashy and Inert
","There is one saving grace to this bird (Turkey, not Swan): Natalie Portman. While she has always been a fine actor, this performance raises her a notch. There is no God if AMPAS members fail to nominate her.The cinematography and editing are all top notch. In fact, there are a few stunning shots.What, then, is the problem? In a word, story.It's not so much this is 'Repulsion' on New York's Upper West Side, it's that the filmmakers rub your nose in it. The anti-art conceit boils the proceedings down to a cliché-ridden, low grade horror film. Repetitive and predictable from Frame One, 'Black Swan' adds a bit of Cronenburg psychosexuality.The film's most interesting aspect is 'suffering-for-art'. (A dramatic cliché also done to death.) If only the noise from the rest of the film was dialed down. Aronofsky should heed the oft-repeated advice given to Ms. Portman, 'Let go!'To say the least, 2010 was a bleak, lackluster year filled with cinematic disappointments. 'Black Swan' does shine compared to most fare. That does not make it a great, or even good, film. When you're starving you'll swallow anything, and those who have never seen another film will enjoy 'Black Swan' tremendously.",4,5,25,20 December 2010
World War Z," Not The Book and Barely a Zombie Film
","From the original 'Night of the Living Dead' to '28 Days Later,' 'Shaun of the Dead' and everything in between (and in the future), what hasn't been explored in cinematic Zombiedom. 'World War Z' uses smoke and mirrors in an attempt to separate it from the rest... and modestly succeeds.Swapping the gratuitous gore usually present in this Horror sub-genre for tension, 'Z' scours the globe in search of Patient Zero. Leading the immunological quest is former UN employee Gerry Lane who careers from location to location one bite ahead of the Zombies. Mr. Pitt's understated, thoughtful portrayal is a real plus.Unlike the book, these 'Zekes' don't feast on flesh. The infected act like individual parts of a large virus with the single-minded goal of replicating. And that they do within twelve seconds of the big bite.The grim 'Z' wastes no time as Philly is overrun in the first ten minutes. The rest is a good ride: the suspense is palpable; Zombie furor frightening; the set pieces stunning - particularly Jerusalem and the in-flight infection. But film history works against 'Z'. There is a veritable encyclopaedia of Zombie films preceding it. Even though we haven't seen it quite like this before, we've seen it all before.That makes 'Z' simply a Zombie film with the blood dialed down to nada, adding a dollop of 'Contagion,' folding in the tired plot point of a man dragooned into service while protecting his family.The short running time cuts the story to the bone a bit too closely. There's some confusion about Gerry's past while the end is predictable and pavement for a sequel. (Continuing Hollywood's abysmal record of forgetting how to end their films by leaving them open ended in case the film is a hit and sequel worthy.) There was much buzz about re-shoots and drama in the production of 'World War Z.' It shows.A no-great-shakes-summer-popcorn film, more thriller than horror, 'World War Z' is an enjoyable night at the flicks, but not the rebirth (or re-death) of the Zombie film.Those who enjoyed the book will find little of it in the film.",6,2,8,21 June 2013
Concussion," Welcome Back, Will Smith
","After a series of career missteps in truly awful films, Will Smith returns with a vengeance in 'Concussion.' Smith is nearly unrecognizable as Dr. Omalu, the Nigerian immigrant who takes the powerful NFL to task for the deaths of players due to the brain disease he discovers.While the plot is a very familiar Little Man David – Corporate Goliath story, the film is elevated by not only Smith's work but terrific supporting players in regretful Alec Baldwin and supportive Albert Brooks. There's particular note of David Morse, a C level, sixth billing actor who continually shows his impressive chops. Morse plays to great effect Mike Webster, a Steelers player who goes quietly insane – pulling teeth and supergluing them back, shocking himself with a Taser – and finally succeeds at suicide. As a Pittsburgh Coroner, Dr. Omalu's scientific curiosity regarding the death of the otherwise healthy Webster sets the ball in motion.Thing is, Webster is a former football God in Steeler's town where fans take the game far more seriously than a sport ever should be. The pressured Omalu persists, pays out of pocket for expensive tests while the complications quickly pile up.'Concussion' adds subtext about what it means to be an American. Smith places Heaven just slightly above America. Surely a large corporation who knows they're killing people will take swift and direct action to stop the deaths and forget the billions at stake. That's what America stands for. Or so the not-yet-a citizen Omalu believes. Then the very rude awakening alarm clock goes off.This ripped from the headlines story also adds a love interest for Omalu that's sweet but neither here nor there.One laughable scene finds Omalu courted by the Fed to be the US Coroner. The interviewer touts the government's honesty. Omalu doesn't take that corrupt bait.There's sincerity in these proceedings. A Capraesque quality. 'Concussion' successfully walks the tightrope between earnestness and cynicism - quite an accomplishment in contemporary cinema. 'Concussion' offers good acting, a solid story that's part forensic mystery, part Don Quixote quest, part pledge of allegiance. It's satisfying and worth a look.",7,7,17,23 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," Wild Fun That Comes With A Big Price Tag
","Based on the 168 minute version.There's no denying Quentin Tarantino's twisted genius and perverse vision. His films are unapologetic challenges to share the roller-coaster as long as one accepts Tarantino run the ride. No one seems to mind. It may be time to challenge that precept. In a 'Playboy' interview, Tarantino stated, 'I just don't want to be an old-man filmmaker.' Pure Tarantino, 'The Hateful Eight' is poetic, profane, laconic, really nasty, bloody as all hell, and meditative; the first half - uncharacteristically old man-y, moody and brooding with meaningful dialogue sharp as a razor. There's promise of a re-think as if Tarantino's voice finally broke to adult from adolescent. Then the film derails to the usual Tarantino / Three Stooges high jinks.This filmmaker is a master at creating tension; cinematic foreplay teasing and teasing until big, sweet, orgiastic release in blood and guts. He also deconstructs and spins plot twists and turns into gold. That task is easy in, essentially, a stage play with eight trapped in one room. A Tarantino film with social commentary as text, the subject under the microscope is race hatred. Setting the film post-Civil War allows the saying of things unacceptable in contemporary society. Like 'Django Unchained,' nary a few minutes pass without a 'ni**er.' And the room is divided into North and South.The length works against this film. At 168 minutes it was quite enough. The added twenty-odd minutes in the roadshow version might make the experience interminable. The film runs out of steam as it plays out and plays out with dialogue between the bang-bang – and there is plenty of blood.Then there's misogyny. 'The Hateful Eight' revels in the abuse of Jennifer Jason Lee, even with her portrayal of a scheming, cold-hearted killer. Her multiple beatings and battered face appears as if a domestic violence victim – most unappealing.The cast does well with the material. There are no standouts, really, but Tim Roth channels Cristoph Waltz who must have been busy.The cinematography is spectacular. Not necessarily the lighting, but the incredible use of the wide screen frame. The look and feel is evocative of David Lean epics Tarantino emulates even to the use of 'Roadshow', a practice that passed out of favor fifty years ago. Films are no longer shot this way. In this regard it was a pleasure to watch.If Tarantino wished to create the emotion of hate in the audience, he succeeded. The hate spills over the footlights, but there is a fine line between using verbiage and posture to underscore race hatred and making a racist (and misogynistic) film. More than in other films, 'The Hateful Eight' crosses that line. Racists hide in plain sight and race bait. This film again leads to question Tarantino's personal attitude. He becomes more suspect peppering scripts with 'ni**er' - even in his contemporary films (joining real life 'Black Lives Matter' protesters notwithstanding). Every use of 'ni**er' is another nail in the coffin. Also, his neurotic mentions of big black c**k in several films (here, sucking) skews toward wish fulfillment. As Black critics have said, 'Something is wrong with this guy (Tarantino).'This is a very ugly, distasteful, caveman film within grand entertainment. That push-pull leads to a zero sum, and self-reflection as to what exactly is entertaining about 'The Hateful Eight.' Given the dichotomy, not a lot.",3,83,172,21 December 2015
"I, Tonya"," A Brilliant Film About Clashing Forces
","'I, Tonya,' evokes lurid attention similar to the rubbernecking that occurs when passing an auto accident. Part pseudo-documentary and part biopic of an abused women who struggles within a sports system that disavows her, 'I, Tonya' presents a true story to clear Ms. Harding's reputation in a stranger-than-fiction story.Given the gift of being lightning on skates set against a truly abysmal, trailer trash environment, Tonya glides on ice under extreme mental and emotional duress meted out by a stage-mother-from-hell, a trope redefined by a brilliant Allison Janney who steals every scene. Too, 'I, Tonya' thumbs its nose at inspiring sports films where underdogs succeed against all odds to make it big. An unrecognizable and equally brilliant Margot Robbie tells us so with acid in her voice by breaking the fourth wall as if in a documentary.The events leading to what's called 'the incident' (the attack on Nancy Kerrigan) are too insane to be believed. Harding, we're told, is not entirely an innocent victim, but her complicity is fairly portrayed - and payback for breaking the rules in a genteel sport where Tonya's blue-painted fingernails, self-made costume and rock song accompaniment are not welcome. At the end, she is banned for life from skating competitions even after pleading to the judge to send her to prison instead of taking from her the only brightness in her awful life.The brilliance of 'I, Tonya' stems from juxtaposing Ms. Harding's skills against the struggles of her personal life. Her familial abuse spills over to choosing a husband who beats her for no reason. She is not a Phoenix rising from the ashes but rather a bird who tries to flap unsuccessfully from the fire only to fall back incinerated. An argument could be made 'I, Tonya' is a feminist film but without mawkish sentiment for a poor, powerless waif. She divorces her scumbag husband only to bring him back in her life when she needs him which leads to his twisted arrangement of 'the incident.'This is God's joke on her. Powerlessness, no education (she drops out of high school to skate), an unsupportive family and the settling for abuse align. The eight hours a day practice cannot overcome the gaping hole in her soul and psyche.'I, Tonya,' minus the skating, is the story of America's low-income underbelly where crassness is a way of life and abuse is mistaken for love. It is also a story of how people cling to insane beliefs they are something they are not because there is nothing else in their miserable empty lives. This is underscored by Shawn (a fine Paul Walter Hauser) who pretends to be an obese, overeating expert in intelligence with an IQ of ten.The intercutting of documentary footage adds spice to the proceedings, and the behind-the-scenes of Olympic worthy skating is illuminating.With rich layers, a search for truth, exciting skating scenes and a perverse underdog story, 'I, Tonya' succeeds in every sense. The acting is Oscar-worthy for Janney and Robbie. Don't miss it!",8,2,3,2 January 2018
Interstellar," A Film Feigning Importance
","Somewhere on the path to juxtaposing the story of the imminent death by starvation of humanity on Earth against a desperate search for a new planetary home (hopefully to not similarly despoil), the authors of 'Interstellar' forgot to consider the audience and instead created a far too long, far too arcane and far too pet film. 'Interstellar' is a kissin' cousin to the equally pet, pseudo mind-blowing, con man sleight-of-hand 'Inception.'A bitter taste is left in the mouth by a self-satisfied script constantly trumpeting a specialness that, alas, is not at all special.Audiences have been beat to death by the tropes, plot elements and dialogue seen so many times before. For example, the 'Pursued By Demons Retired ______ Forced Back Into Service' trope.Women, as in most films, are relegated to the back of the bus. When will writers and filmmakers wake up to the richness in woman's hearts and minds - even a cold scientist's ticker and noggin?Face-down-death awaits the character with the fewest lines and closeup. (Much like the Bic 'Red Shirts' in 'Star Trek' you knew would never make it to the end credits.)An intelligent young woman becomes hysterical because Daddy's leaving, yet her intellect does not grasp his mission is important: To save her and the rest of the world. Beside, Daddy didn't explain, at least not on camera.Matt Damon resurrects from hypersleep to wreak havoc as in the hackneyed 'Don't Astronauts on 'The Twilight Zone' Pass Basic Psych Tests?' plot element.Don't forget the Dead Wife and Wise Grandpa tropes.Wonder is non-existent. That's quite a feat as few films have led us through a wormhole. 'Black Hole' did a better job. At least the mysterious passage in Disney's opus didn't suggest injection into a globule borrowed from the coda of '2001: A Space Odyssey.' (Also cobbed from Kubrick's masterpiece are the more human than humans (articulated) computers.)Cinematic corn served warm with a schmear of butter is quite delicious. Corn served cold by trying-too-hard actors sittin' on the porch waxin' philosophical is a dish best passed to the person sitting on your right.There are nonsensical interviews of dust storm survivors who describe what the special effects department has just shown. There's no lack of understanding why the run time is 169 minutes. The dogged determination to not self-edit and lose script pages underscores either Nolan's lack of being a good audience or not caring about audiences - the latter a quality indicative of too many contemporary filmmakers.The ending leads to head scratching that, in another film, would elicit laughs from the audience. Poltergeists my patootie!'Interstellar' veers uncomfortably close to complete train wreck, but there are a few nice touches. While derivative, the articulated computers are cool. That mankind can solve mankind's problems without an advanced alien intelligence, God or other deus ex machina is the one original idea - and it's a good one.Save very few elements to recommend it, 'Interstellar' is a really, really long bore pretending importance. There's nothing worse than films of that ilk.",3,14,27,10 November 2014
The Revenant," Miserable; Not Only The Character's Life But The Film Too
","At 156 minutes, 'The Revenant' is unwatchable, so it wasn't. After an hour, instead skipped to watch a minute every three or four through to the last twenty minutes which encapsulates the final conflict between John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh Glass). Nothing was missed for in between is Glass grimacing left then right.There is a harrowing, savage bear attack leading to Glass hanging to life by a slender thread. Oddly, all that came to mind is how the effects were accomplished. That goes to a lack of empathy for protagonist Glass.This is a film of unquestioned artistic merit. Though some gush about the cinematography, it is merely serviceable. It's not the cinematography that's beautiful, it's the wilderness. All that's required of an available light cinematographer is to set the frame and F-stop. The actors most likely kissed pavement back in civilization after shooting this demanding film. They did well under the circumstances, particularly DiCaprio. The villain is the director and the unreachable allegory he wrote on the script pages.In 'Jodorowsky's Dune,' the titular director made a few memorable Seventies' films. When pitching 'Dune,' the studios requested a standard length film - 120 minutes (not viable for a film from a story this complex). But Jodorowsky wondered why it couldn't be ten hours or twenty hours. He was clueless why the studios weren't funding him. The doc is in part the story of a delusional, out-of-control ego. The viewer may wish to slap his face. Enter Alejandro González Iñárritu who also appears to have an ego of the same dimensions.God bless the artists, but not those who trade their expression for self aggrandizement. Not only is 'The Revenant' a vanity project, it is Oscar bait.Awards should be given to those brave enough to sit through this slog. It is a simple story raised to the power of crashing bore. 'The Revenant' is nearly incomprehensible, and filled with spiritual mumbo-jumbo even Iñárritu most likely can't explain.See this if you relish masochism. It's a bet this film will bomb. Maybe that will awaken Iñárritu. He's a genius. He just doesn't know how to connect with an audience. He certainly doesn't here.",2,35,71,21 December 2015
Dunkirk," A Masterpiece (of Emotionless Boredom And Nolan Trickery)
","Crow the critics are about Nolan's latest, 'Dunkirk.' A stunning masterpiece say many. Masterpiece my ass.Snookered by the hype and war film fandom, ducats were placed on counter, a ticket for admission passed back. Lights dimmed, anticipation mounted, and... nothing. Nothing. Save lurching between disparate, battle set pieces featuring people for whom little or no empathy exists. Lacking investment in the characters, what remains are merely adequate, bloodless war scenes easily outgunned by the recent 'Fury' and, farther back, 'Saving Private Ryan.' For example, a young boy is killed but we know nothing of him, nothing of his motivation for climbing aboard a civilian, Dunkirk-bound boat at the last minute. We feel nothing for him because he's simply a cardboard cutout.As the actors barely register emotion, boredom set in and not to be shaken off. The characters move as wind-up toys. There are few actors who bare their soul like Cillian Murphy, here a shell-shocked survivor. As directed, he sleepwalks with the depth of an amateur in a high school production. He's not alone. All the actors turn in measured performances with identical blank looks and monotone deliveries. Particularly wasted is the actor's actor, Kenneth Branagh.Certainly the bravery and sacrifice of civilian and military in the Dunkirk evacuation is celebrated in 'Dunkirk.' Thank you. However, this historical action occurred in 1940. Films echo the zeitgeist of the time in which they're produced. It's an odd choice to make a large (bad) film about an evacuation three-quarters of a century past. There's a stink of political agenda afoot in 'Dunkirk' that's intolerable. The enemy, unseen in 'Dunkirk,' lurks and kills from safety by air and ground. Surrounded with backs to the the Atlantic, the very survival of a way of life is in question, as portrayed in 'Dunkirk.' (Spoiler Alert: The Allies Won The War.) The enemy's attacks are isolated like terrorism. The result is 'Dunkirk' weaves a cautionary allegory mirroring religious extremism bent on destroying all non-believers.Subtle propaganda is dangerous. 'Dunkirk' fits that bill. Either that or Nolan is a complete idiot who hasn't a whit of sense. It's a toss-up based on a filmography including the lackluster borefest 'Interstellar,' and the beyond inane 'Inception.' Nolan remains static in his career with 'Dunkirk.' His films are half-baked, underwritten, detached, and emotion-free. 'Dunkirk' plays like a rough cut by a bad director who expects the viewer to emotionally fill-in-the-blanks. 'Dunkirk' even lacks the courage of its convictions in being bloodless - there are no graphic deaths. At least Spielberg had the courage to rub the viewer's nose in the stench of death in 'Saving Private Ryan.' The first half hour of that film is unprecedented in the depiction of carnage (one can almost taste the grit of raining sand from nearby mortar strikes). Nolan sanitizes-for-your-own-protection. Yet he chose a violent topic and punked out; a war movie detached from death is not a film about war. By design, war cannot include gratuitous violence, just insanity - an element also lacking in 'Dunkirk.'The wall-to-wall dramatic, but mixed low, score loses its effectiveness and becomes annoying. And, the constant, ham-handed crosscutting between stories further waters this already thin soup by stopping a scene's dramatic momentum.A short scene in 'Mrs. Miniver' (1942) featuring civilian Walter Pidgeon returning from Dunkirk in his shot up runabout says more in the visuals and a few lines of dialogue about the evacuation than the entirety of 'Dunkirk.' As Trump might Tweet, 'Sad!'",1,481,841,21 July 2017
Gone Girl," The Film 'Gone Girl' Is What 'Gone Girl' Is About
","The misanthropic ingredients in the 'Gone Girl' blender result in an unappetizing drink smacking bitter.'Gone Girl' is what stoners call a 'Goof,' i.e. a stupid joke played on those high to have a laugh at their expense. A step further; 'Gone Girl' is self-reflexive and abets itself. The script for the film is part of the story of the film which is a soapy, broad slice of rancid Americana.Simply, if Affleck/Pike were to snuggle and watch a film within 'Gone Girl' it would be 'Gone Girl.''Gone Girl' is a social/media satire, and could have been one of the best ever except it both takes itself too seriously and relentlessly rubs the audience's nose in ugliness and extreme cynicism.The filmmaker's tongues are also too far in the cheek. There are dumb as posts Ozark Dwellers/Thieves. A caricature 'Bad Girl' who gets away with murder. The insensitive, cheating dumbbell hubby. The beyond-catty Nancy Grace stand-in Missi Pyle. Even the choice of openly gay in non-cinema life Neil Patrick Harris as an obsessed former suitor underscores the satire. Like what you see? According to the filmmakers they're you.Those who rant and rail about the lapses in logic, nuances of plot, and motivation miss the point. There is no point except to allow junk-media-obsessed America a cold hard look in a mirror. Stand back and inspect the story. Scene after scene, this film is so over-the-top as to be laughable. Except the joke, told by elitists, is on you. Though meant to be acerbic, this satire bites too deep into the hand that feeds it. 'Gone Girl' is terribly misguided. It misses greatness through lack of restraint and balance.",4,5,10,12 December 2014
Mr. Nobody," A Derivative Pastiche
","Found 'Mr. Nobody' to be a difficult slog. While visually inventive and well structured, the final effect was ennui.Note: viewed the 133 minute version.Perhaps because it was an amalgam of: 'Sliding Doors,' 'Butterfly Effect,' '. . .Benjamin Button,' 'Slaughterhouse 5,' 'Run Lola Run,' 'FAQ About Time Travel,' 'Somewhere In Time,' 'Retroactive,' etc.The interstitial physics lectures used to advance and explain the plot felt forced and pretentious. While it can be said of most films, this was the Director/Writer's singular vision, and it comes off as pet and obscure.The female leads, with the exception of Sarah Polley, are wasted. I've never seen the vivacious Diane Kruger so bland and underutilized. However, Jared Leto's work is outstanding.Curious about the release, I found 'Mr. Nobody' received limited European screenings, and is not listed on Box Office Mojo. It seems to indicate there may not be a North American theatrical release. Perhaps DVD at some point. While I'm rarely on their side, notoriously unintelligent Distributors may be correct in not picking up 'Mr. Nobody.' Sadly, this heartfelt, greatly flawed film will be little seen and wear the badge of cult classic.It may be worth your time, and might resonate. It left me cold.",2,63,112,21 July 2010
Django Unchained," Forget The Slaves, Free The Audience
","It's quite an accomplishment to be cinematic adjective; Tarantino. (Or for pretenders to the visceral throne, Tarantinoesque.) Particularly when the Director/Writer is so young and with relatively few films on his resume.There is pressure on Mr. Tarantino to feed the descriptor, or none whatsoever when he makes films to amuse solely himself. The latter is the primary issue with the spaghetti-western-cum racist-tome direct from the Antebellum South, 'Django Unchained.'One expects the liberal use of blood squibs in a Tarantino, and 'Django...' will not disappoint. (Tarantino's famed over-length as well.) What's missing in 'Django...' is the cleverness and surprise in previous efforts: 'Reservoir Dogs,' 'Pulp Fiction,' and the lyrical 'Kill Bills.' The re-imaging of the War film so brilliantly accomplished in 'Inglorious Basterds' makes the identically conceived 'Django...' a self-parody of Tarantino. Just move the action back about ninety years and from France to America. Even place a scene using a foreign language as a way to speak openly in case eavesdroppers are within earshot. Hire the same pivotal character. Add the same cartoonish elements. And deliver the blood. This time add a few more laughs. (Slavery is far funnier a topic than the slaughter of millions of Jews.)As a writer, Mr. Tarantino's pen is running out of fresh ink. That the important issue of racism (and his favorite motivation - revenge) is the spine of 'Django Untamed' does not excuse this film is merely a number of scenes tossed ascreen that do not make a convincing, complete film. Mr. Tarantino is listening to the hype and lost (at least with 'Django...') the ability to tell a good story without requiring the audience to hold what's dear to Tarantino to their breasts as well. Spaghetti westerns are a cheap genre from long ago that were mostly awful - save a few starring Eastwood. The corollary follows: 'Django...' is a conceit by a man venerating crap. The result is crap. And that's insulting to an audience. (Using titles from other films as illustrative of the genre for his current film is also becoming an annoyance.)The story in a nutshell: 1858, slave and wife are branded then separated when they are sold. Waltz, a Bounty Hunter, finds slave to help him track down some baddies. Slave becomes adept at Bounty Hunting and he and Waltz conspire to save slave's wife from another plantation owner. Then Shosanna runs a Parisian movie theater and hatches a plot to kill all the important Nazis.Samuel L Jackson is terrific as the self-loathing Black Slave Supervisor nastier than any White. (And whiter as well.)Jamie Foxx is a comatose-robot-killing-machine with a fast gun and little depth. (No wonder bigger Black stars turned this role down. Probably due to embarrassment at the portrayal of Blacks.) Watlz' sympathetic-to-slaves 180 turn from Hans Landa in 'Inglorious Basterds' is serviceable yet will certainly garner another Oscar.DiCaprio chews not only the scenery but some furniture as well. It's a fun turn but not enough to save the film.Tarantino populates smaller roles with TV faves from formative years when his nose was three inches from a Philco. (Casting these has-beens also saves a lot of dough.) 'Django Unchained' is rife with lots and lots of padding and self-indulgence galore. A few more films like this and Tarantino will be the Director of whom it is asked, 'Hey, whatever happened to that guy who made those really bloody movies? He used to be good.'",2,64,114,25 December 2012
Drive," A Worthy Update Of 'The Driver'
","(Even to both lead's shared name: Ryan.)Minus the rampaging, corrupt cop (Bruce Dern) from 'The Driver,' adding more love interest, 'Drive' is an existential treat for the twenty-tens.With flat-affect and monosyllabic speech, Mr. Gosling's takes the wheel not to outdo the cops, but save a sweet young woman (Mulligan) who had the misfortune of marrying a recidivist dipstick. Mulligan's cute kid is a fuel additive.Many viewings of 'The Driver' created difficulties in the comparisons, yet this tale is engaging. While 'The Driver' directly referenced the Seventies' post-Watergate zeitgeist, 'Drive' dwells more in the internal world of sacrifice.Nods to Albert Brooks. His range amazes as any recollection of the goof in 'Lost In America' trickles away like the blood he calmly spills with a razor from his very sharp collection.Ron Perlman does gruff better than anyone, and his under-boss is a serviceable placeholder.Mulligan does what she's supposed to do: hit her marks, look vulnerable and dreamy. Nothing more or less.There will be a lack of mention herein to the 'Bullitt' homage. It's 'Stang versus Mopar... with Ford victorious anew.'Drive' is a high octane crime thriller whose success lies in overcoming the well-worn plot in performance, a pretty solid script and direction that knows to get out of the way. (Unlike most of the ilk, 'Drive' is cut well, not over-cut to the point of migraine and eye strain. Thank you!)Mr. Gosling is a chameleon inhabiting character. This role speeds him toward greater recognition of his formidable acting chops. His turn makes a look at 'Drive' worthwhile.",Null,1,4,27 September 2011
Room," Fails To Plumb The Subject's Depth
","A poor kissing cousin to 'Stockholm, Pennsylvania,' 'Room' is a backyard shed creating the world's limits to a kidnapped young woman and her by-the-adbductor son.Snatched at seventeen, Joy (Brie Larson) is imprisoned for seven years by a standard, un-dimensional psycho holding the power of life and death over her. (Cross him in the least and there's no electricity or heat.) At the start, Joy's son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), is angry and semi-feral yet quite content following silly rules in the only world he knows. Their pointless days come to an end when Joy contrives Jack's death forcing the psycho to bury the allegedly dead child. Well-rehearsed, Jack escapes and the dominoes fall leading to their escape to a world that has passed by Joy and one in which Jack has zero knowledge (a first encounter with steps mystifies him).Yellow ribbons and celebrations follow. With opposite effect. Joy's parents have divorced, high school chums have moved on. A formative slice of high school track star Joy's life is missing. Joy's biological dad harshly judges her; mom and daughter fight at the same level of a rebellious teen railing against parental control.Due to his age, Jack is 'plastic', his societal integration much easier. Soon he's knocking around a ball with neighbor kid. But, a reporter's insensitive question causes Joy to break down which leads to a brief institutionalization. And she's released all better.However, the treatment of an inherently dramatic subject matter of abduction and reintegration here falls short. The sunshine and rainbows, feel good ending, while moving, is mawkish. Everyone is healed and the horror of what was lived through for nearly a decade is forgotten. It is also a cheap device when children are wiser than adults. All these problems of the script.The balance of the failure of this film rests squarely on Brie Larson's shoulders. Her portrayal, as others, is at arms length with the character and hit a wall keeping her from connecting with feelings. Many crow her portrayal is spectacular. For her it is. In the annals of effective acting it is middling. Therefore, this is her tour de force - by default.'Stockholm, Pennsylvania' took the protagonist's story to a far more logical, satisfying and shocking conclusion. On the base, sensational end of the spectrum, TV's 'Cleveland Abduction.' Find 'Room' between the two. Either a good movie-of-the-week or poor indie sidestepping, and in some ways trivializing, a horrific subject.Watch 'Stockholm, Pennsylvania' instead.",6,51,111,16 December 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," One of 2013's best films
","More than other films, 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' fractures the audience. Split along the dividing line between cynicism and idealism, one camp finds a sweet treat celebrating the underdog while the other chokes on treacle.Armed with a terrific script penned by Steven Conrad, star and Director Ben Stiller proves his mettle in front of and behind the camera. His Mitty is an everyman sacrificing all for family; the flights of fancy an escape from a life lived in quiet desperation. Set upon a quest to find an important film negative, Mitty surpasses fantasy, finds the negative and wins the girl. It's pure hokum, yet surprisingly uplifting. Risking oxymoron, though steeped in fantasy 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is unerringly real.The film also peddles the notion our increasingly wired world, where it's not real unless posted on Facebook, is fallacious and dangerous in that human connection to the world and each other is becoming the fantasy. Think of sightseers sequestered behind iPads and smart phones snapping away in lieu of directly experiencing the marvels before them. Or the story of a man beaten by several others on a subway platform where none of the bystanders stepped up or called 911 but did record the scene on their mobile devices.Best expressed by the object of Mitty's search, photographer Sean O'Connell (a fine Sean Penn) is poised to take a spectacular snap of the elusive Snow Leopard, balks and states (paraphrasing), 'Sometimes I don't take it. I just like to be in the moment.' A concept drowning in contemporary life built on instantaneous gratification. (The difference between the immediacy of digital photography and traditional which requires time, patience and a swim in smelly, carefully prepared chemicals.)'To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.' This cinematic 'Life' magazine motto - the film's theme - infers the adventurous spirit, curiosity and purposefulness require resuscitation. Absent the phony, wise guy RomCom dialogue used in most of the ilk, 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,' quietly celebrates the human spirit like no other film in recent memory. And there is nary a cynical frame in it.Kristen Wiig is understated and quite appealing. In an unforgettable scene, Walter fantasizes she takes the stage in Nuuk, Greenland to dedicate a rendition of Bowie's 'Space Oddity' to him. The ballad rouses Walter to board a helicopter and, hanging on for dear life, continue the quest. Later, while pedaling in hot pursuit of Sean O'Connell, a large flock of birds creates Wiig's likeness. It's an amazing image (as is the cinematography of Iceland and British Columbia).Adam Scott's corporate raider is a bit broad and one dimensional. Shirley MacLaine is fine as Edna Mitty; a sweet, pie-baking Mom direct from the cover of 'The Saturday Evening Post.'If fault is to be found it is in overt product placement that is counter to the film's tone. In defense, the Papa Johns tie-in is motivated unlike Fedex trucks prowling streets in many films. But the inclusion of Patton Oswalt as an E-Harmony rep is an unnecessary distraction.Not unlike any other romantic comedy, this is a film of standard movie plot points and complications. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' soars in its heartfelt, assured and gentle execution. Given its definitive slant, your mileage may vary.",8,4,7,14 January 2014
The Artist," A Silent Roar
","On the surface, 'The Artist' wordlessly redefines charm. The film appears to be an homage to Silents. And pretends to be a Romance. But there's a lot more.Tapping into the world zeitgeist, 'The Artist' tips its Top Hat to the toughest economic times since the Depression - the era in which it's set. This film says (or doesn't) enough talk-talk-talk: in our darkest hour, heart and hope matter most, pride the least.'The Artist' adds a smidge of warning: the world's people are more precious than the maniacal pursuits of governments hellbent on rushing us all toward oblivion. While quite entertaining solely as a film, subtext elevates 'The Artist' into a masterpieceBrilliantly referencing the smile-inducing films devoured by Thirties' moviegoers, 'The Artist' is a rags-to-riches and riches-to-rags tale of a wildly popular Silent star and a hoofing extra whose paths and fortunes cross. Ms. Bejo sparkles as Peppy Miller. She's a swell gal and eternal optimist who owes her skyrocketing career to a no-strings-attached boost from Mr. Dujardin, George Valentin. He and 'The Dog' (Uggy) are swept aside by fickle audiences seeking a younger, fresher face - and new tricks. George's heart (and ours) is broken as scores pass by his self-financed, every-$-I-have, African-Adventure, silent Oater to line up for the new Peppy Talkie.Peppy and George are neither romantically involved nor lovers. Their love is spiritual: pure, free, unbound from the physical. And their love story is a joy to watch.There's a lot here derived from many Silent sources. Sure George and Peppy are composites of Silent icons, but it doesn't matter. 'The Artist' is an irresistible film plumbing the past for a solution to our present. And there's a cute dog! And an uplifting George/Peppy dance number finale that's a WOW!Don't say a word. Just see 'The Artist.'",8,0,5,23 January 2012
Super 8," Stale Popcorn With Rancid Butter
","Think Spielberg Lite: a dollop of his heart, half the storytelling ability, ladle on the special effects.Super 8 is a nearly forgotten film format that succumbed to portable video in the late Seventies. Much the same way 'Super 8' will be quickly forgotten by the time eyes acclimate to sunshine outside the theater.'Popcorn' films were invented by Mr. Spielberg who mentored this project that's a thinly disguised sycophantic homage. Mr. Abrams (born 1965) is no Spielberg. (Speilberg is no longer Spielberg.) There are a few obvious nods to Mr. S.: among many others, a character named Brody, flying bike and a shot cobbed directly from 'CE3K.' In 'Super 8' Mr. Abrams also casts himself as the heir apparent to the Speilbergian crown. It's the same deadly mistake M. Night Shyamalan made in stating, 'I'm the new Hitchcock,' just before releasing 'The Happening.'Summer blockbusters eschew artistic merit for the promise of thrill ride entertainment. But Mr. Abrams falls far short by offering cardboard cutout characters – the square jawed, brave Sheriff-Dad; the mean-as-hell USAF Colonel - playacting basic emotions in a logic-defying story. In a reversal of Spielberg's 'Absent Dad', the opening shots introduce the 'Absent Mom' who's been crushed to death by a steel beam in the local mill. It's 1979. You know, when America still made steel.A group of budding filmmakers hope to score big at the Cleveland Film Festival by producing a Zombie opus. Their filmic effort is interrupted by a massive train wreck loosing an alien transported cross-country via rail. (Huh?) The alien crashed on Earth a few decades ago, and suffered torture at the hand of the aforementioned mean-as-hell Colonel. (Why is it advanced lifeforms have difficulties piloting their craft? Don't they have to pass a test?) It seems all the none-too-cute alien really wants is to go home. Gee, that has a familiar ring.The Kid-Director sees an opportunity to use the wreckage and sudden influx of military as backdrop and 'production value' for 'The Case,' the Zombie film within 'Super 8.' Meanwhile, a little romance brews between the leading lady and our 13 year old hero.Of course the leading lady is abducted as lunch for the alien, and the brave hero sets off to rescue her. The contrivances pile so high and so rapidly the brain numbs. Anyone over six years old intuits where things are headed light years before they occur. (Why are humans such a delicacy on alien menus? All the dogs are smarter and split the County before they become snacks.)The one saving grace is Elle Fanning who is not only too good for 'The Case,' but too stellar for 'Super 8.' Her eyes belie a depth even her sister, Dakota, hasn't plumbed – and that's saying a lot. However, there's cheapness in using a plot device featuring children as wise stand-ins for adult thoughts and emotions. Kids are kids. They ain't wise.There are a few laughs, but most of the wise ass lines fall flat and, at the showing I attended, were met with stony silence not only by this reviewer but my fellow travelers as well.On the technical side the dialog mix was set very low. This is always a clue the filmmaker is practicing sleight of hand to direct your attention to the visuals, not the story.'Super 8' as a 'Popcorn' film is only modestly entertaining, and in fairness the first half holds promise, but then plods to a feeble, sappy conclusion. It's mostly zip-bam-boom, and more surrender-your-brain-at-the-concession-stand than most. In its sloppy, ill and under-written script lies the germ of a great story with a lot of heart. Unfortunately, Mr. Abrams left that part in his word processor and instead infused the film with narcissistic recollections of his pubescent years as a LA film business brat. And set it all to his favorite songs from the late Seventies.Make certain to stay through the credits when the amateurish 'The Case' is unspooled in its entirety. It's funnier and more entertaining than the preceding two hours. Better still, stay home and NetFlix a double feature of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'ET.'",3,23,42,10 June 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Look at me! My film is brilliant, the rest are crap
","While there are strokes of brilliance and humor in 'Birdman,' the sum effect is shock at the narcissistic disdain the director holds for audiences.The plot is simple enough: a huge action star (Keaton) refusing to add another franchise film to his resume attempts to break away by mounting a pretentious, overstuffed play based on Raymond Carver's writings. A coterie of malcontents and neurotics abet Keaton. Using an experimental brush loaded with mysticism, surrealism and existential angst, Iñárritu follows the on and off stage drama in one take. (Acclimating to the lack of cuts takes a few moments, but an unbroken shot does not really add to this story just as it failed in Hitchcock's 'Rope.')The good is aforementioned. Unfortunately, the bad tilts the scale way over.Partly meant as commentary about the nature of art and distilling culture to the lowest common denominator, the director beats a dead horse, resuscitates, and then beats it to death again.Add obvious commentary about the craft of acting on stage and film and blithely stumbling upon success.Ironically, those who are drawn by this big budget art film have the sophistication to realize the message already. Those who wouldn't see 'Birdman' on a bet, the audience whose nose elitist Iñárritu tweaks, will never receive the message. Why should they? People like what they like, and if they like cotton candy let them go forth and eat. Only one with a huge ego – this director – would have the temerity to call anyone on their preferences.Then add whining actors portraying every showbiz cliché while the film spools on and on and on.Then add the irony of effects like those in frowned upon action tentpoles are what made the single shot possible in 'Birdman.'The actors bought into this story. They give it their all and do good work, particularly Edward Norton. However, Zach Galifinakis proves he's out of his depth outside man-child roles for which he's best known. One wonders if Galifinakis was cast to prove the director's corollary.Slow, boring, distasteful and insulting does not offer a pleasant experience. The best to be said is 'Birdman' tried for heights others fear to attempt. Like Icarus, the wax melted.",3,125,259,8 January 2015
Prometheus," Not Only Brainless But Reprehensible
","Welcome to Ridley Scott's lobotomy.There's a quaint notion plot points introduced in the first minutes are paid off by end credit's roll. (Introduce a gun in the First Act, use it by the Third.) Three Act structure: venerable, tested, Beginning, Middle, END. It is reported with great sadness this concept perished in the still-birth of 'Prometheus.' Fine. Great films sometimes toss away cinematic tradition to frame an intriguing story in a new way. 'Prometheus' is not one of them. This film is an anti-cinematic conceit whose sole purpose is who knows. Maybe to get your ass in a seat for the next. Mr. Scott and his band of merry pranksters should have inserted the title, 'Coming Soon, Prometheus II'. Add a zoom out from infinity to wring the most of 3D.It's difficult to fathom why anyone without good knowledge of the Alien films would care about or understand this flaccid prequel. (Or even care if you do.) The Alien Quadrilogy left many to wonder about the aliens. They're obviously intelligent yet incredibly hostile. Why? Who are they? Where do they come from? 'Prometheus' offers a tease but few answers. Instead there's obfuscated storytelling with the clarity of thick Mississippi mud. However, fans of the Alien films will immediately recognize references to the earlier films.The brass tacks.This rust bucket lurches into many ports along its ill-fated two hour tour. There's mankind's unquenchable thirst to know his place in the Universe. A narcissistic quest for God by a pseudo Jesus. Corporate greed and dirty dealings. The strained relationship between Fathers and Daughters. Guns blazing action. Beware! If this cocktail be tasteth it will puckereth the mouth with bittereth confusion and droppeth the IQ by fourscore points.Dialogue so bad the ears ache. Characters you could give a damn about ready to do anything to fulfill unspoken agendas. Characters 'assigned' inane personalities in order to act out equally inane, unmotivated behavior. Even the hapless lead, the excellent Ms. Rapace, appears to have walked into the middle of a lecture about Astrophysics that's well above her head. And, Ms. Theron trips into the space carpet and is never heard from again. A signpost for trouble dead ahead always arrives in the form of a film within the film. In this case, Michael Fassbender, the android David, adopts Peter O'Toole's fey behavior after watching (a 3D) 'Lawrence of Arabia.' From 1962. How many will get this, and other, smarmy references tossed ascreen by lazy writers who are also incapable of writing and instead plug in emotion and theme from other sources.HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.Of Mr. Fassbender, his light shines brightest. Like the murderous HAL in '2001: A Space Odyssey,' this artificial David intrigues. He's Mary anointing Jesus' feet; the perfect, cocktail shaking man-servant; corporate bad guy; keeper of the (unspoken) secrets of secrets; murderer; Dr. Frankenstein. Nice work, Mr. Fassbender, but see also Ian Holm, Ash, 'Alien,' 1979.Mostly, the cast just bumps into each other on the expensive sets and vast, exotic landscape.Mr. Scott called this mess, '2001 on steroids.' Kubrick is doomed to spin eternally in his grave.C'mon! It must have thrills and chills. Wrong, Bucko. There are painfully few heart-racing moments. Sure, here's a highpoint; an inexplicable Zombie attack by the greedy Brit, Fifield, Sean Harris, who died after his face was burned off by the molecular acid coursing in alien veins. Nice work, Mr. Harris, but see also Yaphet Kotto, Parker, 'Alien,' 1979. Minus the Zombie, of course.The writer's laptops should be immediately confiscated and incinerated. The ashes should then be sealed in a titanium urn, encased in a ton of concrete and dropped into the Marianas Trench. Wait! James Cameron could possibly retrieve them. (Yes, that's a dig at Cameron.)Tech credits are top notch as is the 3D. Too bad all that effort resulted in a stupid, pointless and muddled-beyond-belief film.If given to mythology, Prometheus endowed humans, formerly clay, with the spark of life. He should have been hired as a technical consultant for this DOA, namesake film. Maybe he could ask Zeus to send down a thunderbolt or two to fry the master hard drives upon which the ill-arranged bits and bytes of 'Prometheus' reside. (If they were on speaking terms after that fire thing.)PS Check the pedigree of authors offering glowing words. Many of these reviews were concocted by Studio Plants. Particularly the cretins pre-selling the extended Blu--ray.",1,68,113,8 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Fails To Rise Above Suspect Politics and Muddle
","An impossibly high bar was set. 'The Dark Knight' featured, in Heath Ledger, one of the top film performances since Edison started cranking. 'Batman Begins' boldly penetrated the psyche of a frightened boy and followed his progress to Gotham's enigmatic crime fighter.Promised to be the final Nolan Dark Knight film, the stone covering 'The Dark Knight Rises' tomb will soon miraculously be moved as resurrection with Robin is assured, though perhaps not with Nolan.Given the stellar first two installments, there's bound to be quibbling, both major and minor, among the Batman fetishists who threaten Critics with death over the award of less than stellar reviews whether 'The Dark Knight Rises' filled their tummies. The best that can be said is it was the end of an arc. And, risking death, to this palate it was more a Rice Krispie treat than sumptuous Last Supper.'The Dark Knight Rises' lacks conviction. When Bane, the disfigured, masked bad-guy from a shithole prison in an unnamed (Afghanistan, Iraq) country, takes over Gotham he takes everything from the 1 percenters and gives it to the 99%. (Bruce Wayne loses everything, including electricity in the mansion due to non-payment). This hardened criminal Robin Hood then isolates Gotham and lights a five month long fuse on a nuclear bomb ticking down to the big 'Fire.' These disparate plot elements – Che Guevera meets Bin Laden – mix like 10w40 and water. This leaves the viewer to swim in the resulting oily mess.William Goldman wrote a self-critique of his script for 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' by stating there were too many reversals. Mr. Goldman, those reversals added charm and surprise and lifted the story. The same can not be said for the over length 'The Dark Knight Rises': Mr. Wayne is quickly dispatched by Bane and spends much of the rest of the film getting his ass kicked and re-training; in their ultimate battle, Nolan uses a cheap deus ex machina when Bane is dispatched not by the Knight, but by the Batcycle riding Catwoman (the luscious Anne Hathaway who struggles to find meat on the script bone and just wisecracks); a teary Alfred leaves Bruce; Gordon is hospitalized for a long stretch; all of Gotham's finest are buried alive for three months; ad nauseum.There is always a problem in unduly complex films because they require so much expository dialogue. (And there is lots of it here.) Conversely, there are elements from the previous films paraded across the screen without explanation, i.e. Liam Neeson taunting Wayne in a ghostly cameo as the life-everlasting Ra's al Ghul. There certainly is no requirement to experience the first two films, but it sure helps.What's lacking in 'The Dark Knight Rises' is the chaos and frenetic energy paired with a walk along the fine line between Wayne's madness and his foe's insanity. That balance made the first films extraordinary. Draining it from 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a major disappointment. This Bruce Wayne also needs a 'scrip for Viagra.While the cast is generally fine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Officer Blake (and the soon to be Robin) is a most unfortunate casting mistake. He's flat, and in way over his head. Thomas Hardy as Bane is an actor's nightmare – masked throughout nearly the entire film, voice filtered. That leaves just his eyes which conveyed little about the character.The tech credits are top notch, and 2D served this gritty film well (one of the only smart moves Nolan made).'The Dark Knight Rises' is overripe. Its politics are confused and suspect – at once Far Left, then Far Right (though parts should be extracted as a recruiting tool for the Occupy Wall Street movement). It serves as a fair Actioner, but it fails to cut to the chase and deliver a knockout punch.",4,2,8,22 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Episode IV Remade In JJ's Image
","After so many years of waiting it is a thrill to inject into the arm a new film in the franchise. The ST: TFA fix is short lived. Like a sugar rush. Inexorably, time ticks on. The high subsides and one is left, well, empty.It's difficult to imagine all the talent in H'Wood and beyond combined their creative juices to make this very familiar tasting drink. In fact, it's Episode IV Cola in a new, politically correct container. Wait! At the helm, JJ Abrams, rapist of the Star Trek franchise and all-around hack. That explains it.SW: TFA is too long, too homage-y (was there really a reason to crank up the chess game on the Falcon?), and absent an original idea for your pleasure. Thank the Maker there were no Jar Jars. That's not exactly high praise. Why exactly does Kylo Ren wear a Vaderesque mask? Mr. V's mask was utilitarian. Questions as these seep in while scanning for the Civic in the parking lot.Cynics crow SW: TFA is a money making machine. Rabid fans stand ready to eviscerate those not drinking the Kool Aid. More moderate fans might pine for the time their virgin eyes watched desperate Luke consider his future in the twins setting before him on the sandy horizon to John William's brilliant score. Those who venerate will. Those who grew up in the flickering light of the preceding trilogies might take pause and remember. Remember.Sure it was fun. Glad to see some of the old crew again. There was emotion and humor. Too, there was promise. It evaporated like an ice cube in the Tattoine desert. For that, Mr. Abrams, you will not be forgiven. Place your voodoo doll of Abrams for Ep VII next to Lucas' doll for Eps I and II. Feel free to stick pins at your convenience.Some films become cultural touchstones. 'Star Wars: A New Hope' is one. SW: TFA is not. It's just another film. Perhaps the failure is the audience. With lofty expectation there's bound to be disappointment. Maybe not. SW: TFA wrought heartache.",5,15,26,17 December 2015
Flight," Stalls and Crashes
","Full Disclosure: Hold a Private Pilots License. In 'The Lost Weekend' and 'Days of Wine and Roses,' men battle their addiction to alcohol. Both Ray Milland and, particularly, Jack Lemmon portrayed the alcoholic lifestyle to perfection.Then there's Denzel Washington. He's a pilot taking control of a doomed commuter jet on a hop from Orlando to Atlanta. Mr. Washington performs a miraculous, impossible maneuver to save the 102 souls on board (losing six) when a catastrophic mechanical failure occurs. Problem is he's drunk (.24) and roused from the alcoholic stupor by cocaine.'Flight' follows Mr. Washington from the pre-flight check to his testimony at the NTSB investigation.There is a subtext of rebirth and spirituality in 'Flight.' Passengers are helped from the crash by a group holding a baptismal service as the plane shears their church spire and misses them by mere feet. His co-pilot thanks God for the crash even though both legs are crushed. However, it's not a spiritual path moving Mr. Washington along his character arc. It's a fellow addict in a parallel story and facing the lies about his life.One might believe this is the stuff of great drama. Unfortunately, the venerable Mr. Zemeckis allowed padding in this overlong story with too many meaningless scenes that keep the film circling for a landing. We learn very little about Mr. Washington. Most information about his past is gleaned by inference; we first see a Navy tattoo, but he's too young to have flown in Vietnam and too old for the Middle eastern wars; he was a pilot for Delta and it's inferred he's well down the career ladder; his Tuskegee Airman father may have been a drunk who operated a crop dusting service but there's no indication it was an abusive relationship (his Mother is barely mentioned); his son hates him for being a drunk while his ex-wife can barely stand the sight of him at her door. But why? People drink to ameliorate pain.In 'The Lost Weekend' we know Milland is disappointed in himself for not being able to write. In 'Days of Wine and Roses' drinking stems from career pressure and working a job Lemmon loathes. The bottom line: it's self- loathing.What makes Mr. Washington drink? 'Flight' offers not an iota of explanation. He's just a garden variety drunk who not only flies loaded but drives that way as well. Drunk driving and flying are inexcusable. Without empathy served up, Mr. Washington is highly unlikable even though he's a stud pilot who saved a lot of people. That's the germ of the story missing from 'Flight.' The locus between bum and hero. The multifaceted personality drawing positive and negative attention.That a slick lawyer buries the toxicology report to keep Washington out of prison adds little to this 'hero.' As does his personal drug dealer, John Goodman, introduced with The Stones' 'Sympathy For The Devil.'Portraying an airline allowing the damaged jackscrew causing the elevator failure to remain 1200 hours after a maintenance notification unfairly paints them as uncaring incompetents. Not cool. Aircraft Mechanics should picket theaters. The reason Mr. Washington caves at the NTSB hearing is to save the reputation of a (boozy) flight attendant he was bedding. His decision is made because she saved a child during the crash and he admits he's told too many lies. A greater story of the politics of lying is absent in 'Flight.' A missed opportunity for a better story. The final scene has Washington's son visiting him in prison under the guise of writing a paper with the theme, 'The Most Interesting Person I've Never Met.' The son's first question is, 'Who are you?' Mr. Washington answers, 'I don't know.' If he doesn't, how is the audience to know. It's a senseless response given Mr. Washington, it's inferred, had a great life he wasted for reasons unknown.There is something in the script of 'Flight' the writer (a hack who's written some real dreck) kept to himself. Or couldn't articulate. It's a shame a Director of Zemeckis' proportions chose to film it. 'Flight' is a talky, overlong, snoozy character study minus a leading character that's also absent tension and internal conflict.",4,15,26,5 November 2012
Joy," No Drama + No Comedy - Stakes = Zero Story
","Mostly, the everyman applauds when another everyman struggles against odds to find success. Sometime those struggles are herculean. Not the case in 'Joy.' While the real life, inventive Joy deserves kudos, the bottom line is this is a feature film about the creator of a better mop.Russell struggles, unsuccessfully, to portray as harrowing the path to the mop. Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), deals with a houseful of kids, only a few of them children by age. The motley crew in a small house is not on Joy's side. She is the breadwinner, the adult, the rock whose imagination is a liability to those overly dependent on her. It's a paint-by-numbers affair from there – familial jealousy, dirty financial dealings, the nightmare foretold by the old saw, 'Do not do business with your family.'The only one with an eye on Joy's genius is Grandma (Diane Ladd). Joy uses her small crumb of encouragement to build a mop prototype. She brings it to QVC where the initial sale segment bombs. Slick QVC huckster Bradley Cooper takes a chance and allows Joy to showcase the mop herself. Bingo! The mop sells out. Success? Nope. The parts supplier is screwing Joy, every sale of the mop loses money, and the family wants their money back. Financial ruin follows. Then Grandma dies. But the plucky Joy womans up to settle all scores financial and emotional. Hoorah!In lieu of dramatizing a woman overcoming, Russell instead created a painfully unfunny comedy. His palette is broad with a spectrum of quirkies mincing about with a family dynamic that could only exist in a poorly written movie like 'Joy.' The spot-on Russell eventually had to fall. 'Joy' is the X marking the spot.Made-for-this-film, unfunny soap opera segments are unmotivated. There is no subtext pointing to the off-TV characters. There's also no payoff. There are out-of-left-field scenes of the soap in the first quarter and it's never seen again. What's the point? The Cooper-Lawrence chemistry bright and vibrant in past screen pairings is absent in 'Joy.' Here, it's given way to forced discomfort. There's a sense Lawrence, Cooper and DeNiro at some point knew 'Joy' was a dog and tried hard to not phone it in. That or their direction was, 'You've just been hit by a phaser on stun.'The tonally confused 'Joy' offers little on the path to an unsatisfying end where Joy makes it big, big, big and helps others succeed.There's little sympathy for Joy. The stakes: not living to one's potential and living with unfulfilled dreams. Her children are healthy. Her dad, DeNiro, runs a going concern and could help financially if push came to shove. She's smart and capable of working. Poor Joy.One wonders about the scores of courageous men and women who daily struggle against far greater odds, wolves at the door, to put bread on the table. Where are tales of these folks? It's an odd and tragic choice for Russell to highlight Joy's story (and insensitive in the current economy where one in seven US children go to bed hungry). The can-do attitude of a person overcoming trials is powerful. Open your eyes, Mr. Russell. There are far better underdog tales to make. They're just not sexy as Lawrence dancing with a mop.",2,89,185,22 December 2015
