The Equalizer," Justice is Equal
","A good better than average movie. It was all about action and good old fashioned revenge for the dear one. If you go with a lot of brains in the movie then you will be disappointed for sure.The movie has a simple story but many things about the lead were unclear and well you can say a hero is a hero and luck and script is always with him hehe.Direction was good, Denzel was good, the mafia people were also OK, overall it was entertaining but as i said if you try to be logical here then you will miss the action.So just go ahead enjoy the action and have a good time.",6,1,2,15 January 2015
John Wick," Just Above Sick
","Keanu Reaves after a long time. It is always good to see him. Normal acting, OK direction but the script/story was not digested. The film comes with an old approach action based plot. And you always know when someone gets out there to take revenge what happens. Some good Jiu Jitsu moves and close combat gun shots can be seen. Max Payne flashed through my mind while watching the film. It was broken in between in many ways where you will just say does it really happen or why and how did this happen.I would say its just an average film and you can watch it for once and enjoy the action.",6,3,15,15 January 2015
Man of Steel," Up Up but not Away!
","Man of Steel.I love Superman Movies. The Best one still for me is the Superman 1.I would say Christopher Reeve was the best Superman ever.The Man of Steel is just an above average movie. Lots of animations, good environment and good costumes.Frankly i did not like the costume of superman. From light blue it became dark blue, S is not so attractive, and the worst thing was Superman did not had the same s style hair style on forehead.Fight scenes are also OK with acceptable acting. I was actually expecting some big solid fights and powerful scenes were missing.Just a simple Superman fighting the villain in the city, buildings and glass crashing were bore and nothing new.everything has been shown very fast in a hurry so that you wont come to know its animated etc.Overall an OK film which cannot beat the simple and superb Superman 1.",6,4,7,30 September 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Couldn't Save Us
","I came in to watch this movie and had some expectations. But this movie is just a below average.I was so much bored in between that eyes were closing. Special effects were looking all fake. Characters jumping, you could make out the ropes tied. The background was all bright colourful giving a fake effect nothing looks like feel of original. I don't know what special effects they have used.Many times it looked like shooting has been done at home with normal camera. just could find 3-4 good scenes and nothing else. Same old boring romance, emotion which didn't add up. Acting wise i found the Tree and the animal only good. I really don't understand the high ratings of people. This is not even a time pass movie.Lots of dragging story. One scene where space carft bursts in air but people will be safe and no scratches lol, lame. Would say watch and see yourself, not a good movie.",4,5,14,10 November 2014
Godzilla," New Age Drama
","I had some expectations from this movie. Was thinking i will have a very nice time watching it and enjoy too. But let me tell you this ain't near to any Action or Sci-fi genre as given in the title.This film is a total drama movie and a slap on Scifi-Action genre. The movie started well and early on tension builds up. But then suddenly family, romance, drama all sorts of stuff kicks in from nowhere.I was simply banging my head and questioning when will action start. Watch out for a Japanese scientist in the movie with same confused expression since the beginning of the movie. Even a child comes to know what has happened but this guy has the same confused look till the end.1 star only for couple of hard work on the animation. One more thing is that action takes place as soon as sun goes down and then you cant understand what is happening.One word of advise 'Run', don't watch it, i don't understand that why this movie was made & how so bad it can be. Don't waste your time on this one.",1,3,10,2 July 2014
