I mean Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) and HULK Were Just Despicable there comic timing there action sequences were just awesome... i m gonna go watch this movie again this week i Highly Recommend this Movie for Everyone not Just for Kids but also for Adults. At 1st i thought this movie was just normal Super Hero Flick but Nops its something beyond that.I mean awesome Sound effects , Gr8 Comic Timings and moreover a Great Story to compliment everything. So 10 Stars for this movie from me. And also I don't wanna compare it with Batman or Dark Knight Because its different and better in its own way. **NO SPOILERS**",10,1,3,29 April 2012
