Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great movie
","No movie could live up to the hype and anticipation that this movie has had. But it comes close. The effects are dazzling, the digital creatures are as realistic as they could possibly be. The finale, the last half-hour of the movie, is as intense a 30 minutes as you will ever see on screen.It isn't a cliff-hanger type of movie either. It is a movie within itself that gives you plenty to look forward to in the next installments.Now the bad. Outside of Liam Neeson, the acting was a bit suspect in places. The annoying comedic sidekick Jar Jar, was just that, annoying. Fortunately he takes a breather part way through and we don't have to suffer through him constantly. Hopefully we will see less of him in the next 2 parts.If you're a Star Wars fan, this is obviously a must see that will not disappoint. Instead, you are left wanting to see it again and wishing it wasn't going to be 3 long years before the next episode.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
