Requiem for a Dream," kids should be made to watch this
","If you have ever wondered what it was like to take drugs, watch this film. If you have ever wondered what it is like to see your whole life fall apart watch this film. It does not claim to be nice and it isn't. This film should be shown to kids to show them what the affects of drugs have on people whether they know they are taking them or not. My hat goes off to the actors in this film for making it, as it was never going to be a film that was widely liked due to its subject matter.  Just think of the baby in 'Trainspotting' and imagine that that is the nicest part of taking drugs in this film. Well worth watching.",9,0,1,9 January 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," It has Harrison Ford in it, what more do you want!
","Harrison Ford, gets hot and sweaty trying to avoid snakes and Nazi's. He looks good, acts like a genuine hero and all in all it is a fun film for any age to watch. I do not know anyone who does not like this film, even though it is over twenty years old.",10,0,0,9 January 2002
The Usual Suspects," do not let anyone tell you anything about this film until you have seen it.
",watch and enjoy. this film will become a classic & some may say it already is. And remember do not let anyone tell you anything about it other than it is a good film and do not watch it with anyone who has seen it. i think you will be pleasantly surprised.,9,0,1,9 January 2002
