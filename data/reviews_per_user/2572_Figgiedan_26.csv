Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Keeping it brief...good/great, better than return of the jedi...
","Saw the midnight show last night - a bit slow in parts, but never boring - the pod race and final battle are the highlights - best lightsaber battle of all the star wars movies....all the actors did a good job. Better than jedi, not as good as empire or star wars. Jar Jar Binks wasn't that bad at all... wasn't as 'cutesy' as people made it out to be, nor was the story just for kids---great flick- see it and you won't be disappointed...F the media, it's good. 9 out of 10.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
Finding Neverland," Finding the man within the boy
","This was a pretty fun movie that had little to nothing to say other than playtime is fun and don't grow up into a big, boring loser.I liked it.Johhny 'Wonka' Depp was great as usual and Kate 'Rose' Winslet is good as usual. The little kids were good. Dustin Hoffman is better here than in 'Hook.' I don't think it should have been nominated for Best Picture, but it was probably a big old MIRAMAX junket-a-thon.8 out of 10.

The Big Lebowski," This movie is for Donny..who loved to bowl
","Donny died young...you, Lord took him in all your wisdom..like so many others you took at Kai San....This was a hell of a movie, gets better every time I see it, bought it on laserdisc --One of the great 'beer movies' where you sit and laugh more than you should so you and your friends tell each other that you're having a good time while drinking and watching movies.Bridges is great - still the greatest 'under-rated' actor of our time. Tutturo is awesome as Jesus, the psycho bowler. Goodman is fantastic as Walter. And Buscemi is good as Donny. The Sam Elliott character was slightly annoying but that was the only minor bitch I have about this funny, funny flick.When I rate a comedy it's based on how many genuine laughs it gets - people saw 'Something About Mary' and thought it was great (I gave it 8 of 10) -- this is better.9 out of 10.

Fight Club," My review? Wait for the video....
","David Fincher's least entertaining film to date: about on par with alien3, with alien3 being the movie I'll see again before this garbage. A very angry movie and very hostile.. a few people I know said that if you love Fincher you'll love this movie -- not the case. Pitt and Norton are good.. but at the point where Tyler builds 'operation mayhem' it gets ridiculous. The 'trick' third act that redefines the whole movie didn't bother me at all, but at that point it couldn't save itself. A 7 out of 10 -- a 70, C-, less than average. Wish they trimmed the movie as much as they showed liposuctioned fat trickling off the barbwire. Ick.",7,0,3,21 October 1999
Amistad," Kris' friend's review - did she like it or not?
","'The movie was much better than i expected.  Morgan Freeman was hardly used but believable even though I don't think any black man at that time could put his 2 cents worth in without white people's permission (with exception of people like George Washington Carver and the likes.. but they were rural and contributed to literature and agriculture..never legal issues).  I liked how he showed american blacks avoiding contact with the africans. I liked how he didn't use much narration and chose visual language instead to show the slave ship, probably the most powerful part of the movie. The one thing i really didn't care for and it was totally totally false historically speaking was in making the English look like they were anti-slavery, anti-emperialists, blah blah blah. False false false. Why the hell did he have to do that? The shot of the ship's masts symbolizing crosses...that was annoying. Plus the Bible sub plot.. did we really need to see that...does Speilberg think the viewer will see more humanity in the Africans because they read the Bible? Overall I'm impressed more with the story, that this actually happened and that we haven't heard this story in school. Did John Qunicy Adams really give a speech in front of the supreme court defending a boat full of Africans? Did the supreme court, 9 of which are slave owners really accept his arguments? I can't believe it and the fact that this fact is unknown is amazing. Today, 1 out of 4 africans are dying from aids and we still pump money to Israel and everywhere else. The world on a whole hardly gives a damn about Africans today. Yet in 1836 they bothered to set sail a ship to send 40 Africans back home. I still think Speilberg should stick to comedy adventures.' ----------- My reply to her was, 'I don't know, I kind of liked it.' 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,28 November 2000
Happy Gilmore," Sandler's best so far..waiting for a little better.
","A funny flick in its own right, this movie is Sandler's best, but he still hasn't really been given a film that really suits his style without being a watered-down, young Bill Murray. Bob Barker gives one of the best cameos ever as Sandler's p'od parter in a celebrity golf match and Carl 'Apollo Creed' Weathers returns as an ex-golf champ. Some good laughs, but a predictable story. I think the stardom of Sandler is based on the fact that he acts like somebody you could be buddying around with at a local party -- maybe someone will give me 10 million for a flick like this one day...I think I can take Bob Barker. 7 of 10.",7,1,1,10 March 1999
Troy," Troy boys
","Eh - not bad. I almost forgot how much I enjoyed the Iliad and the Aeneid when I was a strapping young teen of a more rebellious nature. This movie brought me back a bit and made me want to strap on a spear and some leather. Minor qualm: Brad Pitt mopes about like a Hollywood movie star who lost his crayons. Greek heroes don't mope - they kick ass - and Greek ass to boot! Then they listen to cheering and eat and have lots of sex. There is some ass-kicking and sex and cheering but Brad's Achilles is too brooding and moody. The FX are pretty good, I liked the launch of 1000 ships. Peter O'Toole looks like he was happy to be surrounded by so many young boys again like in Lawrence of Arabia - his scene was good. Orlando Bloom plays a good Paris. Best of all is Eric Bana as Hector, who would've been better in the Pitt role. I could've done without the stupid 'reaction' shots - 50000 men on a field and Helen and Priam can see Menaleus and Paris fighting through all of them? Dumb. All and all, 'eh, not bad'. Gotta check out Alexander next. B-. 8 out of 10.",8,11,20,8 January 2006
X-Men," Great for a superhero movie.
","I'm a huge DC comics fan, but unfortunately the Superman and Batman movies have always been pretty lousy (save the first two Supes flicks) and The Watchmen never made it to screen. Marvel seems to be doing the right thing and having Stan 'The Man' Lee aboard helps alot. The Spiderman trailer looks great and The Hulk sounds promising - I just wish the Marvel stock was still up there on the NYSE - its worth next to nothing now since they claimed bunkruptcy in 1995. Anyway, X-Men keeps you interested and tells you enough about each character while tossing in a bit of a plot at the same time. It's smart and worth seeing. Halle Berry and the Cyclops guy could have been better but Ian, Picard and the Wolverine guy are great. Hopefully this will start a small new genre for the 200's - the ok superhero movie! Original rating a B, but bumped it up to an A- after seeing it a second time. Looking forward to the sequel.",9,0,0,19 February 2002
Closer," Not close enough
","Wish I stayed further away.It's full of all this b.s. about relationships and animalistic behaviors and mind games and violence and typical everyday crapola that we all deal with and one point or another all throughout life.Then we either give up sex altogether or get married or neither or both or become the hooker with a golden heart or call Mike Nichols and say you're a dirty old man.Yeah, we're all a bunch of used cars, I get it.Now show me Queen Amidala on the ass-pole again.6 out of 10. A D+.",6,0,1,15 July 2005
The Aviator," It's a talkie!
","A great night out at the movies. Leonardo and Scorcese are a great combo, different from the Deniro-Scorcese combo, but just as strong and a dynamic-duo all the same. They seem to be more of a positive combo than the dark films Scorcese made with DeNiro. 'Aviator' is Scorcese's most 'Hollywood' movie since 'Cape Fear' and is about 100 times better. One thing about Scorcese is you can tell he is passionate about his subjects. Howard Hughes is a real 'American dream' and has a rise and fall and rise again story that everyone loves to hear about. All of the actors are great. Blanchett is annoying but only because she does Hepburn so well (Hepburn was, to me, annoying, but also endearing). Leo DiCaprio is great as Hughes. Alda and Baldwin add to the mix. It was really just a very entertaining film, one of my favorites of the year and a pleasant surprise. It really made me more interested about Howard Hughes, how he literally lived every day like it was his last and what it cost him along the way. 9 out of 10. A-. In my top five this year.",9,1,2,10 February 2005
Batman Begins," Bat-acular!
","Great flick. I don't really see this one as something you could watch repeatedly and still enjoy it, but was a good origin story. Both villains were true to form and Bale was pretty decent. Katie Holmes didn't bother me as much as I thought she might, but I never realized she had a snaggletooth. Lt. Gordon was good too - Gary Oldman did a nice job. Michael Caine was my first choice on the first batch of Batman's - he made a pretty good Alfred, though not as dry as I'd hoped. Morgan Freeman was good in the expanded Lucius Fox role. Plus obscure villain Zsasz had a nice cameo. To top it off, I was actually surprised at one moment where something happened that I hadn't really been looking for (spoiler so I won't mention it). Funny how the least interesting parts were when Bale was dressed as Batman. Worth checking out. Looking forward to another one with the same crew. Overall, B+.",9,2,4,19 July 2005
Man on the Moon," Jim Carrey is the best thing in this real-life/re-creation of a film.
","Jim Carrey is great -- no argument there. But Andy Kaufman was huge because of 'Taxi.' Not because of Tony Clifton. Not because of his Elvis Impersonation. Not because of his wrestling. The film devotes about 10 minutes tops to his stint on 'Taxi' and recreates a whole bunch of events that Jim Carrey as Andy recreates for us to a tee. By the time we start to see a little bit about Andy Kaufman and what people thought about him, he's already dead and buried. I always liked him, on and off 'Taxi.' I recommend this flick only to those who have no idea what Andy Kaufman did while he was here. He wasn't a HUGE star, but he was an entertaining man. I'd be more interested in a film showing why a lot of stars who worked with him did not want any part of the film. Where was Tony Danza? I wish they explored his 'shock comic' personality a little further. All in all, a bit of a disappointment, but a well done recreation of a lost comic. I hope Jim Carrey gets the respect he deserves this year. Milos can watch reruns of 'Taxi' and think about how neat it would be to recreate Andy's scenes with a Tony Danza stand-in. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,30 December 1999
1941," Either you get it or you don't - it really is a great movie
","I originally had this movie rated as a solid B (8 out of 10) but I just upgraded to a 9 (A-). This is really Steven Spielberg having fun - it's a movie, a LOUD movie, a movie that could have been thought up by boys in some back yard sandbox playing with their army men and had a large budget for special effects like an A-Bomb to drop on them. It has a LOT of laughs. Belushi is a cartoonish over the top pilot. In fact, everyone is cartoonish and zany, and in the heart of it all is the one voice of reason, General Stillwall, who wanders through all this. Gale and Zemeckis (the screenwriters) actually based a lot of the story on historical events and did their homework - there really was a blackout in CA one night where someone possibly reported an enemy plane was flying above, there really was a Japanese Sub that got off the coast of Cali, there really were Zoot Suit Riots. This movie has more history in 5 minutes than Pearl Harbor does in it's whole 3 hr entirety. A whole mess of stars show up and it's fun seeing them have fun. I loved seeing this when I was 8 years old when it was relased and I think I love it more now. Watch it usually once a year and like it more each time. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed if you are looking for a 'movie' (fun) and not a 'film' (serious). The laserdisc and the DVD have the director's cut, which is worth the extra scenes.... Speilberg recognizes this as his first mistake after his two big hits, I disagree -- I wish he'd do another slam-bang-comedy-action flick like this rather than the childish-dumbed down tripe that was A.I. -- at least 1941 didn't try to  make a statement and insult the audience's intelligence. It's dumb, loud and proud and a hell of a lot of fun.  Grade A- (9 out of 10). 'Lemmie hear your guns! Na-na-na-na-na-na!'",9,2,5,13 July 2001
The Game," In the same mood as se7en, intelligent and thrilling.
","Great flick - Michael Douglas is great once again and Sean Penn better not quit acting or I'll send him 10,000 double cheese and sausage pizzas from 'spicoli.' He was great as well. Many twists and a fantastic ending. Same mood as se7en -- does the bad guy win though? See this flick! 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,23 January 1999
Garden State," Garbage State
","'Garden State' is annoying, partly because I thought it was going to be mostly about New Jersey and hoping Tony Soprano would show up.It's celluloid garbage about how rich white people on medication have it bad, but they know all about the world and we should love them away.Padme plays an a-hole and some TV guy named Zach tries to look cute while they find the meaning of life in a junkyard.Go ask Mommy and Daddy for a hug and get off the drugs, people.Why this is in the top 250 movies is a sad reflection on how society is becoming a medicated wasteland. Oy vey!5 out of 10. D-.",5,1,6,15 July 2005
There's Something About Mary," Funny, but not fantastic. Over-rated.
","I didn't know what to expect going in to see this flick - I saw it the first day it came out with my brother and all we knew were the actors and the Farrelly's other flicks. It was good. Matt Dillon was the standout - he's still one of the best young actors who doesn't get recognized as much as he should. The gel scene and the dog on fire scene were great, but some stuff like the fish hook scene and the singers were just stupid. The whole deal with her retarded brother was just offensively bad - the only thing that was funny was Dillon's failed pick-up line 'I work with retards' which showed how scummy his character was rather than poke cheap laughs at the disabled. Stiller was good, Diaz was tolerable. The Chris Elliott boil thing was just gross. Kingpin was better, even Dumb and Dumber had its moments. It's funny but don't expect to be laughing the whole way through without wincing at the lousy parts. I think it did so well because of the whole love story plot which brought the gals into the theater with the boys for some gross-out humor. 7 out of 10.",8,1,1,12 March 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Am I sick for liking this film?
","A number of people hail 2001 as the best Kubrick movie, but this one is my favorite. It's sick, twisted, bizarre but also highly original, entertaining and brilliant. The whole deal is you hate Alex, then you like him (or sympathize with him if 'like' is too risky a term), then you should hate him again, but you really can't. All the characters are quirky and unique. There are some harsh scenes that are incredibly violent, but as the doctor states 'violence is a horrible thing.... & for it to make you sick means you're getting better;' Keep an open mind and check it out - there are a hell of a lot of funny scenes --- and don't feel awful for liking this flick - it's really rather good. 10 for 10.'Eggiweggs - I'd like to SMASH-EM!'",10,0,0,3 February 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Unrealistic fun
","Go into the movie not expecting much realism and you'll go away happy. Pretty good flick with good young actors and a lot of interesting shots. A large ensemble of characters, some better than others, some more interesting and believable than others (Big Chris was my favorite character). Sting is in it for all of 3 minutes in case you are wondering and he doesn't do a damn thing other than sell pints and whack his son once in the face. All in all, good flick but don't expect gritty realism, it's just a movie. 8 out of 10. B-.",8,0,1,3 January 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Fair at Best
","Perhaps I expected too much going into this film after hearing only praise for its director, actors and subject, but all in all it really wasn't that great. Do you recall a film from a couple of years back about a genius pianist who overcomes great odds and is once again accepted into society? The film was 'Shine'. Call this one 'Shine Pt. 2'. Another Hollywood piece of pretentious claptrap that will win all kinds of awards at Oscar time and p*** off real artists like me who can only have the safe haven of the internet for any of their visions and wisdom. People were leaving the theater saying 'now that's the kind of film I'd see again.' - I had to roll my eyes at them and at the same time think how 'safe' it is for some to see it on the screen, while the same type of people are the ones who would make fun of the crazy professor who talks to imaginary people and walks funny. Bunch of hypocrites. Pay close attention to the hankerchief and the pens, never saw that coming! Grade - C. 7 out of 10. Jennifer Connelly and Crowe do a pretty good job, but couldn't save it for me. See it once, if you the film is great, at least try and empathize as well, that's all I ask.",7,0,1,16 January 2002
The Waterboy," A worthy rental from the bat-in-the-crotch school of filmmaking
","Henry Winkler is the best thing there is about the Waterboy - there were at least four great scenes with the FONZ that made me and my friend laugh out loud. The football scene were good - they must have gotten some pretty good stuntmen for a few of those hits. Bates was pretty good and Sandler was ok, but isn't much of a lead man. Jerry Reed is even in it! The story itself was asinine - but check your brain, as many have said, have a brew or a milkshake and prepare to embarrass yourself for laughing at such a dumb movie. 7 for 10.",7,0,2,18 May 1999
The Producers," Mel's first and dare I say it, best.
","This movie is great. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder make a great pair as scam artists who want to produce a play that's so bad that it'll close down within the first week and they can keep all the production costs never used. Wilder is one of the best comedic film actors and I wish Zero Mostel stayed with us a bit longer, he was a true talent. This is just as good, if not better than Young Frankenstein. Brooks' writing is right on target and the jokes fly. 9 for 10.",9,0,0,10 March 1999
The Thin Red Line," The Thin Plotted Red Line
","I so much wanted to like this movie. There were a number of good performances, especially Nick Nolte, but this movie tried to say too much without saying anything about its one-dimensional characters. Wait for the video - and go rent Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July or Full Metal Jacket. It was a great looking movie, but that was about it. Tedious and I never thought I'd use this adjective for a flick... pompous. 6 outta 10.",6,1,2,19 January 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Some call me...........tim?
","Monty Python is the BEST comedy troupe of all time. Hands down.This is a great flick, 'Brian' is good but this is better, parts of 'Meaning of Life' are good but parts of that film fall flat. If you want to see Python in their heyday, when they were at their most creative and Graham Chapman was at his alcoholic best, rent this flick. Another great 'beer flick' that you can add to the list for you and your buddies. So if you dare rent this movie danger awaits you with big, sharp, pointy teeth! 10 for 10.Is that African or European swallow??(what a magnificent performance)",9,0,0,30 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the trilogy - one of the best movies ever.
","Hoth is great - asteroids are great - space slug is great - Yoda is one of the best original characters ever in a movie - Vader is a real bastard - Lando 'colt 45' Calrissian and Boba 'he's no good to me dead' Fett take charge of cloud city -- Leia and Han fall in love - Luke gets all sweaty during the training - best lightsaber duel of the three flicks -- 'how you doin' chewbacca, still hanging around with this loser?' -- 3po gets shot and r2 saves the day at least three times again --  THIS MOVIE IS THE REASON LIFE CAN BE SO GRAND - the trilogy has given me and many others endless hours of happiness. A gem. 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,23 January 1999
Gladiator," For the Love of Rome! What a disappointment....
","Ridley Scott has made a real loser. The first third of the movie was tedious - the one battle at the beginning was so messy you couldn't tell what the hell was going on -- ok the horrors of war show that it's crazy and Ridley Scott was trying to make the viewer feel as disoriented as the film's hero -- guess what? It was done better in 'Saving Private Ryan' and at least in that film you can SEE the fellow soldiers falling around the main character. One ripoff from a film. Also check out how close it comes to 'Braveheart' in parts --- 'Say, William Wallace is visited by the young queen while in a cell in 'Braveheart' and that was cool - let's have Maximus visted by the daughter of the king and conspire against her brother just like the young French Queen conspired against King Longshanks in 'Braveheart.' Plus in 'Braveheart' there's cool battle scenes, let's try that too. Not to mention the obvious, Russell Crowe sure as hell sounds like Mel Gibson, the only difference is he is so miserable in this film and there is no real heroic character development like with Gibson. When his family is killed at the end of the first act, the moral is that Hollywood truism, 'behind every good man is a dead woman and/or child.' It does pick up after that though. The best part in the film was the 2nd act after he's picked up by Oliver Reed and thrown in as a Gladiator - but even here the battle scenes are too messy and you can't tell what the hell is going on - at one point a Legionaire is cut in half by what I thought was only a wooden stick on the chariot - I had to be explained that 'it must've been a blade' by my companion who came with me to the film. Now that I think about it, we were asking each other what the hell was going on a number of times, mostly due to the jerky camera shots and the loud noises over whispered dialogue. And I never talk during a film. The ending was ludicrous the 'go home Maximus' and the 'Lucius is safe' dialogue made me roll my eyes. There was little to no historical value to the film and Rome was pretty damn boring - plus 5 shots of the same part of the 'majestic collosium' only verified that it was a CGI-generated shot. Christ, even the CGI birds were splotches on the screen...Anyway, there are a few things that were ok - Reed and Crowe were pretty good. Phoenix was ok as the 'unloved by daddy' emperor. The actress Connie Neilsen who played Lucilla was pretty good and well as Maximus' two 'buddy' Gladiators. In short, a lousy script, well-acted but 2-dimensional characters, and messy camera shots made this only another film that disappointed me. A 6.5 out of 10 (D) --- Go watch any bit of 'Spartacus,' two scenes from 'Braveheart,' and the first 15 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan.' You'll have the same damn movie.",8,0,0,19 May 2000
High Fidelity," High expectations...lower opinion of the film
","I was REALLY looking forward to this film. I'm an avid movie goer but haven't been in months due to the sharp decline in quality that usually happens around post oscar time. Anyhow, there were ideas and events in the film that I really enjoyed, problem was that they were usually only given a moment to mull over, or were treated as one-liners. I thought the lead female was awful and it was an extreme stretch to see the two of them get back together again. The two 'dorks' at the store were great.. and Top 2,3,4 'breakup girls' were all good. I just didn't find any chemistry between his latest breakup and himself. Also, why the hell was it downpouring all the time? And why would a lawyer be hanging out in a seedy club rather than hangin out with Catherine Zeta Jones' character instead? Even John Cusack wasn't very likable at times.. all I know is that it had lots of potential and I would've liked to see how the music influenced these individual characters more. And what kind of music did the female lead like? It's never shown...They only scratched the surface of the record on this one....go see 'Being John Malkovich' again.  7 out of 10. C-.
