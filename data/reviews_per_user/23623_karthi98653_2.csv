Changeling," Why it is not in Top 250??????????
","I saw this film and it disturbs me in several departments. How many it says...1) It says the mother's love and what she would do for her son..She would bring down the whole world for him.2) A murdering psychopath of different style. Other than the style he is sick and horrible.3) The trust of the mental hospitals,asylums are no longer exist for me after seeing this movie, One flew over the cuckoo's nest. We should do something about that. 4) The police are not god and they will make mistakes too...The trust with their department too ripped away.5) What would be a man's reaction in his final five minutes..beautifully portrayed by eastwood. This film definitely deserves its place in the TOP 250 and Oscar win too...Mistakenly something happened i think. 9/10 for me and must see...",9,2,2,7 September 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," 8.8 from 75000 users!!! Give me a break......
",Just now finished the screening of the guardians..And yup it was good and entertain to watch. But not it will add to the epic movies list. Die hard dark knight fan myself hereby can boldly say..'Thank god Still Dark Knight is the best superhero movie'....1) Visuals are stunning. Not headache things like we get in the transformers series...It is good and fun and colorful... 2) Wow..Bradley cooper voiced that rocket and i laughed a lot moment at its timing humor and mockery...rocket easily best character of the movie. 3) zoe soldana..The only girl comes to the directors mind when traveling to other planets..She is OK. 4) Batista is the only heavyweight champion in the movie..I don't see another better body builder anywhere.. Fine job Dave.Finally i give 8 out of 10..the second best super hero movie is still avengers...Don't worry avenger fans.....,8,4,10,8 August 2014
