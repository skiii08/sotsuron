Gremlins," One of the greats...
","Many great films have a half a dozen (or more) copy-cats.  This is one of the films that borrows, yet still stands alone in creating a revolution of beastie pictures.  Gremlins, along with it's sequal are part of the 'Greats', like 'Jaws', 'Star Wars', 'Ghostbusters', among many many others. Some people don't get this dark comedy, and that's understandable.  It is a mean spirited, fantasy film at times, but sometimes you laugh harder after you've been scared nearly to death.  It would be wrong to deny this film it's just do.  It showed, along with 'Jaws', that thrillers can be fun and profitable, if you do it right. A loveable Creature named Gizmo, is brought home to Billy Peltzer, by his father, Rand.  The new gift came with 3 rules.  All of which Billy must abide by,and was forwarned.  Billy does his best, but fails as he brakes the most important rule and lets loose hundreds of green monsters, that love to break things, and hurt people.  It is a zany film, and if you haven't seen it, I don't want to give to much away.  Enjoy the film, and it's sequel, which is one of the few arguably worthy sequels in film history.  So check out 'Gremlins.'",9,0,1,29 August 2000
Man on the Moon," This is where the magic starts...
","Who was Andy Kaufman?  What was he really like?  The answere is, I think, no one really knew, not even himself.  I think that is the point the critics who mention the film doesn't get to the heart of who Andy Kaufman really was.  Man on the moon may not be 100% accurate, but it's a wonderful film. Being a late Kaufman fan, (I was to young to have a clear memory of him when he was alive and in the direct spotlight), I have become a fan through showings of his classic performances and news shows about him.  What I've seen has been recreated very vividly.  Jim Carrey doesn't just play Andy Kaufman, he is wisked away into Andy, he becomes Andy, in a performance that should earn him one of those little golden trophies.  (If it doesn't then I'm convinced the Oscars are rigged.)  I remember two young ladies leaving the theatre half way through the film, they must have been expecting another 'Ace Ventura', or 'The Mask', and had no idea who Andy Kaufman was.  The film isn't for everyone...bottom line, but on the other hand, we have my fiance on the other side who went into the film kicking and screaming, and was all misty eyed at the end (I cried to, it didn't help that she started it...), falling in love with Andy Kaufman as I did long ago.  Andy was banished from everyone's memory years ago, now it's about time he got the appreciation he desearves.  This ones for you Andy.",10,0,0,22 December 1999
