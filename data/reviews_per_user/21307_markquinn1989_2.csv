Changeling," What a tremendous piece of film!!
","I just saw Changeling a few days ago and I have one word to describe it: BRILLIANT!!! I had heard a lot of talk about Jolie's strong performance and it pushed me to see it. And having seen it now, I fully agree with many of these critics. Not only is her portrayal of Christine Collins beautifully poignant, it is also fully engaging (I can see a second Oscar heading towards her mantle). But as well as Jolie's central performance, there is great support from John Malkovich (at his usual best) and from the rest of the previously unknown cast.Beautifully directed by the great Clint Eastwood, who may earn yet another Oscar with this, this film really brings the 1920s and 30s to life. Much like a fine wine, Clint just seems to get better with age.I don't want to reveal too much so I will just say this: You MUST see this movie. For me, this film, along with Slumdog Millionaire, The Wrestler and The Dark Knight have been the best of the year and if you haven't yet seen any of them, you are missing out on the creme de la creme of 2008.",8,5,9,13 December 2008
Inception," Summer BLOCKBUSTER!!!
","Christopher Nolan is one director who has never failed to deliver & his latest film, Inception is no different. With this he has created a monumental & thoroughly original piece of cinema that not only entertains but makes you think, something that modern blockbusters have failed to do time & time again (e.g. Avatar, Transformers, Clash Of The Titans).Leonardo DiCaprio leads a sublime ensemble cast that includes some of today's biggest & brightest stars and a true legend in Michael Caine, while Leo himself delivers arguably his greatest performance yet.The film looks & feels stunning!! The visuals are top-notch, the film sounds suitably tense while Hanz Zimmer's score only adds to the atmosphere. The script is (as you would expect) brilliant, remaining complex but relatively easy to follow & Nolan has once again stayed clear of conventional narrative to heighten the film's complexities.This is a true original & just goes to show everyone that blockbusters can be intellectually challenging whilst remaining hugely enjoyable. As a result, one can't help but want more from a standout film in a year that surely has more to offer than it has produced thus far. A new dimension of boundary-breaking has just been created by the new Kubrick / Hitchcock of film.",10,6,12,18 July 2010
