Marie Antoinette," Microphone in the film
","I am not sure why the AMC cionema in Hong Kong at Pacific Place offered this film in a very annoying 4:3 format. Not only did it kill the art direction of the film (actors getting cut off on the left and right side of the film and thus the cropping felt so unnatural) but the goddamn microphone appeared above people's head more than 20 times in the film. Imagine trying to get immersed in a period film when you see a microphone on the top of the screen. I am not sure whether I really like the film now since my experience of it was destroyed by weird cropping. I wrote to AMC, but I can't believe that they are not more careful about this. Ridiculous.Besides all this, I think the film is OK, but the pace is not that good. Sometimes the music went well with the scenes, a new way of looking at cinema music, but I feel some of the songs made me imagine the 80's in a period film... awkward.",5,1,2,13 February 2007
The Departed," Ching Chong Chinese American Gangster??
","Excuse my poor English in this review yet I am addressing everyone to excuse the embarrassing and irrelevant Chinese dialog and characters in this film. Before I divulge as to why this disastrous verdict for The Departed - much of what was going through my mind was not only Asians. The annoying coincidence of romance with the same woman between the 2 protagonists (shallow plot), DiCaprio's identical acting to Blood Diamond (research boys?), same body language and facial expressions... (too easyÂ™), Jack Nicholson was someone you really aren't scared of... and Matt Damon was just a dumb a**...long drawn out scenes made the whole film slow and dry...weak acting from the Psychaitrist.OK back to the Triads. I could not get over the fact that they used American Chinese guys to play the supposed local Chinese triads. Their Chinese dialog was atrocious and embarrassing.Like Westerners trying to talk Cantonese. Did they run out of people to hire?? Whoever wrote the Chinese dialog part of that scene should be sacked. Very unlocal Chinese pronounciation the Chinese right and the dialog was like formal Chinese. Can you believe there was NO swearing at all???!!!... Weak. So if they had such a bad Chinese accent, why speak Chinese at all? They are obviously brought up in the USA. Sigh, another sad moment in a US film. That killed the film completely. My advise is to go see Infernal Affairs and realize that the original film is smart, original, very intense and at least you did not want the film to end!",2,3,7,7 March 2007
