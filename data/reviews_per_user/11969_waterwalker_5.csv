Marie Antoinette," French Court a la Hollywood
","Sofia Coppola has produced another interesting and enjoyable offering, though her best effort for me remains 'Lost in Translation' Marie-Antoinette displays her usual masterly creation of atmosphere--a world so artificial it is difficult to be convinced of its reality. Yet don't we see such a reality every day around us, in Hollywood? In the end I think Coppola suggests that the public's image of Marie Antoinette and the disjunction between their image of her and the real person is just as great as that of actors who achieve fame in Hollywood and become grist for the rumour mill.If you like movies with lots of action, Coppola is not the director for you. If you're drawn to thoughtful movies that rely more on the creation of atmosphere and development of character, you will enjoy this movie.",7,1,3,2 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," fiction based on fiction
","My mother and I decided to see this movie last night, out of curiosity.I have not read the book, my mother has. Both of us ended up wishing we had not decided to sit through this painfully tedious, laughably inaccurate tripe.To be honest, I was greatly disappointed. I had heard a great deal about how, despite the glaring inaccuracies in the story relating to art and religious history facts, it is a well paced, exciting story. I was expecting to enjoy the movie as a thriller.Perhaps the screenplay did not do justice to the novel; yet people who have read the book and reviewed the movie claim it is fairly faithful to the elements of the plot in the book. I remain incredulous as to why on earth anyone would take this story as fact? It didn't even allow me to suspend my disbelief for the sake of the story, let alone convince me that the things it claimed could have happened.Having said all of the above, Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany in particular do all they can to enjoy their roles. The failure of the movie is not related to the quality of the actors; it is simply that they had so little good material here to work with",3,9,19,18 May 2006
War of the Worlds," not Spielberg's best but still delivers
","Let's get a couple of things straight.I wouldn't say 'War of the Worlds' is Spielberg's best movie, but there were lots of things I liked about it.1) It is NOT just another 'Hollywood disaster epic'.2) The humans don't come up with a way to vanquish the aliens at the last second.3) The special effects (though EXCELLENT) are not allowed to overwhelm the story of one family, which is what it's really about.4) BECAUSE its about one family, and Spielberg allows us to get to know them, we actually CARE about what happens to them, unlike the characters in 'The Day After Tomorrow', who were distinctly underdeveloped for the sake of the action.5) Spielberg's use of pacing; he knows just when to let the viewer breathe, and when to ramp the tension up again; movies like 'Charlie's Angels II' leave me feeling numb because there is no letting up on the action and eventually you get to the point where you can't respond any more.6) Creative use of shots and attention to detail; Spieberg can tell us so much in a short amount of screen time. The beginning sequence, of the drop of water on the leaf, turning into our earth, turning into Mars, which turned into the red traffic light, for one; beautifully done. His use of mirrors, and framing shots through broken window panes. Also his use of the birds; as soon as Rachel sees the birds flying away in a panic in the boat scene, we KNOW the boat won't be making another trip without a word being said! 7) No famous landmarks getting demolished.8) Dakota Fanning's acting.Granted, the ending felt rushed; it is however faithful to the ending of the book, if less developed.I trusted Spieberg to make this movie far more than another 'Independence Day' or 'The Day After Tomorrow'. As far as I'm concerned, he delivered, even if he didn't do so perfectly.",8,2,7,2 July 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," death and taxes...
","Being a huge Emma Thompson fan, I decided I had to see this one. I wasn't disappointed. Will Ferrell does very well in a part that's more serious than the roles he usually tackles, and Maggie Gyllenhall and Dustin Hoffman clearly enjoy their roles.A movie that reflects on all sorts of issues--isn't real life almost always stranger than fiction? Why is it that we expect a story to be a comedy or a tragedy? And why is it that people seem to think they can get out of dying someday, whenever or however it happens. Overall, this is an interesting interpretation of the Benjamin Franklin quote that death and taxes are the only things that are certain in life.For those who like movies that are funny and intelligent.",8,1,2,4 February 2007
The Queen," Quirky and thought provoking
","Helen Mirren is unquestionably the star of this show, giving a performance that is remarkable for her refusal to play on our sympathies. Nevertheless, by the end of the story, the viewer has caught a glimpse of the real person who has been the Queen of England for more than 50 years.James Cromwell is a delightfully bumbling and insensitive Prince Phillip, and the other cast members are also very good.Worth seeing for Mirren's performance alone; however, this is also a well directed movie with excellent support performances and a smart script which sensitively charts the Queen's realisation that times have changed and she has not changed with them",8,1,2,2 January 2007
