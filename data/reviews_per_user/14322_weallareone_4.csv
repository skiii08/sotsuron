Source Code," Fascinating Concept
","An enjoyable movie to watch, thoroughly enjoyed it, excellent concept, really captures the imagination, actively engaged me emotionally with the main character. Other characters lacked depth though. A few little 'niggly' things that just didn't make sense, could have been better tied up with more attention to detail. For example, when he returned to the loop the scene was shown of the ducks on the lake next to the train going past, he would never have seen it from that angle, nor would anyone on the train.. didn't make sense to me.There were a few things scientifically that my mind was hooked 'how?' but these questions weren't adequately answered. Nonetheless, a good movie. And this is probably not so much a review, but more a critical analysis of what could be improved.Feels like it could be adapted to be the first in a series, but that might be better suited to TV..",7,1,2,4 September 2011
Saving Mr. Banks," Let us go and fly a kite!
","I've just finished watching Saving Mr. Banks​, I have mascara tracks running down my cheeks, soaked from the streams of tears that flowed as I watched. I'm not sure I've ever experienced such a poignant, deeply sad, yet buoyantly beautiful film in my life. Such difficult experiences for a child to make sense of, and out of it, emerged an adult who created such joy for so many through the most wonderful Mary Poppins​. It took a genius, a man who rose from his own ashes of a harsh childhood to help unlock the magic of Mary, the magic of Mrs Travers so that the world's children, and the adults who emerged from within those children could experience the wonderful joy and magic of flying a kite repaired by a previously broken father. The delicacy and power that this film tells this story is one that I've rarely seen matched.",10,1,2,5 November 2015
Deadpool," Brilliantly witty, entertaining and emotionally engaging. A Brilliant new way to tell tired old superhero stories.
","I've heard it being talked about but only saw it last week for the first time. In terms of its genre, it's a brilliant movie, well crafted story line, brilliantly scripted. It does something different with the super hero we've never seen like this before. He's lovable, the story is heart wrenching, you (I) want him to beat the hell out of the evil villains he's fighting. I've never experienced that before about a villain in a superhero movie. Usually the villains are very stereotypical and don't evoke the passion Deadpool did for me. I really really wanted to see the horrible man squashed to smithereens for being so evil and inflicting so much pain on innocent people. 
Daredevil's villain was suitably evil and cold but the characterisation didn't evoke such a strong emotional response for me. 
I'm not a batman or superman fan, but I do love a bit of science fiction, and Deadpool ventures far enough into a bit of sciency reasoning for his superpowers to fascinate me. The fight scenes I'm usually just waiting for them to end so we can move onto the next story, but with Deadpool they were interesting, they weren't just bashing each other up in cool ways, they had wit and humour in them, which I loved.",9,1,2,7 June 2018
The Social Network," Go & see this movie!
","Different people like different things. How amazing would it be if you created a product that would be exactly what each individual using it wanted it to be?How great would it be to find a uniquely common theme by which to market it AND have other people market it for you- free of charge?That's exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has created. Genius, sorry, love or hate his personality one must acknowledge the genius of what he's created.The Social Network is a movie about Zuckerberg's story, how Facebook was created. I would however, suggest taking the accuracy of the story line with a pinch of salt (except for Zuckerberg's clothes, he testifies to the their accuracy in a Y combinator interview!)It is rare that I have an experience in a cinema where I am excited throughout, and at the end the audience applauded, rightly so!If you have a vision for your business, you must go and see this movie, I dare you not to be inspired by it.If you want to be entertained.... go and see this movieIf you want to be excited about possibilities that lie before you, lie before us all. Go and see this movie.If you like a good belly laugh... go and see this movie.If you appreciate an awesomely crafted movie go and see this movie.To summarise go and see this movie!",10,1,3,14 November 2010
