The Blair Witch Project," Wished I liked it more
","Criticism is beyond the point here; everyone needs to see this movie, and then make up their own mind. Its central premise and its style of filmmaking is so inventive, and such a healthy kick in the ribs to the tired Hollywood thriller conventions, that I wanted to like this movie more than I was able to. The structure is just a little too loose, and moments of real tension and fright are leavened by far too many more moments of randomness and boredom. Also, I don't feel that the film really *builds* to its climax - you know, squeezes us tighter and tighter into a vise grip; it's simply a pattern of tension and release, tension and release ad finitum until the final attack and then it's suddenly over. Still, like I said, you have to decide for yourself - and if it really works on you and you should like it more than I do. . . well, then I'm envious. I really wish I could like it more.",Null,0,1,8 February 2000
Vertigo," SPOILERS GALORE! If you've never seen the movie, DON'T READ this review!
","I suppose this is some kind of masterpiece, what with the absolutely overwhelming photography, powerful score and all - but I must say I just couldn't get into it. We're made to be patient through a looooong exposition (Scottie following her around), which I didn't mind at first because I said, 'Hey it's Hitchcock - the payoff will be worth it.' Well, it wasn't. Scottie's obsession was inexplicable to me (and, yes, I realize that Kim Novak is hot); maybe the writing was weak in not giving him a strong and clear enough motivation for going over the edge (what were his other romantic attachments like? Why is *this* one in particular so extremely excessive? Knowing these things would help) or maybe it's just that I can't buy Jimmy Stewart in this type of role. He projects too much groundedness, dignity and common sense for him to be convincing as this kind of obsessional basket case (the scene with him in the asylum was particularly embarrassing and unconvincing; he doesn't look 'crazy' - he looks like Jimmy Stewart just refusing to say his lines). Maybe an actor a bit more rumpled and on the edge - Robert Mitchum, say - could have brought the part off better (and I'm a *huge* Jimmy Stewart fan, just so you don't get the wrong idea).My biggest problem, however, is with the final third of the movie. Excuse me, but I just don't think it was a good idea to reveal the murder plot and its actual machinations two-thirds of the way into the film. Not knowing for certain up until the very end whether 'Judy' was really 'Madeleine' or whether Scottie was indeed just imagining things would have been much MUCH more effective. It would have pulled the viewer in, kept him guessing and psychologically on edge all the way through. Once you know that Scottie is 'correct' in his assumption, not only is the tension gone and you're no longer immediately connected to the story, also you can't truly buy his craziness or obsession as a thematic point since, after all, he's 'right.' I believe this to be one of the all-time biggest scripting mistakes in the history of cinema. Hitchcock has said, though, that suspense is not what he was primarily after in this movie. He wanted to reveal the murder plot early so it wouldn't get in the way of the attention paid to Scottie's disintegration. But without the suspense, Scottie's disintegration just looks stupid. It's like the end of the movie has already come and gone, and yet the director is still forcing us to sit through a drawn-out and pointless epilogue that just takes foreeeeeever. . . And the ending - what's with that?! She sees a nun and so she jumps off the roof? It's absolutely RIDICULOUS - so abrupt and nonsensical, as if the editor suddenly told Hitchcock that he had to end the film RIGHT NOW, and he had to think of something fast. Clearly, the best ending (if the film had to go this long) would have been for her to slip off the edge, and then have Scottie try but fail to save her - thus mirroring his failure to save the cop at the beginning of the movie from falling, giving the whole thing a neat little symmetry. That Hitchcock failed to see the absolute rightness of this conclusion makes me wonder about his status as a cinematic genius.Well, ok, I won't go that far - Hitch's reputation is safe. But Vertigo's isn't; this is no masterpiece, and far from the director's greatest work. Instead, this is the one film where he deserted his 'popcorn' approach to creating thrills and opted for a more pensive and 'mature' style, thinking this would prove him the artist so many denied that he was. It does just the opposite - by playing down what he did best (building and sustaining suspense), Hitchcock is left rudderless, and his attempt at 'adult' themes just look embarrassing. It's beautiful to look at, of course - one of the most sumptuous visual experiences in the entire history of movies. The redwoods scene, and the Golden Gate Bridge - fantastic! The scenes in the museum, too - absolutely ravishing. But, alas, great photography does not make a great movie. If only Vertigo were a coffee table book, then it might truly deserve the classic status it has been accorded. I don't know, I guess if you're a fan of the technical aspects of cinema, and love Hitchcock for his visual bravura and like to analyze his technique, there's probably a lot here for you to enjoy (and is no doubt why it's so loved by other directors). But if you're like me, and enjoy Hitchcock films for their pure ability to keep you tense and on the edge of your seat, Vertigo is not the film to watch.",5,13,20,17 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I had no expectations and came out disappointed anyway
","Considering all the hype for this movie, I think I went into it this summer as blank as it was possible to be. I purposely I had found out next to nothing about it and had expectations neither high nor low. I loved the Star Wars movies as a kid, but they hadn't become a religion to me and it had been years since I had seen them. But I had good memories, you know, and at the beginning of Phantom Menace when the John Williams music started blasting and the 'Star Wars' logo first flashed on screen, I got goosebumps because, amazingly, I was eight years old all over again. It was an awesome experience.Sadly, it was the highlight of watching The Phantom Menace - everything was down hill from there. The movie's not outrageously bad (except for a few key places), just dull. Even the action scenes don't have much kick to them because nothing seems at stake, we don't care about the characters enough for it to matter who wins. Of course, it's the good guys who do win, but unlike the first series, this outcome never seems seriously in doubt. There's no villain here with the strength or authority of Darth Vader to pose a real threat - even Darth Maul, who looks awesome, has a totally cool way with a light saber. . . but someone forgot to write him a part. His lack of authority and screen time was one of the film's biggest disappointments.At the other extreme, too much screen time for Jar Jar Binks. Now, people have been bad-mouthing this character ever since the film came out so I don't feel I need to add too much here - except to wonder, when did 'comic relief' become for George Lucas a prime reason for creating a character? One of the great things about the first trilogy was that, amusing as several of the characters were, there was never one that was thrown in JUST for the purposes of laughs - they all had a function and were all competent within their chosen spheres of activity. Even the dreaded Ewoks from Jedi were preferable to Jar Jar since, as sickeningly cute as they were, they were also fierce fighters and were essential to the rebellion's ability to fight off the Imperial troops. But Jar Jar serves no useful purpose, is actually *inept*, and only remains alive through the whim of the filmmakers. Hopefully, this whim will run its course shortly into the second episode (though I wouldn't count on it).Now, about that pod race. This thing has been getting almost as much positive ink as Jar Jar has negative; even people who pan the movie just love that pod race. I hated it. Several reasons here: 1)It had no real reason for being, except to serve as a show-off special effects moment. That is, it's connection to the rest of the plot was skimpy at best (SPOILER: what, Lucas wants us to believe that the *only* way two jedis could figure out how to get off Tatooine was betting on the winning of a 9-year old boy? Come on. Even Ben Kenobi didn't ask that much of Luke Skywalker when first taking him under his wing) 2)It was built up too much within the movie itself. One of the great things about the action sequences of the first trilogy is how casually set up they were; before you knew what hit you, the characters were off and running - either pursuing, being pursued by someone, light saber duelling, etc. With the pod race, there's all this talk about it and set up for it first, so that by the time it arrives it's actually anti-climactic. 3)The very notion of a central event like the pod race contradicts what we feel we know about Tatooine - which is that it is a planet of isolated groups and interests, with no central authority (no, not even Jabba) who would be able to set up an event such as this on such a wide scale. Oh well, guess we were wrong.The special effects were impressive, I guess, but they cause the look of the film to veer too closely, I think, to computer animation - to the point where I began to wonder, 'Hey, why didn't Lucas just hold on to Pixar and make computer animated movies like a Bug's Life and Toy Story.' Those films actually have more heart and, yes, 'humanity' in them than this one does - and they don't have to worry about using actors, which from the looks of this movie, Lucas dosn't really know what to do with anyway (all negative comments about Jake Lloyd are completely justified, while Natalie Portman, Ewan MacGregor and Liam Neeson just don't get a chance to do very much).One final note: Lucas had defended this movie by saying it was meant primarily for 11-year olds, and not grownups. Hmm. Considering that this whole story arc must necessarily end in tragedy (the central character turns to evil), defeat (of the Republic) and even cruel disfigurement. . . I have to wonder, is that the best target audience? And is that the best way to approach and write such a story? Time will tell, of course, but I don't hold out much hope for the next two films based on this one.",Null,0,1,4 February 2000
As Good as It Gets," Unusual movie
","This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely convincingly and feels very real. It's weird. I don't know if it's just the greatness of the actors overcoming an under-thought out script, or whether it's just the script concentrated solely on crafting great scenes one after the other, but not so much in coming up with a convincing through-line. Whatever. All I know is that this is one of the most entertaining pictures I've ever seen, extremely funny and quite emotionally affecting in places. Somehow, it just doesn't matter - I like it anyway.The performances are uniformly excellent. Nicholson shows real range here - sure, he gets to be the sarcastic curmudgeon we've all come to expect, but his character also has moments of fear, repression and vulnerability which he brings off equally well. My problem with this character (and the 'problem' only exists as I think about him afterward, not while I'm actually watching the movie) is in his conception: he seems to be whatever the writers want him to be at that moment, with no particular consistency from scene to scene so when he supposedly 'changes' at the end, we're left to think, 'Change? This guy's been changing through the entire movie!' And also, the fact that his character is a romance novelist is never really explained or examined in any way.And yet, Nicholson's performance makes it not matter quite so much.Helen Hunt is a revelation in this movie - she nails every scene she's in, whether she's forced to be witty, embarrassed, angry, defiant, emotionally overwhelmed, whatever. She keeps Jack on his toes, and they work off each other brilliantly. Also, I never thought I'd find myself saying this, but Greg Kinnear was great as Simon, the gay neighbor.   (It was also nice to see director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)What more can I say? Good comedy, good love story, great acting. None of it, in the end, is very convincing, but if you just focus on the individual moments and not on the grand design - a task made easy by the wonderful writing and playing - it's very easy to like As Good As It Gets.",7,75,118,17 February 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Overrated
","When I first heard about this movie I was very excited because I'm a huge fan of playwright Tom Stoppard, who co-wrote the script. Also, it had a great premise: Shakespeare, at the beginning of his career, looking for that first big hit to really establish his name, is at work on his new play 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.' He falls deeply in love/lust with Viola de Lesseps, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and is motivated to write 'Romeo and Juliet.' As actually executed though, the film is. . . well, ok, but not nearly as good as it could have been and just waaaaaay overrated. First of all, Shakespeare as portrayed here is just a simp, all pointless motion and hot-blooded excitement - seemingly interested in scoring women and very little else. There's no suggestion of the eloquence, the wit, or the sheer patience and craft that he would need if he was going to become what he did. In the role, Joseph Fiennes is a complete blank. This seriously undermines the film from the start: we don't have to see the guy being a genius (after all, this IS supposed to be early in his career) but if we don't at least get a glimpse of the potential, we can't really buy it as Shakespeare - and the whole movie simply devolves into Hollywood actors running around with funny costumes on.  (In only about five minutes of screen time, Rupert Everett, as Christopher Marlowe, completely blows Fiennes away in terms of poise, presence and sense of humor - I think he probably would have made a much better Shakespeare.) All the other performances are fairly strong, causing Fiennes to further stick out like a sore thumb. Nowhere is this as true as with Gwyneth Paltrow. Since the Oscars, there's been a big backlash against her and her performance here (especially at this site) but COME ON, people! - this movie is unthinkable without her! I speak as someone who'd never been all that impressed with her (she was pretty enough, I thought, but as an actress a little bland) but after I saw her in this I became a believer. She has such a grace here, a presence that we don't normally associate with actresses anymore - you'd have to go back to the days of Grace Kelly or Ingrid Bergman to find a proper parallel. Absolutely enchanting - which is essential, because we must buy her as the muse to no less an artist than Shakespeare. I guess what I have to ask is, for all those people who didn't like Paltrow and yet liked the movie - well, what exactly did you LIKE about it?The script, I'm sure they'll say. But if your two lead characters sink like a stone then exactly how good could you consider the script to be? In any case, I think there's been too much said about this damn script - as if the real story wasn't meant to be about Will and Violet (which doesn't play convincingly), but about all those sly little jokes that the writers sneak into the margins of the screen. They're not even that funny. The more Shakespeare you know, of course, the more of them you'll likely get, but that still doesn't mean you'll laugh; I got several of them, and the most that ever happened was, I said 'Oh yeah, I get that - I understand what they're referencing.' It makes you feel intelligent, maybe, but it doesn't give you any enjoyment. The film tries to be too 'smart' when at its heart it's just a dumb love story. Perhaps Stoppard was actually the wrong guy for this project - he's too intelligent (anyone who doesn't agree, just check out any of his wonderful plays - like 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,' 'Travesties,' 'Arcadia,' 'The Real Inspector Hound' or any of over two dozen others). The guys behind 'Airplane' or 'The Naked Gun' would have been a much better choice. If they'd written it, this film might actually have been FUNNY. Dumb, certainly, but funny. As it is, this film walks a tightrope between silliness and profundity, never firmly registering in either, so never being really satisfying on any level. It has its moments, and the radiant Gwyneth of course (as well as Judi Dench as a wonderful Queen Elizabeth; she absolutely stops the film whenever she appears which, alas, is not nearly enough) but it's more of a disappointment than a treat.",5,3,7,4 February 2000
Ed Wood," The charm and appeal of this film eludes me.
","I just don't get it. Why make a film which celebrates and nearly canonizes a bad filmmaker? I've heard some say that it captures his buoyant enthusiasm and never-say-die spirit. Commendable qualities, to be certain. But it doesn't change the fact that HE WAS A BAD FILMMAKER! And he wasn't bad because he was reaching for something greater than he could achieve, or because he deliberately reveled in camp and bad taste for its own sake (like, say, John Waters). Nor was it true that he was unfairly labeled and vilified by the Hollywood establishment because he flew in the face of their conventions (as such, the association that's made with Orsen Welles late in the movie is particularly laughable). No, the reason Ed Wood was bad was because he was just naturally inept. He had no idea how to appropriately construct a scene, how to direct actors, how to light a film set, how to. .. well, the list goes on and on. Basically, everything a director needs to know how to do - he didn't have the first clue about.What's odd is that the film makes this abundantly clear. There's no attempt to portray him as a closet genius or an ahead-of-his-time visionary. Indeed, the scenes of him directing on a movie set have a kind of 'Saturday Night Live' sketch quality about them, as we watch disaster breaking out all around, and Ed blissfully sitting in the center of it, thinking it's all great. If the movie was constructed as an elaborate joke - a parody of a 'serious' biography by the use of a laughably inappropriate subject - it might have worked (although even then, it would be a cheap joke - making fun of Ed Wood is about as bold as making fun of Pia Zadora).That certainly seems to be the movie Johnny Depp thought they were making - his portrayal of Ed is so cartoonish and one-dimensional, with exaggerated snappy line deliveries straight out of a '40s B-flick, that it's a role Jon Lovitz - in full 'Yeh, That's the ticket!' mode - could have done just as well. Director Tim Burton, though, as well as writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, want to find more here than just Ed's ludicrousness. I know this is their intention not because they've found it, but because the film is a leaden bore - so that tells me that it wants to be 'important.' First of all, it's filmed in black and white and we all know that represents high 'artistic' aspirations. Personally, I think a movie glaring with bright and tacky colors would be the more appropriate way to commemorate Ed Wood's life. But then, I'm thinking of it as a comedy, and this film is serious, very very serious.What it's serious ABOUT, I have no idea. The cruel and unfortunate fate of the talentless? But shouldn't those lacking ability fall to the bottom of their respective fields? Certainly Burton is not bemoaning the fact that Ed was not more successful in Hollywood: that it is precisely Wood's enthusiasm and determination which are the qualities most in  need to counteract the jadedness of the industry? My god, maybe that IS his point! But certainly there exist - and have existed - directors and creators of actual skill and talent who have possessed the exuberance attributed to Ed here. Why commend him on his personal qualities when he was such a washout in the field where he chose to employ them?I don't know. Lots of people like this film. More power to them. Maybe someday someone will be able to explain to me its appeal in a way I can comprehend. All I know is that, at some point, I became impatient and frankly offended at having to sit through the exploits of a no-talent hack. Zeal and enthusiasm - yes, this movie convinced me that Ed Wood had them. But so, I'm told, does Charles Manson. And no one's suggesting we should make a celebratory biopic of HIM.",3,10,30,11 March 2000
Sleepy Hollow," A triumph for Tim Burton
","I've always admired Tim Burton's abilities as a visual stylist - his movies always have a unique and totally off the wall look - but I've never been truly satisfied with him as a director. His inability to tell a clear, focused story - or to get anything out of his actors except over the top performances - or to stage action in anything but a perfunctory manner. . . have always made him suspect to me. I felt his promotion to the rank of director was unwarranted - that he should instead be making his living as one of Hollywood's most in demand cinematographers or production designers.Having seen Sleepy Hollow though, I'd definitely have to say that Burton has made considerable progress. His distinctive visual touch is still present, though he has reigned in some of his wilder extravagances in order not to overwhelm the story. His ability to stage action sequences is much improved, resulting in some truly hair-raising chases and fight scenes (you're left to wonder what his Batman films could have been with this new found talent). Furthermore, the relentless jokiness which usually undermines his movies has been replaced by a brooding and operatic tone which better fit the story. For example, the flashback sequences here provide some of the most haunting and poetic images Burton has ever created - and they feel sincere, as if they come from a very deep and genuine place inside the filmmaker, and are not just flung at us to dazzle and tickle us with his visual ingenuity.All of which is not to say that Burton is no longer any fun. It's just that he has put his humor into better perspective. There are many nice wry touches in Sleepy Hollow, none more so than in Johnny Depp's truly outstanding performance, which straddles the poles of absurd comedy and genuine heroism. Even as we come to feel for Ichabod Crane and to admire his steeliness and pluck, we are never far removed from laughter at the character's prissiness and squeamishness. Depp walks a real tightrope act here, and it will probably not be to everyone's taste. I thought it was one of the best performances of the year, and represented a perfect marriage between Burton's tendancy toward campy theatrics and his newfound maturity and grace.Some caveats: Christina Ricci is not used particularly well here; her part is too blandly written to give her prickly screen persona much room to breathe. Too bad, as she would make an ideal Burton heroine (I hasten to add that every other single actor in the movie - including Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and yes, even Christopher Walken in a wordless cameo - is solid). And what's with this story anyway? It's a pointless bastardization of the original tale. While it's true that the original is pretty threadbare, it is certainly suggestive enough that a writer could spin out compelling backstories and elaborations without having to resort to coming up with a completely new murder mystery plot (which is kind of overplotted and confusing, anyway). But, taken on its own merits, the script certainly works well enough, and anyone not familiar with the original story won't notice anything amiss.Ok, now that I've said all that - the real reason to see this movie. . . those decapitations! The advertising slogan was 'Heads will roll' but never in my wildest imagination could I have guessed with what frequency and in how many different kinds of ways. Burton eschews realism or gory details here, and instead goes for a stylization that is at once giddy, horrifying and strangely beautiful. The fact that each decapitation is played slightly differently - either in how it's shot or how it's perpetrated - keeps it from becoming routine and, indeed, every instance of it involves some new kind of twist or surprise. Some may say Burton is sick for focusing so much attention on this aspect of the story, but this is the Headless Horseman after all, and Burton's courage in not backing away from his grisly deeds gives the monster his full due. Although I wouldn't call the film frightening exactly (that is, to anyone but the most absolutely faint-hearted), it is suffused with a powerful sense of  creepiness and dread that prove extremely effective.All in all, a very enjoyable movie, and a signal of even better works yet to come from Tim Burton.",7,0,0,8 February 2000
The Godfather: Part II," An absolutely great sequel - NOT!
","As a huge fan of the original Godfather, I have never understood all the hoopla about this film. A great continuation of the story? The only sequel to be better than the original? No way, on both counts - not by a long shot.First of all, The Godfather is a movie that truly needs no sequel. When that door closes on Kay at the end, that's it - an entire cycle has played out: power has been passed on, the new guard has superseded the old, evil has corrupted goodness and the sins of the father have come back to feast upon the sons. It is a perfect story, complete in itself and suggestive of all that is to come. Anything you could add would only be elaboration, nothing genuinely new.  As such, there's nothing - not one single thing - which happens in The Godfather Part II that is not either already implied in the first movie or at least could be predicted by knowing the first movie. Therefore, the story just doesn't feel fresh; it feels more like a 'standard' sequel - that is, one done just for the money, to capitalize on the series while it was hot. (The true greatest sequel of all time, of course, is The Empire Strikes Back - superceding the original in so many ways and on so many levels it's unbelievable.)Now, I'll concede there's an awful lot of artistry on display in this movie - the acting is all great, the cinematography and production design, etc. It certainly doesn't have the *look* of a quickie re-hash. And you can tell that considerable time and effort has gone into the story and in the structuring of the movie. Which makes its failure all the more troubling to watch. First of all, the cross-cutting between the two time periods (Vito Corleone in the early part of the century and Michael in the late '50s) just DOES NOT WORK.  I'll challenge anybody on this point; if you think it's a good idea, you're just WRONG! I can half see what Coppola had in mind here, but it's just annoying. First off, the two sequences are not equally weighted - we see far more of the 'modern day' Michael segment - and so the Vito scenes come to feel more like an intrusion, a break up of the momentum of the real movie, rather than as a legitimate sequence in its own right. And frankly, it's not a legitimate sequence anyway - it's far too bathed in quaintness and romanticism, it never truly takes Vito to task for the life he has chosen; in fact, it doesn't even give us a good sense of why he has chosen that life. Except for the brief murder scenes, it mostly portrays Vito as a hero - a Robin Hood of the people - and does not give a clear picture of the ruthlessness and cold-bloodedness he would have needed to build up his empire. (For a good portrait of this side of the young Vito, read the chapter in the original Godfather book by Mario Puzo which focuses upon his rise to power. Compare this sequence to the movie's in order to see just how much Coppola has omitted and how much he has romanticized what he's kept.)  Coppola wants to save all his rage and condemnation for Michael, you see - almost as if the Corleone crime family was kind of a Mom and Pop store started by the old man in the good old days, and was great and wonderful until the young whippersnapper came in with all of his newfangled ways and started screwing everything up. If Michael's soul is shown as corroded by the end of the movie, why is Vito not assessed in the same harsh way? After all, if not for him, his son would never have been put in this position in the first place. Curiously, Michael's attempts to 'go legitimate' are portrayed as the real horror here, which is certainly an interesting idea, but I think this is a theme much better developed in The Godfather Part III, where the agent of legitimacy becomes the Church (the Vatican), making for a much richer and headier mix. Here, Michael's mainly trying to buy into resorts and casinos in Cuba. How interesting is that?Finally, this picture moves sooooo slowly and takes so much time to tell its story (er, stories) that it becomes sleep-inducing. Not enough of import happens here for the story to take as long as it does. In short, The Godfather Part II is a film with an inflated sense of its own importance; the wonder is that it has suckered so many millions of people into buying into it. The Godfather is a movie which truly needs no sequel, but if you feel compelled to see one, rent Part III and skip over this tired and pretentious mess.",4,26,60,5 February 2000
The Godfather: Part II," OK, maybe I get it now (a qualified thumbs-up)
","I have an earlier review of this movie posted somewhere on this site in which I pretty much deconstruct it and its status as a 'classic sequel' and even 'a great movie.' A handful of great scenes populate it, to be sure, and a spate of fine performances (particularly a toweringly great one from Pacino), but nothing that coheres into greatness - particularly as it's at the service of a turgid and convoluted plot.All of which I more or less stand by - at least as it befits my own taste and predilections. But I recently had some insight into why this sequel may be so well-respected: in its very dourness and lack of fire, it paints the unremittingly grim portrait of Mafia life that many apparently felt was missing from the first Godfather. I recently showed that movie to a group of my friends who had never seen it before (amazing in this day and age, no?) and they all enjoyed it - but, to a man, they felt that it definitely glorified and mythologized the violence it showed and the lifestyle it portrayed. Personally, I have a hard time seeing this - and, pay attention, because I believe here lies the discrepancy between the people who love the sequel and those who don't. On the most simplistic level, if you feel the first film glorifies the Mob - and feel at least slightly cheated because of it - you will most likely have an appreciation for the second film. If you feel, like I do, that the first movie sucks you into associating and sympathizing (hell, even *loving*!) these characters, but that the violence brings everything all back home and reminds you the evil and corruption which undergirds their way of life - then the second movie, though having perhaps some interesting elaborations upon this theme, offers nothing genuinely new. And is, therefore - despite all the evident care and superb craft involved - kind of a waste of time.But, since the violence and worldview depicted in The Godfather is such a polarizing issue, I suppose it was a good idea that Francis Coppola decided to have another go at it, ramming down his point for all those who didn't get it the first time: 'The Mob is BAD, it CORRUPTS YOUR SOUL, and NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT!' These are good points to be made, and perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss them. I had just thought, previously, that . . . well, they're obvious (or should be, anyway - and anyone to whom they're not obvious is probably beyond all hope) and that the director had already made them once. Clearly, not everyone feels The Godfather makes those points cogently enough (as my friend says about the end of the first movie: 'Sure, Michael is cold, ruthless and lies to his wife - but DAMN, he's just the *man*!'). For those people, The Godfather Part II exists, and that's fine. I'll never speak ill of the movie again.Except for those flashback scenes - those are still terrible! Either they should form a completely different movie unto themselves, or they should be cut out entirely (watching the second film as part of 'The Godfather Saga', where these flashbacks have been excised, is infinitely more rewarding to me). I still don't know what function they serve - if anything, they seem a throwback to the preciousness and romanticism of the first film, except far worse, in my opinion. But no one seems to agree with me, so I'll stop beating the tune on that one . . .But as long as I'm here and have got this movie in my sights for a second time (and am inclined to dwell on its strengths rather than its faults), let me just expand upon what I said earlier about the acting: the film is a veritable master's class in great acting, coming in all shapes and varieties. The coiled intensity of Pacino is complemented by an equally quiet yet forceful turn by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen (whose work in both Godfathers is some of the greatest, yet most unsung, in cinema history). Lee Strasberg does wonderful things with the Hyman Roth character, adding new layers and shadings in every scene, and his soliloquy to Michael about Moe Greene is as dead-on perfect as anything can be in this world. Similarly, Michael Gazzo takes a seemingly annoying and one-note character (Pentangeli) and works in so much depth and humanity, that at the end he's one of your favorite people in the entire Godfather story (doubly amazing, since he didn't have any automatic goodwill from the audience by being a carryover from the first film). The quiet scene between he and Duvall near the end is, in some ways, the most shocking, cold-hearted and violent of the whole series - and not one weapon is drawn, the two speaking in pleasantries the entire time, barely above a murmur. This, folks, is great acting - as well as sophisticated writing, all topped off by a director who has total confidence in the audience to get it, without his having to exaggerate or accentuate a thing. This is, simply, peerless moviemaking.Such peerlessness exists, for me, in doses rather than all the way through in The Godfather Part II. But to extrapolate from this that the film is somehow worthless is a mistake - one I must apologize for. Though I still stand by my assessment that, for me anyway, the second Godfather is largely 'unnecessary', I am more aware and sympathetic to the larger purpose it serves for a good deal of the audience. And, necessary or not, it still has on show some absolutely top-notch cinema acting, writing and directing. Maybe it, unlike the first one, is an offer I *can* refuse, but having once accepted it, I'm there for the duration.",4,14,37,5 July 2002
U-571," World War II Sub movie gets the facts wrong - but everything else right.
","Saw this movie in the theatres over the summer. Enjoyed it, but pretty much promptly forgot about it. I saw it again recently on video and, already knowing the story and the outcome, I was free to pay more attention to the technique. And my verdict is this: U-571 is one of the most finely crafted popcorn movies of the past several years. One of the things which has become most regrettable about the Big Hollywood Summer Movies is their relentless pace: everything is in your face, it's all whiz-banging by you a million miles a second, with the (increasingly hokey looking) CGI special effects hogging just about every frame of the screen. Hollywood action directors have lost touch with how to pace a film for maximum impact: that there must be peaks and valleys, moments of calm and white-knuckle tension in order for the explosions to pack the wallop they should. U-571 gets it just about all right. It is a very satisfying viewing experience; nothing to rewrite the book on film, certainly, and nothing you will carry with you for the rest of your days - but a solid, intelligent entertainment that won't leave you feeling like you've just been raped by Industrial Light and Magic.The setup is solid and well thought out; it gets the film rolling at a good clip (I won't bore you with details of the plot here - you can read the IMDb summary for that). There's a no-nonsense quality to it all, right from the get-go: the filmmakers are not interested in any romantic subplots (there are no women in the movie), inter-crew rivalries or joshing, puffed- up backstories (no 'proving something to his father' or 'avenging the death of his best friend' type character profiles) and least of all no gratuitously overlong 'money shots' showing off the hardware and special effects. To some tastes, this might make the movie a bit too dry and faceless, and I'll be the first to admit that I wouldn't want every movie to be done in this way. But it's appropriate to the subject at hand: in such a scenario, the task - the mission - is what is most important (not whether or not Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler - or Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane - are together at the end of the movie) and it's refreshing to see a big Hollywood actioner get that right. It reminded me of the classic war movies of the past, like Guns of Navarone, or Where Eagles Dare: Ok, we've got a job to do and we're going to do it - that's what we're here for (*all* we're here for) and that's what the audience really wants to see. So let's get to it!Furthermore, making all (rather than just some) of the story take place on the submarine was very brave. It's the tightest, most claustrophobic place imaginable, and it does not allow for the type of cathartic, big action payoffs that other films can provide (aerial dogfights, car chases, kung-fu blowouts, etc.). There's a muted, constricted feeling to even the good guys' victories here that does not allow for a satisfying 'Hooray!' from the audience - just a pattern of high tension, slight release, then back again, all leading to a surprisingly muted finale which, in its own way, is as clear-eyed about battle and as respectful of the men who fought it as was Saving Private Ryan (though, of course, much less pointed about it).Some might question how I can actually use a word like 'respectful' in relation to this movie, since - as has been widely noted - the exploits of the American crew here are wildly fictionalised, and that the true heroes in acquiring the Enigma machines from German subs were the British. Well, I'll agree: this is Hollywood revisionism at its worst. But you know what? It's a cracking good tale, done with care and respect (it even lists, at the end, all the different missions - British and American both - that were responsible for successfully confiscating Enigmas). The film's concern is not with presenting historical 'truth' but with using the backdrop of history as an entryway onto a tautly constructed cinematic thrill ride. If such an endeavor strikes you as offensive and opportunistic - well, I can't really argue with you. But if you can get past it, and are only interested in a solid, well crafted, well thought out movie. . . gentlemen, I give you U-571.",Null,0,1,2 December 2000
The Shining," All play and no work makes Jack (Nicholson) a VERY dull boy. . .
","It's certainly not a new complaint in relation to this film, but I must register it anyway: Jack Nicholson's acting here is all wrong for the material. Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity - which, given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style - could have been truly horrific to watch, we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird: it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film, and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film *parody*. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable, but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically (A minor comparison would be the first 'Fletch' movie, where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller, but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup).However, there's no point in blaming Nicholson for the mess - this was clearly the way Kubrick wanted the part to be played. Perfectionist and control freak that he was, you don't believe for a minute that any inch of a Kubrick film isn't exactly how he wanted it; he certainly wouldn't allow a mere *actor* to steamroll his well-laid plans, not even one as forceful and magnetic as Jack Nicholson. Still, this movie - together with Batman, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - soured me on Jack for a long time; I found in him an actor far too willing to coast on his personality and to ham it up mercilessly, rather than bother to actually create a recognizable human being. Such a technique is fine, even commendable, for farceurs like Jim Carrey or Paul Reubens (either one of which would probably have been just as effective as Nicholson is here at being Jack Torrance) but we should expect more from our so-called Dramatic Actors. It wasn't until I saw some of his more restrained, nuanced work in such films as Ironweed, Wolf, The King of Marvin's Gardens, and even (amazingly) Easy Rider that I realized what a truly fine performer Nicholson can be when he is forced to, as it were, paint in between the lines (by the way, no complaints from me about his Oscar for As Good As It Gets - he's the only actor alive who could have made that part work the way it did). It's just too bad Kubrick didn't decide to use him this way; watching Jack Torrance go from a diffident, restrained man (watch the first part of Wolf to see how surprisingly well Nicholson can play such a character) to a rampaging lunatic would have been truly frightening (even with the extra bit of campiness Nicholson throws in - 'Heeere's Johnny!', etc). It would have been as if the Overlook Hotel unleashed some primordial demon from the depths of an essentially decent man. The way it plays now, Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning (those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!) - all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course, there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie; Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact, when Nicholson is offscreen, the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous, as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open - yet paradoxically oppressive - map room (where Jack does his 'writing'): these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it, its stillness and quiet, and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have (which, again, would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place). Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices, for the most part, and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet - which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply, there are images and flash-cuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake - they will haunt your subconscience forever (deliciously). None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy, the wife, finally discovers what it is Jack has been 'writing' all this time: I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gut-bustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bone-chillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone, the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at, it's just that he belongs in a different movie - the Evil Dead flicks, maybe, or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining, for me at least, a frustrating experience: I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever, or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas, it cannot be both - and in trying to do so, it effectively undermines itself at every turn.",7,25,41,1 December 2000
American Beauty," Come on people - WAKE UP already!! It's no good!!!
","Dreamworks did one hell of a job rolling out the red carpet for this bloated, self-important saga, making everyone feel it was the 'movie to see' this fall. Well, I don't mind blatant promotion if it points me toward something worthwhile, but this was such a stinker that I walked out in the middle of it (and I NEVER walk out on movies!). I later heard the details of the ending from a friend and could only be doubly grateful that I walked out when I did.The acting is uniformly hollow and grating. I squirmed in embarrassment for Annette Bening, a fine actress forced to embody one of the shrillest and most blatantly misogynistic caricatures of womanhood/motherhood ever put on the screen. Thora Birch as the daughter is evidently the most recent graduate of the Winona Ryder 'sneering and sulking as a form of character delineation' school of acting. But even she looks like a Meryl Streep next to Mena Suvari as the teenage Lolita of the piece, who is so boring and unappealing that the notion of anyone falling in love with her is absurd. Wes Bentley as the kid next door is just plain weird, like an outcast from a David Lynch movie - which wouldn't be so bad except that we're supposed to take him seriously. Chris Cooper as his militaristic and overbearing father does his best with the role, but it's every bit as obvious (and odious) a caricature as Bening's. The only actor who comes out looking even halfway decent is Kevin Spacey - not because he's so wonderful, but simply because he has the good sense to underplay his part and search for the laughs wherever he can find them. Indeed, when he's being drolly amusing, the movie is passably entertaining (like in the scene where he tells off his boss, or when he applies for work at a fast-food restaurant). But he gets zero support from the rest of the cast, and so even his talents are wasted, as there's just no one believable for him to play off of.  And even his humor is wasted, since the film, instead of being a black comedy (which might - emphasize MIGHT - have worked), so wants to be taken seriously as an Important Statement. But since everything in it is either a cliché or a stereotype, how can it be taken seriously?And it's so derivative! It's like the producers said, 'Ok, let's cross The Ice Storm with Lolita and The Truman Show, throw in bits and pieces from Fearless and War of the Roses, some of the feel of The Graduate, and give the whole thing a look straight out of Blue Velvet.' It's ridiculous! Every situation and idea in here has been done far better somewhere else - heck, any run of the mill made for TV family crisis melodrama is better than this schlock. I can't emphasize this enough: THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE! An insult to all mature, thinking and feeling people.What's WRONG with all of you out there?! Snap out of it! Seeing the reception this film has been getting, I feel like I'm in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and I'm the last one who has not been taken over by the pods. And you know what? It's starting to get lonely.",2,5,9,18 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," A great premise squandered
","I remember when I first heard the premise for this movie, I wanted to just get up and cheer - it sounded so great! A guy discovers a secret portal into the head of John Malkovich, allowing people to experience what it is like to be the famous (but not too famous) actor for 15 minutes at a clip, before being dumped out onto the New Jersey turnpike. Bizarre, surreal, and totally original. Which is why it's such a shame that the movie ends up using this device in service of a rather lame romantic triangle between John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, none of whom create a very interesting or likable character to begin with. The movie could have explored the nature of celebrity, or the psychological need people have to 'get inside' someone else's head, or to live vicariously through others. All these things are touched on to some extent, but they take a backseat to what becomes essentially a boring sex romp.Still, there are some wonderful things here. The 7 1/2th floor is an invention of Monty Pythonesque lunacy, and it provides the film with a hilarious visual motif. The actual scenes of entering the portal and being inside Malkovich's head are shot with great deadpan brilliance. And Malkovich himself is totally amazing - wonderfully droll as 'himself' and then suitably off the wall as his body becomes overtaken by forces beyond his control. He truly deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year (just think how great the acceptance speech would be!)Of course, the fact that in a movie entitled 'Being John Malkovich,' John Malkovich himself could be considered only a *supporting* actor is entirely the problem. I wanted more of him, and less of the dippy trio mentioned above. The movie frustrated me - it could have been so good, and settled for being ordinary. Ultimately, the things that are good about it do make it worth seeing, but just barely. And don't expect any comic masterpiece; all the critics that hailed it as such were talking about what the film could have been, not what it is. Rating: 6/10",6,0,0,19 February 2000
Dark City," It's true. It's all true.
","I concur with every single positive comment made at this site concerning Dark City. It is an absolutely ingenious movie - certainly visually, but in Hollywood these days that's the easy part (even hack filmmakers can create movies that at least LOOK good); the real treat is how well the story fits together. It's gripping on the level of pure plot mechanics as a Kafkaesque nightmare, and it also works well on the philosophical level as a speculation upon the fundamental nature of identity. This latter part is somewhat undercut and ill-served by, IMO, a too abrupt finale which also falls back on typical Hollywood 'climactic showdown' conventions; a more muted and ambiguous ending would have been preferable. Still, this is only a slight mar, and the picture is absolutely marvelous. It is often compared to Blade Runner and Brazil but, while I respect and appreciate both those movies, I found myself much more gripped and intrigued by Dark City.",7,0,1,21 March 2000
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," There's got to be SOME reason why these stories are so popular . . .
","I have yet to read one of the Harry Potter' books and maybe it's high time I did  because, based upon the movies made from them, I have a hard time seeing exactly why they're so popular.To be sure, the first movie (which, like the second, I saw as a chaperone for my young nieces) has a certain low-key charm, as the notion (and presentation) of the Hogwarts School of Wizardry contains enough wow-ee inventiveness to be sufficiently engaging. And, of course, the tried and true theme of the ugly-duckling transformed into a prince (or, closer still, the poor waif plucked from obscurity and ill-treatment to be lead into a life of wonder and personal distinction) that Harry's story represents is a surefire route to the capture of any child's imagination. It is accomplished, too, with sly Dickensian wit that can prove similarly entertaining to adults. As a stand-alone movie (and book, I guess), I can certainly see the appeal of Harry Potter.'But as a SERIES?? It seems to endlessly repeat itself and its dramatic beats in each succeeding storyline. So, in this third movie we get  yet again - an opening glimpse into Harry's home life with the cruel and spiteful Dursleys (whose overstated and unwarranted evil grew tiresome even before their exit from the *first* film); his re-acquaintance with friends Ron and Hermione on the train to Hogwarts; the preparations for the upcoming academic year; the maddeningly brief and perfunctory introduction to each of the whimsical wizardry classes for that year  all populated with masterful British actors who get only the most token of screen time; Harry's ongoing (and boring) rivalry with the dreaded Malfoy (whose one-dimensionality bespeaks an artistic laziness); and the entire movie threaded through with an underlying evil and threat (either to Harry, the school in general, or both) which finally erupts into the inevitable rousing (or, would-be rousing) showdown at the end. Frankly, this last always stretches my credulity, as it becomes increasingly clear with each tale that not only is Hogwarts possibly the most dangerous place in the world for Harry to be, but that it is populated by a staff of `expert' wizards who are singularly ineffectual in combating any kind of outside threat. One gets the perverse sense that the school should actually be *run* by Harry and Hermione, rather than developing them from diamond-in-the-rough wunderkinds who only gradually come to expertise in their fledgling magical powers.Now, don't get me wrong: as a kid, I too was taken with books written in series (starring the likes of Encyclopedia Brown, the Hardy Boys, and the Great Brain) and demanded nothing more from them than that they provide the same types of stories and interactions that I loved so well the first time round. But J.K. Rowling's inflation of her books to near `War and Peace' lengths, as well as her insistence that each one represents a further step in the development of a larger artistic master plan strikes me as so much pretentious piffle. I don't begrudge kids their fun  and ANYTHING that promotes reading on such a wide scale is to be cherished and encouraged. But let's call a spade a spade.And, while we're at it, let's call Rowling a sell-out. If there's ANY work of literary fiction that could stand on its own, without a movie needed to popularize it among the masses, it's Harry Potter' (probably Lord of the Rings' too, but we won't go into that). Frankly, I think the beloved authoress let slip a grand opportunity to stick her tongue out (and finger up) to Hollywood by refusing to allow her books to be adapted into movies. She certainly doesn't need the money, the books don't need the exposure, and it would have provided her young readers a glimpse into true artistic integrity at work: an example that some things *don't* work best when the most money and advertising is thrown at them . . . that sometimes, the inner recesses of your imagination is the best place for beloved characters to reside.And of course, had she done so, we as moviegoers wouldn't be subjected to productions so overly reverent to their source that the makers live in terror of leaving even the tiniest of details out. Why o why is it important for Potter fans  who know everything that's going to happen anyway  to be able to see Hollywood's representations of their private fantasies? Why o why is it important for us non-Hogwarts initiates to be force-fed every scene and character from the book in a compressed running time that gives none of it any room to breathe or create any resonance? It's the absolute worst of all worlds, and everybody loses. (Yes, even fans of the books who enjoy the movies  because, whether they realize it or not, their own mental pictures of the characters and situations, formed when reading, are being reprogrammed and reconstituted by Hollywood. It's doubtful whether, having seen the movies, even the most die-hard reader can ever picture Harry as anyone other than Daniel Radcliff, or Professor Snape as Alan Rickman, etc.. . . Which maybe wouldn't even be an important point to bring up, except for the fact that the books had clearly done such an EXCELLENT job at capturing young imaginations, all on their ownsome. Now, even that accomplishment becomes suspect.)But oops, I realize I haven't yet said anything about the newest movie, re-conceived by director Alfonso Cuaron, which has received buckets and buckets full of praise (and, truth be told, was the only reason I went at all). Well, yes, he is a better director than Chris Columbus, and the photography in certain scenes is much more dramatic than anything in the other two, but we're getting into some pretty minute distinctions. It's a Harry Potter' film, and so subject to all the same annoyances and inconsistencies mentioned above. See it if you must - but me, I'm heading for the library . . .",Null,0,0,17 June 2004
Man on the Moon," Unenlightening, unnecessary movie
","Despite a great performance from Jim Carrey, this feels more like a 'greatest hits' collection of Andy Kaufman performances than any serious attempt to examine him or try to understand him. Some people have said that by not trying to psychoanalyze Kaufman the filmmakers show admirable restraint and point up the fact that we can never truly 'know' anybody or their motives. Fine, but in that case why make a movie? Without an angle or a point of view to it, a biopic is just dull. Books and/or documentaries remain the best way to chronicle a person's life - and in Kaufman's case, there are several good examples of both (books: 'Lost in the Funhouse' by Bill Zehme and 'Andy Kaufman Revealed' by his friend and writing partner Bob Zmuda; documentaries: Comedy Central's Salute to Andy Kaufman and, if you're interested primarily in his wrestling exploits and his bouts with Jerry Lawler 'I Come From Hollywood' - and there are others as well). With so much information out there about the man, this movie just feels redundant and unneccesary.",4,0,1,1 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," A flawed gem
","First off, everything you may have heard about the opening Normandy sequence is true: this is quite simply the most amazing battle re-creation footage you're ever likely to see. Definitely not for the squeamish, it paints its horrifying portrait without ever allowing the viewer to glory in any kind of 'excitement' (which most battle simulations end up doing on some level, even the well-meaning ones). Spielberg uses every ounce of his talent and ingenuity to show combat the way it should be shown: as pure Hell, a nightmare that it is impossible to waken from.As for the rest of the movie which follows this opening sequence. . . well, I'm not sure. The first time I saw it, I was caught up from the beginning and the rest of the film seemed to hold me equally well. But upon further viewings, the flimsiness and basic illogic of the central plot become far more noticeable. I don't know, it's a toss-up. There are still several compelling scenes here, and Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career (his 'dramatic' career anyway - I'm one who still believes there's much to be said for Tom's earlier work in comedy) but there just seems to be an overall 'falseness' in the structure that undercuts some of the film's power. I wish a better framing story could have been found.But by all means see this movie. Warts and all, it's the kind that only a truly great director could make - and the opening alone is worth the cost. Just don't expect a masterpiece; think of it more as a flawed gem.",7,0,0,5 February 2000
Schindler's List," Some thoughts
","SPOILERS WITHIN. Don't read unless you've seen the movie.At this point, almost a decade after its release, Schindler's List is what it is: it has become a cultural touchstone, and its reputation rightfully precedes it. It certainly has an aura and a cachet that goes beyond any single endeavor to praise or criticize it; therefore, I plan to do neither, but merely to share some of the thoughts I had while watching it. Some will be positive, others more negative - but none of it is meant to (or will be able to) diminish what Spielberg has achieved with this movie.First off, I must say that all the scenes with Schindler himself I found riveting: Liam Neeson - not an actor I usually warm up to very well - was absolutely mesmerizing: he gave the character an authority and a charisma that was totally captivating, while still preserving the basic enigmatic nature of the man. (He reminded me again and again of a young Richard Burton when he was at the top of his game.) The tug-of-war of conscience in the scenes between him and Stern (Ben Kingsley, underplaying nicely) were, though a bit schematic and obvious, nonetheless powerful - no doubt because of the enormity of the topic at hand. Holocaust movies, of course, can very easily get a free pass because of that very enormity, and Schindler's List is no exception: scenes that might otherwise have seemed simplistic or overplayed are imbued with power because of the context in which they occur.One scene that stuck out for me, though - and not necessarily in a good way - was the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. It is of course a tour-de-force of filmmaking and technical prowess (a foreshadowing, say, of the Normandy Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan), but its reason for being I found suspect. Ostensibly - on the level of the story, anyway - it was there to bring Schindler face to face with the horror and waste of the Nazi policy toward the Jews, and so to suggest a reason why he converted from shameless profiteer and exploiter to Jewish savior.Except, as such a scene, it doesn't quite wash. Schindler indeed is displayed as witnessing the liquidation, but from his vantage point - a hill overlooking the ghetto - he would in no way have been able to see the scene in the detail, and in all the different locations, that the movie makes us privy to. No, this scene is designed not to be played before Schindler, but to be played before us, the moviegoers.So why does that bother me? Well, it seems to me a break in form. A movie that had been, up until that time, focusing narrowly on one man, suddenly opens up to wanting to display the panoply of characters and lives that were directly affected by the Holocaust. Problem is, by adopting such a large-scale approach, no one individual (or family) is able to claim our full attention, and so Spielberg becomes guilty in his own way of `ghetto'-izing the Jews - that is, grouping them together facelessly as victims, rather than showcasing any of their dignity or humanity as individuals.My bias, I suppose, in films dealing with the Holocaust, is that the enormity of it is just lost on most of us. It's impossible - unless we lived and survived through it - to do justice to both its scale and its horror. Therefore, a film-maker shouldn't try. Not that Holocaust-themed films shouldn't be made; it's just that, to be honest and effective (not necessarily the same thing - particularly when the artist is Spielberg) they should focus themselves on a small *microcosm* of it - a family, a person, a survivor - and attempt to *SUGGEST* the full horrors, through the particulars of that person's story. Actually trying to show those horrors outright (to put us, as it were, `inside' the Holocaust) is frankly impossible, and I think Spielberg's ambitions to do so, through this liquidation scene and other similar ones in the movie - are, though perhaps high-minded, ultimately wrong-headed.But, as I say, when he's focused narrowly on Schindler himself, the film works wonderfully - and is far more able, in my opinion, to get across the horror and waste of the Holocaust than when it's concentrating on its big (but impersonal) `herd up the Jews' scenes. The making up of the list itself is extremely powerful in this regard: `More names! More names!' Schindler demands, and his mania in doing so tells us all we need to know about the absolute desperation of the times (particularly as it comes from a formerly amoral man only interested in himself).And as such, I must take exception to all those (and there are many) who find the last scene - Schindler's breakdown - to be completely maudlin and ill-advised, a detriment to an otherwise marvelous motion picture. To me, it was the best scene in the movie. For, in the character's hysterical insistence that he `could have done more' - coming on the heels of all the people we saw that he *DID* save - it serves to remind the audience - in absolutely unambiguous terms - that what Oskar Schindler did, though momentous, wasn't'even a drop in the bucket compared to the number of lives taken and/or disrupted by the Holocaust. That this man - driven to bankruptcy and ruin by his (eventual) unceasing efforts to save the Jews - could claim that he `didn't do enough,' only shows how much there was to do, and how much of it was left undone. That, to me, is the kind of moment that brings home the enormity of the Holocaust - not the use of hundreds of extras to be herded onto trains and into showers. We can tell ourselves (and be right) that those scenes are fake (staged for the movie). The point made through Schindler's breakdown at the end is the deepest kind of truth - the kind that never should be forgotten or cast aside.",7,10,15,15 June 2003
Donnie Brasco," One of the best
","I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I've seen it I've come to like it *more*than the previous time - which is fairly incredible. I definitely liked it well enough the first time, but upon the third viewing I became convinced: this isn't just a good, solid movie - it's one of the greatest of all time.Why? Well, for me, I'd say that 'Donnie Brasco' is the movie that 'Goodfellas' wasn't.  I don't actually get what the big fuss is over 'Goodfellas' (which I realize, for many people, disqualifies my opinion right there, but here goes) - it's objective to the point of not taking any kind of stance at all on its characters or its situations. And even at that, in comparison with 'Donnie' it actually *does* glamorize mobsters' lives: they are all the masters of their little world, and are entitled to the best of everything, even in prison.  By contrast, 'Donnie' shows the cheap and petty underside of mob life: a bunch of frustrated grunts, hanging out in the local grease joint, hatching schemes to make any kind of buck in order to pay off their bosses. It's sad and pathetic - and the attempts of Pacino's character to puff himself up (as well as the life he leads) into some kind of mythic significance is just unutterably sad. It's the 'Death of a Salesman' of mob movies. And that in itself would be quite enough. But in fact, it's also something else, something equally gripping and profound. It's maybe the best 'undercover cop' movie I've ever seen, as well.  That is, not only does it gives us a good inside view of the actual mechanics and legwork involved (wearing a wire, reporting to superiors, etc.) but also the effect that staying perpetually 'in character' can have on the undercover cop's personal sense of self. Johnny Depp's character here is torn between his two separate identities: that of Joe Pistone, upstanding cop and family man, and the slimy and amoral 'Donnie Brasco' that he is forced to live out every day as. His loyalty also becomes torn between his superiors, who stand loftily and sanctimoniously above him, and the everyday mob characters that he spends his time with and comes to feel a closeness for - particularly Lefty (Pacino). The relationship the movie builds between these two men is one of the strongest and most tender (while still understated) that I've ever seen in any film. And the conflict that it brings about in Donnie is made very real and poignant to the audience.Also helping to make Donnie's dilemma effective are the scenes between he and his wife, played (perfectly) by Anne Heche. I bring this up because there might be a tendency to view these scenes as filler, since they take us away from the main action, and are pretty touchy-feely to boot (the quality of writing in them, I'll admit, is not as consistently high as the other scenes in the movie - though never less than competent). However,  I find them just as necessary and vital to the film as all the mafia stuff: those scenes add incalculably to the composite picture of Johnny Depp's character, and how it is being pulled this way and that by the call of duty and the pull of his heart and conscience.A FINAL NOTE: Concerning Al Pacino's performance here; it's been lauded as one of his best, but I'm not so sure. The CHARACTER of Lefty is definitely one of the greatest he has ever been handed, but there's not much subtlety to his portrayal, i.e. it's of the hambone, 'Hoo-Ha' variety that has become his stock in trade ('Sea of Love' being the last time he created a fully three dimensional person on screen). However, what's affecting and poignant is how the film *uses* that portrayal: we're so used to seeing Pacino as the big boss, the head honcho - where his bluster is justified by his position - that to flip the formula on its head, and show him as the lowliest of the bottom feeders, yet still maintaining the same bluster, is tremendously jarring, in a sad kind of way. It's as if we're seeing the character of Lefty say to himself: 'I'm a nobody, but maybe if I puff up enough and carry myself more like Al Pacino does in the movies, I can become a somebody.' In this situation, is it the actor who's creating the magic, or the filmmakers' canny *use* of the actor, with all of his associations? I'm inclined to think the latter, but ultimately it doesn't matter: the bottom line is, Lefty Ruggiero is one of the greatest characters in all of film, and his story will break your heart.A great, great movie. I'm sure I'll revisit it many more times through the years.",Null,0,0,24 July 2001
Mulholland Drive," What's going ON here?
","David Lynch movies pretty much exist to annoy me, so why I even bothered with this is somewhat of a mystery. In truth, a friend of mine who really did want to see it (and loved it, by the way) more or less twisted my arm, but I never particularly expected to enjoy it. And I was not disappointed.I'm not gonna go on about it, though: Lynch is someone you either like or you don't, and I just don't. His desire to tell stories devoid of narrative, or at least with a punctured and messed-up sense of narrative, is not really entertaining to me. Perhaps if his visuals and atmospherics were more compelling, I might be willing to just groove on them in the absence of story. (As a counter example, I *can* groove to, say, the imagery in Blade Runner, and enjoy watching the film just for that, even though I don't find the story to be particularly interesting or well told.) But that's just a personal call: if you like Lynch at all, you must like his style and visuals, and that's fine. I just don't - they don't do anything for me. But I think we can part the ways amicably on that. However, I can't leave this film without lodging one fairly serious complaint - one that I believe holds validity whether you're a Lynch lover or not. For about three-fourths of the way through, the story actually DOES make sense: it's not told in the most conventional way, perhaps, but it is at least something you can follow. Unlike Lost Highway, which (from what I've heard) was confusing and tripped out from the beginning, Mulholland Drive has a throughline that does appear to be headed somewhere. Then, just as on the TV program Twin Peaks all those years ago, it's as if Lynch decided, 'Oh my gosh, this story is actually GOING somewhere - I can't have that!' And so at the eleventh hour he does a double flip-back whammy and in the final fifteen minutes turns it all into incomprehensible weirdness - for no better reason, seemingly, than that, well, he's DAVID LYNCH after all. A little consistency here, Dave, would be nice: if the whole film is going to be like a 'dream state' - or whatever it is you're going for - establish that closer to the beginning of the film. But this is just yanking the audience's chain, pure and simple.Anyway, that's my opinion. Lynch fans can (and probably will) have a field day with me, but there it is.",Null,0,2,10 November 2001
The Insider," In a perfect world. . .
",". . . this would be just another movie. The uniformly strong acting, the tautly-scripted storyline, the assured but (for the most part) largely unobtrusive direction - this stuff should just be par for the course. Back in the mid-70s these kind of smart, densely plotted, clearly focused movies were done all the time. Sadly, in today's Hollywood of Michael Bay, Lucas/Spielberg clones and Tarantino wanna-bes - where shock and spectacle, pop culture hipsterism, and visual overkill predominate - an intelligent, sensitively wrought movie like The Insider comes across like some kind of revelation. Rather than what it is: a good, competent film - not a transcendent one, nothing that will stay with you for a long time after you've seen it: in short, not a Best Picture nominee. And yet, of all the films up for the Oscar this year, I'd say this one is the best; what does THAT tell you about the movie cycle we're currently going through?I don't mean any of this to take away from the movie itself. There's much to like here, particularly the lead performances from Al Pacino and Russel Crowe. Crowe brings a crimped, repressed intensity to his role as Jeffrey Wigand, who blew the whistle on big tobacco and then had to live with the consequences. His stillness and meek stolidity simultaneously pull you in and yet keep you distanced at the same time. He internalizes the role to such an extent that we can sense the springs and whirrings going on underneath without him having to show any of it to us. As a matter of fact, it's very much the type of controlled intensity which Al Pacino brought to his work in such 70s films as Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and (especially) the two Godfathers. Alas, it's a skill that has long deserted him (or been deserted by him) and he has become one of the most 'showy' of actors. No Pacino performance can properly be called subtle anymore - it's merely a question of the degree his over-acting takes: either full-steam-ahead scenery chewing (Scent of a Woman, Dick Tracy, Devil's Advocate, Heat) or a more relaxed hamminess which at least keeps him on the same earthly plane as his co-stars (Carlito's Way, Glengary Glen Ross, Donnie Brasco). Happily, The Insider falls into the latter category, and his portrayal of '60 Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman, while certainly heroic and larger than life, is also imbued with a real sense of friendliness and compassion. In dealing with Wigand, he is forced to adopt several different roles - friend, confessor, sounding-board, even big brother - in order to nudge the man into telling his story. Pacino goes through the changes with ease, but he also suggests a real concern and protectiveness for Wigand which go beyond his need to get a good story. As such, the film becomes primarily about the relationship forged between these two men. This is a good way to focus the story, since it puts a human face on the larger issues raised instead of just being a simple-minded polemic, whose characters exist only to move the plot along.What else. Um, let's see - the direction is solid, for the most part; it lets the story tell itself rather than trying to inject much bogus 'style' onto it (there are some lapses here and there - some overly dramatic soundtrack choices and a misplaced 'hallucination' scene in a hotel room - but nothing too major). The supporting cast is all good - though certainly no more than that. This is particularly true of Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace, who's drawing all sorts of accolade for what is basically an impersonation. An enjoyable one, to be sure, but it never really goes beyond the surface. Of course, the film doesn't help matters by writing Wallace as a shallow dupe and corporate lackey - it really does a hatchet job on him and I'm not sure how justified it is. The final third of the film, in fact, is a little hard to take - the part which deals with '60 Minutes' refusal to air the tobacco story. It just doesn't seem as compelling as the earlier part of the film - partly because Wigand, the most interesting character, gets pushed to the background and it becomes a one-man show for Al Pacino. And when I say one man, I really mean it: the Bergman character is portrayed as the only one with any integrity whatsoever, as he single-handedly (and single-mindedly) pushes to get the story out through other media, while his colleagues (including Wallace) are content to tow the corporate line. The filmmakers exaggerate the facts here, and the film suffers as a result: it puffs itself up too self-consciously as an 'issues' movie, rather than letting those issues emerge organically through the kind of character study the first part did so well. And any time a film makes one character the sole repository of goodness and integrity, as it does with Pacino here, it tends to become strained and unbelievable. So, too, does The Insider in the final half hour.Up until then, however, it's good - though certainly not the second coming of All the President's Men (the film it's most often been compared to). There's no reason, though, why every film shouldn't be this good; there's nothing amazing going on here, just an interesting story, well told. If that's the kind of virtue which gets lauded in Hollywood these days as a masterpiece, then I think we're all in a lot of trouble.",Null,0,0,5 March 2000
The Graduate," Some comments on the second half
","(This review concerns itself solely with a specific discussion of the latter half of the movie, so if you have not already seen it, you probably won't want to read this either.)This is my second write-up for The Graduate  it's kind of hard for me to shut up about this movie; it's one of my all-time favorites, and I find more and more to like every time I watch it. What I want to talk about specifically, though, is the second half of the movie  that is, everything past the point where Elaine Robinson finds out Benjamin and her mother have been having an affair. The film builds to a kind of climactic moment with that revelation, almost a mini-ending (complete with a long shot and a fade to black). Indeed, for many people, the film actually *does* end right about there: it has long been a foregone conclusion in critical circles that the film never completely finds its way back on track from this point on. That is, once the focus shifts from the relationship of Ben and Mrs. Robinson to that of Ben's pursuit of Elaine, The Graduate simply runs out of gas.It's not my intention to argue too strenuously against this consensus: I don't believe there can be any doubt that the first half of the movie is much sharper, funnier, more intense, and just all-around more involving than the second half. (Though I do believe that by the first part being *so* strong, and involving us so well, it does tend to make the weaknesses of the second part less jarring than they should be: we already know and care about these characters  Benjamin, anyway  and want to follow them anywhere, no matter how sketchy and unfocused their stories begin to seem.)No, the point I want to make here is that, though The Graduate becomes a different *kind* of film in the second half (a romance, versus the sex farce/comedy of manners that was the first half), it never ceases being jaundice-eyed and satirical about its characters. I say this because it is an easy enough assumption to make that the film makers expect us to take Benjamin's love for and quest of Elaine at face value: to believe that they were `meant for' each other, and that their ultimate triumph is a resolution to be sincerely wished for. In reality, it is nothing of the sort. Ben and Elaine barely know each other  at least not in any meaningful way  when he begins his intense courtship of her (`stalking' might be the better term). There's something undeniably creepy and unsettling about Benjamin's fixation on Elaine: it's as if he's on a quest to woo and win her, but he's doing it primarily for the sake of being on a quest (and perhaps as a way of jump-starting himself out of the rut that his relationship with Mrs. Robinson has become). There's nothing specific about Elaine that is spelled out for the audience as to why she might appeal to Ben so much  save for the simple fact that she's NOT Mrs. Robinson. This lack has often been attributed to poor screenwriting and a flawed conception and, while that's an understandable conclusion to draw given the second half's other failings, I don't believe this is actually the case. Whatever you may think of it as a thematic strand, I believe this sense of blankness in the relationship between Ben and Elaine was deliberate on the part of the filmmakers - ie. they knew what they were doing, and what point they were trying to make. And that point relates directly to the fallacy of romantic love. We see many scenes of Ben viewing Elaine longingly from afar (to the omnipresent strains of Simon and Garfunkel), the camera's soft-focus making it all seem like something out of a fable, or (more likely) a Harlequin romance. But, as an audience, we are so used to (just as much today as back in 1967) accepting these kinds of shots and poses as a shorthand for deep love, and a feeling that the two characters in question were `meant' to be together, that we are easily fooled into thinking that that is just what the film makers have in mind for these two. In reality, it's an insightful (visual) comment upon just how such `shorthand'  in not only film, but any of the arts (literature, song, painting, etc.)  screws up young people such as Ben and Elaine, giving them the illusion of love and passion being there when they aren't.Which explains the film's ending  that is, its very last shot. It should be joyous and celebratory, as Ben has succeeded in his goal  snatching his beloved away from the altar and claiming her for himself (and she going along willingly, even giddily). But after the initial enthusiasm wears off, the smiles on the two of them dissipate and our final image of them is one of sheer dejection and confusion. And it must be so, because they have been duped by years of pop culture hogwash into believing that this is what true love is; the realization hits them hard that they don't have the slightest idea what they're doing together. And so Ben's dilemma of what to do with his `future' continues: he has wound up in exactly the same place he was at the beginning of the movie  only now with an equally confused human being as an appendage.As I say, all this may not make you *like* the second part of the movie any better than you do (I can appreciate it, but on a different, somewhat lesser, level than the first part). But I think it's at least important to be clear what the film makers were after, and to judge it according to how well it hits *that* mark, rather than the one we may have been *fooled* into thinking they were going for.",Null,132,161,10 June 2003
The Graduate," Its triumph is one of tone, not content
","I take up my pen tonight (metaphorically) to defend this movie from the onslaught of revisionist criticism it has taken over the past twenty years (particularly acute with its theatrical re-release three years ago). Any film that becomes as popular and as culturally defining as this one was in the late 1960s is bound to occasion any number of reassessments and reappraisals.  However, the extent to which the majority of these have been so negative to the film is somewhat overwhelming. There's almost a defensiveness here - on the part of critics, anyway - as if to say, 'You fooled us into thinking this piece was something IMPORTANT and PROFOUND - well it isn't! Now, we're gonna get ya for it. . .'In fact, I'm not so sure that this film was ever intended as any kind of sweeping cultural or generational statement. I believe that may have been imposed upon it by the critics of the day, who wished to see in Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock the picture of disaffected youth, boldly rebelling against the false values of his elders. Personally, in my experience of the film (which I have seen now countless times), I don't find anything that grand. Indeed, to me The Graduate succeeds by being one of the best *minimalist* movies in American cinema. Its story is about a PARTICULAR character, in a PARTICULAR time and place, playing out a very idiosyncratic set of circumstances. It posits no doctrine, argues for no 'alternative' lifestyle, and in general refuses to prostheletize or to make its hero into any kind of leader or paragon.  If audiences responded (and continue to respond, critics be damned) to Benjamin's plight, it is because of the intensity of *feeling* that is communicated, not to the quality of thought. Indeed it could not be, since the main item up for display in the movie is the degree to which Benjamin's ability for clear thought has been subsumed by confusion, fear, self consciousness, and an almost soul-annihilating depression.These oppressive qualities are communicated to the viewer through Mike Nichols' brilliantly meticulous camerawork. His dogged insistence, from the very first shot, of framing Benjamin in tight closeups even amidst (nay, especially amidst) a large group of people (the airport, his graduation party, the hotel) gives us an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia. We feel acutely the young man's sense of entrapment and exposure; at the party, as he runs upstairs to his room, the camera rushes to keep up - and it is as if Benjamin is trying even to escape being in this movie. 'Don't look at me!' his pinched voice and wilted expression seem to cry out, 'leave me alone!' I ask you, is there a soul among us who cannot relate to that feeling, who has not felt it at least briefly during different moments of his life - being the outcast, the lost soul, the one in pain amidst the gaiety or unconcern of the rest of the crowd? The conditions which lead Ben to feel this way are not specifically enumerated (beyond a vague expression of being unsure about his 'future'), but they don't need to be.  The feelings are articulated so vividly - through camerawork and performance both - that they reach us on a visceral level, and we are free to fill in our own emotional backstory for them - thereby involving us more on an individual level than we would be if we were told more specific information about Ben.
Dustin Hoffman here is totally unforgettable. He takes what is essentially a cipher character, and fills him in with such pathos and vulnerability that we can't ignore him or look away. Even as we laugh at him, we ache for him. He would do it again twenty years later in Rain Man - that trick of being overwhelmingly present in every scene and yet remaining such a total blank. How is that done? What internal rhythm does he allow us to lock into so as to keep him a compelling figure, and one who garners our full sympathy, while being at the same time a total cipher. I don't know, but that magical performer's trick of Hoffman's is, along with Nichols' painstaking camera work, what keeps this film vivid and compelling all these many years later. Yes, even as the story sputters in the second half, and even as Benjamin's relationship with Elaine Robinson remains sketchy and maddeningly unexamined. It doesn't matter because by then Hoffman and Nichols have pulled you into their spell: you will follow Benjamin Braddock anywhere, accept anything he does at face value - you just don't want to take your eyes off him.Oh, and here's to you, Mrs. Robinson. Her seduction scenes with Ben are some of the richest jewels in cinematic history. Their affair is, for both of them, a desperate and pathetic act, and their scenes together are charged with an almost overwhelming sadness and despair, which is strangely heightened (rather than alleviated) by the wicked humor these scenes also contain. It goes without saying that Anne Bancroft here is totally marvelous (just look at the way she says 'Art' when Hoffman asks her what her major was in college to see how it's possible to pack a lifetime of rage and regret into just one word). But I am at pains to point out that, much as some have wanted to make her the piece's unsung and misunderstood hero, Mrs. Robinson is clearly and unmistakably the villain of the movie. She is cruel, manipulative, and (as the Simon and Garfunkel song about her would later suggest) quite possibly a borderline psycho case.  She represents the death urge - the power of spite and vindictiveness to choke out all other human feeling, including the desire to see anyone else's life turn out better than one's one. It is unclear at the end whether Ben and Elaine will escape her fate - or her grasp - but it is certianly clear that a failure to do so would spell tragedy, not triumph.",Null,0,1,26 February 2001
Toy Story 2," It's good, BUT. . .
","Don't have any major axe to grind with this one; it's an enjoyable and entertaining movie, perfect for the whole family. Go see it. But please don't make the ridiculous claim that it's better than the first one. The first one had the true spark of originality - this one is a mere updating, a scrupulous ploy to revisit all the good bits pioneered by its predecessor. Don't get me wrong - it does an exceedingly good job of this, and finds creative and imaginative ways to recycle the material without making the audience feel that it's just seeing the same old thing again (I particularly liked the way it worked in a *second* Buzz Lightyear action figure, so that we could have the fun all over again of a Buzz totally clueless as to his own doll-hood). But, really, when you get right down to it, we *are* seeing the same old thing again: the characters haven't expanded or grown any (how can they, after all - they're TOYS!!) and the plot mechanism is exactly the same - a daring rescue mission to save a toy in trouble. And it suffers the same malady which infects every sequel, the desire to do everything bigger and more opulently, which undermines the low-key charm the original had; instead of staying within the parameters of the neighborhood and a back-yard world, TS2 takes its heroes, more improbably (and impersonally), through crowded city streets, local shopping malls, high-rise office buildings, and finally into the bowels of a large modern airport. All of this is done with wit and originality, but it seemed to contradict the fundamental premise of the first one, which is that any step outside of the bedroom is a dangerous and unlikely one for a toy to make.  What's more, the egregious Sarah McLachlan song in the middle of the movie is one of the most lachrymose bits of over-stated sentimentality ever seen in a Disney movie and almost made me want to bolt from the theater in disgust. The first movie had nothing so wildly embarrassing (the Randy Newman songs being utterly perfect).The moral quandary Woody faces here is interesting, but it's almost too big a theme to introduce into a story of this nature. I was left unconvinced that he would choose the road of built-in obsolescence, represented by going back to Andy, as opposed to the assured ever-lasting fame of being enshrined in the museum. I ended up feeling sorry for the Stinky Pete character, who was supposed to be the villain but in actuality made some pretty good, hard-to-refute points about the ephemeral nature of being a mere child's plaything. You might say I was thinking about this too hard, but the story premise is an intriguing one, and seems to invite more allegorical and philosophical speculation than it delivers; it pulls back in the end and reverts to its big adventure chase mechanics. It seems to me that the first Toy Story did not make this fundamental mistake of biting off more than it could chew; plot, theme, and action were all perfectly integrated in that movie, making it truly one of the minor classics of our age.Anyway - just needed to get that all off my chest. TS2 is an enjoyable movie, no question about it, one of the best of the year. But because of the absolute perfection of its predecessor, I just couldn't help feeling it was somewhat hollow and regurgitated. Here's hoping that Pixar does the smart thing and puts Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang permanently away in some digital toybox somewhere, letting them live on forever in the shimmering perfection of our memories.",6,1,3,22 February 2000
There's Something About Mary," Lower your expectations
","This film contains two of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in my life (they both involve the dog) and the ending is clever and sweet, but as for the rest. . . I don't get what all the hosannas are about. The film's actually pretty plodding and slow-moving and there are long, loooong stretches where there are no laughs at all. As for the two most infamous scenes - i.e. the bathroom scene and the bit with the hair gel - they're not really done that well: the joke is too obvious and the timing is terrible. I think, in general, the Farrelly brothers lack the kind of light touch that is necessary for comedy (yes, even gross-out comedy), and their movies (including Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin) tend to consist of long set-ups for jokes that are sometimes funny but most often not. And even when they're funny, you can't quite forget how long the set up was, and wonder why the pacing couldn't be better and more assured.Anyway, I don't want to rip on this movie too much - it's got a good spirit, the entire cast is appealing (if rather unexceptional) and there's even a nice little message underneath it all. As light entertainment you could do a lot worse, but you may be left wondering what all the big fuss was about. Lower your expectations just a bit and you should enjoy it just fine.",Null,0,0,17 February 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Two movies for the price of one - the first is a delight, the second a travesty
","Life Is Beautiful is really two separate movies - completely different in plot, tone and intent. The first part is a breezy romantic comedy, one which is exceedingly well-done: clever, goofy, big-hearted and a lot of fun. It resurrects the style of the old silent classics like Chaplin and Keaton and adapts it for modern day audiences. And Roberto Benigni is a first rate clown - a hangdog mixture of Woody Allen and Kramer from 'Seinfeld'. If you were to turn off this movie after the first hour, you would have gotten your money's worth.However, if you stick around for the second part you'll likely want your money back - as well as a full public apology from Benigni for being such a moral retard. For, once he and his son are rounded up by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp, the movie turns into one of the biggest travesties in the history of cinema. Just who was the idiot who allowed Benigni to introduce something as weighty as the Holocaust into this whimsical and paper-thin world? Inflicting Bugs Bunny or Charlie Brown with AIDS would make about as much sense.Now, I've heard this film defended as being a 'fable' - as if to say, 'Well, straight forward realism isn't what Benigni was going for.' Well I'm sorry, but if straight forward realism isn't what you're going for, then you DON'T use the Holocaust as your backdrop; it is too real and horrific an event to yield its place to fables and fairy tales. Once you're a stone's throw away from the ovens, the logic of a cartoon world just does not hold up. And, sadly, it is only by such cartoon logic that we can conceive of Benigni keeping his son so well insulated from the horrors going on all around him. Implausibilities just pile up here like so many dead Jews (you find that phrasing offensive? Welcome to the world of Life Is Beautiful): the opening sequence with the guard, where Benigni pretends to 'translate' his German - wouldn't any of the other inmates have commented upon how illogical his spiel was, and thereby alert the guard that he wasn't being translated properly (and, further, didn't this whole scene play like an egregious 'Hogan's Heroes' rerun? Just what we need, a sitcom set in a concentration camp); and is it logical to assume that the kid would stay so well-hidden in his barracks all day, or that no guard would ever search the top bunks to find him?; how about the supremely idiotic moment when Guido (Benigni's character name) gets on the camp loudspeaker to say hello to his wife? Under normal circumstances, the schmaltz of this scene would merely be laughable, but the context of the Holocaust makes it instead deeply offensive. To which Benigni adds stupidity in the next moment by allowing the kid to get on as well: isn't the whole point to *hide* the kid, so that the guards don't realize he's still alive? Of course, Benigni knows he doesn't have to worry about them finding his son - after all, since he wrote the script, those guards will only do what he tells them to do, logic and history be damned.For that is exactly what Benigni is doing here: he's damning history, showing a cavalier disregard for facts. 'Yes,' I can imagine him saying, 'I know six million were murdered, but I don't like that ending. I'll write my own upbeat version of the truth.' Of course, that's precisely what Guido does with his son: he creates his own version of the truth, lying in order to shield the boy from the true horror of their situation. Ok, forget for a moment the plausibility of keeping up such a charade and instead ask yourself this: Is that such a good idea? I mean, after all, if the kid truly doesn't know the danger he's in, how can he protect himself? This is the same kind of logic that grownups use so frequently to lie to their young kids about death or divorce, or any other similarly weighty topics - almost always to the detriment of the child later in life. So not only is Guido's deceiving of his son not noble or 'touching' - it's actually downright dangerous. Furthermore, even on a purely symbolic level, the notion that innocence could somehow be preserved amidst the horror of the Holocaust is an outright lie, and a truly insidious one. Anyone who's read Elie Wiesel's 'Night,' where he describes his childhood years inside a camp and the bitter toll they took upon his faith and his sense of justice in the world, would understand the true depth of this lie.To sum up, I have to be a little nasty. Normally, I'm a strong believer in 'to each his own,' particularly when it comes to movies. If you like something and I don't, or vice versa, we can argue about it, but ultimately we're each entitled to our opinions. Not here. The subject portrayed is so monumental, and its treatment so facile, that if you like this movie I have to say that there is something seriously wrong with you. Either you're a moral retard like Benigni, or you know nothing about the Holocaust, or you are far too easily manipulated into crying on cue and getting all warm and emotional inside that you lose sight of the depths to which the filmmakers are sinking. I don't know how this movie got such nearly unanimous across-the board support, whereas only a few short years ago Schindler's List opened a large debate concerning the ability of films to accurately portray the Holocaust. Could it be that this film's refusal of an accurate portrayal - in favor of its 'fable' approach - is what makes it so palatable? Are we ready now to sugarcoat the Holocaust, make it less of a 'downer'? Scary thought. Perhaps it's time for Mel Brooks to dust off his 'Springtime for Hitler' musical which seemed so patently absurd thirty years ago; sadly, I could just see it now being the toast of Broadway.

A Clockwork Orange," Stan took a wrong turn here - and just kept going
","'Dr. Strangelove' and '2001:A Space Odyssey' are in my Top 5 movies of all time, so in my book Stanley Kubrick forever has an asterisk next to his name denoting 'genius' (his 'Lolita' was none too shabby, either). But right here, with this movie, is where ol' Stan began - in my mind - to vanish into his own hermetically sealed vault of cinematic pretension and designer, knee-jerk nihilism. The movies he made for the remainder of his life are cold, opaque works that don't engage on any level, save for an appreciation of the technical artistry they demonstrate: meticulously constructed sarcophagi, where lie entombed the spirit of a once-puckish, daring, and wonderfully *alive* filmmaker.At least with `Clockwork' Stan still retained the power to provoke (he lost even that right after this release) - but he goes about it all wrong, and to extremely dubious ends. I should say upfront that I read the book (by Anthony Burgess) first, and it had a profound effect on me. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The first part - which chronicled Alex and the violent, pillaging activities of he and his `droogs' - filled me with such revulsion and hatred, that I took sadistic glee in seeing the `reformed' post-Ludovico Alex get his nasty comeuppance in the second half of the book. However, when the story took its final twist at the end by giving Alex his `freedom' back, I was furious. Here's a guy who (the narrative makes clear) has learned no lessons or morals from his predicament - who feels no remorse, and will doubtless return to a life of `ultraviolence' as soon as he gets the chance; I was rooting for him to remain a robotic pawn of the state. The book's fundamental challenge lies just in this: convincing (or at least presenting powerfully to) the reader that even brutes and reprobates such as Alex deserve the dignity of free will, and that there can be no justification for revoking that. (The challenge is, indeed, open-ended - inasmuch as I'm not entirely convinced; after all, isn't prison a revocation of someone's `free will', too? Isn't *any* form of punishment? But at least the book's presentation makes it an idea worth wrestling with.)Kubrick's mistake, as I see it, is in making Alex such a charming and charismatic figure. In the book he's a single-minded brute; he still is in the movie, but by filtering his thoughts through the purring, dulcet tones of Malcom McDowell, and filming even his most violent and heinous acts with pop-art style brio, Kubrick leaves little doubt about his affection for this monster. Further, he does so within the context of making EVERY OTHER SINGLE CHARACTER in the movie such a caricatured and annoying drone (so much so, in fact, that it is actually *they* who become the monsters - quite a flip).
As such, Kubrick upsets the entire balance of the piece (at least as Burgess envisioned it). We get no sense of Alex's crimes against humanity - because, in fact, there's no `humanity' here: only the kind of ciphers and waxwork grotesqueries that would become Kubrick's definition of `character' for the remainder of his career. Perhaps that's his point, after all (no doubt it is): that, in fact, under a bogus sense of decorum, society consists of nothing but droning, annoying hypocrites, and there's no use in spilling a tear for any single one of them. But when you are watching a woman being violently raped and you are made to feel nothing for her - not to mention her brutalized husband (who gets absolutely savaged by the director later in the film) - then something rather sick and insidious is going on.
Burgess' book was written as a warning against the dangers of social engineering, no matter how well-intentioned. Kubrick's movie plays more as a blatant indictment of humanity as a whole. Its underlying, none-too-subtle message is that in a society so plastic and corroded only violently murderous free spirits like Alex are truly worth anything: he may not be nice, but at least he's not dead inside like every other single person on the planet.Personally, I think the only humanity Kubrick ends up indicting by such an approach is his own. But then that's just me, isn't it.",Null,5,9,12 December 2003
Groundhog Day," The greatest film comedy of all-time
","This is not only the greatest comedy of all time but one of the best films ever, in any genre. What makes it so great, besides a stellar performance by Bill Murray (which is, hands down, his best screen work to date) is how perfectly the script has been worked out, down to the tiniest little details. The premise is a solid one - a man is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he learns how to become a better, less self-centered person. But it could have failed on so many levels: the built-in repetition factor could easily have sunk the film, and a very real danger existed that the situation would simply become as boring and infuriating to the audience as it is to the main character. The filmmakers - director Harold Ramis and his co-writer Danny Rubin, who came up with the original story - find several ingenious ways to ring changes upon the premise, and do a totally convincing job in mapping out the growth and development of the main character. That character is a cruel and shallow Pittsburgh weatherman named Phil Connors who is disgusted to find himself once again in Punxsatawney Pennsylvania to cover the dreaded (to him) groundhog day festival. By being forced to live the day again and again, amongst people he despises, he will have to come to terms with his own shallowness and lack of human connection. The film, then, is his quest for personal redemption and deliverance. If that sounds heavy to you, well . . . it is, sort of. While the film is clearly a comedy (and is very very funny), it does not hesitate to display the horror and desperation of Phil's predicament. By the end, you FEEL for him, and have come to know him, in a way that just would not be possible if his situation was played only for laughs. If ever a movie wrung every last drop of greatness and potential out of its central premise, it is this one. If nothing else, the script should have been up for an Academy Award; it is - hands down - the best comedy script of the 90s.Of course, probably the biggest concern is that the audience will enjoy Phil being a crumb much more than they will watching him become a nice guy, which would pretty much undercut the central theme of the movie. This is where Bill Murray's amazing performance comes in to play, since he's equally entertaining as a good-hearted and reformed man as he is as a jaded cynic. This is no mean accomplishment, and it's absolutely essential for the movie's success: if he came across as too nice, then we wouldn't buy the character's initial misanthropy, making the 'transformation' a foregone conclusion; equally, if his change into a happier, more well-adjusted person wasn't funny and enjoyable in its own right, then we'd walk away thinking 'The movie had a great first hour - then it got boring as he started to change.' Either eventuality would have absolutely killed this picture.
Fortunately, Murray - perhaps unique among screen comics - has always been equally adept at working either side of the sweet / sour divide. He can just as easily be lovable as despicable, and get laughs doing both. I can't really think of any other comic actor who can do this (Robin Williams is always relentlessly cheery; Steve Martin is funniest when he's angriest; Jim Carrey couldn't get laughs by being sweet and sincere if his life depended on it, etc.). Therefore, the movie is unthinkable without him. But it is also an absolute gift to him - no other film he has ever done has allowed him to show this much range as an actor while still letting him play to his strengths. Anyone who witnessed him trying to go dramatic in The Razor's Edge, or to bring off a similar grump-turns-into-a-nice-guy premise in the atrocious Scrooged will know exactly what I mean.To sum up, this is one of the best films ever, and belongs on that short list of works that are truly uplifting and heartwarming - but which EARN it. As 'transformation' movies go, it's right up there with the seasonal classics of Scrooge, the Grinch and George Bailey in 'It's A Wonderful Life' - all without the benefit of the Christmas season for its backdrop. In fact, one of the best things about Groundhog Day is that it might actually start a new trend - showing this film every year on TV in the wastes of February would be a good idea, when we could all really use a good cheering up!",Null,0,0,11 February 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Should have been buried along with Stanley Kubrick
","Some reviewer (I forget now who) once said of Kubrick that 'he wants us to respond not to the story or the characters, but to his artistry.' If that's your bag, there's much in Eyes Wide Shut to respond to: the beautiful precision of the tracking shots, the gorgeous lighting (almost always from a natural source, like candles or Christmas lights), the rich cinematography,. . basically, all the things Kubrick has already been well admired for in the past. But all at the service of what, exactly? The only depth on display in this movie is in the color scheme. The story is incoherent and downright embarrassing, and Cruise is all wrong as the protagonist. Nicolle Kidman fares somewhat better, as she gets some tour-de-force monologues (which she pulls off quite well) and then is pushed aside for most of the picture, where all the slipshod plotting takes place. Actually, 'plotting' is far too generous a term. Things happen - but that's about the only relation this movie has to an actual 'plot.' Even so, I could see myself enjoying it as an elaborate dream in another director's hands - say, Coppola's, or Lars von Trier's, even (maybe especially) Ken Russel's, someone with a more sensuous or enveloping visual style. But Kubrick has always been far too clinical for that - his images, no matter how stunning or well-lit, are always relentlessly flat and literal; they carry no meaning or suggestiveness beyond their rather prosaic surfaces. As such, the 'orgy' scene in this movie (to take just one example) doesn't play like a bizarre hallucination, but rather as documentary footage, which forces you to ask immediately 'Who exactly has orgies like this?!' no doubt breaking the mood Kubrick is at pains to set. In the theater where I saw it, laughter was the overwhelming response to this scene, not enraptured awe.  But at least that scene kept your interest (if only to see how embarrassingly over the edge Kubrick was going to go), which is more than can be said for a whole slew of others, such as the ones between Cruise and two separate prostitutes, the one in the costume shop, and most especially the one at the climax of the movie between Cruise and Sydney Pollack. The flat-footedness of the direction and acting in these scenes is truly astonishing for a mainstream motion picture, not to mention one made by a supposed 'master': moments are drawn out endlessly, pauses exist that you could drive a truck through, and each scene's reason for being is highly suspect. Of course, if you're going to get into reasons for being, you'd pretty much have to throw out this entire movie. Which is exactly what I recommend that you do.I have a special category of film which I describe as ''Neighbors' Bad' - in honor of the 1981 John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd comedy. Briefly put, it is one (quoting from my own IMDb review of that movie) 'whose plot is almost indecipherable, whose events and characterizations are completely random, and again and again frustrates any expectation at arriving at any sort of meaningful conclusion, even a silly one.' Without a doubt, Eyes Wide Shut fits the description to a tee - it is truly Neighbors Bad.",Null,0,1,21 February 2000

The Godfather: Part III," Fully worthy of the Godfather name
","What's the deal with the slagging this film has taken? Ok, so it's not as good as the first one (few films are), but it's a more than worthy wrap-up to the series, teeming with all the elements that make the Godfather saga so engrossing: strong characters, shadowy back-room negotiations, elaborate plotting and double crossing, shocking yet fantastically orchestrated violence and, finally and most memorably, an operatic finale which is a masterpiece of cross-cutting between ritual and acts of murder. If the film sags around the edges, well - that's entirely appropriate too, since Michael Corleone, its lead character, is himself now aging and frail. It is as if each of the Godfather films takes its cue from Michael's metabolism: the first is full of zest and youthful exuberance, the second is cold, hard and opaque, and the third is creaky and totters on the brink of collapse. Many take this as a fault of the film, when really it is the perfect mirror of the soul of Michael himself. As such, the weariness which pervades the entire story is poignant and heartbreaking, not the result of bad filmmaking.The acting is all first rate, as is expected by now in a Godfather film. As Sonny Corleone's bastard son Vincent Mancini, Andy Garcia makes a strong impression and the push-pull between he and Pacino - the young hothead vs. the wisened and calculating veteran - gives the film its edge, and its unique place in the Godfather canon. It is slightly unbelievable that Michael would have no one else to turn over the running of the family to besides Vincent, a tangential relation at best, but since it works dramatically you tend to overlook the flaw in logic. Likewise, the scenes between Michael and Kay carry a special charge; though written near the level of soap opera, the fact that it is actually Pacino and Diane Keaton sitting across from each other, and that we feel we have shared so deeply in their history together, breathes a curious kind of nobility and sadness into them. Like everyone else, I missed Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, but even his absence serves, in an ironic way, to underline the theme of Michael drifting toward the end of his life, losing all his associations along the way; the loneliness and solitariness which enveloped him by the end of the second movie have not gone away, and his attempts to fight against and deny this fact is what gives his character real tragic dimension here.Ok, just a word on Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter Mary. No, she's obviously not a trained actress and her readings are a little flat, but you know what? It doesn't make that much difference. Her character exists more as a symbol to Michael of innocence and incorruptibility than as a true three-dimensional personage. As such, she at least has the right look and feel - I can imagine her as Pacino's daughter in a way I don't think I ever could have bought Winona Ryder (who was originally to play this role). What I'm saying here is that, while she's not great, she does what she needs to do and she in no way sinks the film - if for no other reason than that her screen time isn't large enough to do so. And for those of you who laughed at her in the climactic scene, I can only point out that this is *Pacino's* dramatic moment, not hers; if you can look upon his soul-chilling reaction and still not be moved, then I think there must be something fundamentally dead inside you.All in all, this is a great film, with a plot line that is at times admittedly hard to follow, but not nearly as much as the one in Part II. And this one has a better cast of characters - just think of it, the Corleones getting into business dealings with the Vatican!  The audacity of this storyline alone should make it beloved to all true Godfather fans. And some of the violence here - including the helicopter assault in Atlantic City, the murder of Joey Zasa on the streets of Little Italy, and most notably the new and wildly unexpected use found for a pair of reading glasses - is as brilliant and memorable as anything in the first film, and supersede the second one entirely. In short, Godfather III makes a great wrap up to the entire saga, and earns its full place in the family history; it's no mere footnote, but a great and satisfying film all its own.",8,0,1,11 March 2000
When Harry Met Sally...," Famous romantic comedy
","Can men and women ever be merely friends, without the temptation of sex rearing its ugly head? This is the question that this movie so famously posed - and so glibly answered - almost fifteen years ago. As it follows the progression of Harry and Sally - a pair of charming, if neurotic, Manhattanites - from enemies to confidants to lovers, it seems to smugly relish the fact that it has proven its point: men and women can never just 'be friends' - sex is always the bond that unites them. But the film is so manipulative, so dogged in its pursuit of this goal, that it never appears an alternative position was ever considered. So, as philosophy, chalk When Harry Met Sally up to around zilch.Now, disregard the above paragraph. Because When Harry Met Sally makes up for its slights to credibility and lack of rigorous thought by being easily the funniest movie of its year (1989). This humor flows mainly from the beautifully crafted scenes and dialogue; indeed, each scene is a dialogue set piece (and could be transferred to the stage quite easily - surprising no one's ever done it, actually), which flows with the firm and confident rapidity of a 20th century Shaw or Oscar Wilde. Of course, this approach has its downside, too: mainly that the lead characters seem less and less like real people and more like tools for the brilliant lines and conceits of the screenwriter (Nora Ephron - never better; in fact, never even remotely close ever again). This may have something to do with the film's inability to seem completely real or true to human nature as it actually plays out - but with lines like these, who's complaining?For, what is great about the movie is not its originality (it steals from all over, especially Woody Allen movies, and the few ideas it can truly call its own are, as I've said, not particularly bright or well-thought out), but its ability to hone in on stereotypes of character and situation and offer pithy and hilarious precis of the male-female condition through the witty banter and interaction of its characters. As such, the film is less like a conventional movie and more like a stand-up routine dealing with life and love in the Big City: it is to be judged not by its content, but by the dexterity of its put-ons and one-liners. (It is not surprising, for example, that several of its set-pieces and comic notions were revisited just a few years later, and in much the same manner, on 'Seinfeld'.) In that regard, it succeeds flawlessly.Just think of all the conventions it gets in, and skewers: the one-track mind male (Harry); the 'sensitive' and practical female, repulsed yet intrigued by said male (Sally); the emotionally unsettled mistress playing the field (Carrie Fisher, who keeps an index card file of 'available' men); the live-ins who can't 'commit' (Sally and her ex-boyfriend); women's concern with middle age and their biological clock ('I'm gonna be 40,' weeps Sally. 'When?' asks Harry. 'Someday.'); the male's tendency to skip out after making love; the horror and unpredictability of blind dates; and, in a scene which is almost passe to mention anymore, women's ability to fake orgasm. The way this film jumps from one familiar convention to another would be embarrassing if it weren't for the fact that each one is handled with such economy, humor and grace.Billy Crystal acquits himself well as Harry - predictably, perhaps, as it's a part tailor made for a standup comedian. Still, seeing him in this after years of half-baked movies and fawning Oscar presentations, it's a revelation how glib and unlikable he can allow himself to be . . . and *still* be likable. Yo, Billy, if you're listening out there: try incorporating some of Harry's darker shadings and more egocentric traits into your future roles; it gives you a more complete palette to work from and keeps you from being too generic and schticky. And your charm and humor will always shine through anyway.If Billy needs to edge a little bit closer back to Harry, though, Meg Ryan needs to get Sally completely out of her system. This role, deservedly, made her a star - but she has tried to go back to this particular well once too many times, and it's become way too familiar: you know, the adorable, bright-eyed bit - mentally disheveled, prissy around the edges with just a wisp of klutziness, all topped by that cute, mega-watt smile.  It has become now the 'Meg Ryan' character, but back when Sally came along it was still fresh, and it was tied to a particular personality. Ryan gives Sally a shy-cum-toughness as well as a moody, slightly cynical and self-deprecating wit that is just totally right. She and Crystal play off each other like two old pros, and they weave in and out of some charming and hilarious verbal music. It's funny, but I just recently saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon television marathon of 'Romantic Weepies' - and it struck me as an odd designation, because this movie is anything but a weeper. It takes a clear-eyed, almost cynical view of love and companionship, and creates around it a charming tapestry of bracing wit and crunching dialogue. So save the violins and the handkerchiefs for romantic comedies less sure on their feet - whose deficiency in wit must be made up for by a surfeit of melodrama and manipulation. This movie is manipulative too, of course, but its manipulation is almost beside the point. It's the laughs along the way we remember here, not the big kiss or the grand embrace. That Harry and Sally were 'meant' for each other and that the film 'proves' it is much less important than the fact that Sally does one hell of a great orgasm.Waiter, I'll have what they're having . . .",Null,67,83,26 August 2002
A Hard Day's Night," Now let's get a few things straight. . .
","I am just about the biggest Beatles fan imaginable and so, axiomatically, I enjoy this movie very much. However, I think it's time to put to rest the notion of this being some kind of great film apart from its value as a keyhole onto to the Fabs' heyday. Let's face it, as pure moviemaking, this thing is a bit of a joke. The story, as such, is nonexistent, the pacing is flabby, and the 'Paul's grandfather' subplot (which no one ever seems to mention in appraisals of the movie anymore, despite its taking up of a good deal of film time) is embarrassingly cheesy. On top of all that, the Beatles themselves are simply so hard to *understand* much of the time (Liverpool scouse being a very mumbled and slurred-together dialect) that quite a bit of the so-called sparkling wit just goes over (or under) your head the first three or four times you see it. Someone really should have sat the lads down with some Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello movies to teach them at least the rudiments of enunciation and comic timing.As a story, it's very interesting how the film portrays the Beatles as prisoners of their own fame, with an unmistakable wisp of pathos and frustration which is allowed to undergird all the wildness and comedy. This especially comes through in the sequence where Ringo leaves the band to go 'parading' and enjoy some freedom (an unconscious foreshadowing of future events to boot, as Ringo was the first Beatle to ever 'leave the band' - four years later during the White Album sessions). Yet, the irony is never put forth that the very people who are keeping the Beatles prisoner - their fans - are the ones for whom this movie is made and is being aimed at. A decade later, such a disparity would have forced a punk band such as the Sex Pistols to fire off a massive 'F*** You!' to its audience (and, in fact, one rock star did do just this - in film, no less: Roger Waters during the amazing and squirm-inducing 'In the Flesh' segment of Pink Floyd The Wall, where a concert of mindlessly adoring fans is compared none too subtly with a Nazi rally).I'm not saying, of course, that the Beatles should have come out spitting and gobbing at their fans and tearing apart their image in A Hard Day's Night. This would have been impossible to do in mainstream cinema in 1964, anyway. What I'm saying is that by introducing such a glaring irony and then failing to deal with it in any way, the film asserts itself solidly as a product of its times and nothing more - no great and enduring piece of art, certainly. In some ways, the next year's followup, Help!, was the better film because it did not try to be anything more than a madcap Beatle travelogue (and succeeded admirably, with its pristine color, beautiful locales, and clever comic moments - although its setups do get a bit monotonous after awhile).Of course, A Hard Day's Night *will* endure - simply because THE BEATLES endure, and this gives us the best sustained look at their performing prowess and all-around joie de vivre. The musical sequences in the film are simply glorious, particularly the orgiastic concert at the end, but even more muted moments such as when the Beatles sneak off to a nightclub to dance and intermingle with other youths to the soundtrack of their own songs; the scene provides a wonderful 'you are there' quality to the partying and club-hopping side of Swinging London circa 1964. But a film's overall quality, I say, must be judged by its ability to be a complete and satisfying whole, not just as a vehicle to show off the talents and charm of its central figure or figures (otherwise, by that measure, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective would have to be preserved and championed as one of America's greatest contributions to world cinema).So what am I saying, finally? A Hard Day's Night - if you are a Beatle fan it is essential; see it, enjoy it, revel in their youth and vitality as often and as passionately as you want. Just don't allow your enthusiasm for the group to confuse this with a great film.(btw: If you wish to experience the group's charm and musical euphoria of this time full on, without the intrusions of a tacked on plot or supplementary characters, check out the wonderful documentary 'The Beatles' First U.S. Visit'. Done by the Maysles brothers - the duo behind the Rolling Stones' 'Gimme Shelter' later in the decade - the film captures all the excitement [and footage] of the Beatles' triumphant arrival in America, including all their Ed Sullivan appearances, various backstage reflections and shenanigans, and an extended, supercharged sequence of their concert at Washington Coliseum. For my money, this film is even MORE essential than A Hard Day's Night; it is, quite simply, the best extended visual document of the Beatles that we have.)",Null,15,26,1 December 2000
Raging Bull," I don't get it
","Watching the slow disintegration of a man who's not particularly likable in the first place - what's the point? That the film contains brilliant direction, photography, acting, music, etc. (and it does) doesn't really provide an excuse. With nothing at the core, Raging Bull is just an empty experience. I mean, come on - a boxer who's a violent personality, whoa! What a dramatic surprise that is. Two hours of this stuff is definitely overkill - but even at ninety minutes this would be too long. Hell, even at TEN minutes.",5,13,27,17 February 2000
Bruce Almighty," Carrey that weight
","It would be difficult to find someone who is more in awe of Jim Carrey's talents than I am. If you want to criticize by saying he mugs and overacts, go ahead  you're right!  but he has elevated mugging to such an art form, and within that over-the-top area he applies such a precision and a finely-honed control that he makes it a thing of beauty. Anyone is free not to like him or his movies (and I understand you), but you must  MUST!  acknowledge his prodigious talent. (A good analogy might run thus: I don't particularly care for musicals, or for Gene Kelley in general, yet it simply wouldn't do to deny what an incredible and inventive performer he is.)As such, I've enjoyed all of Carrey's comedies on some level; even when the story or premise is lame, he is never less than riveting and hilarious to watch. So it surprised me somewhat when, very early in Bruce Almighty, I caught myself thinking to myself two distinct thoughts: 1) `Someone else should be playing this role' and 2) `Jim seems really *desperate* up there.'To tackle the second thing first: Carrey desperate. `How can you tell?' a Jim detractor might scoff. `After all, he always runs roughshod over everything in sight, and works desperately to be the life of the party.' True, but up until now he has always tended to play (in his comedies, anyhow) characters that were so over the top, and in movies that were pitched at such a heightened level anyway , that his wildness was not only at home in the material, but completely appropriate. In Bruce, he finally takes on what is essentially an `ordinary guy.' And you know what? Jim just can't do ordinary.He wants to flail, he wants to scream, he wants to bounce off the walls! And as Ace Ventura, or the Mask, or even his so-slimy-he's-sublime lawyer in Liar Liar, we want him to as well. But in this movie, his rubber-faced antics were not endemic to the character, but rather seemed grafted on, in order to give the audience their `silly Jim Carrey' fix. Hence, the seeming desperation: every opportunity was taken to insert familiar schtick, whether appropriate or not (and it usually wasn't), causing it to look  for the first time  like the performer was actually doing his best *impersonation* of Jim Carrey, rather than having it all flow naturally from the situations and the character.And herein we come up against the (current) limitations of Jim Carrey as a performer. He does not play well with others. In no movie I have ever seen of his does he do an even adequate job of being an ensemble player. The other actors exist for him simply as props, not as people to play off of or draw inspiration from (yes, even in his so-called `dramatic' films  which is why none of them were any good, save for The Truman Show, which had masterful directing and an indestructible premise going for it). That being the case, he cannot simply settle back into a character and take part in the ebb and flow of a scene  he perpetually feels a need to `make something happen' and so strains, even against the grain, to be big, brassy and memorable. And as I've said  this is no crime when applied to the type of human cartoons he has heretofore played. But when it's done in the service of someone who's supposed to come across (at least nominally) as a real person, it feels fraudulent in the worst kind of way.I would have enjoyed this movie more (for, it does have a good premise and some clever bits) had the lead character been played by someone like Ben Stiller or Matthew Perry (on the young side) or, say, Tim Allen or Bill Murray (on the older side) - someone who can balance humorous riffs against a capacity for both subtlety and self-deprecation. (Actually, it would have been most perfect for the 80s version of Tom Hanks, who was capable of infusing yuppie smarm into a character, yet mixing in just enough of an essential sweetness to keep him sympathetic. And, of course, hilarious. Will we ever see that Tom again?)Morgan Freeman as God, though, is a hoot. Yeah, I could really get *BEHIND* a Heaven that had him in charge! In the scenes with him and Carrey, he just wipes the floor with ol' Jim; it's like he's giving an object lesson to the young whippersnapper in how you get laughs while remaining composed, and not relinquishing your essential humanity (or, in this case, divinity).I don't know, man. If I were giving career advice to Jim Carrey, I'd tell him to either play to his strengths by sticking with the loony, larger-than-life roles  or, if he really wants to stretch and be serious (even if it be `serious comedy' such as this), then he needs to settle down and learn how to truly interact with other people. Far be it from me to clip his wings  I love him in the stratosphere!  but if he's determined to expand his repertoire, then he needs to develop a new set of skills. Enough awkward hybrids like Bruce Almighty, and he'll be yesterday's news.",Null,0,0,8 June 2003
Rear Window," Hands down, Hitchcock's greatest film
","You could say that Psycho is more shocking, Vertigo more psychologically probing, and North by Northwest more sheer fun - but no other single Hitchcock film fires successfully on so many cylinders all at once. Every aspect of the director's considerable artistry is on view here - his humor, his tight plot construction, his brilliant set design, his visual ingenuity, the sexy and sophisticated interplay between his two leads - each honed and refined to perfection. Everything works in this film, and works brilliantly. The physical limitations of the plot - i.e. that it all takes place on one set - could have seriously undermined the film by allowing it to become too static, but instead Hitchcock actually makes the resulting claustrophobia work to great effect; it all builds to a climactic scene that is as pulse-poundingly suspenseful as anything ever committed to film. There are not many movies which could be described as 'perfect' - even in the best of them, there's usually at least one or two minor flaws somewhere - but Rear Window definitely earns that distinction. If you have not yet seen it, I envy you the experience you are going to have once you finally do.",10,0,2,7 February 2000
The Truman Show," One of the films for which the Nineties will be remembered
","I believe that, in the future, when the 90s are looked back upon, The Truman Show will be seen as one of its truly representative films, not only for its high quality but for its unerring evocation of one of the most prominent themes of our times: the out of control nature of the media, and its invasion of our personal lives. Think about how many movies over this past decade have used this theme as a jumping off point: Natural Born Killers, Mad City, Wag the Dog, To Die For, The Cable Guy, Quiz Show, EdTv, . . I could go on, but you get the idea. The Truman Show towers over all these films because instead of being a polemic, it casts its story in the form of a fable; you're free to buy what's happening as 'real' or simply metaphorical, and the story works equally well either way. Because there's no direct reference to any current media images (no MTV or CNN or Jay Leno monologues about Truman and his life) the story exists outside of time - it could take place either in the future, a fictionalized present, or an imagined past: it's never made clear and it doesn't matter. By not trying to be up to the minute, The Truman Show succeeds in being timeless.However, that is only one of its many successes. The story manages to be involving on the levels of drama and comedy simultaneously. Truman's dilemma is always achingly real to him, and yet as spectators we can't help but see how funny are the preposterous ways in which the situation is kept going (the posters in the travel agency, for example, or the teacher telling Truman 'You're too late, everything's been discovered already.'). To be sure, it's a sinister humor, one that chills at the same time it amuses. It reminded me at times of the coldness and bemused misanthropy pervading such Kubrick films as Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, and 2001. And yet, amazingly, at the same time it also had - through Truman - a hopefulness and a wonderment that was reminiscent of the very best of Spielberg. Now, I can't think of two directors who are more different from one another, and by evoking both, the film shows an almost unparalleled range and vision.I'd like to say Jim Carrey was a surprise here, but in fact he wasn't, not to me anyway; from the time I saw him in The Mask (in his Stanley Ipkiss scenes) I always suspected he had a role like this in him. He's effective and believable in a more toned-down part, although I believe that the role is such a gem - and so assured of audience sympathy - that nearly any actor could have played it and been equally effective. The true star here is the director, Peter Weir, who after this and Fearless must now be considered in the genius category. Not only does he create a compelling and totally believable world, but he uses camera angles in a sly and totally original way to subtly indicate to the audience the depth of surveillance involved in Truman's world. And he comes up with a cornucopia of unforgettable images, all slightly surreal and menacing, while at the same time containing a strange and gripping beauty: the 'sunset' scene where the sun and moon hang next to each other in the sky; the nighttime image of all the actors on the set, arm in arm, searching for Truman with guard dogs and flashlights (definite shades of Invasion of the Body Snatchers); the final scene of Truman, at the 'ends of the earth' seemingly 'walking on the water' (an image Magritte or Dali would have been proud to have painted); and, perhaps most memorably, the supremely surprising yet totally brilliant moment when the moon metamorphisizes  into a giant searchlight. Even out of context, these scenes have a stunning visual power, and add immensely to the film's overall subject and theme.But even if you're not in the mood for a serious message, or a meditation upon the popular media and its role in our lives, it's possible to enjoy The Truman Show on just the most basic level of an interesting story, well told. It's a 'quest' film, but because of the way it's set up and its sly humor, it can also be enjoyed as a *parody* of a quest film (after all, it's 'only' a TV show). Its 'major themes' can be taken as a parody of a movie that would like to have 'major themes.' The film achieves this dual effect (significant and yet not significant) because of the way it refracts everything through the television lens - which, as we all know, trivializes every subject it encounters: yes, even a man's quest to discover the meaning of his life and start entirely anew. The very final shot of the movie, which some people complain is too glib and abrupt, is actually perfect because it emphasizes this point with such deadly satirical force.The Truman Show: entertaining, thought provoking, eerie, sad, triumphant - just about the most complete movie experience you could ever have. Definitely one of the classics, not only of our time, but of ALL time.",10,0,0,19 February 2000
Donnie Darko," The film that made me wish Spielberg would go back to the suburbs . . .
","The suburbs were the setting for three of Steven Spielberg's most popular achievements - 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial' and 'Poltergeist' - and I don't think it's exactly coincidence. As a storyteller, Spielberg drew strength and imagination from his suburban setting, and he was a wry and fair chronicler of it. He knew these people and their environs; he could perceive the inherent limitations, but he also believed in the fundamental decency of most of its denizens, and also recognized what a powerful base of operations the suburban hearthside could be (even one that was, as in 'E.T.' somewhat less than perfect). How different from every other single movie maker who delves into suburbia. From 'American Beauty' to 'Edward Scissorhands' , from David Lynch's twisted tales of paranoia to the gothic surrealism of 'Donnie Darko', the suburbs are continually a place of danger and trash - a place where the soul is crushed and life is perpetually dark and soulless (underneath of course the placid and reassuring surface). It's time, I think, to send a little letter to Hollywood: 'Enough with this stuff already!' Either find a new take on the subject, or at least lighten up and let some joy into the proceedings. The suburbs don't *all* suck, after all.At first, this film looked like it might be going in that benevolent direction. It did a nice job painting a fairly normal suburban family and environment without pencilling in either too much plasticity (Mary McDonnell's mother veers in that direction, but her portrayal keeps pulling back from matriarchal harpy into a more rounded, human performance) or moodiness. But this idyll breaks down rather quickly, and we're once again into the Suburbs As Hell (teenage angst sub-genre). And you know what? Once you've been down that road a couple dozen times, there's really not too much more to say (or see).So Richard Kelly, the writer and director, attempts to sustain our interest with a plot that, like 'the Sixth Sense', infuses creepiness and notions of horror and/or insanity before resolving all with a 'surprise' ending that - supposedly - sheds new light upon all that has gone before (and is meant the make the audience say, 'Aw - coooooooool, man!'). As you can no doubt tell, I don't think much of the device, or of the movie, and here's why:It makes no sense! String it all together, work it out backwards and forwards, and the film still has too many loose ends, too many things that just do not cohere. One could possibly make a plea for relativism, or ambiguity, but even allowing for that the film really doesn't hold together. For example, much is made of the firing of the English teacher played by Drew Barrymore; in the principal's office when it happens, she breaks down and bemoans anyone ever 'reaching' the kids. But from what we've seen of her in class, she clearly maligns her students and acts like a supreme bitch, so why should we care. If she was onscreen for more than five minutes it might make sense; instead, it's just bad writing. Yet another of Donnie's teachers is held up as the shrewish, self-righteous type who sees things in utter black and white terms; we're not meant to like her, and we don't - but to what ultimate effect? A motivational speaker in the film is eventually revealed as someone with a dark secret, but that too is passed over and not really dealt with in any but the most cosmetic way.  Amidst all this, Donnie Darko seems to be going quietly insane.All of this might have some sort of point, in a better movie. If I had to guess, that point would be: the school Administration dispenses soul-crushing pablum, like so much mental novocaine. Is this what's eating Donnie throughout the movie? It's hard to say, since the filmmaker decides he doesn't want to deal with any of it head-on, but rather plays around on an arty concept of the world being refracted into all sorts of weird shapes through Donnie's peculiar 'condition' (the exact nature of which is not revealed until the end - if there, even!). Problem is, as he plays around with the 'freakiness' of what Donnie is going through, he loses sight of how to portray good old fashioned reality (exaggerations and caricatures abound), leaving the audience adrift on a sea of madness on the one hand, and cartoonishness on the other. Not a pleasant dichotomy.
Once the movie finally reveals its hand, a new spin is put on things, of course. But, reflecting upon everything which went before in the wake of the final twist, I could see no reason for the tone the director took, nor could I truly see any kind of resolution. My fear is that the director *thinks* he's made sense of things at the eleventh hour . . . but in point of fact, he's cleared up nothing. It's possible to muse that the film is wanting to be some kind of Generation Y version of 'It's A Wonderful Life,' but nothing of any import really happens or is revealed, so even that association is bogus.So many ideas in this movie. So many ideas that were almost good. There isn't a good movie inside this mess, trying to get out, but there could have been. Stylistically, at least, it was very intriguing and well handled - Kelly is a natural director, with an imaginative eye for *shooting* and *displaying* the suburban landscape (almost as good as Spielberg).  But the guy clearly needs to hire a writer next time. And if he's trying to make science fiction (which is what this film seems to be leaning toward), a science fiction writer wouldn't hurt.Which reminds me: hey, Steven, you still available?! Come on back from your 21st century musings - the suburbs could really use you again!",Null,1,2,26 August 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Ford and Connery are outstanding together
","I remember when I saw the previews for this movie I was not encouraged: seeing Harrison Ford and Sean Connery as Father and Son bickering like a standup comedy duo in the midst of dangerous situations did not look like a very good idea to me - it seemed too 'cute'  for the normally gritty Indiana Jones series.  Well, how wrong I was.  Last Crusade is a GREAT movie! I go back and forth in my mind whether this or Raiders is the best of the series. I'd probably have to give Raiders the edge, just for the originality and the action sequences are slightly better, have more punch. But by even forcing me into a comparison, Last Crusade shows the kind of staying power it has. (Just to put my biases right on the table, I thought Temple of Doom was not only the weakest in the series but one of the worst movies ever made - it shares a place on the Lucas/Spielberg  scrap heap along side such stinkers as 1941 and Howard the Duck.)And what makes this film so great IS the relationship between Ford and Connery as father and son. Without that relationship at the center, then yes, this movie would have played too much like a slavish imitation of Raiders. It otherwise has all the same elements: Nazis, quest for Biblical artifact, Sallah and Brody, an Indy fight/chase on a moving vehicle (a truck in Raiders, a tank in Last Crusade), climactic pseudo-religious 'power of God' sequence, etc. But the presence of Connery, and his interaction with Ford throughout, just changes the entire complexion of the movie. It becomes less about the action (though certainly not skimping on it) and more about Indy's attempts to please his father and build a relationship with him. This may seem, on the surface of it, too precious or 'touchy-feely' a concept; all I can say is, you need to see the way Ford and Connery handle it. Each performs with subtlety and gruff good humor, not allowing their encounters to sink in dross or sentiment; but equally, not simply tossing them off or treating the whole thing like a joke. Each of them finds an absolutely perfect balance. Ford is especially touching in the way he shows us Indy's barely repressed hostility toward his father, yet at the same time the aching need he has to be validated in his father's eyes - all without once begging for audience sympathy, or losing the sly humor and sense of fun which made us all love Indiana Jones in the first place. In the end, and primarily through the talents of Ford and Connery, the film achieves a poignance which I never would have believed possible - or even advisable - for such a comic book styled action movie.Unlike many others, I also enjoyed the romantic interest here, Dr. Elsa Schneider, played by Allison Doody.  Though certainly not as memorable a character as Karen Allen's Marion in Raiders, she was worlds better than Kate Capshaw in TOD and was ten times as sexy as either one of them. Also, without giving anything away, I like the way the filmmakers worked her character into the story -  she becomes a prime mover of the plot in a way that neither of the other two women were.",9,0,0,5 February 2000
The Godfather," Movies just don't get any better than this
","What can I say that hasn't already been said a million times. This is one of those movies that just holds you in thrall from beginning to end, with no let up in interest or involvement - an amazing feat under any circumstance but almost unheard of for a three-hour movie! As such, it's interesting to compare this with more recent epic-length films of today. A couple years ago, on its 25th anniversary re-release I saw this in the theater on the same day I saw 'The English Patient'. The difference in the two films was just amazing. The English Patient wasn't bad or anything, it's just that it was way too long for the story it told; a good 90 minute-to-2 hour premise was padded out with gorgeous but pointless scenery, an unnecessary subplot, and a shooting and acting style which emphasized dragging things out just for their own sake. The Godfather, by comparison, crams every single minute of its running time with richness, characterization, intrigue, etc. - so much so that, for me, the film actually seems SHORTER than its running time would lead you to believe. There's so many movies that could learn from this - movies that want to be epic length to inflate the importance of their subjects, but just arent' interesting enough to hold us for that long. Many films are guilty here, from Titanic to The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Green Mile - even such 'great' films as Lawrence of Arabia and (yes) Shindler's List use their lengths more as endurance tests (i.e. if you can't stay interested through the whole thing than you must be somehow boorish or unfeeling) and as proofs that the directors just became so enamored of their subjects that they couldn't bear to take anything out than as necessary for the telling of their stories. Sadly, I must say that, in my opinion, even The Godfather Part II falls victim to this tendancy - definitely one of the most overrated and unnecessary sequels of all time.But if you want to see the Corleones (and Francis Ford Coppola) when they were all at the top of their game and everything was just cooking, go back and watch this movie. Even after all the imitations, the rip-offs, the parodies and the cultural appropriations of lines like 'Make him an offer he can't refuse' and 'He sleeps with the fishes' to the point where the movie sometimes seems as entrenched (and as tired) as cliches like 'Mom, God and apple pie' --- once you start watching all of that stuff flies out the window and you're amazed to learn that, wonderfully, this film has lost none of its edge or entertainment value in the nearly thirty years of its existence.(BTW Don't anyone get the idea that I am against the concept of long movies - some of my all time favorites besides The Godfather are Apocalypse Now, 2001:A Space Odyssey, The Deer Hunter, and Oliver Stone's Nixon.  It's just that, I believe, a film really has to justify that running time, because it so opens the door to pretension and indulgence.)",10,1,4,1 February 2000
