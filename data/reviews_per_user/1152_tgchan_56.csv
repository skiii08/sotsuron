The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," tgchan says YES / www.tgchan.pl
","6.8 from 10267,241 users. Well, to be honest, I don't even remember what was the last thing in the previous part. I just hope it will be a decent film, that's all.6 minutes - and I have no idea what is going on... Not remembering where the last part left off, might be the reason 31 minutes - I still have no idea what is going on, but it is enjoyable to watch even so 53 minutes - this film is the best example of how propaganda works. I also cannot say that I am not enjoying it, it's pretty nice 1h 15 minutes - the real action begins now, and its good. The sense of terror and fear of war is shown really well Heh... It was really okay, but I hate the idea that it is so closely tied up with the other parts. It feels like a serial which has got a new episode every year. There is also almost nothing happening and I would never watch it again... Yet, it was quite interesting. Weird.tgchan's rating: 5.5 /10",6,0,3,3 January 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," tgchan says YES~!! / tgchan.pl
","7.4 /10 from 88,654 users. I really don't care about ratings of this one because I loved Cloverfield (2008) so much, I can't even express it. I just hope I will love it the same or even more.6 minutes – interesting start 22 minutes – do you like post-apocalyptic stuff? You will love this, even though there are no sceneries of it 27 minutes – it reminds me more of Saw (2004) than Cloverfield (2008) 42 minutes – holy FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 54 minutes – refreshing 1h 15minutes – totally unexpected~!! 1h 33 minutes – weird as hell with so many questions unanswered~! grrrMeh not worth the Cloverfield's (2008) name, but it was okay.tgchan's rating: 6.5 /10",7,2,4,11 June 2016
The Equalizer," tgchan says YES / www.tgchan.pl
","I am really excited about this one! Training Day (2001) is one of my favourite movies of all time and The Equalizer (2014) is made by the same director! I just wish David Ayer would have joined this party along with Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington... he's a great writer. Let's not hope for the worst! It might be still very good... and I honestly hope so... Let's go!25 minutes - nothing really worth mentioning, nice cityscapes, the story doesn't really bore you and you still wait for a big boom to happen any minute. The only think I don't like is the weak screenplay... it seems like it is going to be another type of movie where a super tough guy saves the girl because someone hits her etc bla bla bla... This is why I wish David Ayer would have written the story instead...33 minutes - holy mother of god... Now that was something worth to see! A little bit overdone but still nice and good looking high octane action 45 minutes - the story is cheesy and there are plenty of situations over which you cringe... but... the action is good and it kind of equals things out 57 minutes - OK it starts to be ridiculous and stupid... do you really will sacrifice decent movie just to pack more action in it Mr Director...? Even Spider-Man and Super-Man together didn't have so many opportunities to help the innocent...1h 8minutes - haha now I even me along with the bad guys want to know, who the hell is this guy!? 1h 10min - Jesus Christ... I can't believe what I am seeing... it can't be so retarded... it just can't...1h 11min - hah! +1 for you Mr Director! That was nice... I almost lost the hope there for a moment 1h 50min - pathetic... with every minute it's getting worse and worse...A perfect example of what happens when a good writer is not there to make a proper story... The movies is empty, full of action without any common sense, logic and purpose...tgchan's rating: 5/10",5,2,4,13 January 2015

Let's find out what people might not like about it.17 minutes - so far it is OK, I don't like fake Russian accent though. I still don't know what is the story, it seems random and without any particular point 18 minutes - the music is so sad and depressing, I want to hang myself... The brutality of people who have slightly more power over others, is also very convincing and real 26 minutes - finally, I can assume what it will be about, and it's getting interesting 37 minutes - wow... what a terrible times... You never knew, when you were followed, observed or being denounced to... the government at its worst~! 49 minutes - it gets better and better with time, and it definitely keeps you entertained 1h 7minutes - the story has so many levels, and they are all brutal... Nice, that it all makes sense after a while 1h 19minutes - holy cannoli~! This scene was creepy and disturbing as f... This film is a mix of The Lives of Others (2006), From Hell (2001) and something else, but I cannot pinpoint it at the moment 1h 27minutes - amazing story, original setting, solid acting and a proper authentic dark atmosphere of those times. Just give it a time, you will not be disappointed~! 1h 42minutes - it gets darker and better with every minute 2h 6minutes - dark and gloomy to the very end of it I liked the ending, It was a nice counterweight to everything I have witnessed during this film.

Now that will justify everything that he's going to make to the bad guys 26 minutes- now that's how you build up the tension and atmosphere, amazing work!!! I want see more!29 minutes – nice action ruined by CGI blood for F sake why oh why they can't stick to the 90's blood effects They were realistic and looked amazing and this craps is plain rubbish 33 minutes – the film has a big BAD-ASS, written all over it! Great cast (Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Alfie Allen), music, story, action and a bad CGI blood 52 minutes – an amazing mixture of Equilibrium (2002), Léon (1994) and Assassins (1995) and all this with Keanu Reeves! 1h minutes – first lame scene but it was a fight vs a girl, those are always lame1h 13minues – the action sure as hell looks amazing and there is one after another, all the time WTF with the ending!? Just wtf It was a direct insult from a director because you can't call it anything elseNice action film ruined by a terrible ending there is also no story whatsoever.

Please don't let it be bad... please...22 minutes - nothing really worth mentioning. I love how they all look tired, devastated mentally and overall scenery is very atmospheric. I really love everything that's connected with WW2 so it's quite easy to satisfy me 33 minutes - the action looks really nice but the music feels off and it spoils the mood... god damn it! 44 minutes - the movie is empty... no story whatsoever... just a mix of a random events thrown together... I was really hoping for something more from David Ayer...1h 19 miniutes - damn those tanks looks awesome! Even without any story it's a pleasure to watch it 1h 31 minutes - I can't tell if it's good or bad... The action is good, acting as well and the lack of story doesn't really bother me since the atmosphere of WW2 gives me what I want 1h 44 minutes - retarded... really... I understand that's a tank but it would never win against 50+ soldiers in close distance... but yea... just run there in front of a cannon and machine guns...I would rate it one mark up if not for the final fight which was unrealistic and overdone... The real battle probably wouldn't even last 5 minutes...

It was a decent film, I really want to see the sequel which is coming out this year: Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015).

Let's see to a what degree.7 minutes - so far boxing looks really like a genuine boxing, unlike in Southpaw (2015) where you could easily notice something is off about it9 minutes - quite surprising beginning. Not something you see a lot in that kind of films. I'm glad they did not follow the routine here 25 minutes - very enjoyable with unique take on the well known genre 51 minutes - a dream story for every up-and-coming boxer 56 minutes - it's really funny where it should be as well 1h 33 minutes - and it manages to step at even higher level. A really nice story! 1h 35 minutes - just like in Southpaw (2015), there is more focus on the life outside of the ring. There is more training and preparing here though. It really fires you up~! 1h 51 minutes - so far, the final fight looks quite overblown1h 53 minutes - and there goes realistic looking fight, right out of the window...

","8.0 /10 from 182,943 users. It is hard not to be excited about new Quentin Tarantino's film and looking at such rating, makes you wonder, if it is really that good. Let's go! 9 minutes - definitely a slow start. I love the idea that Quentin Tarantino shot the entire film with some vintage camera, I love that kind of things.16 minutes - still slow, but bloody entertaining (literally) 30 minutes - Tarantino and his special way of putting a bunch of amazing people in a very small and tight place, marvellous~! 37 minutes - the humour in it alone, is worth every second of anyone's time 38 minutes - work of art... you can watch those scenes and listen to dialogues over and over and they never get boring 1h 16 minutes - except for the fine sceneries, dialogues, atmosphere, costumes, acting, humour etc. nothing really happened yet, no action at all 1h 26 minutes - this should be a play in some most prestigious theatre in the world. Yes, it's that good and it would fit there perfectly! 1h 45 minutes - Tarantino at his finest... Bloody hell! 1h 59 minutes - incredible, slow but incredible2h 11 minutes - one of the sexiest gun shot scenes I have ever seen 2h 28 minutes - what a story... yet another Tarantino's simple tale told in the most sophisticated and on the highest level of art way... Remarkable~! 2h 35 minutes - I can't believe is still getting better and better... not after all this... SICK~!! What a f***ing ride~!! Slow until the very end of it, but boring?

I hope the score is significantly underrated and I will have a blast with this one.9 minutes - so far, it doesn't do anything different than any other mob film 33 minutes - I can't get enough of the ugliness of Johnny Depp's character... it is beyond fugly~! 1h 11 minutes - definitely interesting to watch, many things happen and the story is being told in a nice way 1h 27 minutes - the level of the creepiness.... over 9000! The things that they have done with Johnny Depp's image is just unbelievable... Whatever there was left of him... he finished it off with his acting 1h 36 minutes - the line of the entertainment and excitement is rather flat, there are no ups and downs in this film, but... it is rather good, if the line started at high position from the start, isn't it? tgchan's rating: 7.5 /10",7,1,1,6 February 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," good for watching while eating
","It was an OK movie. OK if you knew what to expect from the movie and you got it. The only things I was hoping for were: nice action with good special effects and the movie delivered both of them on really high level. Fighting was really nicely done. I really enjoyed looking how bad guys were flying away after front kicks from Cap Murica. None CA fight scenes were just normal, usual stuff nothing fancy Were they boring? Really hard to tell but you had this weird feeling that you have seen a lot of that already in your lifetime.I am not going to say anything about acting as I don't know these actors good enough and probably have seen them only in very similar or same kind of movies.Movie served me well for something to look at while I was enjoying my frequent meals.There is one more thing if we have already mentioned the food I may as well add that there is so much cheese in this movie that you should be able to fix a nice large pepperoni for your family if you bring some pizza cake along ^_-tgchan's rating 6/10 http://tgchan.wordpress.com/",6,0,1,11 August 2014

","I don't think anyone needs any explanation who Christopher Nolan is. As much as I love and appreciate his films, I am little bit worried that this one may be slow and boring.

Let's see if it is as good as people rate it: Ratings: 8.8/10 from 502,646 users.20 minutes - I am so confused... I like it because it's interesting, mysterious, atmospheric and all, but I have no idea what is happening and what had happened with the world before...30 minutes - the story is really absorbing but it is so retarded at the same time... Coincidence huh... oh well... I'll just have to turn a blind eye to this and see what's next 42 minutes - my emotions scattered all over the place... Nice one Mr Nolan, truly nice one...45 minutes - the music!!! 1h 6minutes - I don't want to stop until I finish it in one go! So much curiosity ! 1h 10minutes - I want to see more new weird planets!!! 1h 19minutes - story, action, music, acting... I am speechless... I should have known better that Christopher Nolan can deliver! I am in tears and I want to rate it already 10/10 but I will wait until the end, just for the formality 2h 29minutes - Inception (2010) was only a warm up for your brain to understand this film What a ride... Damn... I don't know what to write... This film is so much. Hahah now I am laughing at what I have written @ 30 minutes... If you will watch it, you will understand why it makes me giggle. It wasn't a retarded coincidence, it was Nolan's perfection of story telling...

It started with a little tease of action and then, plenty of before army background story; who he was, who he is etc.27 minutes - we're back in action BUT! it looks like they are using CGI blood effects!!! It looks awful! 48 minutes - omfg... they really do use CGI blood... PATHETIC! + I think, I know what will happen later on or at the end of the film, let's see if I can predict it 57 minutes - American solider + family problems... typical drama...1h 46minutes - the action is really nice but CGI effects (they are good but still... where the hell are those amazing special effects from 90's?! Am I the only one who miss them?) + soldiers don't even break sweat! just meh... I could find something similar on youtube 1h1h 55minutes - yea yea yea... war veterans coming home and they are disconnected, full of mental problems etc. well I don't give a crap! Nobody forced them to go there in the first place! 2h 4minutes - holy F!!! I did not know about it... Damn... That's harsh...Bradley Cooper was really great!

They are very well made, but for somehow who knows thing or two, they feel unnaturalIt must be really hard to make a good film about boxing, but it is definitely one of them. Even though, there were some bouts shown, this film is more about everything outside of a ring. Jake Gyllenhaal was great as usual, and it was nice to see Forest Whitaker too.EDIT: I have just noticed that the writer of the story is none other than Kurt Sutter, the man who created Sons of Anarchy Do I have to say anything more? :)tgchan's rating: 7.5 /10",8,2,2,11 October 2015

I don't believe I have to mention that the special effects are top notch, right? >:D 20 minutes - I am already deep in love with the movie!!! Amazing cast! Amazing story zomfg can't wait to see more! 45minute - O M F G I am crushed how amazing this movie is!!! and it's funny too!!! Like really funny! and to think... I am saying all this not being an X-men fan at all :)Somewhere in a middle it feels like the movie slows down a little but it is coming back to its original pace after a while.Annnnnnnnnnnnd it is over. I have finished watching it... yep it steps down a little from the point I have mentioned above. The first half was just simply one of the best things I have seen in a long time, the second part is not bad but you can feel a significant difference. The whole movie is still an amazing thing to watch. Actually it made me want to re-watch some of the older X-men movies.Now it is a little tricky to rate it... as the first part of the movie was 11/10 and the second something like 7.5/10... but my final score is...(oh snap! just as I was writing this, the end credits were rolling down and guess what!? There is a short scene at the end of the them !~!! make sure you don't miss it!)tgchan's rating: 8.5/10",9,4,6,3 October 2014

I normally don't do any reviews of the films I have seen before, but... it might have been easily 15+ years since I have watched this one, I don't remember much from it. Many say, it's like Top Gun (1986) but with cars, and I think this is how I remember it, but is it any good and worth our time? Let's find out. ( Note, that I might be a little biased, since I have started racing ovals myself recently (iRacing). I will still try my best and stay neutral about it. )2 minutes - oh god... it's gonna be tough to stay objective with this one. They show me a track and cars and I already love it lol... Or maybe it's the charm of the 90's with a nice music?7 minutes - it's so god damn cheesy and clichÃ©... but I love it. Actually, it doesn't look so bad at all26 minutes - the music is great and it feels exactly like in Top Gun (1986) ...Oh... maybe it's because he was a director of it too... Forgive my ignorance, I didn't check it before53 minutes - once the film moves away from a track... let's just say, it doesn't get better...1h 18minutes - I like the story, I really doI am not going to lie... I enjoyed it. It is a decent film, and if you like racing, you should like this one as well.tgchan's rating: 6 /10",6,1,2,19 September 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," tgchan says YES!
","www.tgchan.pl 'One of the best emotional roller-coasters you will ever find in movies...' -thchanI am a bout 15min from the end of the movie and I had to stop for a while because it was too much.I don't even recall when was the last time I have seen such a good movie... not to mention genre alone of it. ( The Notebook (2004) ) Normally I don't write anything about acting if I have not seen at least a couple of very different movies with the given actor, but I have to know... The acting is so good that you can't omit it without noticing. Shailene Woodley (the girl) is so cute, adorable, you want to hug her and fell in love with her right away! Everything she does feels extremely real and loaded with honest emotions. Ansel Elgort (the boy) is the exact copy but in a male version. These two will take you for a ride about life like you have never seen before... Better prepare lots of tissues because this movie will squeeze every last drop of your tears, both... from joy and unhappiness... . The story is amazing, the actors are great and the music is a beautiful, juicy, cherry on top of it all. I can't stress enough how much I love and recommend this movie... Sometimes I had this weird feeling that it is all too beautiful to be true bla bla bla but, you forget about it really quickly when the current of the great story carries you off.The movie is forcing you to think about lots of things... especially about appreciating what you have got... and teaching you to attain the best of it.'The Fault in Our Stars' is the kind of movie you can watch with everyone. It is perfect to watch: with your girlfriend, wife, family etc.There is one thing about it though, watch it only with someone with whom you don't mind seeing you crying, otherwise you might go to a toilet awfully a lot... if you know what I mean...'If you want the rainbow, you have to deal with the rain.' - Gustgchan's rating: 9.5 /10",9,0,1,6 September 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," tgchan says YES!
","www.tgchan.pl Yes, yes and yes... this is one of these very arty and weird kind of movies. 30minutes has passed since I have started it. So far I am little confused what's going on but I can already see high quality of the movie. Every camera angle is very well thought, shots are beautiful and you want to pause every one of them just to enjoy the given place. Music is very well synchronized and fitted pleasantly with the action going on the screen. 'The best music in a movie is the one you can't hear without thinking about it.', and it surly is the case in that movie. At first it was a little boring but the action has already started now and I feel sucked in considerably. I am eager to see what will happen next and I want to absorb this weird aura of artistry more and more.I really liked seeing lots of well known actors scattered all over the movie: Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Owen Wilson and probably few more. Every person in the movie is very well created and colourful character, with a little note of grotesque.You'll have many occasions to laugh because of over-saturated scenarios which are great! It sometimes feels almost like you are watching a cartoon (in a good sense of its meaning, of course).This and my other mini reviews are written in few parts. The first part, I write after few minutes of the movie (first impression), the second one somewhere in a middle of it, and the third and last one, right after I finish the whole thing.What an amazing way to tell a story about the hotel... What an exceptional way to show simple things in colourful light... You can feel pure art touch in every part of the movie! This movie is not about the story but all about showing how things are done by a true artist!tgchan's rating 8/10",8,0,2,8 September 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," tgchan says YES!! / www.tgchan.pl
","OK... So I have recently seen Planet of the Apes (2001) and it was meh... I knew the risk of watching it because of a pretty accurate IMDb score. I still wanted to see it before the newer movies from the ' ... Apes ' series. Now it's time for this one and it has got a whooping rating of 7.6 ! Let's see if the IMDb score will be as accurate as before... I honestly hope so! 7 minutes - already so much happening, feels great! 15 minutes - omg I have a work to do but the movie sucked me in so much already! I can't stop watching it! 20 minutes - hm it looks like they have 'nuked' every ape with CGI so the real one wouldn't stand out from the rest... If the movie will stay as good as it is so far, I can live with that... even though I hate CGI 25 minutes - this ape has got better moves than the Spider-Man! 32 minutes - not a second wasted, it's so good! I really didn't want to watch it after seeing Planet of the Apes (2001) and now I can't stop! 1h 13minutes - !!! How is it even possible that this movie is so good!?!!?!? 1h 34 minutes - no please no!!! Don't do it! Don't ruin something that has been so perfect! WTF with the lame speech!? OK, thankfully the lame part was only two sentence long :) I don't know what to think now.... The whole movie was amazing but the ending left me hungry for more! I have checked the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) but it is made by a different director... The score is even better than for this one though!

I would rather watch something more energetic but, judging by the high rating of this one, it should entertain me enough. Let's find out! EDIT: Oh David Fincher is the director now I know why do people love it. He made one of the best films I have ever seen: The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999).9 minutes – it's good, not super good just good, but you can feel the greatness coming out of it and only expect better and better things to come with time 12 minutes – the music is good! 56 minutes – oh my F god! You wouldn't like to be in this guy's shoes, the whole world is about to fall on his head, COMPLICATIONS! 1h 6minutes – lol and once again I have confirmed my suspicions about the music score – Mr Trent Reznor, good job! + I think, I already know what is going on in the film 1h 8minutes – yup, I was right but they have already showed it now so I was kind of late. I have also forgot to mention, how good is Ben Affleck's acting, top notch work! Still, more than half of the film left, and I wonder what will happen next 1h 24minutes – damn what a story! I think, I liked the first half of the film more, everything was so mysterious and unknown but now, they play with open cards. Still plenty of minutes left, let's see what will happen next 1h 39 minutes – COMPLICATIONS! but this time, on the opposite end. I can see where the plot is going and I don't like it but, I freaking enjoy the film! 1h 45 minutes – guess what? Even more complications! Do you like them? Well, you will love this film just like I do! 1h 52minutes – what a mind game, this is like an action film, but all the special effects happen in the acting and the plot 2h 5minutes – holy mother of god! This film keep surprising you at every step 2h 11minutes – if you ever marry a book writer, remember what may happen lol 2h 23minutes – checkmate babyDamn! What a film!!! I really don't even know how to rate it. I liked it a lot, a lot a lot but I just can't give it more than this.

Now, I am even more curious what The Imitation Game (2014) may represent. Let's not waste much more time! 13 minutes – you really don't have to wait long for it, to suck you in like a whirlpool21 minutes – if you loved A Beautiful Mind (2001), you should love this too. It has a very similar ring to it and I love it! 1h 20minutes – it's good, the time flies real fast, so it means it's not boring but I find it quite empty. There is not much going on and I have a feeling, there was so much more behind it. I think the director failed to show the real emotions and the importance of this event 1h 31minutes – riddles, puzzles, mind games I really like it! I love the way of showing it; how the real secret intelligence services work like 1h 46minutes – great acting and incredible story, quite sad though I liked it, it wasn't boring and you genuinely wanted to know more and more with every minute of watching; all this without any real action going on. I can't stop thinking that the film has missed some important emotional details of those times. I don't know why nor what exactly it might be, but I have a great unsatisfied feeling about it.

It really makes you wonder all the time, how on Earth did they manage to pull this off! 1h 27minutes – it starts getting interesting, creepy and scary. Good, it was too calm for my taste! 2h 7minutes – Not so interesting anymore I was waiting for some more drama; man vs machine etc. but it happened so quickly and the rest? It's just nice visuals 2h 18minutes – just WTF I think I know where did David Lynch get his ideas fromWhat a disappointment!!! This film could be so much more, something so amazing but Stanley Kubrick has decided to go in a totally WEIRD direction with it The most shocking thing is that, it lacks nice and interesting story (it's kind of ironic because 47-years old special effects were incredible!

Can't wait for his new work!tgchan's rating: 8/10",8,0,3,12 June 2015
Straight Outta Compton," tgchan says YES / www.tgchan.pl
","Ratings: 8.1/10 from 66,044 users looks bloody nice~! I am really excited about this one. Let's go~! 5 minutes - and it is amazing already 8 minutes - but I am already sure that, if you liked 8 Mile (2002), there is no way you won't love this one 39 minutes - I always enjoy the films about going from nothing to something, and this one is no exception 54 minutes - decent. Nothing more, nothing less 1h 54 minutes - totally overrated... The drama is fake and it feels like it's coming from a fairy tale just to dramatise things more Nice story, it was a pleasure to watch, that's it.tgchan's rating: 6.5 /10",6,2,26,15 January 2016
Lucy," tgchan says YES / www.tgchan.pl
","I loved the trailer, even though it was a little crazy. My favuorite movies of all time: Léon (1994) and The Fifth Element (1997), have been created by this director - Luc Besson. I am really eager to see Lucy (2014), although I'm little sceptical about it. Let's see if he still got it!8 minutes - oh my god! the music, style, action, acting just wow... amazing from the very start. It kind of gives you an idea what can you expect to see later on.30 minutes - it's wild... really crazy wild. You have seen so much already and you still have no idea what to expect.37 minutes - OK... the story is a little ridiculous but the dialogues between people are even more off... Nobody would react the way they do... it just feels fake...50 minutes - definitely original but I was hoping for something more action oriented. You know guns, fighting etc. It's focused more on evolution and possibilities which is amazingly interesting as well.Damn... what a weird movie... Worth seeing but it's really weird... Totally different from what I have expected. Great original story, nice effects but after few first actions, it felt more like watching a 'what if...' documentary on Discovery channel... Not to mention lame as F-word ending...tgchan's rating 5.5 /10",6,0,3,20 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," tgchan says YES~! / www.tgchan.pl
","8.4 /10 from 463,377 users. It is one of those films I have seen when I was a child and instantly fell in love with it. Those things will always have a special place in your heart, they are somehow inscribed in your life, forever. It doesn't mean I will forever like them though. I have recently rewatched all of them and they were just meh... If not for the strong nostalgia, I would probably regret wasting time on them. I really hope for the best with this one, but hey... If it sucks, it sucks. I most definitely will not shove it behind some old feelings for the series. Enough of babbling, let's go~! 5 minutes - straight into an action~! 8 minutes - impressive... (even though it feels like copy & paste job) 12 minutes - it feels like home...21 minutes - so far it gives you everything you have expected, and probably some more 31 minutes - the special effects are really nice 35 minutes - of nostalgia trip, awesome~! 1h 3 minutes - I love every minute of it so far 1h 42 minutes - definitely the best STAR WARS in the series. Though, it relies heavily on your nostalgia and all the good memories you have from the originals, but it does it so well...1h 53 minutes - the final scene doesn't make sense at all...2h 11 seconds - flat, the ending was really flat in my opinion Just like my friend described it... It has got thousands of deja vu moments and it is solely built around your nostalgia. It is not a bad thing, and I really liked it. In my opinion it is a nice welcome back party to the upcoming other parts. The next episode will be the real thing.tgchan's rating: 7 /10",7,1,16,28 March 2016
Unbroken," tgchan says YES~! / www.tgchan.pl
","WW2 and survival? I am in! Ratings: 7.2/10 from 77,212 users should be good enough to enjoy this one, I just bloody hope it is a solid 7! Whoa! Director: Angelina Jolie, writers of the screenplay Joel Coen and Ethan Coen ! Now I really want to see it.5 minutes - starts with a nice action right of the bat! 28 minutes - not a fan of past-present-past jump story telling 1h 7minutes - damn... Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson really sacrificed some of their body fat for this film 1h 31minites - nothing extraordinary, but it's interesting and quite entertaining 1h 36minutes - it's brutal... and you don't need to see no blood for that...1h 53minutes - it is slow, but it doesn't bore you 1h 59minutes - wow... what a scene... A definition of the ultimate mental strength. The Japanese guy is doing great job, you genuinely hate his guts! Great story and execution. As I have mentioned before, it is slow, but somehow it kept me interested to the very end. Films like this, show everyone how retarded and ridiculous wars are... Nuclear deterrence might be the reason for the longest 'peaceful times' in our history, but I am also in opinion that many people got smarter, have seen how devastating and simply dumb wars are... Films like this, definitely help to remind us, that nobody really wants this.tgchan's rating: 7.5 /10",7,0,1,25 August 2015
Godzilla," tgchan says YES!
","www.tgchan.pl Great movie to watch while you are eating:). It means there is a lot of action going on almost every minute. I really enjoyed looking at all damages caused by monsters, true eye candy. Before I have started watching it I was hoping for something similar to Cloverfield (2008) - if you have not seen it well it is one of my favourite movies it means GTFO and watch it now! Unfortunately it is far from it it's not as dark,gloomy and scary as Cloverfield. Main focus is on people and their actions while monsters are shown only sometimes and very briefly. The camera work is great when they are showing monsters, it really makes huge impact and you can feel the seriousness of situation. I actually had to check if it's not the same director who made Cloverfield, as I was seeing lots of similarities, which of course is great. The Godzilla looks very good although too much steroids for my taste. Final fight was amazing and I really liked the ending.This movie could have failed on so many levels but it didn't! and I am glad for it! tgchan's rating: 7.5 / 10",7,1,4,2 September 2014
Deadpool," tgchan says YES~!! / tgchan.pl
","8.2/10 from 360,258 users not freaking bad for a film about a superhero I have never heard about. Okay, I lied. I heard about him, but that's it. I have no idea of his powers, story or anything else, except for that he wears a red suit and liked to joke around.1 minutes - opening credits are actually interesting to read... I am impressed 8 minutes - the action is extremely absorbing to say the least 9 minutes - a definition of how comic book film should feel like39 minutes - it really makes me laugh, and it is not from despair 44 minutes - I freaking love it... Now, I wonder if it is my number 1 superhero!? I love the back story as well 53 minutes - so far, I understand exactly why the film received such high rating, it simply deservers it 58 minutes - so he got the best gift he could ever have and he is still not happy because of the look!? RETARDED 1h 20 minutes - I love the freshness in it and the humour is really goody good~! 1h 28 minutes - the action is good and when it's gone the humour still keeps you entertained at all time 1h 38 minutes - lol, it really effortlessly makes you laugh 1h 41 minutes - and even the end credits are worth watching as well Totally worth every minute~!!*make sure you watch a short scene after the end-credits tgchan's rating: 7.5 /10",8,1,6,11 May 2016
Sin City," tgchan says YES!! / www.tgchan.pl
","Great cast, great IMDb rating and an amazing original look why not watch it again.Some time ago I have decided I will not write any reviews of the movies I have already seen before, mainly because of my style (first impression). I wanted to watch Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014) but I could barely remember anything from the first one I have learnt that it's strongly connected with the one from 2005 so, here I am Let's see if it will be as good as I have rated it almost 10years ago! 12 minutes – you can hear,smell and see the originality of it from the very few seconds. I can't help thinking about the game Max Payne (2001) while watching it, it feels somehow similar25 minutes – the narration and gloomy atmosphere feels so amazing The acting is so good that you can only see the created characters and no one else. No matter how long the movie is, you'll never have it enough 42 minutes – so confused for a second I remembered that the movie has a few different stories but I didn't expect credits in a middle of it 52 minutes – wTF not again 1h 13minutes – holy moly! How could I not remember this one! Every second of this movie is a treat! 1h 32minutes – I don't know how many short movies I have seen already but every each one of them was amazing so farOK, the last episode wasn't as good as the rest of them but still!!! Not a second wasted! I gave this movie 8/10 almost ten years ago and I would do it again. Now I can watch the Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014), stay tuned! tgchan's rating: 8/10",8,0,1,31 December 2014
Spectre," tgchan says YES / www.tgchan.pl
","Ratings: 7.0/10 from 175,183 users and plenty of hate with this one~! I am really excited about it, but a little sad that people don't like it. Hopefully they are wrong and I will love it~! Let's see/ 6 minutes - the top agent using a laser pointer on a gun...7 minutes - like with every Craig Daniel's Bond film, you don't have to wait long for a high octane action 15 minutes - terrible opening music performed by some eunuch who can sing...47 minutes - except for those two things I have mentioned before, it is okay to watch. Nothing extraordinary though 1h 27 minutes - and I can't really say anything bad about it, it's quite enjoyable Just a decent film. Nothing more, nothing less.tgchan's rating: 6 /10",6,0,1,19 January 2016
Her," tgchan says YES! / www.tgchan.pl
","Years ago, when I was working at the video rental store, I have skipped and did not watch this film because I thought it was about some transvestite LOL. I knew about the high scores and that it will be probably great, but I just couldn't force myself to watch a film about some guy becoming a woman or the other way around Only recently, when I have been talking with my friend about best films, this title came up. Previously, I have only looked at the cover and name, but this time; I have checked the description and I felt in love with the story right away! I have high as mountain hope that it will be good, so let us start it! 7 minutes – haha, it's already great! It supposed to be a near future but it resembles our actual reality so much; all those social services, virtual friends etc. and at the end you are all alone32 minutes – I enjoy it so far, but I really don't like Scarlett Johansson voice, it is a little annoying I have no idea what to expect from a next scene so I want to see more and more 42 minutes – OK this is starting to be really weird. and trust me I have seen plenty of weird things in my life It feels like watching pr0n with your family to be more precise 1h 12minutes – the story is OK, but what I really like, is the way they are showing the near future. Everything looks so calm, modern and clean without any unnecessary splendour you know, just nice and simple. I really enjoy being there when I watch it 1h 16minutes – damn! it's weird! Really man! This film challenges your mind in ways you would never think about, something you have never experienced before, I guarantee you that1h 43minutes – Holy F! Now that's going to be interesting! Complication! Who doesn't love them in films? :)Damn what a beautiful film Why I can't like it more, though? Something great is missing in it, maybe it's because I am not quite satisfied with how it ended, I honestly don't knowtgchan's rating: 7.5 /10",7,1,2,25 April 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," tgchan says YES!!! / www.tgchan.pl
","Wasteland? Post-appocalyptic world? Tom Hardy? Original director of Mad Max trilogy? and the whooping score of: Ratings: 8.5/10 from 203,536 users ! Too good to be real but let it be that good! I love Fallout, Carmageddon and everything that is post-apocalytpic, this is the closest thing of that magnitude I can get at the moment! Let the show begin!6 minutes – starts with a high octane action right from the bat! Actually too fast and too much for my taste 13 minutes – disgusting and beautiful at the same time. So much work have been put into this film, it looks incredible 17 minutes – the amount of epicness and the imagination of the director is indescribable 22 minutes – this film is the visual description of craziness! Awesome! 25 minutes – what a feast for eyes you watch it and can't get enough of it and it is constant high octane action of the best quality. The only thing I don't like is Tom Hardy, he does not fit in here 30 minutes – of a film and I could stand up and walk away satisfied with what I have seen so far, this is how good it is~! 37 minutes – even the fighting scene looks on the highest possible level, it is incredible what this film has achieved 51 minutes – up to now I have not mentioned the music and sound effects but they are sick as well! 1h – how often does a sequel, reboot or a remake of a film get better than original?! One of the best films in years!!! 1h 3minutes – and I can't point even one single thing I do not like also the acting is superb, like everything else to be honest 1h 32minutes – and it still surprises you with new action coming and coming 1h 40minutes – up until know I have not realised but there is almost no CGI bullsh*t (minimised to bare minimum)! Everything you see is real like in 90's! Great kudos for thatThere are almost none films I want to watch again after I finish them, only the best of the best this is one of them. The only thing I didn't like was the voice of Tom Hardy it sounds like it has been added in studio room, cut off from all other sounds, too clean and out of place like a narration.tgchan's rating: 9/10",9,2,5,27 June 2015
The Martian," tgchan says YES~! / www.tgchan.pl
","8.2 /10 from 229,174 users. Obviously it will be good The question is to a what degree? Ridley Scott and Matt Damon what a sweet combo~! The soundtrack from this film is incredible! I do not expect anything less from the film.5 minutes – I am glad I didn't have to wait for the action too long 11 minutes – this film will have to do hell of a lot and some more to impress me. I mean, a guy on a Mars how interesting it can be huh? 23 minutes – so far the music is way ahead of the film. The movie is just okay, but the music is amazing, it feels weird being so unmatched 45 minutes – it keeps you interested. Nothing more, nothing less 1h 4 minutes – I know that sometimes things don't go our way, but you can definitely feel the artificial over-dramatization here, just to add some more flavour to the story 1h 26 minutes – over-dramatization or not, it gets more intense and interesting to watch 1h 34 minutes – it is one of those films where you really wish everything can end nice and happy 1h 56 minutes – awesome visuals and the story keeps you on the edge of your chair at that moment 2h 9 minutes – this film feels like giving a birth, but in an inverted way.

Furious 7," tgchan says YES! / www.tgchan.pl
","Ratings: 7.5/10 from 186,220 users, yea right lol. Probably, many people overrated it, because of the last performance of Paul Walker in it It would be nice, if it is a solid 6 but hay! I hope I really do, this film will prove me wrong! Let's see it!3 minutes – and I am already laughing my ass off but I can swallow unrealistic, trivial things etc. they just have to be good OK, so nothing lost yet 16 minutes – decent fighting scenes, with a nice camera work 33 minutes – so far it is not so bad, I just hope they will not make me wait for another action for too long, those none action scenes are devastating 49 minutes – it is entertaining, I am not going to lie 1h 2minutes – ridiculous! but ridiculously fun to watch as well. Another thing that I really like is that the CGI is not to be seen so far, either it's so good or it is oldschool baby~! 2h 2minutes – it is so stupid, I feel my brain cells are dying but there is so much action going on, you don't really have time to bother about it lolA very nice and touching ending it actually brought some tears to my eyestgchan's rating: 6.5 /10",6,1,16,1 August 2015
