Raiders of the Lost Ark," I didn't understand
","This film is for me a complete mystery.Is it a 'pastiche', a parody of 'good ole time' adventure movies? In this case Lucas & Spielberg missed the target.Or did they simply make fun of us?",3,5,27,1 June 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Déjà vu
","Really disappointing movie.I loved 'Jurassic Park 1', I hated this sequel. Manifestly Spielberg wanted make a little money to round off his colossal fortune, so he served us that bad warmed-up movie.Actually, the story is so bad that I think a software could have made the 'scenario'.Déjà vu mieux!",2,2,22,5 June 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Marvelous!
","You will find this movie marvelous, full of mysteries. You will remember it as a very pleasant moment in your life.I strongly recommend it: 9 of 10.And what again? Oh yes, overall if your name is Homer Simpson...",2,0,21,8 May 2002
Jurassic Park," Excellent, in spite of all
","I really enjoyed this film.Steven Spielberg knows how to create an appropriate climax, combined with the new (at the time) image processing methods.Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed that Spielberg have evacuated the most part of scientific content in Michael Crichton's book, succumbing to one of Hollywood's fundamental diktats: 'Thou shalt not demand too much of the viewer's intelligence'.Actually the ending was eight years old kid stuff, spoiling the initial fear climax.In spite of all, I saw the movie twice in succession in the theater, and many times on VCR after.",9,3,4,2 June 1999
