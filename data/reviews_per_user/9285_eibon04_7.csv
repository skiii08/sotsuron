The Blair Witch Project," Unmemorable Movie
","The makers of The Blair Witch Project have done a good job at pulling the wool over people's eyes making them think that this is actually good.  Just because a film was made for little money does not make it a great movie(it's not how much you spend but how much you put into a film).  This movie is inconclusive when judging the directors abilities as one horror movie hit does not make a great director.  I believe that the two directors have to do more films before passing judgement on how good they how.  I think it is silly to compare them with the likes of Wes Craven, John Carpenter, Tod Browning, and other great directors of horror films as The Blair Witch Project might be the only decent movie that they will ever make.One problem I have with the movie is there is nothing to remember.  There are no scenes or lines that stand out and make people remember it for.  The movie was like a one and a half hour whale watch trip(the experience was similar to attending a whale watch as a person starts to feel sick).  What I hate about this movie was that it seemed that the directors did not any artistic vision and this is the main problem of the film as I feel that nothing emotionlly was put into it(a bad thing is when two people direct as they have different styles while one director would use a style that the crew can get familar with).  BWP is not a scary movie and anyone who says so is not a real horror movie fan who've seen real horror films but mostly Johnny come latelys.  The success of this film worldwide proves that the human being are becoming more dumber and idiotic and that no one has any taste for great art anymore(we have mostly tase for art of mediocrity). The art of greatness is dead, but the art of mediocrity is alive.",1,1,3,10 March 2000
Vertigo," Timeless Classic
","Vertigo(1958) is the greatest movie of all time.  Based on a book by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac that was written especially for Hitchcock after finding out too late that he sought to adapt an earlier book by them that would be filmed as Diabolique(1955).  Vertigo is an psycological thriller about obsession, misplaced love, and death.  This is a film that perfectly states Hitchcock's most personal throughts.  Two other films that dealt with sexual dominance are Notorious(1946), and Marnie(1965).
Vertigo is a great cinema piece for a few reasons.  First, most of the characters in the movie are three dimensional and well defined.  Second, it uses a number of different colors to its advantage.  Third, the camera movement is beautiful and smooth. Fourth, The story is so gripping that its hard to take you eyes off the screen as you wonder what happens next.
Alfred Hitchcock's direction is almost flawless and his expertise in some of the scenes is brilliant.  My three favorite films of Alfred Hitchcock has to be Vertigo(1958), Shadow of a Doubt(1942), and Notorious(1946).  James Stewart gives a complex and emotional performance as the detective who obsesses over the image of Madeleine.  Kim Novak has the most difficult role in the duel performance as Madeleine/Judy.  Bernard Hermann's score is a beautiful piece of music.",Null,2,3,14 November 2000
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Superior to the Cartoons released today by Disney Studios
",A beautifully colored and wonderfully depicted story of the Snow White tale. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs(1937) is one of the few Walt Disney pictures that I think is any good.  Tends the water of fairy tale and horror.  This is the film that is what many Disney films have tried to live up to and some failed.  A very good film that is made special by the early use of Technicolor.  Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs(1937) made an impression on many Italian horror filmmakers who would use this impression to do some of the best Italian horror films ever.  The use of color in here would influence Dario Argento to fashion his film Suspiria(1977) after the style and look of this animated feature.,Null,1,1,17 August 2001
Final Destination," The Best of Post Scream Flicks
","Final Destination(2000) is a fresh and imaginative horror film that for once does not involve a masked lunatic.  The movie is a cross between The X-Files and H.P. Lovecraft.  The numbers three and seven play an important role in the scheme of things.  It deals with unpredictability, predetermination, fate, and the philosophy of life and death.  It contains one of the most creative death scenes in a horror movie that I've seen in a long time. Final Destination(2000) compares very favorably to The Dead Zone(1983), Don't Look Now(1972), and Seven Notes in Black(1977).",Null,0,0,30 March 2000
The Great Escape," Stunt Work by McQueen is Fabulous
","Not one of the best WWII films of all time but certainly entertaining with some excellent set pieces to remember.  Made in the days when many long epic films consisted of all star casts.  An enjoyable film from director, John Stuges that I prefer over his Western, The Magnificent Seven(1960).  The Great Escape(1963) has an interesting premise that is half realized.  One actor, James Donald plays a POW prisoner for the second time in five years after playing a similar role in Bridge on the River Kwai(1958).",Null,0,1,28 September 2001
Jackie Brown," Not One of My Favorite Leonard Adaptations for Film
","Jackie Brown(1997) is a major disappointment following the brilliant and strange Pulp Fiction(1994).  A huge plus for the film is the cast and their performances.  A rare De Niro feature where he is not the center of attention in Jackie Brown(1997).  Too eratic in story and some scenes.  A average take on an Elmore Leonard movie compared to 52 Pick Up or Get Shorty.  The one scene that I do enjoy is the sequence done with mutiple viewpoints ala, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon(1951).",Null,3,6,23 July 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Interesting Take on Homer's The Odyessy
","O Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000) is a strange comedy that mixes the zanniness of The Big Lebowski(1998) with the eccentric behavior of Fargo(1996).  George Clooney gives the best performance in his career as the main character, Ulysses.  Big Dan Teague played by John Goodman is someone out of a Flannary O'Connor novel.  He reminds me of the character played by Ned Bettey in John Huston's Wise Blood(1979).  Not one of the best films by the Coen Brothers but certainly a fun and entertaining movie to view.",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
