","Everything in this movie is  superficial, just pretty imagery and emotional music trying to pull  your heart strings. The characters in this movie are generic stoic anime  characters, and they are extremely underdeveloped at that.The movie  wastes time with these stupid mtv moments, were some bands songs  will start playing and everything goes into fast forward.It's a  complete waste considering that time could have been spent developing  the paper thin characters a little more. Magic plays a big part in Your  Name because the writer couldn't figure out how to cover up all the  obvious plot holes.Magic always saves the day conveniently, and when  ever something goes wrong. It just feels contrived, like it's only  happening to make you feel sad.  Don't waste your time with this overrated trash, it's as shallow as a  porn star!",1,28,80,16 November 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars A snoozefest story
","Wow this is a really dull movie, I could hardly stay awake. Edwards continues his trend of making movies that put intelligent people to sleep and entertain the simple minded masses. Three thirds of this movie don't even feel like Star Wars, could be any other sci if film. There are no jedis, no lightsabers and no space battles. Although darthvader does show up for a couple of minutes, he breaths some life into this hollow husk of a film but not enough to save the viewer from boredom. There are a lot of newly introduced characters in this movie, and they are all uninteresting and one dimensional. The actors do an okay job but it seems like they are phoning in there performance, especially the lead actress she seems very unemotional and boring. she's probably the least likable. It seems a lot like Edwards is purposely directing his actors to show as little emotion and interest in the events that are transpiring in front of them as possible. Rogue one is a weird movie in a sense; it's to fast paced at times and also to slow sometimes. Generally it's a very slow paced movie but when they're are dramatic or emotional moments that require a slower pace for them to work properly and sink in. The movie just blazes past them at a lighting pace, not allowing the audience to digest whats happening. It ends up making the more dramatic moments feel superficial and rushed. The last fourth of this movie is were it goes full Star Wars with a big space battle accompanied by a land battle going on simultaneously. This part of the movie is admittedly a little fun, but it's to late, to little to compensate for the rest. which is dull, drab, vanilla and down right boring! I really don't understand how people find this fun. My father watched this movie, and he normally loves sci fi regardless of the quality;and even he thought this was boring. It seems to me like Disney is just trying to milk the series for all it's worth, they don't care about anything else. Rogue One is defiantly the most overrated movie of 2016; it's sad that people have such low standards.",3,11,20,7 May 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," The mcdonalds of the movie industry pumps out another movie!
","And as usual it's garbage. Only watched approximately ten minutes, couldn't stand to bear it any longer- IT'S THAT BAD! Hopefully people will get tired of these movies and the Marvel cinematic universe will die! Do you think I'am hoping for too much?",1,5,12,20 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars The Force yawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwn!
","Wow this really is one of the most sleep inducing, yet financial and critically successful movies I have ever seen. Well it's quite obvious Disney knows exactly what they are doing, there targeting the biggest fan base in existence. The Star Wars fans! But it's not only the fans of Star Wars that run out to see this crap in cinemas, it's just about every living person. And do you want to know why? Because Star Wars is a huge event, an unavoidable event!you'll eventually get around to watching even if your not a fan of Star Wars, it's almost like a curse.I'm going to make this review as short as possible because I honestly don't feel like wasting to much time talking about this film.Okay, this movie seems completely pointless it undermines all the struggles the characters of the original trilogy went through. All they're efforts where for absolutely nothing. Because good and evil are stuck in an endless battle, neither will ever truly vanquish the other. There's a great sense of repetition, the events of A New Hope are literally repeating here! This is practically a remake of A New Hope, and a very uninventive remake at at! The main characters are all new; although a couple of oldies make a return beside the new ones. The leading protagonist is a one dimensional mary sue who becomes a jedi master in a matter of hours. secondary protagonist is a rouge storm trooper who is a bumbling idiot that cannot accomplish anything competently. All the characters are unlikable. I went in hoping to see Mark Hamill reprise his role as Luke Stalker unfortunately he only shows up at the end for five seconds and has no dialogue. Alright,that's it, I'am going to wrap this up; bottom line this is a VERY boring movie! Don't give Disney your money because they haven't earned it!",1,29,77,16 June 2017
