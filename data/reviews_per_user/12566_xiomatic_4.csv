First Man," Stark, claustrophobic and real
","Bemused at the reviews of 'boring' or 'too long'. This is not Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff, and is not meant to be. It is a character study based on a book James R Hansen which is a biography of Neil Armstrong, rather than a story of the moon landing per se. Of course the movie is going to show the moon landing, and the events which lead up to it, but these are just part of what the movie is about.We see how hard it is to be a test pilot then astronaut. The launches and flights are seen from Neil's perspective, his visceral experience of being on top of a missile smashing into space. These scenes are not spectacular, in the Apollo 13 sense, but dark, claustrophobic, noisy and confusing, like it really was. A lot of people who perhaps were brought up on super-hero Hollywood movies cannot seem to relate to the portrayal an actual human being matter of factly doing things which are so far beyond normal. So we have the usual morons complaining about the fact that Armstrong doesn't smile enough or have anything witty to say while he is fighting for his life, you know, like they do in the movies. This level of immature stupidity is beyond my ken, so I'll just say just don't watch it. Keep to Star trek or Iron Man or whatever.If you do appreciate what real people do in real life, warts and all, you will hopefully appreciate this starkly dry portrayal of a man who has all the flaws of you and me, but who also just happens to repeatedly face life threatening situations and find solutions to them on the fly. Armstrong is shown as an introverted man of few words and not particular friendly. But he has extraordinary coolness under extreme pressure. That's why he was chosen as the first man.On a philosophical side note, it is not unusual for a truly great man of history to be reviled by the ankle biters of his day. There are whole industries of historians who specialize in trying to bring down the great to their own wormlike size, and I have no doubt this is or will happen to Armstrong. But unlike pretty much everyone living today, his name will be known a thousand years from now.The movie portrays a real marriage, so unlike what is normal in Hollywood that it seems to be a shock to a lot of people. Maybe they don't have wives, I don't know. I certainly could relate to one or two exchanges between Neil and his wife Janet. Clare Foy portrays her as a sweet but strong woman. What it would have been like for her to hear her husband on the intercom say 'We're in trouble' I don't know.This movie is almost fly on the wall documentary when it comes to the rocket scenes, and kitchen sink stage drama when it comes to the personal stuff. I'm not a fan of Ryan Gosling, but he is convincing here. He really does a great portrayal of Neil Armstrong.",9,2,2,11 June 2020
Lawrence of Arabia," One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made
","Basically, this movie epitomises Hollywood at its greatest. If only Hollywood could make movies like this again. I could say today's Hollywood is so mired in self-absorption and catering to niche interests they won't make a movie like this again, but in my opinion they simply don't have the talent to do so.This movie is nearly four hours long and thankfully has a ten minute intermission just over halfway. In those days they actually thought about the audience don't you know. I actually watched the movie over two days as I do have things to do. It starts with a black screen, which is a bit disconcerting, and then some rousing band music starts up. It really sets the tone. All the actors are at their level best, Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif are standouts in a movie of standouts. Omar's entrance is iconic, one of the top three movie scenes ever made in my opinion.There's really not much more to add to what has been said over the years. If I was to use one word to describe it, it would be Magnificent.",10,0,0,14 November 2019
The King," Moody Millennial Becomes Monarch in the Middle Ages!
","As a sometime musician, I find it interesting that while a modern musician would be loath to change a single note from any of Bach's or Mozart's compositions, today's screenwriters have no problem rewriting Shakespeare so as to not only change the play, but to make it the opposite of what Shakespeare intended.Watching this I had mixed feelings. It is a well made production, the cast are generally good, the battle scenes are well done. The problem for me was the premise; if you want to rewrite Shakespeare you better be an extraordinary writer, or it will not work. One of the most important things for any movie is the ability for the audience to suspend disbelief and to maintain that suspension for the whole movie. It becomes a serious problem when the audience starts asking questions like 'Wait, he's an anti-war millennial but out of the blue says kill all prisoners'. Where did that come from? Or he's a King who just conquered France, but then gets lectured to by the French princess and he just stands there looking like a lost puppy. It just doesn't make sense.It occurred to me that this movie isn't supposed to make sense, it's only supposed to tick the boxes for the woke millennial college student who fantasises what it would be like to be a King in the middle ages. It would be a great opportunity to show medieval neanderthals concepts like being against war and listening to princesses. The woke millennial fantasises that he can kill real warriors in single combat but he'd rather be sitting in a dark corner being moody. He looks moodily at the deplorables around him and wishes the middle ages would end already.I don't know too much about the real King Henry V, but for me to suspend disbelief I would have to go along with the idea that a modern woke millennial can mood his way through being a King in the middle ages, to be a pacifist and sensitive guy who reluctantly kills because he's forced to. Such a King would have been regarded as a pathetic weakling and Henry's own father usurped just such a King. As I said, I don't know too much about King Henry, but I know he wasn't this guy. So my suspension of disbelief failed, which is disastrous for any movie. I think this kind of rewriting of history to suit modern sensitivities could work, but it requires writing and directing with much more skill and subtlety than shown here.",6,1,5,12 November 2019
13 Hours," Edge of your seat heroic tragedy
","Utterly engaging edge of your seat stuff. Based on the book by the very operators being portrayed in the movie, it shows the buildup and attack leading to the tragic killing of a US ambassador and his bodyguards during a massive insurgency in Libya. It also shows the extraordinary bravery and skill of the secret soldiers who were there mainly to provide security and not to engage in a massive battle.All the way through the movie I kept asking myself 'so when's the cavalry coming?' But the cavalry never came, due to sheer incompetence or sheer indifference by the higher-ups.Is it possible that an army of insurgents can build up without anyone in US intelligence knowing? Is it possible that the insurgent army can then attack an embassy compound and no help come at all? The movie deliberately makes no judgement and leaves it up to the viewer to decide.It's an interesting illustration of our times that when these guys returned to the US, far from being lauded as heroes they were either ignored or vilified by the media. The death of a US ambassador had to be blamed on someone and it was not going to be the politicians and generals who were in charge but the nobodies who tried and failed to save him. My hat goes off to them, however, and the politicians, media and their supporters can shove it.",9,1,1,12 March 2020
