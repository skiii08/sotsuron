Walk the Line," Johnny Cash would have been proud of this film
","Like most film biographies about artists, I was skeptical about Walk The Line. I thought the film would try to make a big spectacle by glorifying Cash's life and by having to show every detail of his career so that all you get is a big convoluted opus. I was basically worried it would turn out to be something like The Doors or even Ray. Walk The Line is not one of those films. It focuses on a specific story revolving between Johnny Cash and June Carter. It has a similar structure to Alex Cox's 'Sid and Nancy' where the film is about the relationship and the music follows in the background. People who know a lot about Johnny Cash might be disappointed only because they may want to see more behind the man in black. I on the other hand, am glad they did not exploit his dark side or try to unravel any big mystery behind the legend. We don't need to know the myth behind this man. Johnny Cash was a monumental figure in American music. His devotion to playing music and staying alive was depended so strongly by his relationship with June Carter and that is what makes this film interesting. The performances are superb. Joachim Pheonix delivers all the way through the end. His singing is great and at times, he really looks like Cash. I can't speak as highly about Reese Witherspoon but she carries herself as a believable strong and self protective woman. She does not mimic or try to replicate June which is actually good. I hope most people who don't know about Johnny Cash will see this film and will then be tempted to buy his music. He is without a doubt, one of the great treasures of American music.",8,0,1,30 November 2005
Coffee and Cigarettes," coffee talk without the dogs or daughters
","Many years in the making, it is great to see Jarmusch finally release these shorts and turn them into a feature. His cool minimal style allows viewers to enjoy these odd and amusing conversations. What's more interesting , (that is if you take film seriously) you will notice certain patterns between the shorts. It is nothing too deep or profound but simply an existential approach between habits and thoughts. Certain dialog's or topics are repeated in other stories and at one point we hear Meg of the White Stripes contemplate that the world is a collection of 'acoustical resonance'. The characters and their environments seem somewhat flat and two dimensional as if they came out of a comic strip. Throughout the film, we also see Aeriel shots of checkered coffee tables with cups clanking and butts smoking which seems to symbolize communication as a game of chess. That was my impression anyway. It flows in a very awkward experimental way where some conversations are lively and others are just dead. Iggy and Waits are an odd combination but the more I watched this scene, the funnier it gets. Everyone loves the Molina and Coogan scene probably because it has a very overt ending to it. My personal favorite was with Cate Blanchett. I never paid much attention to her as an actress but now I see how appealing she can be especially since she is talking to herself. Steven Wright and Begnini are hilarious in their strange miscommunication.It is refreshing to see a film that takes chances, does'nt try too hard and certainly doesn't try to blend in with typical Hollywood films. Jarmusch still stands out as one of America's most original modern directors.",8,1,2,1 June 2005
Taxi Driver," a film that's beautifully 'organazized'
","It's not everyday when you come across an 'out of body' experience. The last time I felt it at the movies was when I saw Star Wars. That was before I saw Taxi Driver. I rented Taxi Driver with some friends seventeen years after its theatrical release.I was blown away. My friends and I didn't say a word until ten minutes after it was over. How was it that a movie like this could have such an impact?The film stars Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle who takes on a taxi career after serving in the Marines in Vietnam and suffering from some horrible discharge. From the beginning we already feel something unpleasant about Travis. We can see that he's lonely, reserved and a bit socially awkward. We sense something more intense underneath but we don't really know what it is. Wandering into porn movie theaters makes him seem even more lonely and perverted. This is his quality time after long days of witnessing a violent atmosphere of pimps, prostitutes and homeless drug addicts.Taxi life sure isn't the solution to his miserable and solitary life. Bur one day, Travis spots a girl played by Cybil Shepard who works at a campaign headquarter for a presidential candidate. We watch Travis trying to flirt and ask her out and although it seems charming to an average bimbo, it comes across as totally awkward. There are long pauses of silence and observations that sound creepily insulting. 'I can see the way you carry yourself that you're not a happy person' he says. When he takes her out to lunch, we see Travis's loneliness amplified with a a mild sense of paranoia. This scene is utterly ironic in how we see a typical first date as sounding nervous and alienating. Who is this guy? Cybil seems intrigued by him and is reminded of a Kris Kristoferssen song: 'he's a poet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction.' It's a great description of Travis but he immediately gets insulted. Rather then analyze the song, he just gets defensive.' 'I'm not a pusher and I never have pushed.' He proves himself wrong. After a bad date of trying to take her to a porno movie, he can't take 'no' for an answer. We start to see more of Travis's creepy personality unfold as he obsesses over her by sending flowers and finally bursting in the office to yell and scream at her. Why does'nt he get it? After all the drunks, weirdos and psychos he picks up, could'nt he learn something ? No, instead, he is driven to a plan of madness. We don' know exactly what but its definitely building inside him. We see this in an amazing scene with Peter Boyle outside a cafeteria. Their interaction reinforces the loneliness and alienation between these characters. Its a quiet scene but its so true in its portrayal that it seem scary. The film looks like a documentary at times because we see street action in the background that weaves in and out of the foreground giving you a sense of real life drama. Some of the shots are particularly shocking and so matter of fact. When an encounter with a pimp turns bloody, we see it from a distance as if we were pedestrians witnessing a crime. The violence in this film is anything but glorified. It puts the film in a gritty and dirty atmosphere that we don't want to participate in. But its not just the violence that hooks us in, its the bizarre and psychological mysteries that carry the story. How did Travis get infatuated with Cybil Shepard? Was it coincidence that she worked for the presidential nominee? How events happen and get traced in this film is utterly disturbing. I still can't explain how a film could have an impact to the magnitude that it did. One thing I do know is the director (Martin Scorsese), the screenwriter (Paul Schrader) and the main actor (Robert DeNiro) were all going through similar experiences during the making of this film. That is rare in a field that involves a lot collaboration. When it does happen it as it did, it becomes truly magical. This is without a doubt, Scorsese's best film to date.",10,1,2,31 July 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," 'eye candy' and nothing but....
","There is something confusing about Tim Burton's films. When a filmmaker has a weakness, shouldn't he take it upon himself to fix and improve that weakness in their following projects? This is after all, what critics are for: to offer criticism about films and explain what works and what doesn't. Sometimes the director will be ignorant and shrug off the review with a 'screw you' attitude and other times it may be a misunderstanding of the critics. 'No mister critic, I don't care so much about plot or characters and it's really about the visuals.' Is that Tim Burton's excuse? And if so, what's the point? Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visually spectacular film but it's not enough to make a good film. The story is about Charlie Bucket but then its about Willy Wonka and we forget about Charlie. There's not one cut away of Charlie's reaction while being in the factory tour. The other child characters are obnoxious as Dahl intended them to be but they have no depth. They overreact on cue when it is time for them to fall into a trap and leave the others behind. There is no build up to their selfish frustrations. Its as if they see the moment where they wish to escape and die. The last twenty minutes of the film feel rushed and we have to think fast as to how Willy Wonka was so quickly welcomed by the Bucket family.Critics can see why Tim Burton chose to film this story. It centers on 'eye candy.' But eye candy is not interesting for a feature if there is not much else to care about. Its like having sex without love. We get dazzling images of chocolate dripping waterfalls and strange looking Oompa Loompa figures and irritating breaks of songs and dance. I especially did'nt care for the background imagery of Oprah Winfrey and Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001. These kinds of visual details ruin the imagination by reminding you what the real world is all about. There has only been one film where Tim Burton's use of storytelling and character development received critical success. That film was 'Ed Wood'. Ed Wood is the movie about the late B-movie director from the 50's who made his films from the heart without conforming to traditional narrative styles. The critics did not catch on with him and coincidentally critics have not caught on with Tim Burton' style. The film'Ed Wood' is the only exception. One cannot help but see the irony in this.",4,8,12,31 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's alienation
","Steven Spielberg is a great filmmaker for kids. He knows how to entertain and simplify stories and bring them suspense,drama and action without a lot of seriousness or complexity. The problem is that Spielberg never seemed to grow up from his traditional method of movie-making. Even when he made The Color Purple and Schindler's List, the subject matter may have been serious but Spielberg seemed to wimp out on some of the graphic content that was necessary for the subject. War of the Worlds is by no means a 'grown up' movie but Spielberg's maturity as a director nonetheless has declined. He refuses to escape the obvious cliché's, the paper thin characters with no depth, the overblown orchestral Williams score that is used to spell out every emotional scene telling you how to think and feel. Die hard Spielberg fans might see this as nit-picky and granted, a lot of people like roller coasters but I want a little more meaning and thought put into the ride. About one hour after the movie and the special effects had worn off on me, I wondered 'what was the point of this film? Why did the aliens wait until now to attack? Why did they look like robots and stand on three legs as if they fell out of an Ed Wood movie?' Mr. Spielberg, we need a little more sophistication because your audience is a lot smarter then you may think.",4,1,3,12 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," major plot holes....
","Yes this is the best of the three prequels. The special effects are as dazzling as ever and this time there is more story. The problem however, is the major plot holes. If you are not a big star wars fan, you may not notice but Luke and Leia's mother died instantly after she gave birth. In Return of the Jedi, Princess Leia talks to Luke about the memory of her mother, her 'real' mother. I've heard other people say that in the new DVD versions of Star Wars, Lucas edited out this dialog. I don't know if that's true but if it is, its a lazy attempt to tie the original story together. After dwelling on this, I realized that this plot hole is not nearly as bad as the one in the original trilogy. Luke and Leia have a passionate kiss in Empire Strikes back and then we learn that they are brother and sister. Leia confronts this fact by saying 'somehow....I've always known.' Well maybe long ago in a galaxy far far away, people were not ashamed to have deep kisses with their siblings but that strikes me as a little odd. Also, what's the deal with R2D2's flying capability? This did not happen in IV, V or VI. Did he forget he could fly when Captain Antilles wiped away their memories? Well, I guess for the average popcorn-blockbuster-movie-fanatic this does not make much difference. it would not surprise me if one day, Lucas decided to re release all the movies in theaters with added scenes and all new plot twists that will continue to distort our imaginations of the story.",5,1,3,19 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A fantasy well realized....
","A few years ago, the New Yorker magazine wrote a fascinating article on Star Wars. It explained the whole phenomenon of Star Wars and how it happened. I was like other 5 year old 'Star Wars' fanatics in 1977 and when I saw the Millennium Falcon zap into hyper-drive, it was an overwhelming stimulation of the imagination. Suddenly every 4 and 5 year old child was teleported into a future that existed long ago and in a galaxy far away. 'Star Wars' gave reason to why we see movies in a big and darkened theater. Yes, Star Wars was a phenomenon but it was not THE film changed the movie industry. That was Jaws.Star Wars's greatest achievement is that the film was such a grand and ambitious project and yet, writer, director George Lucas was able to realize it. No other science fiction film has had so many creatures, planets and special effects as Star Wars. It is a universe in and of itself. Looking back on 'Star Wars' many year later, I can see problems that seemed to permeate in the other films from the saga. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is a masterpiece, that is up until the story leads Luke and the others into the Death Star. By that point, the film turns into an exaggerated cartoon. When Han Solo is chasing after an army of stormtroopers, we get the idea that he's really not that scared. Okay, he's scared but not to the point where his life is at risk. We see this type of problem in all the Star Wars films (with the exception of 'The Empire Strikes Back'). Characters are running around shooting each other like a bunch of kids playing tag. Where's the suspense and drama that leads us to believe that this is supposed to be real? It worked for the first half of Star Wars.The first hour of Star Wars is beautifully written. One of my favorite scenes is when Luke and Obi-Wan are sitting at Obi Wan's home. Obi wan is talking about the past and also talking about Luke's father and the 'force' which is an 'energy field created by all living things.' This conversation is one of the moments of the film that always enhanced my imagination for the film. I not only believed in the film, but I also believed that there was all of this history and supernatural elements that existed prior to this film. Too bad, the history was later realized into another series of cartoonishly dull adventures in the Episode I, II, and III. Oh well. It is after all the imagination come to life that makes all of these films important. That's what counts. The rest is mediocre.",7,4,6,19 August 2005
Fantastic Four," Its Fantastic For Morons
","the Fantastic Four was one of Marvel's longest and most successful running comics. Unfortunately this movie killed it. Maybe this film was not guaranteed any success because the popularity of this comic started sagging over the years. What we get here is a desperate attempt to make an old team of heroes come across as slick, sexy and hip. Man are they hip. You get to see the Thing sport a nice pair of Nike's. Great product placement. In fact, this movie is loaded with so much product placement that I had a hard time distinguishing it from an actual commercial. The Burger King billboard so beautifully displayed behind the action. The American Express line 'catching one of your friends looking silly...priceless.' Yes, these subliminal ads should'nt matter. Its the movie that counts. Right? This movie is so desperate for attention that it needs to sell you a Whopper and some Nikes in order to make you happy. The characters are awful. They act like puppets from a reality show. Where's the depth and complexity? Hey, I know its superheroes but who says you can't have a serious superhero film? Remember Christopher Reeve as Superman? these guys are not even from the same world. They belong to an American Gladiatiors event sponsored by Mountain Dew. What does Stan Lee care anyway? He's got a couple of other comics he can destroy on the big screen. They're just hot cakes waiting to be sold. That's what this is. Money hungry, blockbuster hits with nothing underneath.",1,4,8,26 July 2005
