Casablanca," A classic
","I had always thought I would like this movie and when I finally watched it I loved it. The performances were amazing, the story and the narrative were beautiful. I enjoyed the kind of torture that Rick endures, Bogart's performance makes the character feel so familiar. The music in it was amazing and fit so well. The themes of love and his sacrifice makes this movie so great. It really is one of the greatest romance stories in all of movie history, and they don't even end up together. It really is a beautiful story and all of the performances are so flawless and it makes this movie stand out in history because of it. If you haven't seen this movie you need to because I can't believe I waited as long as I did to see it.",10,0,2,12 May 2016
Annie Hall," First Allen film, will have to see more now
","I loved this film! This is a film primarily about the rise and fall romantic relationship. However, Woody Allen's creative genius allows it to become so much more. From the non-linear timeline to the subtitles telling the audience what the characters are actually saying, Allen's decisions keep the movie interesting and fresh. My favorite scene is the one in which Annie, who is brilliantly portrayed by Diane Keaton, and Alvy (Allen's character) are having intercourse, but Annie is bored, and a manifestation of her mind is sitting in a chair near the bed. I found this to be a very inventive and imaginative way to depict Annie's boredom; it stuck out to me as one of the most memorable moments of the movie. This movie examines the realities of relationships; it reflects the happiness they bring as well as the boredom, anger and heartbreak they cause. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and would love to see more Woody Allen films.",8,0,0,13 May 2016
The Graduate," A fantastic coming of age film
","I have enjoyed this movie more and more as I have matured and really related more and more to Benjamin. This movie has the perfect balance of humor and serious tone. This movie lets itself get into big complex issues and then inject humor into them in a way that makes all the characters more relatable. We can all understand where Benjamin is coming from and why he is so nervous, and the humor adds to the serious situation in a great way. There are lots of beautiful shots in this movie to really appreciate along with its amazing soundtrack featuring Simon and Garfunkel. The soundtrack really sets a mood and tone for the movie that is perfect. This is definitely my second favorite coming of age story behind Garden State.",10,1,1,13 May 2016
Psycho," Favorite horror film
","This movie has it all. The camera movement, lighting and general feel all contribute to making this movie rightfully perfect. Then you add on an amazing soundtrack that just adds so much to the suspense. The soundtrack may be responsible for most of the feeling of fright or horror. The best part though is the story. I was fortunate to have avoided the ending of this film before seeing it and I can't be happier that I did. I enjoyed that twist and shock ending, it made perfect sense throughout the story and made the entire story so much creepier and unsettling. I will take a creepy and unsettling story that borders on disturbing over a modern horror with cheap thrills any day.",10,1,2,13 May 2016
To Kill a Mockingbird," Great book and great movie
","To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books, and it was amazing to see the characters come alive on the screen. Gregory Peck is absolutely perfect as Atticus Finch, the intelligent and kind father of Scout and Jem, and Robert Duvall is able to depict Boo Radley's deep pain without saying a word. One amazing thing about this film is the way that it is from the perspective of a child. Director Robert Mulligan is able to flawlessly translate this from the book, and ensures that it does not falter throughout the movie. The black-and- white cinematography is evocative of the 1930s Deep South, but To Kill a Mockingbird is not just a period piece. Unfortunately, its portrayal of racism and a corrupt legal system are still relevant today. It is an important film in terms of style and content, and one that I will definitely be seeing again.",8,0,0,13 May 2016
