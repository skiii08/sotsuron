The Longest Yard," Funny
","I enjoyed the humor in the film. The show wasn't the most deepest and in depth film, but I don't think it needed to be. It wasn't silly, or over done in the humor; instead I found the movie light and enjoyable. It also had some good football scenes and its always interesting to see the inside of a prison with the daily lifestyle of inmates. It was nice to see the character development in the film and Adam Sandler is amazing as always.",8,1,1,17 January 2020
It," Not For the Faint of Heart
","Most remakes are terrible, but this one managed to follow the original story and still be extremely entertaining. The cast in the film, were extraordinary as they played their parts to a tee. The characters themselves were highly enjoyable as they mixed humor, friendship and heart in with the absolutely scary events that were taking place in the film. The story was easy to follow and highly entertaining as the kids dealt with the issues at hand. 'IT' is extremely scary; how they depicted the clown and the gore mixed in, with children being eaten. It's not for the faint of heart.",8,0,1,18 January 2020
Fury," Very Realistic
","For a war movie, this one is very well done. Its extremely realistic as it shows you the struggles and horrors people went through in war. This movie is very well filmed with a perfect cast to seal the deal. The begunning is a little slow, but once the movie gets going it really picks up.",8,1,4,23 December 2019
Darkest Hour," Excellent Film!
","Wow, Gary Oldman's performance as Churchill was astonishing! The movie was amazing as it showed you the tremendous hardships and obstacles that Churchill delt with in such a critical time. I loved every moment of this film as it dipicted this topic with such clarity. What might seem like a boring subject to be entertained by for two hours, its actually quite facinating and very intense. The filming was beautifully done, followed by a great cast and a perfectly written script.",9,0,2,23 February 2020
Happy Gilmore," Down To Earth Funny
","Like any other Adam Sandler film, its a little off the wall wild, full of crude humor and a wacky storyline, but that's what makes it fun. Even through all of the unrealistic things that happen, there's still a good message portrayed in the film, behind the comedy. I loved that this movie wasn't over the top dumb, but more down to earth and relatable.",8,0,0,31 January 2020
Billy Elliot," Widely Over Rated
","The film is very slow and lower budget. I do like the idea of the story, it's entertaining to watch a struggling kid fight to dance; but the way it was written/depicted was very boring and slightly weird. Not to mention that this is a British film, the actors have very heavy accents making it difficult to understand if you're not used to the British language. I enjoyed the dancing scenes and wished they would have had more of Billy dancing. The one nice thing about the film was the ending; I find the movie finally started to pick up a bit at the end, leaving you with a decent feeling when the film was over.",6,1,3,16 January 2020
Blade," Over Rated
","I love Vampire Movies, Underworld Is one of my favorite Movies, but I find this show is very lacking. It's mostly about Wesley killing/beating up vampires the entire time. The plot of the show isn't very good; extremely lacking, the lines are terrible, and the CGI is really bad. The filming is okay, but the gore is way over done making the show distasteful. It would have been nice if Blade himself would have had more of a character. He literally is just a 'Tough Guy' who broods all the time. I do enjoy the action in the movie and the different views of how a vampire can be hurt or their abilities they wield. Since every show has a different opinion on the vampire, it's always entertaining to see the differences.",5,1,3,7 January 2020
Hot Fuzz," Differant
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I decided to view this film, I thought it would be a really stupid comedy, but was finding myself surprised at every corner.There is, humor in the film but it's an unusual humor, filled with in your face, obvious comedy, that creates a lighter atmosphere in the movie. Instead of having the normal boring cop movies, this one brought a different approach to the table as you followed Simon Pegg. He is a cop that does his job too good for anyone to like or want him to be apart of their team. About half way through the movie it seems to add in a horror streak to the film, mixed in with mystery and action, while still keeping the show light. Making you wonder, what genre does this movie fit into?The relationship between Nicholas Angel and PC Danny Butterman was written quite well. It was far from the usual cop partner relationship that is showed in most films, instead of having Butterman as a stupid cop who can never do anything right, he's just a normal guy trying to honestly do better. Even though there's very little back story to the characters and no normal romance thrown in there, it made the movie enjoyable because it was out of the 'Ordinary' expectations.",7,1,2,11 February 2020
The Natural," Way To Slow Paced
","The only reason this film is worth watching, is the cast, Robert Redford, Glenn close, Robert Duvall, Kim Basinger, and Barbara Hershey, all great actors that bring life to this film and keep you wanting to watch more of them. The movie itself drags on as the simple storyline takes place over 138min, it's way to slow making you bag for it to end. You know from the start that Robert Redford is a great player, it's agonizing to watch him slowly get recognized by everyone else; as the ending is predicated from the start.",5,0,1,27 February 2020
Cloverfield," Baffled
","Why is this rated so high? The entire movie is filmed from a hand camera; its shaky and shot with weird angles. I know thy are trying to make it look real, but it makes it hard to watch. And the monsters might look cool, but the CGI is really bad. The only enjoyable part was seeing familiar actors such as Lizzy Caplan from Masters of Sex, Mike Vogel from Under the Dome and Odette Annable from Supergirl.",3,0,2,19 January 2020
"I, Tonya"," Fascinating, but dreary
","The story of I Tonya is a hard story to swallow, knowing that its true, draws the watcher right in. Its an entertaining tale thats hard to believe is true, but not one that will leave you with a good feeling at the end. The acting is spot on, the script flows nicely, and the filming is great. But the film is essentially one depressing movie to view.",7,1,1,15 June 2020
Final Destination 2," so-so
","The lines are cheesy, the filming is bad and Ali Larter is the only decent actress on this entire show. The only interesting part of the movie is the creative way people die in this film. If you loved the fist film, then you might like this one too.",5,0,0,5 January 2020
Blade II," Better Then the First
","This film follows suit with the first, as it's mainly about Wesley fighting/Killing creatures. I appreciate the fact that this movie has less gore then the first, but instead it is replaced by some terrible CGI. There are some plot holes in this movie, but the story is more interesting then the first film.",6,0,1,10 January 2020
Nacho Libre," Theres's Dumb and then There's Dumb
","The storyline of the movie moves so slowly, that it leaves you board, while waiting for the movie to get to the action! The comedy relief is so dumb that its no longer funny. This movie is only for die hard Jack Black fans",1,0,5,20 December 2019
Closer," What Was the Point of This Film?
","Let me just start out by saying; the acting was amazing, flawless. But the film itself was exhausting! The time jumps were very annoying and the story has no depth to it. The movie ends the way it started, leaving most of the characters miserable. You're left feeling, why did I watch this?",3,4,6,15 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Pretty Good Film
","This film did a good job in capturing the heart of Captain America; Chris Evens did a perfect job of playing the role. The rest of the cast, Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving also helped bring this movie father up to standards. The film had a well picked cast, great filming and a solid story. The tone of the movie is a little gloomy since it's set during world war 2 and Captain America doesn't have the most appealing powers/abilities like other heroes. But the movie is still very entertaining and a must see to fully understand other marvel movies.",7,1,1,29 December 2019
Bird Box," Loved This Film
","We need more films like this. I found this movie had the perfect amount of suspense, horror and heart to it to make into a very entertaining movie. The cast was well chosen and amazing in the film, especially the kids! Even though they didn't explain the background on the creatures or what they even look like, that was okay. I find by not knowing it lets your own imagination come up with an answer; which in all honesty can be much scarier then the writers could have come up with. I also find this movie very original! I watch lots of horror films and I have never seen one based on not being able to look at the monsters. It was a cool idea to implement into a movie; the thought of living in a world blind folded is a very interesting idea.",10,3,7,8 January 2020
"I, Robot"," 'The Fact That I Told You So, Just Doesn't Quite Say It'
","Even though the CGI isn't the best in the film, everything else makes up for it! The storyline is very intriguing, the acting is spot on and the facial expressions used for Sony are very impressive. I love the technology ideas they came up with in the movie for what the future might look like, very creative!",9,1,1,26 January 2020
American Beauty," Rough Start, Good Ending
","The beginning of the movie came across as boring, watching a messed up family have a middle life crisis, but as the film progressed it improved greatly. The humor in the film and the extreme difference in the characters made the show come to life. The acting of Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening was beyond impressive. They brought a whole new level to the screen as they took their characters from one end to the spectrum to the other. They also showed the raw feelings of how life can take you into a rut with how tough and hard it can be. The only thing I found difficult to watch was an older man having graphic sexual fantasies about an under aged girl, and acknowledging that they acted those scenes out in real life.",8,0,1,6 February 2020
Divergent," Greatly Disappointed
","I was looking forward to this film because I greatly enjoyed the books, but after watching the movie I was really disappointed. The books are a lot more rough with more gore, more heartache, the world is much more grim and the people are much harsher. This Film downgraded the hardship and brutality that was originally depicted in the book leaving you with a soft movie. It also cut out some very important scenes.Looking at the movie for its face value, by not comparing it to the book; its an okay film. The acting isn't the best but its well filmed and the storyline is very entertaining to watch.",5,0,0,29 December 2019
She's the Man," Fun teenage comedy
","I think they did a great job with this show. It has the perfect amount of humor and romance all thrown into one big pot creating something that's fun to watch. It might be a little cheesy in some areas, but that's all part of the fun. They also picked a decent cast for the movie; they make good eye candy, but also bring some humor to the table. The show might not have you busting a gut in laughter, but its easy and entertaining to watch.",8,0,0,11 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not that Great
","Great acting, Great Visuals, love the older feel, Great ending. Everything else was very boring. The film dragged on for what felt like forever, with very little action or interesting storline in between.",6,1,2,23 December 2019
P.S. I Love You," Sad but Good
","P.S I Love You is a refreshing Romance film to watch. It isn't full of Clichés nor is it cheesy, instead it's full of heart, sorrow, and new beginnings. The story was beautifully written, putting in just enough humor to lighten the mood of the serious demeanor of the film. The actors portrayed the characters in a very endearing and relatable way; so that you felt you could connect with them and bear their pain. Overall, a very good film.",8,0,0,23 January 2020
A Bug's Life," Great for all Audiences
","One of my favorite childhood films! This movie is a great film to show your kids or even watch for yourself. The animation for its time was very well done and the voices were well chosen. The story is very entertaining as you follow flik on his journey to save his colony from the grasshoppers. It's filled with humor, innocent love, friendships and action. The grasshoppers might be scary for a younger audience, but most Disney villains are.",9,0,0,5 January 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," Torture to Watch
","I understand that this movie might be considered a masterpiece because of the amazing filming, the technology for it's time and maybe even the acting! But, this movie is so incredibly slow that it is beyond boring. This is literally the most boring film I have ever watched in my life. Why do I want to watch monkeys jumping around for a half an hour and then watch a man walk through a ship for another half an hour? Why is this movie rated so high? You have to be a hard core movie lover/sci-fi lover to enjoy this film; even then it's debatable.",1,5,11,20 January 2020
Thor," Fun movie
","Great movie! The storyline is very well done! I love how they show Asgard and explain how everything fits into place. The humor is very tasteful, mixed with a good amount of action. The only thing that could have used some improving was the way they filmed the film. The shakey camera and weird angles are a little annoying, but the rest of the film makes up for this. Very good choice in the cast, could not have picked a better actor for Thor or Loki. Natalie Portman's part isn't the best. She has cheesy lines and her acting doesnt flow right, even though she is a talented actress. She does better with serious parts inatead of light and comical. This movie is very clean and makes a great fun movie for the entire family.",7,5,6,28 December 2019
A Beautiful Mind," Beautifuly Done
","You have to be prepared before watching; this isn't a nice comedy or a story about a hero; instead its a very intense film about the boundaries of love. The full realization of how mental illness can effect a person was written so beautifully in this film that it will capture your attention to the fullest. Russell Crowe mastered his role in this film, making you fall in love with his character and making your heart break for him. Jennifer Connelly also played her part with a graceful skill of perfection. This film was very well done. The only reason I cannot give it a 10, is that the ending is very hard to swallow; that it leaves you with a very unhappy feeling.",9,0,0,5 January 2020
Burlesque," Fun and cute
","I'm not too sure why this got a 6.4 rating! It's not the most in depth show, but the acting is very well done! With many familiar cast members from other well loved movies. The singing is amazing, so is the dancing! If your looking for a fun flick with sexy dancers and nothing too in depth, this is a good choice!",9,1,1,15 December 2019
The Reader," Does Not Leave You With A Good Feeling
","The acting in this film was superb. The message was a very enlightening one about the holocaust , but it was also very depressing. The outcome of this boys life was a little extreme and left you hanging at the end saying 'What?'. I understand Kate Winslets role and part in the film, it was very powerful. But what was the point of Michael Berg? He was a no one, who fell in love, then devastated by the truth, became miserable and never lived a happy life, who remained a no one. The ending left you with a feeling of 'Why did I Watch this?'",5,1,2,17 December 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Compared To the Book, This Movie Is Rubbish
","In all honesty, you may or may not like this film. It all depends what your expectation are and what you are looking for.Everyone knows, the books are literally a woman's fantasies about BSDM sex, so please do not expect this movie to be something sweet and cute like most love storiesIf I was to rate the movie based only on the movie and not the book, it's a shallow, poorly written, mediocre acting film that's much better then the normal porno, but it's more something to waist time with. You can't expect wonders from it, It's not the Notebook, but it's not the worst thing in the world either. A bit of sex, some BSDM, and a messed up love story. No one dies, or is brutally beaten, people have exaggerated a little too much on the movie.Now, If I was to rate the movie based from the books, this is a load of garbage. Fifty shades is supposed to have fifty personalities that he shifts to and from quite dramatically, but in this movie, fifty is just one thing, brooding. There is no depth to the character and the acting is beyond poor. Same with Anastasia, the actress has played the part so poorly that it's infuriating. They have cut out so many important scenes or have slightly rewritten them so that you do not understand the characters like they are shown in the book. Even the sex scenes are so poorly done compared to the books, they were so much better and showed that fifty was all about trust and finding connection with Anna. Yes fifty liked to punish his subs in the book, but he also made it very clear to Anna what she would be getting into. Because he did not want to take advantage of her. Where in the movie this is shown more like he is a predator. In all honesty in the books, it's Anna that's really messed up with her thinking, where as fifty is a broken character that grows and develops into something better.The movie has shamed the book, it did not do it justice.",4,0,2,17 February 2020
Iron Man," Great Superhero Movie
","Its hard to find a top notch superhero film. I think this one meets those standards. Its very well filmed, with a perfect cast. Full of good gritty action mixed with the perfect amount of humor. The movie has a perfect stoyline that sucks you right in. I love that Tony is a genius, but he doesnt meet the average cliche of being nerdy. Instead he's a mix of a playboy and a man who loves his weapons; he knows his mind and what he wants; Making him a solid guy. They did a fantastic job depicting this character.",8,0,0,28 December 2019
The Sixth Sense," Wow. Great Horror Film!
","Haley Joel Osment makes this movie! He is the most incredible child actor I have ever seen! The way this film is done it's a masterpiece! It will have you scared in many places, but also fascinated at the same time, while you search for answers to what is going on. This film was so well done that it will be one of the greats for many years to come.",10,1,1,5 January 2020
Final Destination," Cheesy
","The filming and lines are very cheesy, but the show is still enjoyable. The idea behind the movie is entertaining and it's nice to see so many familiar actors in the film.",6,0,0,5 January 2020
The Matrix," Beyond Excellent
","It's hard to put words together to describe how good this movie is. Everything about it was very well done. The acting is superb for all cast members in this film. The graphics are very good for its time, with great filming. The storline will blow your mind and have you really thinking. It's a movie you have to rewatch again and everytime you do it gets better because you pick up on more details you missed the first time. The film has really good action scenes that are wildly entertaining. Everything about this film deserves two thumbs up.",10,0,0,28 December 2019
50_50," Intense
","The movie is more intense and extremely real, then I expected since it is rated as a comedy. It's a very down to earth film that causes it to be a little depressing as it shows the entire struggles and reality as a person battles cancer. The overall movie was very well written and really managed to hit the heart strings. It was fascinating to watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting as he transformed his character from one spectrum to another. But Anna Kendrick's part was poorly written as it didn't flow right with the movie. Her lines were awkward and no therapist is that unprofessional or clueless. I feel this movie would have been better with more comic relief.",7,0,0,6 February 2020
The Runaways," Rock 'N Roll, Sex, and Drugs
","When I watched this film, I wasn't expecting much, but was greatly surprised from what I saw. Coming from a person that doesn't like Kristen Stewarts acting, she did a perfect job of portraying Joan Jett. I love Joan Jett as a singer, her voice is fantastic and even though she's all girl, she acts like a boy; Kristen Stewart portrayed this to a tee. I am also very impressed with Dakota Fanning; she has always been such a good actress, and she will not fail your expectations in this film. It was very entertaining to watch the True Story of how the Runaways started and ended. This movie did a great job portraying the events of what happened, making it flow well, and very entertaining to watch. If interested in further learning more about this band, there is a great documentary called 'Edgeplay', with the real band members talking about what happened.",9,1,1,22 January 2020
Gladiator," A Master Piece
","Everything about this film was extremely well done. The acting was superb! Russel Crowe makes you truely feel for him amd Jaqulin Phenoix makes you utterly hate him. The fighting scenes are extremely enteraining and interesting! The story portrayed in the film is very moving and is an attention grabber from the start of the Movie. The tone of the show is quite serious, but that's expected with this kind of genre. If you love sword fighting shows then this is a must see.",10,2,3,16 January 2020
Donnie Darko," Wierd
","The film definitely catches your attention as you try and figure out what in the world is going on. They did a great job with Frank the Rabbit; he is thoroughly creepy! Jake Gyllenaal acted his part to perfection, he will give you chills at some parts in the movie with how intense and creepy he can be with his character. The other cast members were also a lot of fun to watch as there were lots of familiar faces in the film. The only downfall is that the movie might leave you a little confused.",7,0,0,19 January 2020
