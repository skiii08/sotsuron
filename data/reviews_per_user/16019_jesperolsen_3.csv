Antz," Animated movies comes much better than this.
","I just don't know what to make of this movie. The characters are unbelievable ugly, they just don't have that cute kind of look, that I like to see in animated movies. Many of the characters actually look like the actors that does the voice overlays. Sylvester Stallone and Gene Hackman as ant look-alike could have been funny, but it just isn't. The humour, the one-liners in this thing are few, and many of them will escape the youngest viewers, as will some of the plot.Conclusion: 'Antz' is watchable becourse it does have some good parts, but if you're going to see a computer animated family movie, you're much better off with 'Monsters, Inc.' or 'A Bug's Life'.6 of 10",Null,0,0,17 July 2002
Memento," Confusing, therefore great.
","Imagine yourself not being able to remember what you did, said or whom you've met 5 minutes ago. That would make everyday life very difficult, not to mention trying to solve a murder on your own. This is basically  what this movie is all about. Using flashbacks to the extent where the story actually goes backwards, is where 'Memento' gets interesting. This way of clipping makes you feel a little lost, exactly as the main character. It's a brilliant piece of movie making, but if you're going to watch it, make sure you give it your full attention. If you are one of those ,while watching a movie, asks everybody else 'Who's that?' or 'Why did she do that?', this movie is NOT for you.Rating: 8/10",Null,0,2,25 July 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," A 'must see' for all ages.
","This is simply the best animated movie I have ever seen. This one tops any other Pixar animation to date. Not only is it very well animated, but the story, characters and the humor is just top shelf. It is really a shame to compare it to 'Shrek', as many people tend to do. The humor in 'Monsters, Inc.' is very different from 'Shrek', and even if I like this one the best, both of them can hold their own.This movie is a 'must see' for all ages. I'm not much for giving 10's, but 'Monsters, Inc.' comes very very close.Rating: 9/10",Null,0,1,23 July 2002
