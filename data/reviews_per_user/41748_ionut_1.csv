Requiem for a Dream," so much for love
","This is not an anti-drug propaganda. This is not 'another' movie. This is not a movie for everyone to understand. This is not for everyone to see. This is not for happy normal people, with great tales, great memories, great families. This is not a rewarded Oscar movie, which isa shame. This movie changed my life forever. I think that the only guilt or sin or mistake of the characters is not the drug-addiction, but the selfishness. They wanted 'more', which is understandable...but they forgot the real purpose...they imagined love so deep, but they forgot to share it, they forgot the only thing that could keep them alive. This is a love dusted drama in my opinion, filled with sorrow and regrets. The fact that they somehow understand their mistakes is the only punishment they deserve, but unfortunately not the only one they get...You may do whatever you have to do in order to be happy, but when you put yourself alone on the throne, here comes the dark fallen angel of solitude.There is no escape from yourself...somehow you realize that you were not meant only for yourself, and that is when the real hell begins...and if you're not too old, too dirty, too late or too weak, as our four characters...you still have a chance...if not , here comes paranoia. The movie is a 10, but deserves a 20, maybe in a less twisted world.",Null,0,1,8 February 2002
