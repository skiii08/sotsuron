First Man," Decent flick but very dry
","Some great acting by a number of the cast and brought life to new part of the story. However, it dragged on and was very dry, reminiscent of A Thin Red Line. Worth the watch but don't expect to be blown away.",6,1,3,21 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great acting, no plot, no ending, no entertainment value
","Was excited to see this as I'm a big fan of QT, but was nearly 3 hours of dry, slow paced nothingness I can only compare to the ramblings of a demented uncles on his last legs. Great performances by Pitt and DiCaprio, but not enough to compensate for the poor writing and no ending.",2,22,42,28 August 2019
Aladdin," Hollow and Uninteresting
","What a disappointment. Never managed to develop a connection to the characters. Songs that were key to the story were flat and dry. Character motivations were unclear Script is a big part of the problem, terrible. Massive gaps in the story like e.g. How did Jafar know Aladdin is the 'Diamond in the rough'.. that was basically left out with no explanation. Poor actor choice in the leads, if you call it acting. So disappointing Disney, you should started again.",2,1,3,25 January 2020
