It," Well i'm sad
","Wow wow wow, don't judge by the title! This movie... I can't even think of the perfect word for how great It: Chapter one is! Some of you guys won't believe me: I watched it 11 times. I got a lot of Funko Pop's from It, even the 3 'limited Chase editions', I got 3 Neca Replica's and I've made some things, like fan-art, myself. But there is one problem. I'm only 14 years old. When chapter one came out I was 12. So I can't watch the movie in the cinema! Welp, I can't change it I guess. One of the biggest fans in The Netherlands gotta wait. I mean, I can deal waiting for Annabelle coming home or Chucky playing with childs. But a clown who turns into *SPOILER*?! C'mon, I've also read the book! By the way, you guys delivered good work Andy and Barbara Muschietti!",10,0,1,30 June 2019
