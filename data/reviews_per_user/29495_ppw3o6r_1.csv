Vertigo," The definitive Hitchcock picture, and one of the greatest movies ever made
","How can I begin to describe how much I truly adore this film? To me there is no there story that expresses the intense emotional desires depicted here. I believe that Jimmy Stewart truly outdid himself here-an even greater performance than his portrayal of Jefferson Smith. The metamorphosis Scottie undergoes is the highest emotional arc of a character I have ever witnessed. Kim Novak's inexperience and nervousness led to her stiff portrayal of Madeline. A truly brilliant script that has no real equal. I believe that Hitchcock truly revealed more of himself here than in any of his other work. North By Northwest, Psycho, and Notorious are all great movies-but I find that they will never match up to the masterpiece that is VERTIGO.",10,2,3,25 April 2006
