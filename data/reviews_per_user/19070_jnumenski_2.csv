The Avengers," The people who rated this film have to be under 15 years of age
","First off. There is no way this film is even close to a 9 rating (it's at 8.8 or something now) NO WAY.The people who are saying the film is a 9 are most likely hyper teenagers who sit home all day, and don't read anything, and watch reality TV - they don't know what is good and what is terrible.This film is dull. Has no emotion (forced doesn't count), and often times is ridiculous. Though what saves it is the fact it makes fun of itself which is funny. Normally I would rate really low but that humour makes it a little better.It was well done for what it is. But I think what happened is the last few comic book movies (except for batman) were so bad that people were surprised with this one, expecting it to suck. So I read things like this is the greatest film ever, or 'A+' rating. You have to be joking.One of the things that really gets to me is one part in particular. The HULK Is this un-controllable force. He almost destroys the ship. Makes sense.Then next thing you know he is fighting ALONG with the avengers. UM..HELLO!!?? how the hell did that happen. Oh they magically tamed the beast or something? Banner says 'my secret is I always stay angry' (something like that) and then turns into the hulk and starts fighting the aliens. This makes no sense.So if he had this mentality all along why did he want to kill everyone on the ship? Nothing was learned. I mean he saves Iron Man later. But on the ship he wanted to kill Thor and others. ????? HUGE GAP. Anyone with half a brain would question this. I enjoy watching this more in cartoon form because the ridiculousness makes sense.",6,5,14,12 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," terrible
","There were some people clapping at the end of this movie, and I was thinking...geeez, those people must be on something, or a little slow. NO WAY a properly functioning person would clap for this garbage. This movie has so many obvious (I do realize this is a film BUT) plot holes it is ridiculous. It really is.Second, the defence for people who admit it is slow but say it is a really good movie, is basically, well if you just listened to the dialogue then you would realize it is a good movie! Um no. See that might be possible if they didn't decide to amp Bane's voice super loud (Oh I get it, make him feel strong by making his voice really loud and powerful.. OH SILLY ME!). I barely understood anything he was saying. And when I did I thought, wow, that is really corny.And I know why Bane is strong in comic book land, but in this real world for Nolan, it made no sense. So you're telling me he has superhuman strength how? What now? And you don't explain it, just let people figure it out. OK sure, whatever you say.Also, there are so many themes repeated from the past film. Oh boy... You have outdone yourself this time Mr. Nolan. It must be from that damn scarf you wear around your neck.Oi.Bad movie. I mean just bad. Seriously, save your money.",2,4,15,6 August 2012
