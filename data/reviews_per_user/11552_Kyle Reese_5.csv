The Rock," This has to be one of the greatest action movies of all time
","This is an absolutely amazing movie, it is an action movie with a plot. Fantastic performances from Ed Harris and Sean Connery, who enthrall the audience in every scene, although Ed Harris is faultless, Connery had the bad luck of getting a few bad puns. Nicolas Cage is good in this role. And of Course Michael Biehn is brilliant in this role, probably the best film he's done to date. The ROCK is crammed with explosions, shootouts, a fantastic car chase too. The Music score to the film is absolutely fantastic, and really makes the film a great success. David Morse and William Forsythe also provide great performances. I can't find many worth while faults with this movie, simply fantastic!!!",10,1,1,12 May 2001
Alien 3," The Bitch is back, but Hicks isn't
","This film is certainly the worst of the saga, but it is not a bad film, and I believe it is harshly treated. I watched this movie a day after seeing ALIENS, and after the pleasing ending to ALIENS, was immediately depressed when I expected Michael Biehn's name to appear on screen and didn't. Even more so, when Hicks, along with Newt, are killed off within the first few minutes of the film. The absence of weapons should add to the suspense of the film, after all, the weapons in the 1st film are rarely handled, and still it was a success. The fact that we don't have Vasquez and Drake blasting the walls down, does not mean the film can't be enjoyable.Some excellent performances from the cast, British actors Brian Glover, Charles Dance, Ralph Brown and the unlucky Paul McGann, his character suffered huge editing and we fail to see what happens to his character in the film. Charles S Dutton gives us the American touch and is VERY good in his role. And of course, the superb Lance Henriksen, makes a welcome appearance as Bishop, and the sight of him softened the blow of having my hero Michael Biehn on the top of K2 at the time of this movie. Henriksen is excellent in this role and to date is the only actor (other than Weaver) to appear in more than 1 Alien film. Don't judge Alien3 so hard, the more you watch it, the more it can be appreciated, and it is as much a part of the Saga as any other of the movies. It is a good film, despite the amazing competition in the Saga, this film is severely under-rated!",Null,0,2,7 July 2001
The Terminator," My favourite movie of all time
","The Terminator is my favourite movie of all time, it has everything I look for in a film, action, love, an excellent music score, an excellent cast, including my favourite actor Michael Biehn. I love everything about this film, in it's day, nothing had ever been seen like it, and is still highly entertaining today. When thinking about the films relatively modest budget, what was achieved was amazing. Although the model of Schwarzenegger is not as impressive as the one used in the sequel, it can be tolerated and is an extremely small flaw in a fantastic film. The car chases, gun-battles and explosions are nicely interluded by an intriguing plot and a love story. The Terminator is so much more than just an action films, it explores many issues and successfully brings them all to our screens.      The best character is Kyle Reese, portrayed by Michael Biehn, in the role that launched his career. Reese is the best hero character of any, and Biehn is highly entertaining in every scene he appears in. It is isn't every day that a viewer will have a film character to be his idol, but Reese is simply cool and the kind of guy every teenager wishes they could grow up to be. The humor in the film comes from the police characters of Traxler and Vukovich, portrayed admirably by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen. They are a perfect combination in the film and every scene they appear in is enjoyable. They're deleted scenes on the new DVD are a must. Henriksen was a Cameron regular, appearing in Piranha II, and later in ALIENS, along with Michael Biehn as well. The brilliant Bill Paxton also makes a cameo here and he would go on to be Cameron's most used actor to date. The Terminator has it all and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.",10,0,0,12 May 2001
Tombstone," Best Western I've ever seen without a doubt
","I've never been a huge fan of Westerns, but this films is absolutely fantastic! The actors are tremendous, Val Kilmer is fantastic as Holliday and this is certainly his best role! Michael Biehn is super as Johnny Ringo and I enjoyed all of his scenes. His expressive eyes say so much, even when he isn't saying anything, you know what Ringo is thinking, and Biehn does super in this role and is my favorite character! Kurt Russell is also very cool in this film and pretty tough! And of course, who can forget Bill Paxton, his fifth and final film alongside Michael Biehn to date, after first appearing together in The Lords of Discipline 10 years previously. This is however the first time Paxton is credited above Biehn! Paxton is great as ever! I really do enjoy this film, the good score from Bruce Broughton is one I long to own on CD!",10,0,0,11 August 2001
The Sixth Sense," AWFUL
","I hated this film, it was boring, Osmond is not a likeable character or actor, i find him very annoying. My girlfriend loves the film, but i can't see it myself! Turned it off in fury! Do not watch this movie if you are expecting a good one! Chuck Norris is more entertaining! Hail Chuck!",1,2,10,4 February 2002
