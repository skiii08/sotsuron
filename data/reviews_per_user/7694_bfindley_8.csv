Spartacus," Thanks Kirk!
","Spartacus, the Greco-Roman himself. Douglas' finest effort. An excellent effort Mr. Douglas.   The late Mr. John Dall (1918-1971) superb as Glaborus. The story of the yearning for freedom.  A story  unknown to the world prior to July 4, 1776.",Null,0,2,7 March 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Move over Stan, I think I'm going to be sick
","NEVER has there been such a fine story line ruined by such language that would cause one to be thrown out of the seediest raunchiest honky tonk dive in the South East, or any where else in the nation. 'Beavis and Butthead do America' and 'Porky's I' were dirty, but HILARIOUS.Call me an 80's throwback if you will. If you do, thank you for the compliment.",1,2,24,9 July 1999
The Grapes of Wrath," in certain situations poverty and laziness go hand in hand - GRAPES OF WRATH IS NOT ONE OF THEM!
",Henry Fonda at his absolute best as paroled 'Young Tom Joad'  60 years ago. A classic. A classic tale of the American style caste system - the wealthy attempting to remain so. And the masses  driven from Oklahoma to  what is believed to be a 'Promised Land' in search of greener pastures. Yet finding only continued class struggle more so than was EVER to be found  in Oklahoma. As stated - poverty and laziness being automatically synonymous.ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE! I would highly recommend 'Grapes of Wrath' for those who are inclined to believe so.,Null,2,4,3 May 2000
1941," Pickens Cool in this 1
","Japanese bomb Pearl harbor then set sites on Hollywood. They come across Hollis Wood (Slim Pickens) saying 'where Hollywood?''You're looking at him.' 'What?' 'Hollis Wood. Cant you speak english?' (They were japanese militia, Mr. Pickens, you good ole boy you!)Then the compass in the cracker jack that Wood swallowed then the Japanese force fed him prune juice then sent him to the toilet then Pickens made that scream then threw his boot in the toilet - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!",Null,2,2,26 July 1999
Slap Shot," Bawdy,------- brutal,-------- goonish, -----raw,-------------violent, ------------- HYSTERICAL!
","Newman and Martin are back ten years after Cool Hand Luke and the Captain, this time as friends and allies on the failing Charlestown Chiefs hockey team. Martin (J. McGrath) picks up three brothers from The Iron League , the Hansons, at a reasonable rate. And the odyssey begins, the Chiefs punch , kick, brawl, and generally steamroll over their fellow  Federal league teams to the Federal League Championship.A tremendous story of the Underdog getting his chance in the sun, [ a la 'The Longest Yard' {1974} ] (yet under much less adverse circumstances than 'Longest yard' ) which is a seemingly unpopular concept [ in my opinion, by the way]  here in the early 21st century.",Null,1,4,25 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick out does himself!
","The all time sci-fi absolute classic of all movie history. The manned space flight to Jupiter. Falling into total failure. What, however was the cause of this failure? Was HAL actually predicting a radio wave of extreme power aimed at Jupiter from Earth's moon? Was it man's paranoia due to this prediction and man's distrust of technology, possibly the paranoia of HAL? Possibly all 3 ?Thought provoking!",Null,1,3,13 August 2000
Titanic," A hypnotic effect. Leo, Kate, Billy, Gloria, the rest of you, may God Bless
","Absolutely mind boggling. I don't think a thing in the world of going to the gent's room umpteen times or stepping out to smoke a cigarette during most movies. This movie had a hypnotic effect on me (first saw at theater in Savannah - Dec 26, 1997) like no other movie has ever had. I absolutely could not help but love this wonderful masterpiece about the worst sea disaster in history. Jake, Elwood, I'm sorry, but I have a new favorite. Nothing personal. I hope you understand.",Null,1,2,14 January 1999
Any Given Sunday," Brutal, Maximum and Extreme Contact, Smashmouth, In your face
","Which is how football is intended to be played. No domes. In all sorts of natural elements. The Miami Sharks of AFFA are on something of alosing streak late in the season. In walks an up start ex cornerback  rag tag named Willie Beamon (Jamie Foxx). Placed at QB By coach D'Amato. A pair of obvious alternatives make themselves manifest. Beamon can call his own plays and leads the team deep into the AFFA playoffs , or listen to Coach D'Amato's plays, and liekely have less success . (All due respect to the old grizled battle hardened coach D'Amato)Not Mr. Stone's best work , but certainly worth viewing.",Null,0,0,18 October 2000
