Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You knew what you were letting yourselves in for...
","I just had to post a comment after reading some of the comments from the 1 star brigade slating Sacha as a racist and how the movie portrays various races/countries. If you think along these lines then you really have no sense of humour or irony whatsoever and shouldn't really go and see or comment on a movie like this in the first place. Anybody with half a brain realises that Kazakhstan may not be 100% as portrayed (in the same way any US movie portrays the UK as all country houses and toffs speaking posh) and that being a Jew, perhaps he is trying to make a statement about anti-semetic people in general rather than slagging off his own religion....The only people who came out of it badly for me were the ones who deserved to, ie the college jock and the guy at the rodeo. The dinner party people and the antique shop owners came across as genuine people, and because of this there reactions were all the more amusing. He just gave people the rope to hang themselves with and some did a fine job, others came out with some dignity intact.It certainly is the funniest movie i've seen for a while but with the state of comedy at the cinema its not saying much.",7,2,8,17 November 2006
