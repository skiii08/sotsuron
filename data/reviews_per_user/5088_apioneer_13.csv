Catch Me If You Can," How director/actors ruin a beautiful script
","I heard a lot about this film.I saw it today and thought it was a brilliant script and how the big name director and star actors ruined a beautiful script.This film was about brilliant characters of Frank and his father which should have been played in a unique way not just plain ,the way Martin Sheen and Leonardo played them.Tom Hanks looked like a stupid who could not capture a victim who is right in front of him like four times.Can you imagine that FBI would act like that and let the guy run around like that??? Leonardo, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner were more concerned about what they are wearing and how they look rather than getting into depths of these wonderful characters. It was not a comedy as I read the script and Spielberg could not get the script and just made it a plain movie .Give this film to British directors and actors and see what a wonderful classic film they will make out of it.",1,3,21,7 June 2005
The Danish Girl," The Director did not understand a deep character
","I saw the film and thought that the director Tom Hooper(The King's Speech) did not understand the character of Lili. In the beginning we see Einar(Eddie Redmane) as a happy and successful painter living with his wife and we have no idea that he is a transgender. I found that out when his wife puts make up on him and he puts on women's clothes. Thats where the problem started for me. People who are transgender or gay/lesbian donot become transgender if someone else puts lipstick on their lips or get them to wear female clothing. They are human beings going through the identity issues since childhood. They live a very depressed life and they are little different than normal people. I wish the director had done some homework and met some of these people to know what they went through. Neither did the actor Eddie Redmane made the effort to meet some transgender people and do some research. Actors get the script and they just jump into playing a role without doing homework.I was trying to like the film but when the wife gets him ready to go to the party and dresses him as a woman and then later she gets really upset and mad because another man was sitting with Lily and getting close, it totally threw her off. That does not make any sense. The wife made her husband vulnerable and now she is all upset. Lily says at one point she believes she is a woman inside and wife says that she believes it too. How can she believe that, she is not the one going through these feelings and emotions which Lily is experiencing. Then Lily was crying so hard when he was about to get the surgery but right before that scene he was all happy with the surgery. The actors did put some emotions into the film but the story was not developed and we did not have any antagonist. Eddie Redmane is a good actor as I saw him in 'The Theory of Everything'. He should be selective of roles and must do home work and research if he takes on to do these important characters.I am giving it 3 stars because the cinematography was beautiful and Alicia Vikander and Amber Heard had some good talent which can be utilized in another stronger film.",3,34,69,1 December 2015
Don Jon," Bad Acting and Directing
","I wanted to see Joseph Gorden- Levitt's movie Don Jon, because I saw him in 'Mysterious Skin' directed by Gregg Araki. Joseph was good when he was young. He really knew how to act and he would put emotions in the character which would make you cry. But I was totally disappointed at Joseph in this character in Don Jon. He forgot how to act. He thought that he could really play a New Yorker and Italian plus Joseph, comedy is really hard. You are not a comedy actor. Why would you choose to write and direct and then you wanted to be a lead actor in it too. There was no real plot in the film and actors were just superficial and there was nothing natural about them. There was vulgar sex like every 10 minutes as if that was the way to keep audience engaged. Scarlett Johansson was struggling to produce New Yorker accent and I don't really care about her acting anyways. I don't know who wanted to put money into this film. Ryan Kavanaugh kept putting money into bad films that's why he is bankrupt.",1,3,8,10 April 2016
Black Mass," I liked Johnny Depp for the first time for his performance and Joel Edgerton should win an Oscar!
","Saw 'Black Mass' today and enjoyed the film very much. I liked Johnny Depp for the first time for a character he chose to perform and showed his real talent and proved that he is a good actor. He has been doing all these crazy Pirates movies and never looked at him as an actor with substance who is careful of picking his roles. But Johnny Depp has proved that he can give a great performance once again. He can be a great antagonist who you can root for. Usually in a movie like this , director forgets that people want to relate to someone. I could totally relate to Whitey Bulger as a father and a guy who loves and gets along with his family including his mother and brother. That made me totally root for him but at the same time I know that this character is a monster and he will meet his fate and get caught. I thought Scott Cooper truly did a great job by bringing all these stories together into a cohesive plot. I could totally relate to the character of young man in the beginning who was hit by a bunch of guys and slowly I was introduced to Whitey. The actor Joel Edgerton totally stole the show. Every scene he was in, he put his heart and soul into it. I know Johnny Depp did a phenomenal job but I thought Joel totally surprised me by his performance. He should be nominated for an Oscar for such a brilliant performance and win.Scott Cooper! I congratulate you for doing such a great job for making a film which gives me hope that Hollywood can still put money behind good films. Do not pay any attention to all these people who only want to see cinema just in one way. They just want to see one character on the screen all the time and if you don't give them that , they get lost and complain about character development because Hollywood has trained their mind to look at films just in one way. You told the story in such a great way that it all made sense. You brought in the characters into the plot where they were needed and you just gave enough character development so that I could relate to them but at the same time your film kept me glued to my seat with powerful storytelling, stunning cinematography, incredible music and a strong ending.",9,0,1,24 November 2015
Lion," This Film has Oscars written all over it
","I had not read anything about this film and I went to see 'Lion' yesterday. I was moved, I was shocked. I had tears in my eyes and the hair on my skin stood up. I could listen to my own heart beats while watching this film. It has never happened to me before when I saw a film and I was touched immensely. The film took me back to my roots and streets where I grew up. I am from Pakistan and I have been living in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I come from that part of the world where this story takes place. I grew up in streets like the streets of the movie 'Lion'. I have met many children who collect garbage to make a living and are lost in the streets of this universe. They sleep alone on card board boxes at night and when you look at them , there is a question in their eyes. The world has forgotten about these children and there are thousands of these children on the streets of India and Pakistan. Do you really know what it feels like when you are only 5 years old and lost in some crowded street in a big city and do not know how to get home? To the boy who played Saroo (Sunny Pawar), I want to give you an Academy Award. The film grabs you from the beginning as it starts out with showing a beautiful relationship between two brothers who are running on a train track. The actress who played mother (Priyanka Bose)touched my heart. Her performance is breathtaking. The way she looks at her sons, shows you how a mother pours her heart with love when she looks at her children. There are no words to express that feeling and actress gave her full self and emotions to play this role from young to old. It is commendable and her acting moved me and reminded me of my own mother. There are so many things which I think my mother does not know about me but the way she looks at me, I know she knows. Lost Saroo looks around for Guddu at the dark train station and then looks for Guddu everywhere, in his thoughts for the rest of his life. What a beautiful role of Guddu played by Abhishek Bharate and what a promising actor! There were some real gripping performances in this film by actors which had only small roles in the film but they left their mark and touched me. I want to give a big hug to Garth Davis for choosing these powerful actors and giving them a chance to express their emotions. I must mention Tannishtha Chattergee, who knew her character and made a mark with just two scenes. Now that's called Actor.I have always seen Nicole Kidman in great grandeur roles. But I was shocked to see her in 'Lion'. A small role with few scenes. She gave herself all. Her performance in Lion is heartfelt. The cinematographer was able to capture her emotions and her heart on the big screen. David Wenham, plays the part of father to Saroo with amazing acting skills and warmth. Dev Patel, you did a good job.I want to give a big salute to all the filmmakers and actors who were involved in making this film. You have done an exceptional job and gave me something which will be in my mind and heart for a very long time.

Room," The Little Boy Gives Fantastic Performance
","Jacob Tremblay was amazing actor in the film 'Room', as he could really perform his role powerfully. I thought film had some good acting in it. The story was weak. I did want to get into the world of the kidnapper so that I could feel more for Ma and Jack.Why this kidnapper put them in this situation? That would have been more interesting. I was confined to this little room for more than 40 minutes of the film. Suddenly Ma decides that Jack has to help them get out of this situation. He was able to run away very easily and then the rest of the film was about their life at the grandparents. William Macy is a great actor but I don't know why he was needed in this role. He could have been a good kidnapper. Ma attempting suicide was not believable as no one who had been confined to a room would ever imagine committing suicide after what they both went through and were given a new life.Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were good as actors so I have some hope for them. Novels are whole different world from films.",7,1,10,20 November 2015
1917," '1917' has Academy Awards written all over it
","I just saw the film and I was mesmerized by the cinematography by Roger Deakins. It is so perfect and spotless. I liked both the actors, David Chapman and George Mackay. The casting was amazing because these two guys had their own looks which worked very well for both of them. One was innocent looking and other was stern looking. You keep rooting for one in the beginning and then later it changes. When I went to the theatre I told myself I am not going to cry and stay strong but at one point I just could not hold it anymore. A tear fell when he meets the brother.",10,17,41,17 December 2019
La La Land," I am heart broken and Damien Chazelle should 'Apologize'- No Oscars for this one
","Dear Damien, I really had great expectations for this film. I waited for a year to see this film. I was so excited that I walked ten minutes in the rain to go see this film. I am going to tell you what I felt about the film as I watched your film, so that you can learn something from my letter.I was very happy to see the initial traffic jam and the first song. I was thrilled to see what happens next? As soon as the film started, I started to feel there was no story line to keep me interested. There were no plot points. Who wrote this script? I could not relate to Emma Stone's character because there was nothing to look forward to regarding her goal. She was just an aspiring actress who was lost in Los Angeles failing auditions. Whats interesting about that? The film was dis-jointed. It was a big mess. The biggest mistake you made was to cast Ryan Gosling. This actor's face is bland. He is probably angry with someone on the set and it shows on his face. This guy has no expressions on his face. He has no idea how to act in certain scenes. He just keeps his face expression-less so that nobody can relate to him in the film. Deborah Aquila should have helped you find a better actor. Who selected Ryan's wardrobe? There was nothing interesting about his bland clothes to go with the musical. His emotions on his face do not match the flow of the story. Ryan, you are not a face for musical or romance or hero for a romantic comedy. You are a face of a villain or a boxing film. You should do those films. The way the director have these two characters meet is so weak. There was nothing romantic about how they meet. Emma Stone is a good actress but she kept (emotionally)staring in space in lot of scenes which were not removed in editing and it affected her performance. Acting with Ryan Gosling also affected her performance. There was one scene in the film where she goes and stands right in front of movie theater full of audience and nobody reacts or shouts as she stands in front of all of this audience while movie is playing. How unbelievable! I wanted to like something something in this film. I tried very hard. I wanted to like a scene where they are about to hold hands in movie theater but even Damien ruined that romantic scene by doing something stupid. I wont forgive you for that. Then someone gave you a museum to shoot in. You should have made best use of those scenes but you did not. There was nothing exciting about it. There were sound problems with car horns. It was so loud that I had to put fingers in my ears. Out of the blue an African American guy (John Legend) gives Ryan a deal and music contract. There was no development for that plot point. Damien you need to really work hard on screen writing skills. I wonder who gave you money to make this film for such a weak screenplay. At one point the African American guy says to Ryan.. you are pain in the as. Ryan! honestly you are pain in the .... I, so badly wanted to like this film and wanted some scene to touch me but when that moment came where Emma is called back for an audition. I thought she will tell her own story which was so powerful, she tells some aunt's story which made no sense to the story line. What a disaster! Emma says at the end...It hurts a little bit. You know what, I am hurt. I need Damien Chazelle and Ryan Gosling to send me apology letter for making such a bad film which I had to go and see . I was in tears when I left the theater. I am sure you will read this and you know where to write me. My IMDb email address. Best Regards, Z",2,64,128,16 December 2016
Eyes Wide Shut," Open Letter to Tom Cruise
","Mr. Tom Cruise, I just saw your movie Eyes Wide Shut. I know this film was directed by Stanley Kubrick, the master. The master has passed into spirit but I want to say something to you. Tom, your acting was so bad in this film that it made me cry. You really needed to understand this character. Stanley Kubrick did not understand this character but you are an actor and actors take months to understand their character. You did not know how to play a doctor because I am a doctor and I know I would never act or behave in cheap manners you did in the film. This character was a manipulator who is two faced. He is one face at home but another personality who is lustful and he is always trying to meet these women because he knows he can have them.He gets so excited about fulfilling his lustful dreams that he ends up in a wrong place. That's what this character was about. Get it! Tom Cruise you played this character flat. I was so bored. I was dying to see this two faced person but you did not think about this character and just played it with no homework. I read an interview of you with Peggy in Hollywood Reporter where you said, nothing is really happening for you. Hey if you start learning how to act, something might happen. Your film does not make any sense because of bad acting. Nicole Kidman overacted in this film so much that I would have to write a separate letter for her. If you want some acting lessons and understanding the character, have your agent call me. Thanks",2,0,8,19 October 2015
Steve Jobs," This film DOESNOT deserve Oscars
","Went to see the film in beautiful Castro theater. Throughout the whole film I kept looking for a protagonist. Someone I can relate to. You cannot relate to Steve Jobs because he is negative, horrible, user, manipulator and hurtful to everyone including his daughter and wife at all the times. I hate Steve Jobs after watching this film and it made me think that Mac/Apple was a product of an evil mind. I should never use these products. Steve Jobs keeps hurting all those people who are trying to help him. Good cinema gives the message of hope and love to its audience and I kept looking for it. I never found it. One little scene at the end wont do it. You keep sitting for 95 minutes to see some character talk about hope or love. There is none. I thought Kate Winslet character might show some hope. Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle were there at the screening. Someone asked about why Aaron portrayed Steve Jobs so horribly and he said this is the way he wanted to do it. He said he spent time with Steve Job's daughter to get more story elements. I think he should apologize to Steve Job's daughter as he did not show the girl in positive light till the last scene at the end. This movie does not deserve any Oscars. Michael Fassbinder and Kate Winslet were wasted in this film as they are good actors.",2,18,51,10 October 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," I think people who give Oscars are out of their mind
","I went to see Birdman because I saw that it was super hyped and won Oscars. As soon as the film began, I started to get uncomfortable trying to find a story or a plot. When there is no plot then actors can't do very much. I thought Micheal Keaton was awful along with all the other actors who were over acting. I could not relate to a single actor in the film. I kept thinking whats wrong with people who give out Oscars. I think they are old people in their 90's who have completely lost their minds. Whatever they cant understand they give it an Oscar. I hope the director and actors read this. If the screenplay was that bad , why did you choose to work in this film? You did not bring anything good to this film. Its a waste of people's time and money. hey Academy get your act together. Start thinking and stop giving Oscars to horrible films!!!",1,6,14,20 March 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson Puts Out of Work Big Name Actors in his movie and tells them, DONOT ACT
","What was this? I just saw Moonrise Kingdom. What has the world come to? I started watching the film and there is some talking about Music and Orchestra which has nothing to do with the story. Then I keep sitting and watching and hoping that I will relate to someone. None! Am I suppose to like the boy and the girl which have no expressions on their face? They are not like-able. It feels like director is trying to make fun of emotionless life in America. I keep thinking as I keep watching. Should I continue to watch this horrible boring movie which everybody is calling a new Style of film making? It feels like the director takes name actors (Who are out of Work) and tells them , hey I am making a movie and you just come and DO NOT ACT. Whatever the actors are trying to convey doesn't make sense. I keep watching and I am bored to death. It feels like Wes Anderson's target audience is under 10 years old. I have to call my 10 year old nephew tomorrow and ask him 'What was this horrible expressionless film about with a bunch of kids running around?' He might be able to tell me. No More Wes Anderson For Me.",1,3,7,14 November 2015
Joy," Big Stars Donot Read their Screenplays and DO NOT Deserve Oscars!
","This review is for David Russell to read and the studios who provide million of dollars to produce a film which is not worthy of any award and not worthy of even producing. We do not get the sense of real story but forced into stylistic directing and a big mess made with million of dollars spent for nothing. I could get that there was lot of comedy in the screenplay but the director did not know how to direct the scenes so that when people watch it ,they could laugh.Story: The film started out with the grandma telling the story. I was forced to look at the story from grandmother's point of view which was not really a big part of the film. Grandma had no role in who Joy was and her journey.It was a character which David thought would save the film in editing, but it did not. People are way smarter than you think. It seems like millions of dollars were spent to work days and days to shoot this film with director not really interested in the screenplay itself and after shooting the film, realizes that how he is going to create a film out of this big mess which he shot.Robert DeNiro: Robert is a good actor but I could see that he did not read the whole screenplay. Whenever you see him in the scene he is in, I could feel that he has no sense of his own character development in the story. All of his scenes had no cohesion. His acting in one scene is way off than his next scene. He is a divorced man who still lives in a basement of her daughter but he has not learned his lesson. I get that, what writer wanted to say, but the way character was portrayed was not believable. If DeNiro had read his full screenplay, then he could understand this character before playing it. It was Russell's job to make him read his screenplay. Him dating this new woman and every scene she was in made no sense.Bradley Cooper: OMG. I had some hopes for this guy after watching 'American Sniper'. But again he did not read the whole screenplay. He was totally out of character. His total focus was to play the role as seducer to Jennifer Lawrence. In his first scene when I saw him , I could see it in his eyes that he is just playing with Jennifer Lawrence on set without really caring about his character. Audience is not stupid. We can see what actor is doing on screen.If he has done his homework or not and if he is just seducing other women on set. Seems like David just brought you on set for few days and shot some of your scenes without really making you understand where this character is coming from.Jennifer Lawrence: Okay Jennifer! you are a good actress but you better choose and think carefully who you want to work with. Don't just accept roles because you worked with someone else before and they sent you a new screenplay. Film industry is brutal and if you do not pick your films wisely, you will be forgotten easily. I thought you were the only one in the film who understood the struggles of this woman Joy and you were true to the character. But how much can you do when other stars have not done their homework. You cannot make a good film by yourself. So you don't get an Oscar either because you pick wrong movies to work in.",1,19,47,26 December 2015
