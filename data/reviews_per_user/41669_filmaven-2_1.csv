Casablanca," One scene always bring tears to my eyes.
","It never fails, and I've seen the movie 20 times; when Paul Henreid leads the singing of the French national anthem (Le Marseillaise), I always start to weep. One reason the scene is so powerful is that many of the actors in 'Casablanca' were themselves refugees and they were not merely acting when singing the song -- it was quite emotional for them as well.",Null,0,0,22 December 2001
