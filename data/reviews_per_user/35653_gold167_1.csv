The Ring," All Subliminal
","Spoiler Alert!!!!!!! Its all subliminal this film is kinda spooky and creepy, having never seen the original I thought this was an oustanding visual film. It really gets into your brain. Yes usually the US remakes are never really up to standard just more glamourised but this was great Watch with caution this is a real CHILLER. The ending was for me non-understandable but apart from that (why duplicate it & watch it again she never sleeps???????) .....GREAT",8,0,0,24 October 2002
