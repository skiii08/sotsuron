Casablanca," good
","i was actually surprised at how much i liked this movie. i didn't expect to be as drawn into it as i was. the characters grew on me fast and that really kept me interested. i loved the character that Humphrey Bogart played. just his rough Brooklyn attitude really was awesome. i found the story of the letters really interesting. it kinda made you on the edge of your seat. the incorporation of the love story i thought made the movie. as bad as you feel for Humphrey at points, in the end you look at him as 'he's that man!' for doing what he did. everyone loves a heroic type guy in a movie and he played it great! the movie as a whole was very well shot. a lot of shadowy shots that really intrigued me and set the whole mood for the movie.",8,3,5,2 April 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," good film
","The Grapes of Wrath was a good film. I had started reading the novel by John Steinbeck back in high school and never finished it. But what I remember from it, it seemed as though i would find the movie interesting which i did. I was really captivated by the opening scene of the paved road in Oklahoma. Just with the telephone poles and everything it was a great opening scene to draw in viewers. the story itself of a man, Tom Joad, is one to grab anyones attention. The concept of Tom Joad(an ex convict) breaking his parole to move out west to California with his family was outstanding to me because it was sort of a bad-to-the-bone thing to do and thats definitely enough to get one like myself to watch any film.i definitely recommend this to everyone. It's just a classic and a need to see movie by everyone. i would watch it again if i got the chance!",7,0,1,6 March 2013
