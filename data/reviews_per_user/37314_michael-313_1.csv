"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Inspired by 'Les Girls'?
","Although 'Priscilla...' undoubtedly stands alone as a brilliant film, I have to say I'm surprised that no one has made the connection with 'Les Girls,' a 1957 George Cukor (who was gay) film about three showgirls in a traveling performance called 'Les Girls.' It was a musical comedy starring Gene Kelly, Mitzi Gaynor and others. Some of the musical numbers and costumes most definitely inspired scenes in 'Priscilla...' (the costumes especially) and even some of the plot points are familiar. On top of that, the 'Priscilla' storyline references 'Les Girls' directly, when it is explained how Terrence Stamp's character had appeared in the stage version of 'Les Girls' for many years during his youthful prime.",Null,1,3,15 December 2002
