Sucker Punch," DIRECTOR'S CUT. One of the best action-feminist movie of the decade!
","Great fight sequences, score and CGI , overall good performances and a fresh and visonary idea from writer/director Zack Snyder.I loved the movie when i first saw it on the big screen, then i found the Director's Cut (slightly longer with more fight scenes, a musical moment and a BIG yet intimate scene at the end) and what i previously considered as a great action movie became something deeper and more coherent.This movie embodies the poetry of living your life as a battle ground while keeping the goal of being (alonside with Fury Road) one of the best action-feminist movies of the decade.Director's Cut is highly recommended.",9,12,15,14 January 2020
