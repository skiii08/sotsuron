The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Barf project
","Folks this has to be the most overblown craze to hit the motion picture industry since Godzilla. Mean spirited,inane,and poorly filmed this flick is neither scary nor funny. Those who mistake this film for innovative filmaking are merely viewing videotape that has no image stabilization. The premise is neither original nor believeable. You want low tech horror- watch The Birds,Psycho(original of course)...original screenplay with horrific elements-In the Company of Men(seriously horrific) or of course The Exorcist...if you do go see BWP please a-sit in the back of the theatre b don't eat anything before the flick..or if you do make it carrot sticks and salad..(I watched it in the center front after downing a huge burr",5,0,2,2 August 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," over rated 'boy and dog' story
","Boy and dog story with SF motif. Quite ordinary formula flick with little creative input. One of Spielberg's weaker films..pales in comaparison with same year's Poltergeist-a thriller classic. ET is sappy,overly sentimental and a little saccharine for my taste. Wanna see real ET's-try the Abyss or Close Encounters(spielberg's best SF) Want nice doggy stories-Lassie,Sounder,et al..",5,0,2,22 January 2000
Se7en," Classic crime caper
",Sets the standard for crime genre films of the late 20th early 21st century. Is to the present gen what Godfather was to the Boomer's.,10,0,0,22 January 2000
Seabiscuit," Wonderful retelling of Depression era horse legend
",A masterpiece recounting of true Depression era  broken down thoroughbred turned hero---and the human lives redeemed in the process. nothing more needs to be said--just a helluva true inspirational story!,10,0,0,27 July 2003
The Insider," The Insider- Classic political thriller
","One of the best political films in memory..along with Network and All the President's Men a true classic..Pacino and Crowe both give Oscar-worthy performances.. with The Matrix one of the two best films of 1999...a brave work with snappy dialogue,story driven plot,and a willingness to tackle an unpopular issue",10,0,0,26 December 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's opus-Still the best SF film of all time
","This film had realism..8 years before Star Wars,seriously talked about first contact with intelligent life..8 years before Close Encounters...seriously questioned the power we give to artificial intelligence..30 years before The Matrix. A warning and a statement of the struggle of the human race..this is the film that should be on the Voyager missions going intointerstellar space. Still the prototype for any hard SF film this is the masterpiece all other films of it's genre attempt to emulate. Should be in anyone's list of top 20 films it's inmy top 1..",10,1,3,14 January 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," Endearing Treasure
",A film with the traditional values that Jerry Falwell canonly mock with the innocence that can only be portrayed by thelate great Jimmy Stewart. If any film will please the MoralMajority and the Academy alike it's this film. I can think of noother film that best exemplifies in a non-hypocritical way what the virtues of charity and faith actualized are. A classic in any age but a reminder in this age of gracelessness and a politically correct but civilly inept soci,10,0,7,14 January 2000
The Lion King," Best Disney animation film
",Heads and shoulders(tails and manes) the best Disney animation production-The Lion King serves as an exempalry work for both kids and adult alike. Brings about the feeling of wonderment and joy of a true adventure and yet has all the morality of serious adult drama without the preachy sermonization often afflicting that genre. A classic in form and function with something for everyone,10,0,0,22 January 2000
Blade Runner," Real I in an AI flick...
","A wonderfully directed epic of  technology gone awry..a story really of a bankrupt society in which the shattered dreams of overpopulated Earth result in xenophobia of man' s own creation. ...all the more remarkable in that this film has succeeded in dealing with an extremely difficult level of subject  matter...not a silly film(Short Circuit, Bicentennial  Man),,nor a heavy handed Kubrickian moral production(2001,AI) but a real examination into the real moral dilemma mankind will face when creation becomes sentient...a must see for any hard SF fan...this is the real McCoy...sorry Bones",10,0,0,6 July 2001
The Truman Show," opverated and hacneyed theme
",a hackneyed and corny film this script plagarizes the far superior and original scripts of Serlings classic Twilight Zone episodes. Also similar theme in several Star Trek episodes. To those of us familiar with real SF this effort comesoff as shallow and tepid. For virtual world adventures go rent The Matrix or a goodie but oldie Westworld...want thrills The Game is for you...cerebral challenge The 13th floor is an oft overlooked little gem..,5,0,3,24 January 2000
The Matrix," Belongs to the pantheon of all time SF classics...a must see for any true SF fan
","One of the true SF classics. This film ironically is the first true Internet driven hit yet it reminds us of the frail boundary between what is real and what is virtual at the turn of the millenium. Intelligent,action packed and true to the genre Matrix forces us to question how we often have come to serve technology rather than have it serve us. As sobering as 2001 and Farenheit 451 with the ethical questions embelematic of both of those classics not to mention the state of the art visual and audio effects.",10,0,0,30 March 2000
The Matrix," Best SF movie since Blade Runner
",A classic..will set the standard for any cyberVR films.. brilliant choreography..not for the faint of heart..Matrix is hard SF at it's best..not afraid to broach moral dilemmas. a complement to any intelligent filmgoer...,10,0,0,26 December 1999
