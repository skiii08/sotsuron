Come and See," Masterpiece......uh..no.
","If you know nothing of history, spent your life perusing Facebook, use nifty words like: problematic, diversity and appropriation. Yea, this movie may be a bit shocking. My advice: instead of erasing history because it offends, learn from it. Pick up a book.
Now the film itself... tediously long grimacing stares into the camera. Nonsensical dialogue, acting, editing, it is just awful. The atrocities of war? No, the atrocities of filmmaking.
But, its gritty....!
Yea, that comes along with having 37 rubles or whatever for a budget.
In all, sophomoric purile filmschool drivel. The only reason I gave it a 2? The cow, it gave its life for this steamy pile.......and was the only convincing performance.",2,8,35,19 October 2019
