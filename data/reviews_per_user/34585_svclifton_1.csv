The Benchwarmers," Great Sports Comedy!
","If you love baseball and you love immature yet funny movies then this is the perfect movie for you! The Benchwarmers is basically about 3 men who were grew up being bullied and decided to join little league to make up for missed opportunities in their childhood. The actors, Jon Heder, David Spade, and Rob Schneider are the perfect choice of actors for this movie with their incredibly funny skills and acting talent. This movie is also great because it teaches a life lesson; bullying is unnecessary and stupid. I can tell you this, I've seen this movie over ten times and I've never gotten bored of it! I just love how this movie has both adults and young children in it because it creates a perfect blend of stupidity and matureness. This movie might seem unrealistic, but it is definitely not a waste of time! There are so many aspects of this movie that make it so successful and hilarious.",10,1,1,29 October 2015
