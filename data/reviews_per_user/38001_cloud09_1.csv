Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," unimaginative and poorly written script
",George Lucas really started losing his touch as an artist in Return of the Jedi.  It seems he puts more and more emphasis on the business side of movie making.  I can't wait till the next Star Wars toys start coming out a year in advance.The plot is terrible.  We never know why the Trade Federation is taking over Naboo.  We don't know why  Darth Sideous (aka Palpatine) wishes to do business with the Trade Federation.The character development is dreadful.  I think Darth Maul says 3 lines in the entire movie.  At the end of the movie I feel very little loathing or dread from him.Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character.  Enough said.Its too bad that Lucas can't be as creative as some of the other Star Wars books and Dark Horse Comics.,1,29,55,4 January 2001
