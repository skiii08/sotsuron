The Blair Witch Project," Nice and spooky
","This was a very worthwhile movie, very different to the 'Scream' generation horror flicks. Instead of 'in your face' scares every two minutes, we were treated to a delicious psychological build up of unease, culminating in that wonderfully 'open to interpretation' ending. I agree that the main characters are sometimes 'stupid', but maybe that was because they're human? It's not the best horror film by any means, but a very notable addition to the genre. That it cost practically nothing to make goes to show that you don't need a $200 million budget to win at the box office....just a good idea and good execution.....(although a massive publicity campaign can help I suppose)....don't go and see it expecting to be scared every two seconds, go and be 'nicely' disturbed for 80 mins or so...",7,0,1,28 January 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Brilliant.
","This is one hell of a fantastic sequel...Jim Cameron does it again after the triumph that was Aliens, he produces another moment of magic...the way this movie consolidates and improves upon the first movie is near perfection. The special effects were absolutely amazing and even today it is difficult to see exactly how they could have been used to better effect. The way he managed to create a bad guy infinitely more scary than Arnie in the first film and make him (the T-1000) so believable is first rate...The cast was absolutely first rate, especially Linda Hamilton...her transformation over the two films was shocking and brilliantly played. The boy Connor was not just there for show either, his performance was great too as the child born to be world leader one day...the action was tense and relentless with some of the best sequences you are ever likely to see...the motorbike/lorry and the helicopter/van/lorry chases being cases in point...The only thing that prevents me from giving the movie ten out of ten is the slight softening of the mood in this film compared to its precursor. The first film was darker, moodier, and conveyed a feeling of dread throughout. This movie had the dread alright with the indestructible bad guy, but there were a few comic one-liners, especially from the supposed robot Arnold which seemed out of place ('I need a vacation' for eg). Still this is a very minor gripe and will not prevent me from saying that this one of the best sci-fi or action movies ever made.",10,2,2,27 March 2000
Aliens," Action movie par excellence
","This is one of my top ten movies of all time, no problem. After the disturbing and almost as excellent original, here comes the rarest of things - the superior sequel and best of the quadrilogy!! Cameron wisely decides to not retrace the steps of Ridley Scott and goes for adrenaline-pumped action mixed with visceral tension, even more tense than Alien...just think of the motion tracker bleeping as the aliens get closer...genius! This is one of those movies you never want to end and I must have watched it 20 times at least. If you found the Alien concept from the original film interesting, you'll absolutely love this. No real flaws as far as I can think of...it's very long (I watched the Director's Cut) but the time flies by and I never really got bored - the strong storyline, wonderfully diverse characters and strong performances (especially from Weaver, Biehn and Henn) see to that. Unlike in Titanic, Cameron gets the dialogue exactly right here, especially with the rousing one-liners for the marines that have been shamelessly copied ever since. Finally, the soundtrack is utterly brilliant - pulsating in the action sequences and suitably eerie in those tense ones. Classic from start to finish and from back to front.",10,0,0,28 January 2000
The Usual Suspects," Fantastic, but...(WARNING: ENDING DISCUSSED)
","WARNING: ENDING DISCUSSED (BUT NOT ACTUALLY GIVEN AWAY)Don't get me wrong, I absolutely adored the film. It is the most bamboozling, head-scratching film I have ever seen with a fab script, some great performances and directing. There's just one thing stopping me from giving it 10 out of 10...the ending. I read someone else's comment, saying that it negated the rest of the film and that is kind of what I felt...after all it is entirely possible that the whole story was made up by Spacey's character and so what actually happened? Was any of it true? This is undoubtedly part of the genius of the script, but could also imply that the whole of the film (before the ending) was irrelevant, which is not completely satisfying, I think...anyway you can see how much this movie has messed with my head - it is a great piece of entertainment and what I love about it is that everyone who sees it will have their own idea of what happened, who Keyser Soze is etc. Excellent.",9,1,2,6 April 2000
Before Sunset," Mature sequel, but lacks magic of Before Sunrise
","Having watched and loved Before Sunrise when it was first released, I looked forward to Before Sunset more than most movies. For me Before Sunrise is one of the most romantic movies ever made, encapsulating for all time young, idealistic love with two people really connecting at a deep emotional level. But watching Before Sunset eventually left me slightly underwhelmed, I have to say. It is not bad at all, neatly tying up the loose ends after the heart-rending ending of the first movie - what happened to obvious soul mates Celine and Jesse? Did they meet up six months later? Did they end up together? Before Sunset is set 10 years after the first film and we get the answers to those questions in a satisfactory manner, but without ever really touching the heights of the first film. But then again, how do you follow up such a diamond of a film? There were a number of good points about this movie, first of which was that it is set in another beautiful location (Paris). I don't know about anyone else, but the first movie was a great advert for Vienna - I've been dying to go there ever since. Similarly in Before Sunset, Paris is endearing in each location, be it a quintessential French caf√©, the back streets or on a boat over the river Seine. Another great feature is that the film takes place in real time, which gives a great continuity to the storytelling and ensures the audience does not miss a thing. Both Hawke and Delpy are back for the sequel, which was an absolute necessity - their undeniable chemistry once again captivates the audience to smouldering effect.Despite all these riches, I just felt that the movie lacked the magic of the first. Personally, I think I will have forgotten Before Sunset before too long. Back in 1995, I only watched Before Sunrise once, but it has stayed with me as a memory of a magical movie ever since. Controversially, I do not see Before Sunset to really be a romantic movie (except perhaps for the end I guess) - it's a more cynical 'Before Sunrise was young idealism, this is real life' take on the two characters, and quite a lot of the movie is spent with the two characters moaning about how their lives have turned out. There are also some rather crude sexual references in Before Sunset, which I thought were out of place, especially given Hawke's character is married with a child. The dialogue in the first movie was altogether more charming, with the characters learning each other's hopes and fears, gauging each other's personalities and gradually becoming closer in a wholly believable way. But even though the characters seem to have become a little bitter with life in Sunset, their chemistry ensures that their conversation never bores the audience.I imagine that a lot of people have given this movie high scores as they can relate in some way to what these characters have gone through, and I think that is fair enough. The characters have grown and this is a certainly more mature film (crude sexual references aside). And to Linklater's credit, the ending was very strong. It is a very good movie, which is well worth watching (and I would advise strongly that you watch Before Sunrise beforehand to fully enjoy the second film).But maybe Sunset is too 'real' for me. Personally, I much preferred the touchingly romantic original movie and its bittersweet ending - and of the two, Before Sunrise is the film you should rent for a quiet night in with the one you love...",6,1,4,28 February 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Read the book instead...
","2001: A Space Odyssey is probably my favourite book of all time and after having read it, I lapped up all of Clarke's sequels...but unfortunately this movie did not cut it for me...I really tried to like it but I just couldn't - maybe my brain has been numbed by all the usual fast paced sci-fi fare these days, but I just found the film really tedious in parts...the ape section and the various 'silence' sequences were irrelevant and boring and did not add to the story in any way.I admit that some of the ideas on view are marvellous and visionary, such as the rotating space station, but again that's due more to Clarke's scientific brilliance rather than to Kubrick - quite why Kubrick would want to have a ten minute sequence of a space station spinning in space to classical music is beyond me (except for the possibility that a spinning space station was a strikingly new concept back then and he wanted to emphasise the point?).I sometimes wonder if I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the book first - it was such a well told and coherent story, which contrasts greatly to the movie which is very abstract. Maybe anyone thinking of watching this movie should see it before they read the book, but definitely read the book - it's a true masterpiece....",5,4,9,27 March 2000
Groundhog Day," Fantastic
","This is one of the cleverest, funniest, most charming films I have ever seen. I completely agree with another reviewer who said that this is one of the most underrated films of all time. The basic premise seems ridiculous - Phil, an unsavoury, ambitious weather reporter living his least favourite day of the year over and over again and is the only person aware of it. There's no explanation for it, it's just happening. But the explanation is not needed for the film-goer - our treat is to live the predicament with Phil, to watch him try everything he can think of to get to tomorrow. The script is wonderfully tight, with no duff jokes and Bill Murray gives his best performance ever - his attempts to seduce Andie MacDowell have got to be seen to believed...hilarious! The ending is 'feel good' epitomised, but not sickening in any way. I'm going to stick my neck out and say that it is nearly impossible to dislike this film (I'm sure some hard-hearted person will somehow hate it)...a must see...",9,0,1,28 January 2000
Gladiator," An Instant Classic
","Wow is all I can say to this....I went to see Gladiator expecting to see a great film and it delivered big time. The storyline and atmosphere of the movie is reminiscent of the classic Braveheart but this movie is just as good as Braveheart in its own right. From the amazing special effects (computer images are used extensively I hear, for example to recreate the Colosseum and also to replace Oliver Reed after he died in real life during the shoot!) to the breathtaking scenery; from the masterful treatment of the gladiatorial violence (split second shots of the gore, a la Braveheart again) to the outstanding performances of the cast, this film just oozes class from every pore. Scott is a genius and I don't believe that anyone would have done the gripping storyline of the movie any more justice than he has managed here. A real 'tour de force' and surely the best film of the year. Endlessly recommended.",9,0,0,16 June 2000
The Wedding Singer," You've got to love those 80's
","I love this movie. It's funny, it's endearing and it just makes you feel really good!! Don't expect a comedy classic or moving love story. This film is just triumphantly...nice. Sandler turns in a great performance as the Wedding Singer himself. None of that being-completely-stupid-to-get-cheap-laughs stuff here. The humour comes from the storyline and the setting (a completely believable rendition of 1985). It's not clever in any way - utterly predictable right from the start, but the cheesy humour and mushiness will win you over. Barrymore is perfect and the on-screen chemistry with Sandler is spot on. There are, admittedly one or two annoying bits, gags which don't quite come off - Billy Idol's cameo comes to mind, but overall if you want a feel good romantic comedy...look no further...",7,0,1,28 January 2000
