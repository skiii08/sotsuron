The King's Speech," Dull and anti-climactic
","I'm a little rankled by the over-the-top praise for this minor Masterpice Theatre dud. I'm not coming from a historian- or speech therapist's point of view, just an avid moviegoer.One letdown for me was, well, a pretty big one - after all that speech therapy, the king didn't seem to be that much better off at the end of the film. He never really had a pervasive 'Porky Pig' stutter; more like an off-and-on stammer and fear of public speaking (at least that's how it was portrayed in the film). It seemed liked Firth forgot to deliver his lines with the impediment, or else in real life it was not that serious.The scenes that delivered the 'R' rating had Firth being instructed to shout 4-letter obscenities as some kind of remedial. These struck me as gratuitous and inauthentic. This is not a great film, all things considered.",2,36,91,9 January 2011
Coraline," Huh??
","I am a big fan of animation, but the love for this movie has me scratching my head. I'm sure the families who fled mid-movie, and the crying children in the audience might agree. I haven't read the Neil Gaiman graphic novel that the movie is based upon, but the story is another Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland wannabe, replete with a curious young girl and the eccentric characters she encounters in an alternate world. CORALINE, however, lacks the wit and social observations of its predecessor, and more strikingly lacks the humor and heart of most any Disney/Pixar animation feature.First of all, when are parents going to learn to heed the movie rating system? This is definitely not a movie for young children. There are ghosts of dead children, for one thing. Another scene - a burlesque with two old women - is very graphic in showing one woman's HUGE knockers covered by the tiniest of stripper's pasties. It makes Little Annie Fannie from Playboy look flat-chested. One family left right after this scene.For an adult like myself, despite all its wonderful visuals, it still seemed plodding and overlong. Halfway through I raised my 3-D glasses to rub my eyes, wondering when it was all going to end, and I made an important discovery. In 3-D, the movie loses its color and intensity, due to the dark glasses. The difference is like the night switch on your rearview mirror. If I had any desire to see this movie again, I'm sure I'd prefer the 2-D version with its brilliant colors over the dull 3-D version.",3,19,49,26 February 2009
Iron Man 2," Another great superhero movie!
","IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...Paltrow as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts, the director as 'Happy' Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool! There's a reason I didn't mention Don Cheadle as Rhodey. His wooden performance was the weak spot of the whole film. I don't get it because he is such a great actor. But his presence was toxic and it looked like he threw off the other actors (noticeably Downey Jr).This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's 'Ex-wife' missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.",10,26,55,17 May 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," So disappointing
","Answer this question: If your life is so miserable, would you willingly step in front of a speeding train and just end it all? No, this isn't a scene in the movie, but it sums up why I dislike this movie so much. You see, the young girl character goes with her pregnant (and soon-to-expire) mother to live with her new, purely evil military stepdad. Her life becomes so unbearable that she creates a parallel imaginary world in which she can just die and join her deceased natural parents in heaven. We all know that ours can be a cruel world, but to most of us the rewards of its earthly pleasures is enough to desire a long full life. However most religions since the beginning of time promise their believers the greatest peace and happiness in some version of an afterlife. And it is this devaluation of mortal existence in this movie that makes me cringe, not the gratuitous violence. Death is seen as some sort of gift.So how does the movie rate, without getting into its philosophies? I had to wonder in which decade it was actually made. Shot almost entirely under a blue light, it looked like a movie that badly needs color correction after sitting in a can for 50 years. The 'special effects' looked like something created by the Creature Shop (was that the name?) circa 1975. There is no dazzling state-of-the art CGI others have gushed about. The pitiful associations to ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND (rabbit holes, mad tea parties) and worse yet, to Dorothy's ruby slippers in THE WIZARD OF OZ, were insulting. Del Toro's message of 'There's no place like Heaven' made me ill. I couldn't wait to wipe this movie off me as fast as I could.",1,33,73,27 January 2007
Watchmen," One word: Spectacular !!
","On my second viewing this movie is as good or better than the first. I urge anyone who is on the fence over seeing it and waiting for the DVD, you are making a big mistake. There is no way the spectacular visuals will impress with equal impact on a TV screen.I went with friends who hadn't seen it yet, and judging by their positive but mildly befuddled reactions, I feel that foreknowledge of the source material is essential. Even though the film's storytelling is solid, the dense plot, time shifts and abundance of characters is a lot of information to process. Get through as much of the comic book (now sold as a graphic novel) as you can, while WATCHMEN is still in theaters. You'll be glad you did.Those unfamiliar with the story seem to think the film goes on forever. Not so for us who do: the trip to Antarctica signals the final act. You'll also know why Ozymandias has a purple tiger as a pet (one of his companies oversees genetic experimentation, not explained in the film.) You'll also enjoy some of the other details that couldn't be included.The critics who don't understand what this movie is about should blame themselves and not the filmmakers. Hopefully they found a better experience seeing PAUL BLART:MALL COP.Grade: A+.",10,11,23,1 April 2009
Dreamgirls," Jennifer 1 vs. Jennifer 2
","DREAMGIRLS was a dazzling stage musical when it ran in the early '80's. It was a thinly veiled (if veiled at all) decade-long look at the career of Dina Jones and the Dreams, aka Diana Ross and the Supremes. Its strengths were eye-popping stage production, and a passable musical score, ranging from energetic disco to devastating ballads, made legendary by the vocal talents of the cast. OK, let's single out Jennifer Holiday, because she was the reason to see DREAMGIRLS with her tour de force performance.The movie of DREAMGIRLS practically couldn't lose; all it had to do was match the spectacle and emotionality of the stage musical. Sadly, it falls short. Compounding this disappointment is the way it ratchets up the references to Diana Ross and Berry Gordy in a shameless, tacky way. No doubt people were driven in the early Motown years, and egos were created, but to overshadow the accomplishments in order to wallow in tabloidism (the weakest element of the musical), left a bad taste in my mouth. How much did the movie reference Diana? It superimposed the Dreams onto 4 actual album covers of the Supremes. It gave Dina an expletive-filled Diana-Ross-like diva moment with a movie producer, a trait not seen either before or after in this mostly sweet and demure character. And the movie's addition of the Jackson Five counterparts seemed to have a ridiculing edge.What else the movie got wrong was the dazzle and excitement. The costumes and choreography were dull. The stage sets didn't exactly take your breath away. But the big question is: Was Jennifer Hudson the second coming of the original Jennifer? Well, if rangeless belting, without the nuance of J1, is your cup of tea, then J2 is for you.There were a few redeeming moments. The opening scene, backstage at an amateur talent contest, was beautifully shot. Girls in their shimmering gowns glide in and out of light in the backstage darkness, like they were bio-luminescent deep sea fish. The Dreams first performance at the contest gave me an exciting anticipation of what was to come. Beyonce delivers a great vocal on 'Listen'. And Eddie Murphy was terrific as a singer and actor; his scene performing at an all-white nightclub in Miami was a standout.",6,4,8,27 December 2006
Ratatouille," Way overpraised ...
","What is it with the excessive overpraise for movies under the Pixar banner? I'll admit the company reinvigorated interest in animated movies a decade ago with photo-realistic visuals, clever characters, witty scenarios, and decent stories. Little of that was evident in RATATOUILLE. This movie was stale, uninspired, overlong and lacking in creativity.Everyone knows the premise by now: a rat works undercover as a chef in a fancy restaurant to prove that 'anyone' can be a great chef if they want to. We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two 'human' leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends. We don't; the story just limps to its foregone conclusion.About the animation: Done in CGI hyper-realism, it elicits a 'wow, that bubbling pot looks just like a photo' admiration that lasts about 5 minutes. By contrast, the end credits are accompanied by '60's-style Disney animation, and it is much more interesting. Maybe it's time for Pixar to turn the clock back.",2,18,45,3 August 2007
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Absolutely terrific!
","Seen it twice already, both times in a movie theater. It is perfect from start to finish. Every minute in this film is interesting. As a period piece the scenes are flawless. (I was alive in 1969 and yes, I live in Los Angeles but not sure if that makes a difference.) I feel sorry for the people who say it is long and boring. If your attention span is feeble, or if you watch at home while working, cooking dinner or reading a magazine, then maybe TV programming is a better fit for you than feature films. The soundtrack including commercials from that time is awesome. I will watch this movie many. many times over. A+",10,14,18,1 March 2020
Children of Men," As bad as movies get ...
","Wow. I don't know where to begin. I had high hopes because Cuaron's HARRY POTTER movie was directing perfection. I had heard enough BLADERUNNER comparisons to make me giddy. I was saving this movie as a treat for myself after a year of mostly mediocre films. Cuaron can thank M Night Shyamalan for his atrocious LADY IN THE WATER that his film wasn't the bottom of my list this year.This hokey, overwrought, noisy, ugly piece of garbage is film-making at its absolute worst.First off, the BLADERUNNER comparisons are so incredibly superficial and undeserved, that I have to wonder if it isn't the film's PR machine putting out those comments. The one and only similarity is that they take place in the future. BLADERUNNER was a masterful amalgam of mood, music, art direction and story that you will never forget. (If you haven't seen it, go for the director's cut, and try to see it on a big screen revival if possible.)CHILDREN is bleak, with no artistry or imagery to speak of. All I seem to recall are scenes filled with tenements, chain link fences and rubble. If it's derived from a video game, I wouldn't be at all surprised, with its exaggerated violence and action par for that medium. And the story is just so stupid. No babies have been born anywhere for 20 years, but there just happens to be one pregnant woman somewhere in London? What about New Guinea, or the deepest Amazon? And if the clichÃ© of a newborn-as-hope-for-the-future hasn't been done to death, then I'll be equally willing to buy into the story about the prostitute-with-the-heart-of gold. If our world is destined to be fraught with problems, let's try solving them now, and forget about placing them on the shoulders of future generations.Grade: F",1,31,55,17 February 2007
Thor," Best actor among Oscar winners: Stan the Man !
","This forgettable piece of junk had one bright moment - the ebullient Stan Lee in a cameo as a truck driver. Now on to the bad stuff: everything else.STORY: Probably solid as conceived by J Michael Straczynski. Definitely ruined by the credited scripters. Because ...SCRIPT: Anyone who talks or writes knows to get your point across in as few words as necessary. Early on, Odin instructs his sons that although they do not seek war, 'we have to be ready for it'. A more regal, adult response would have been: 'we have to be prepared'. Odin words sounded like they were written by (or for) 10-year-olds. Sorry if this sounds nitpicky, but it was an indicator of the wretched mess of dialogue for the next two hours.ACTING: Tom Hiddleston(Loki) seemed to try a bit; everyone else phoned it in. There is not a drop of emotion in evidence anywhere.ART DIRECTION: Fake-looking all around - from the New Mexico town to Asgard and beyond. The Frost Giants and Destroyer were no better executed than what you find in a movie-of-the-week on the ScyFy Channel, maybe worse. And whose idea was it to make Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, a pavement of fiber-optic Lucite?!! Unbelievably bad. Only one person can take credit for that, and he is ...KENNETH BRANAUGH (DIRECTOR): He has to be the weak link here. Too bad because he seems like a nice guy.FINAL COMMENT: The story draws on Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's origin of THOR (Marvel version, of course) from 1968 - issues #158 and #159. The two comic greats had applied their cookie-cutter morality play to THOR, as they had to their other creations - Spiderman, Iron Man, Dr Strange to name a few - that of a self-absorbed individual gaining a conscience and becoming a hero. As usual, it was done to perfection every time. I still get a lump in my throat every time I re-read Spiderman's or Thor's origin. (And all done in 20-pages or less!) Reprints of these comic books are out there and I encourage everyone to read them and see why movies like THOR are being made 40 years later..",2,2,7,20 May 2011
Crazy Heart," Totally loved it!
","This is movie perfection. I'll take a character-driven story over the TRANSFORMERS any day. But I AM picky! CRAZY HEART is a parallel movie to THE WRESTLER from last year, and I think it is the better film. Both deal with the fictional stories of middle-aged men who found moderate success in the entertainment careers of their younger years, but now have to deal with the issues their younger selves never foresaw (or purposely avoided.) How do they deal with dwindling fame, financial hardship, grown children and loneliness? You will see all this in the expertly written, acted and directed CRAZY HEART. Add to this an awesome soundtrack of original songs performed beautifully by Bridges and Farrell (their duet actually gave me goose bumps!) An overall excellent and very entertaining film. I especially like the low-key 'cliffhangers': will boozed-up Blake remember the names of a couple to whom he has promised a dedication? Will the liquor store owner comp a bottle of whiskey that Blake can't afford? There are many nice subtle touches throughout. The director deservedly won Best First Feature at the INDEPENDENT SPIRIT AWARDS this year.",10,3,5,4 May 2010
Inception," Add me to the list of haters
","This movie is way too talky and confusing to enjoy. Add to that a director/writer with absolutely zero sense of humor and wit, and we are left with this dry onslaught on your senses. I think Mr Nolan may have brains and be some people's cup of tea, but his humorless and emotionless films have all left me extremely disappointed. INCEPTION in particular was torture for me. There is absolutely no payoff by the end of the film because we do not care about any of these characters. If it were not for the genius score, this could easily be the worst waste of time I have had in a movie theater in years.I see there is some controversy and speculation as to where all the rave reviews are coming from. It's possible that there are many who do love this film. But they weren't in our packed audience. One person clapped at film's end, and it quickly died when no one joined in. Instead most people bolted for the doors after this overlong dud.",1,12,23,7 August 2010
The Greatest Showman," here's why the critics are wrong !
","I've seen TGS six times - about every 2 weeks since it opened. To me the film was an imaginative take on the man who created one of the most enduring forms of entertainment the world has ever seen. But the critical comments were not part of my experience. The following points seem to be the most repeated among the critics:HISTORICAL ACCURACY: This criticism is easy to dismiss. Unless the film is a documentary, the 'facts' are subject to interpretation. A long list of movies based on real people or events bears this out. Consider this: If a film (non-documentary) were made about Donald Trump, wouldn't there be very different versions, depending on who's telling the story?THE REAL PT BARNUM: This can be addressed with my comment above. But I'll go ahead and answer those who feel that the man who was famous for having said 'There's a sucker born every minute' had his character sugar-coated in the film. Those critics say he was portrayed as a saintly family man who championed inclusiveness. I don't know how they didn't see the same film I did. At a young age PT learns that honesty may not be the best policy when he is punished for admitting he made young Charity laugh. He subsequently steals, obtains a loan with false collateral, and embellishes his 'circus freaks' to his liking. He even admits to being a fraud to the highbrow theater critic. And when he gains entry to high society via his partner Phillip Carlyle, he has hesitations about appearing in public with his human menagerie. I'm leaving out a few, but how many more character flaws do the critics need to see in a 2-hour film?NO BACKSTORY: A few critics lamented that the secondary characters (the circus crew) were not given full backgrounds. I can only shake my head and wonder how they could expect to pull this off with a dozen or so characters. Would they have liked a 3-hour movie better?THE SONGS ARE TRITE: Simple answer - one of the most revered songs in a film musical is about rainbows and bluebirds.NO REAL DRAMA: Sure, it wasn't APOCALYPSE NOW, but PT faced enough challenges in the film to dismiss that criticism.WEAK SCRIPT: Always a matter of taste, but I found it intelligent, engaging and very often humorous. I've laughed every time, particularly at the exchanges between PT and Phillip as they are trying to make the acquaintance of Jenny Lind in London. And the audiences I've been with laughed along with Queen V at the 'reaching the top shelf' retort by Tom Thumb!SUB-PAR CHOREOGRAPHY/MUSICAL STAGING: Again a matter of taste, but after 6 times seeing the film, the musical numbers still give me goose bumps. The Other Side number, staged in a bar, is no less impressive than anything from a Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly film. TOO LITTLE/TOO MUCH: The Village Voice critic wrote that it was boring and exhausting - in the same sentence! So which one was it?!I personally feel that a clinical dissection of the movie misses the point. Maya Angelou said something to the effect that people don't always remember what you do or say, but they will remember how you make them feel. I'm glad I'm one of the many viewers who got such an incredibly wonderful feeling from THE GREATEST SHOWMAN.",10,7,15,2 April 2018
