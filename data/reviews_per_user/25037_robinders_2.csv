The Incredible Hulk," Good movie...
","Wow...What a good comic book movie.I thought this film had good dialog, strong storyline and good action as well. The special effects were not nearly as hokey as they were in the last movie. I'm glad the movie was true to the comic. It made it very fun to watch. With references to others in the comic world storyline, I foresee more movies in the future having the Hulk character in them, as well as team ups.If I had to find one thing that could have made this and all Marvel movies better it would be dropping the Stan Lee cameo's. Also, I think the time has come to retire Lou Ferigno from the Hulk franchise. If you have to through a dog a bone, just give it to him, don't make him do tricks.Eight and a Half out of Ten",8,2,4,25 June 2008
28 Weeks Later," The first movie was brilliant, but this installment...
","Was average at best.I'm really tired of the stupid things people do in most horror films. This film is no different. The horror films that I consider as really good don't need to have idiot characters doing stupid things to keep the story moving. Death shouldn't need a dumb mistake or a poor decision as a catalyst.The effects were really realistic, the story even plausible; not that it needs to be. The speed of the virus' transformation however, was inconsistent with the victims and a little faster that what one would expect to be believable.Average at best.Six and a Half out of Ten",6,2,2,25 June 2008
