Requiem for a Dream," WOW!!!
","This is the most powerful and amazing movie I've ever seen.  The editing is amazing, the acting is amazing, the directing is completely mind boggiling and the effect it has on you after it's over is like nothing you'll have ever felt.  See this movie.  It will change the way you see the world. 11/10.  Best movie ever, no questions asked.",10,0,0,24 July 2001
