Insidious: Chapter 2," Great sequel, not as scary
","The ending of the first Insidious will make any viewer NEED to immediately watch this sequel. I've never seen a more intense cliffhanger movie ending. I found Insidious: Chapter 2 to be a great addition to the first movie, although I think the first one was slightly better as a movie. Insidious: Chapter 2 takes place directly after the first, and continues with part of the plots conflict. The movie does take a similar haunting theme, although it is slightly different as the first. I found this movie more engaging as the first, because it makes you think a lot about the unknown pieces of information that would reveal import clues to the mystery part of the movie. I would say the first movie was scarier, but this movie was slightly jumpier. (I might be wrong) But I liked this movie, and if you've watched the first movie, you gotta watch this. If you're new to the Insidious series, it's great, start with the first movie. I would totally recommend this movie (& the Insidious series) to any fan of horror. I also find these movies incredible movies in general. I rate Insidious: Chapter 2 8/10.",7,0,0,28 December 2016
The Conjuring 2," A Great paranormal horror movie!
","The Conjuring 2 is a very well-made horror movie, and a well made movie in general. One of the best that I've seen. It does an excellent job of making you think about what's really going on, and what's behind the haunting. While Lorraine's visions of an evil-looking nun become more threatening, and while the apparition that torments the family has no visible similarities, who's responsible for the haunting becomes more and more questionable. The movie is as good as the first Conjuring, and maybe more scary. The movie has a less creepy atmosphere since it's based in a very urban area (London, England) whereas the first movie as a house in the middle of the woods. Both movies are based around a haunting usually occurring inside a single house, both haunting cases escalate to a possession. The Conjuring 2 has a few more jump scares. I'd say the jump scares in The Conjuring 2 were scarier than the ones in The Conjuring. If you like scary movies, are if you loved the first Conjuring movie, than this is a very good film to watch! Be prepared to have sleepless nights! I rate 9/10",9,0,0,19 November 2016
Batman Begins," 'Batman Begins' establishes the origin of the best superhero trilogy
","This movie perfectly displays the origin of Bruce Wayne on his journey to becoming The Batman from the moment his parents are killed. What I really like about this movie his how it shows Bruce's relationship with bats. From the first time he saw them in the cave he fell into, Bruce is shown to be afraid, and almost mesmerized by the tiny furry animals. He eventually accepts his co-existence with bats when he re-vists the cave, and calmly lets bats swarm around him. In some scenes he treats bats as his allies. This relationship with bats is displayed throughout the entire trilogy, and is what makes Christopher Nolan's vision of Batman stand out. After the movie establishes Bruce's origin, it brilliantly and accurately shows Bruce's path to becoming Batman, from him forging batarangs, to the creation of the Batsuit, to the first time he busts criminals. This movie also contains the first appearance of import Batman/Gotham City related characters. Those being Alfred Pennyworth, Lucius Fox, and Commissioner Gordon. Each one of these characters are displayed perfectly, and each have the perfect actors for their roles. Of course, in most superhero movies, the hero isn't paired against casual city criminals. they eventually are given a challenge, when they are paired against the antagonist. Bruce does have experience from his encounters with the League of Shadows, he isn't quite ready to take on a criminal cancer within the depths of Gotham City, the notorious Scarecrow. The twisted villainous character gives Batman the true test of fear.Overall, Christopher Nolan sets his Batman trilogy on the right path with this movie. Everything about this movie appeals to Batman fans, or superhero fans in general. Everything about the movie is great. Christian Bale takes on the role of Batman and does one of the best jobs as the character to this day. The movie accurately captures the character 'Scarecrow' and tops it off with the League of Shadows and Ra's Al Ghul. This movie is absolutely perfect, every DC fan should see it. 10/10",10,0,1,5 May 2017
Insidious," One of the scariest movies I've seen, that also has a brilliant plot
","I decided to watch Insidious, since I was blown away by James Wan's other series, 'The Conjuring.' The Conjuring was one of the best movies I've seen, so I thought I'd watch James Wan's earlier movies. I had heard about Insidious a very long time ago, but I never thought I should watch it, until recently. I was very surprised by how good Insidious was. I was expecting a creepy-ish movie revolving around in-house hauntings, but it was much more than that. Insidious had an amazing plot, and was also much more frightening then I expected. The movie revolves around the idea of astral-projection, an out-of-body experience that makes you feel like your physical conscience is disconnected from your body. (Some real mountaineers who hike through low-gravity zones describe this.) The movie displays a boy who can do this at will while sleeping. Although something about this ability ends up bringing a lot of fright to him and his family. I found the movie very exciting and suspenseful, while also being interesting & enjoyable. There were a few jump-scares that made me jump, and the movie as a whole was quite scary. There were some extremely creepy moments that I still vividly remember. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies. My final rating is 9/10.",9,1,2,28 December 2016
The Dark Knight," The best superhero movie ever made by far
","This movie follows up Christopher Nolan's 2005 'Batman Begins' movie which established the origin of Bruce Wayne and how and why he became 'The Batman'. This story follows up his rise as Batman with a powerful test to Bruce Wayne's mind, sanity, and intelligence. Now that he is recognized by Gotham City as a hero, he is looked up to by many, but despised by others. This movie delivers a brilliant version of the most historic superhero universe rivalry ever. Batman and the Joker. The movie brilliantly displays the Joker's strategic and calculating mind, while keeping you extremely entertained, scared, and mesmerized. Heath Ledger's performance of the Joker is beyond words, his performance will go down in history as incredible. Especially considering it was his last. (R.I.P. Heath Ledger) Alongside the perfected Joker, is Christian Bale's brilliant performance as the Batman. Even considering how Batman has been played by many people and is one of the most recognized superhero icons ever, Christian Bale's performance stands out and remains to be unchallenged other than by Ben Affleck. Overall, the movie has a perfect setup, and leaves you on the edge of your seat the entire runtime.This movie is by far the best superhero movie ever made, and nothing to this day has challenged it. And there likely won't be anything TO challenge it. (Unless DC nails its upcoming Justice League movie, maybe then) But this movie is a must see for everyone, it has something for everyone, and it's an intriguing trip for your mind, and your understanding of Batman and the Joker's rivalry.10/10",10,0,0,3 June 2017
The Witch," A masterpiece of both archaic drama, colonial representation, and psychological horror
","This movie immediately struck me as what the result of a Shakespeare & Brothers Grimm collaboration would look like. The film is like a beautifully embroidered tapestry, with an interestingly somber & sullen style & theme, and surprising authenticity. The most notable & well structured aspect of this film is the design of the early 17th century set. All the actors speak in an old, yet recognizable English. You likely won't understand half of what the characters are saying unless you've studied Shakespeare. The somber and misty feel of 17th century New-England is captured in a beautifully perfect & realistic fashion. The actors clothing, manner of speech, and heavily religious mindset is accurate to that of 17th century New-England that the movie uses as its setting. The film does a good job of making a statement about how hard it was to be alive in the 1620's, and that these peoples lives were never easy. Even if you're someone who's never studied the hardships of this historical era, or the lifestyle of settlers in the new world, the film gives you a powerful impression that it was extremely hard to be alive in this time. (It accurately captures the grueling lifestyle, while it also remains true to what witches were believed to be in this time)The first glance at the forest is chilling. The battalion of impenetrable trees seem to pulse with a ominous intent, and the portrayal of 17th century witches is both deeply disturbing, and unnervingly accurate. The witches on-screen moments, and her actions throughout the movie have an overpoweringly gripping effect on the audience, as the witches presence and potency seems to span over the entire forest, and echo a dark omen for the poor family of seven that resides by the forest side.The film is frightening in a rather subtle way. (mostly after the ending, which resolves all the disturbing occurrences in a solemnly saddening conclusion, which has the most powerful effect on the audience) Robert Eggers immaculately designs a thick, omnipresent tension which further contributes to an increasingly uncanny atmosphere. The film conveys a unique design of horror that's chillingly unfamiliar these days, (but not absent) and deviates from the unusual expectations from an average horror film. (That being said, this is most definitely not an average horror film. (In a good way) I mostly enjoyed this film as a piece of genuine art and as a folktale. If what you desire from a horror movie is jump- scares, gory images, and creepy faces, (Or most of what the horror genre is producing today) rather than a layered and deeply soul-shaking story, than this movie is most definitely not for you.) The film is scariest to those who think deeply about it, and those who understand the 17th century folklore, and the importance of faith in this time, since the film is also frightening at a religious angle. The audience can do nothing but watch as the families faith is questioned and attacked by theirs God's absence in their suffering, and as the family is plagued, tormented, and (figuratively) torn to shreds by the deceitful & manipulating hand of the evil that resides amongst the trees. Thus, the events of this movie are a perfect presentation of a Puritan's worst nightmare. Some of the most frightening & disturbing implications are hidden behind seemingly innocuous, yet slightly sinister things. And some of the most saddening, most horrific implications are hidden beyond the ending, leaving contemplation and speculation on the viewers mind for days or weeks after. While each time you recommence speculation of post-movie events, you also remember how well the film captured your subconscious in its quintessential design of psychological haunts, and you're reminded of the depth of this profoundly powerful story. Robert Eggers combines these layers of subtle horror with expert film-making to create a truly nerve racking story about religious paranoia & familial trauma.I felt like the full impact of the movie didn't strike me right away. But as I thought and thought (which I guarantee you will) about the plot and the genuinely saddening conclusion, the film started to grow & gnaw at my thoughts until I realized the sheer magnitude of depth & meaning of what I had watched. There is Biblical symbolism scattered throughout the run-time, a perfect display of how religion ruled the lives of people living in this time, and some much deeper elements that I cannot reveal without spoiling major plot points. But overall, this film is a masterpiece, as a horror, a drama, and as a film in general. Everything about it is executed in a perfect design, and the unbelievably disturbing ending will shake you to whatever is at your core.",10,2,4,21 October 2017
The Conjuring," An amazing horror film!
","The Conjuring is a brilliant haunting/possession movie that contains lots of suspense, horror, and jump scares. With an excellent plot, great cast, and amazing effects, and a terrifying antagonist, The Conjuring is one of the most frightening movies I have watched. I like how the occurrences start small, first the dog refusing to enter the house, then all the clocks all stop at 3:07 am, then the more serious and intense parts of the movie begin. The Conjuring is likely one of the most well made paranormal horror movies to ever have been created. I still am very shaken by the intense scenes, and specifically the jump scare when Lorraine is in the basement. If you like horror movies, or like being scared in general, this film will become one of your favourites. If you've come to this move after watching The Conjuring 2, than I can assure you this movie is just as good, if not better than its sequel. I give The Conjuring a 10/10.",10,0,0,19 November 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," A solid conclusion to the worlds best trilogy
","8 years after Batman's conflict with the Joker, he has become a social recluse like you'd expect him to be. But that won't last very long, as the genius terrorist Bane, has risen in Gotham and will draw the Batman out of hiding. And Bane is more than a worthy opponent. Bane proves to be formidable this movie that gives Bruce Wayne the test of strength and willpower. Like the rest of The Dark Knight trilogy, and the rest of Christopher Nolan's movies, this film is incredibly well produced, and is amazing all together in every way. The story telling and scene quality is amazing, and leaves you wondering how it could be any better. The movie introduces the villain Bane, who has his origin explained in the movie. Bane is one of Batman's biggest comic enemies, and is an intimidating character. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is flawless, and really makes you believe in the character throughout the movie. The movie also introduces another important Batman-related character, Catwoman. Selina Kyle's character isn't as deep as Batman, but is still a juicy feature of this movie. Seeing Christopher Nolan's Batman interact with the notorious Catwoman is pure gold. Anne Hathaway does a phenomenal performance of Catwoman, that defines how you'll view the character.Overall, the movie is perfect. Its suspense and intensity remain constant throughout the run-time, as the characters develop, along with the plot. Every movie fan should see this, for it easily takes a seat among the best movies ever made. Although it does not surpass the previous addition to The Dark Knight trilogy (The Dark Knight), it still delivers a satisfying and purely uplifting conclusion to the trilogy that will never have any competition for the title of Best Trilogy Ever.",10,0,2,5 June 2017
