Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Clearly someone forgot to mention how RIDICULOUS this film is
","I gave it a four star out of generosity. First, I bought this movie on i--Tunes thinking it was going to make a solid addition to my action/adventure genre. It didn't. The film lacks many things: originality, acting, storyline, and directing. First, the film is very much like watching an episode of Supernatural (at least Supernatural had a better way to kill vamps). There is no original way to kill a vampire here. Everything is the same: stake, sunlight, crosses, etc. Second, the acting is horrible. The lead actor tries too hard to be the clumsy, intelligent, vampire killer that closely resembles a Clark Kent double. His acting is dull, and unlikeable. Next, the storyline is weak! Another sad attempt to achieve originality. The directing is terrible. There are far too many UNBELIEVABLE scenes, even for an action film, that you just begin to laugh. Especially as the film is about to end. I gave it a 4 because the CGI was impressive. I wish I could get a refund.",4,3,5,23 October 2013
The Intouchables," By far a movie worth the buck
","The reviews are correct, for the exception of a few bad reviews, 'Intouchables' is a movie to watch. I wish I would have seen this movie in theaters, but better late than never. The movie will make you laugh, touch your heart, and remember how beautiful, precious, wonderful, and lucky we are being human. The actors are outstanding. The photography and filming is breathtaking at times. But, for the most part, the message is delivered with perfect timing. I love french new wave filming, and although I saw this in subtitles, the actors magically invoke the essence of 'Intouchables'...the human heart.Strongly recommend watching this movie with the family >>> PG-13",10,1,2,13 August 2013
