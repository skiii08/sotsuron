Skyfall," Simply Brilliant
","For me, this was the greatest Bond movie ever. The best previous one being Casino Royale.It was also the saddest and most thought provoking.There is a constant thread of a passing. It starts with Adele's opening-credit song, and is apparent throughout the film, such as when Bond sits in the National Gallery and looks at Turner's painting of the Temeraire that represents the passing of an age. Are older characters being replaced with younger ones. Will Bond retire, or perhaps be retired?I'm not going to review it... you absolutely must watch it for yourself.",10,2,9,10 January 2013
