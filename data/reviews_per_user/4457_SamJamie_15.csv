The Ring," A true, epic horror classic.
","The Ring is a 2002 American supernatural horror film directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, and Daveigh Chase. It is a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ring, based on the novel of the same name by Koji Suzuki. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.The Ring really is everything a great horror picture should be. Take an original story, an interesting protagonist and a genuinely chilling back story and keep the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout, this film checks all those boxes. The cinematography in this film is outstanding, the deep green and blue colour palette completely sets the tone and mood for the film perfectly well.Naomi Watts gives a career-best performance in the Ring that I still don't believe she has beaten until today. It's just a shame she's been in schlock like Shut In and Dream House in recent years, especially when she's clearly a great horror actress.I'm glad The Ring got the praisal it deserved receiving positive reviews. Many critics praised the direction, screenplay, cinematography, Watts's performance, and reliance on dread and visuals over gore. The film also grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror movies of all time. It's such a shame the sequels didn't live up to the originals standard.",10,0,0,27 January 2020
It," A future horror classic.
","I'm a massive horror fan, always have been and when I first saw this movie I was blown away. The films cast is outstanding, especially for child actors which can be hit or miss. You could see how much effort was put into the film to stay faithful to Stephen Kings source material and I truly think this is his best film adaptation. After watching the I'm sorry, awful, made for TV series I found Pennywise laughable - and I half expected that from this one too, but after the opening sequence with Georgie I knew the film was going to be a home run. I personally can find little I can fault with this film as it's one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time, low ratings I find unjustifiable unless you think just describing a horror film as 'un scary' somehow makes you different from the majority? Completely forgetting about the other elements that make the film great? I don't know. But I loved it.",10,0,1,17 January 2020

She tries her best to find a way out of the city before it is too late.This sequel is much more focused on epic action scenes rather than a cohesive narrative, never the less it's a very enjoyable watch even if it's not as good as the original.",6,0,0,22 March 2020

","This was my favourite movie of the year. It's about friendship over anything and I just love that about both films.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," The greatest slasher movie of all time!
","I'm always confused when people compare this film to the likes of the original 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' because in my opinion this film completely blows those out the water. An original plot and a truly chilling killer with a horrifying backstory makes this one much more fleshed our than those films, an epic soundtrack and great performances from Robert Englund in his best portrayal of Freddy as well as Heather Langenkamp and a young Johnny Depp. This film holds up and it's still scary!",10,0,0,18 January 2020
