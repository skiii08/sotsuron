Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," very good over all
",Many critics seemed to have taken a disliking to this movie... and in some ways i can see why... but over all it's well worth seeing... (several times... it only gets better!)let's weigh the pro's and con'scon's-to much CG?  not a problem... it looks awesome for every cg    shot that looks ify there's 1000 others that are flawless -jar jar?  he is very anoying at times... but he has his place... it might just be bigger than it should be. -lack of character?  in some instances... anakin's mother is a great character... and there could be more time spent to introduce her and anakin... i don't know... i was upset when a character i won't name dies... so it mush have been at least an ok character film.pro's -it's STAR WARS people! and it may be different that epidodes 4-6 but it does definitely carry the same spirit... and like the trailer says... 'every saga has a beginning' and the beginning had better be different than the end or it would be boring. -Darth Maul there was probably more hype around this character than there needed to be... he's a thug... but he is DAMN COOL. all the lightsaber battles between him and the jedi are... wellWOW... and that's all i can say. -The Plot... this is something i won't talk much about so i don't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it... but it is very very good... lots of unexpected stuff and nothing is too obvious... lots of great foreshadowing (some people seemed to think this bogged down the movie... and perhaps it does... but it'll be really cool when it links up and goes on in episodes 2 and 3)in final conclusion the movie is great dispite a few small issues... so go see it!!!!,8,0,0,22 May 1999
