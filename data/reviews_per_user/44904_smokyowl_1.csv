Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Wait for the DVD.....and rent it.
","The first 40 minutes were so boring I left to get a refill of popcorn. I don't usually do that, but the plot was so predictable I figured I wouldn't miss anything...and I didn't. I only laughed once during the movie, and there was only one shot that would make me go to the theater to watch it, and the shot lasted 3 full seconds. The first half of the movie gets off to a sluggish start full of predictable outcomes and exposition. Then there's the mermaid part, then the conclusion....big deal. Then there's the whole sub-plot with a guy falling in love with the mermaid....and during the movie I kept asking to myself: 'what's this guy's name?' The movie as a whole just isn't entertaining enough to warrant seeing it in theaters. A few parts are okay, but overall I'd definitely suggest waiting for the DVD and rent it. Die hard fans of the series will probably love this movie because they are die hard fans, and they'll hail it as being great because they are emotionally invested in it already.",5,1,2,1 June 2011
