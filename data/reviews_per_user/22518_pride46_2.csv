Requiem for a Dream," Not only a work of art, but a lesson.
","I first saw this film almost six months ago, and it is still very much with me. This is a film that you simply cannot forget. It is too powerful. I have asked others if they have seen this film and some have responded with, 'I'm not sure, maybe.' I know right then that they haven't, for they would surely remember it.Darren Aronofsky is a man with an extraordinary artistic vision, and it is amazing how he manages to create such a grand, albeit depressing, atmosphere with what little he has to work with. That alone is a phenomenal achievement, but what may be even more incredible is the impact this has on a human's psyche. I have never had anything to do with drugs, and this film has ensured that I never will. This film depicts the lives of four addicts and reveals scenes that build up to a disturbing climax.This is a film that made me depressed for weeks.",9,0,0,7 August 2002
Vanilla Sky," Not so difficult to follow
","I had been forwarned. I was told not to watch this movie unless I anticipated being confused and befuddled afterward. It's not as complicated as it was made out to be. The film ties itself up at the end and explains itself. If you see the ending and still don't know what was going on, you weren't paying attention. If you want a real puzzle to crack, watch David Lynch's Mulholland Dr.",Null,0,0,18 June 2002
