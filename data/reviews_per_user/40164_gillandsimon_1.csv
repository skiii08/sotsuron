The King's Speech," Its not about Oscars
","The are few roles in movie history which define an actor. Scoring the winner in the World Series or sinking the putt on the last day of Augusta. These things catapult the achiever to the highest level, to the the top of their profession. When faced with this opportunity, some falter, some do not possess the metal to finish and but a small few, succeed. Their reward is the admiration of all true fans, the trepidation of the established champions and the self-belief which will sustain the winner in the upper echelons.When Colin Firth first read this script he could only have thought that his moment had come, that this opportunity could be his defining role. For no story rooted in such a critical moment in history is more fascinating and yet moving. Others faced with such an opportunity have not excelled - for instance, Helen Mirren's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in the days after the death of Princess Diana. Firth reaches out and grabs this role with both hands until he has the audience eating out of his. Geoffrey Rush was a brave casting decision as the counterpoint between such different actors could so easily have annoyed the viewer. Yet together they played a touching portrayal of a friendship based on mutual respect and laterally, on admiration.Helena Bonham-Carter conveys perfectly the difficult balance for wives in those times - who must know their place and yet also know exactly when to be steadfast without undermining their husband.This movie springs from the great tradition of many British productions. Only British cinema has such a rich heritage in portraying triumph in a time of adversity. From the great libraries of war movies like Ice Cold in Alex, through modern day classics such as Chariots of Fire, The Kings Speech will take its place proudly at the top table.To Colin Firth, winning the Oscar is somewhat incidental. This actor knows he gave of his best, that after this he will be acclaimed by the king-makers of Hollywood and further afield. He has lifted the heavy mantle of 'the great British actor who has never played an epic role'. He will now have his chance to establish himself with Sir John Gielgud and Lord Lawrence Olivier. Ironically, he will receive his own Royal honor from Elizabeth II well in advance of attaining such legendary status.Finally, for all those who struggle with their own speech, both physically and metaphorically, let this be both an inspiration and a refuge. A reason to hope and a reason to persevere. For the rest of us we can live the moment, the torment and the triumph...and for once, no one can say that it isn't as good as the book! May you relish it as much as I.Simon Davis",9,4,7,28 January 2011
