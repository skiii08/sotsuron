The New World," Poignant and transcendental
","First, let me applaud this film. I have been waiting for Terrence Malick's fourth film ever since I saw The Thin Red Line. Arguably, Malick is one of the most adept and deliberate filmmakers right now. The New World is nearly flawless, and the beauty of Malick's direction adds to the argument that film can still be considered aesthetic. Much has been lost in the last 30 years, but Terrence Malick sticks to what he knows. What some people may complain about this movie are the long silences, the action-less movement, and the poetic voice over. This is what Malick does. He is a modern transcendentalist. What he does with film is comparable to what Emerson did in writing. The color is naturalistic, and the sounds are earthly. It helps that Malick uses natural light for his shots, giving the scenery more life and texture. As for the substance of the film, what isn't pantomimed in subtle gestures and movements is brought to life with flowing poetic voice over. This goes all the way back to Badlands for Malick. But here, we get varying minds contributing. There are some moments in this film when the viewer has to understand the characters by their facial expressions instead of their words. I think that will be hard for a lot of people who are expecting a more vocative and kinetic film. As for the acting, I was very impressed with all involved, particularly Q'Orianka Kilcher. This young woman played the part of innocence beautifully. I also have to give some credit to Colin Farrell, considering I never expect much out of him. Unlike some of his other movies, he was not in it to steal the spotlight. Everyone played their parts without any excessive over-acting. This movie is a historical drama, but I feel like the history aspect is merely a backdrop for the Terrence Malick play. In his production, the flowing waters and the forest canopy are the actors, and the gentle reflections of troubled minds are the words. Truly, this is an incredible film. I have waited a long time for Terrence Malick to wow me again, and he has done exactly that. If you want a movie that tears at your heart strings, then go see something recycled like Brokeback Mountain. If you want a transcendental experience, one that challenges you to go deeper than the surface of the film, then The New World is waiting.",10,328,517,22 January 2006
Batman Returns," Tim Burton at his finest.
","It is easily debatable to determine which of Burton's films reigns as his best. The only other movie which comes close to this caliber of filmmaking it the dark comedy Edward Scissorhands. But Batman Returns is the best movie I have ever seen which utilizes a dark comic atmosphere as the backdrop for a superhero setting. Where it exceeds the greatness of the original Batman is clearly the art direction. The winter season adds to the looming darkness of this film, which is simply fantastic. It also employs four of the perfect actors to carry out these twisted characters. Danny DeVito shines as the vile Penguin, and Chris Walken is beautiful as the manipulative business man. Of course, no one can undermine the fact that Michael Keaton was the best Batman ever, especially in this work. There are also so many perfect shots in this movie, on behalf of our fine director. The most memorable, in my mind, is when the Penguin emerges from the water before his death, the blood dripping from his face. It is just a clear and shocking shot. Along with the most impressive Danny Elfman score ever, this is the perfect Tim Burton feature ever. No matter how many times I watch it, I am in awe of this brutally honest and dark film. God bless Tim Burton!",9,0,0,4 August 2002
Schindler's List," The Best Directed Movie Ever Made.
",There are very few movies which excel in every category of good filmmaking. Schindler's List is on the top of almost every category in my mind. But what stands out the most is the direction. Schindler's List has to be hands down the best directed film I have ever seen. Saving Private Ryan is the only movie which truly comes close. Spielberg is perhaps the greatest director we have ever seen in the film industry. This movie is perfect. I give it more acclaim than any other film made within the last twenty-five years.,10,9,13,8 May 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Sequel is far more than the original
","We see a lot of sequels now. Some are horrible. Others outshine their predecessors. And now we have a sequel to the beloved Matrix, four-years in the making. And like Star Wars Episode 5 or Blade II, this sequel blows the original apart. Why? The visuals are more stunning, but that is hardly the important factor. The story here, although simple, is twice that of the original. The first Matrix was beautifully crafted to shock and surprise the audience with this image of fabricated reality. There is no way the sequel will copy that same format, considering that we already know what we are supposed to know about the system and the prophecy of the one. But The Matrix was not original in its most basic story. It follows in the same tradidition as the original Star Wars trilogy: a man who is ignorant of the world around him steps into his role as the savior of mankind. The Matrix is like that. However, Reloaded provides us with only remnants of that first storyline. Now it is a discovery of the 'why' question rather than the 'how'. There is a dumbfounding twist at the end (which I will not reveal here. See the movie!) which adds an entirely new dimension to the story. There are also some strong Classical themes here regarding leadership, themes which are brought up with the same questions of choice in Vergil's Aeneid. Reloaded may initially seem like nothing more than an action movie with some philosophy as a bonus. But to those who listen carefully and comprehend what it is they are saying, Reloaded is an incredible experience. Though of course you may have to see it twice to fully grasp what the Wachowski's are trying to accomplish. But, why wouldn't you see it twice? It is just that awesome.",9,0,0,15 May 2003
The Thin Red Line," Simply put...the greatest war film of all time.
","The heading 'greatest (blank) ever' is thrown around a lot, almost jokingly at times. But this is, in my opinion, genuinely the perfect war film. Because it came out in the same year as Saving Private Ryan, Malick's masterpiece took a back seat to a grittier, more realistic war film. But what we as viewers got in 1998 were two movies that showed different aspects of war. Saving Private Ryan is hailed because the film-making was so involving and intense that it makes the viewer feel like they are actually in war. On the other hand, The Thin Red Line, from one of the finest director/screenwriters in the world, Terrence Malick, does not dilute the effect of the violence of war, but it also shows how psychological war can be. Often, we have seen movies like Apocalypse Now, where the mental damage of war drives a man to insanity, but that is not what Malick wanted to show. The Thin Red Line is just as realistic as Saving Private Ryan, but the emotional spike is far more powerful. Part of that comes from Malick's trademark transcendentalist film-making, showing the sweeping landscapes and the beauty of nature, while at the same time emphasizing the environmental injury brought about by the interaction between men and nature. Part of the emotional draw comes from the characters, and there are many. Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are phenomenal as they always have been, but it is the supporting cast that brings the reality of this film to light. Dash Mihok comes off as a surprise, as does Jim Caviezel, in one of his earlier roles. But there is also the Malick 'silent character,' here personified by a pale and small Adrien Brody. Other actors of note that only made this film more incredible include Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, John Savage, John Cusack, and Miranda Otto. But one of the keys to the success of this movie is the powerful, ominous score by my personal favorite, Hans Zimmer. The scene in which the army storms the Japanese camp is chilling, both with what is shown on screen and how Zimmer's music hauntingly beautiful. All of the elements of fantastic film-making are present, yet that does not answer fully the question of why this movie alone stands above all the other war films in history. What does Terrence Malick do that makes The Thin Red Line so effective? When you watch war movies, there is seldom a personal feel them. Hundreds of soldiers race into battle, and many of them die. The Thin Red Line has these clich√© scenes, but there is another echelon of consciousness. Malick uses voice over narratives not to explain what is happening, but to explain what exists in the mind and not on the battlefield. War is not merely fought with arms, but with minds and hearts. At one moment, an American is killing Japanese soldiers and ridiculing their dead; yet soon, he shakes so hard that he cannot contain his own fear. This is kind of war that has never really existed before in film. For a plot as simple as taking one hill on a Pacific Island in World War II, The Thin Red Line supplements with substantial philosophy and psychology, showing the humanity as well as the darkness of war. In essence, The Thin Red Line is the most complete war movie ever made. If it had come out a year before Saving Private Ryan, perhaps we would consider it first when we think of revolutionary films. It is a complicate tale, one that is anti-war while still recognizing the courage and glory of it. You would be hard pressed to argue that it can be labeled as simply as pro or anti-war. But that is how Malick tells his stories. The moral ambiguity of humanity set against the backdrop of the natural world is his method. I have never seen another movie as significant and brilliant as The Thin Red Line. It is easy to compare it with movies like Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, but Malick's film is on an entirely different level.In this war, there is a thin red line between sanity and madness.",10,0,1,17 April 2006
Contact," Not so much a sci-fi flick as a spiritual journey.
","This film is a borderline excellent movie. However, it has some simple plot elements which seem to be prevalent in most other movies of this sort. Then again, it has a few messages to which we as both rational thinkers and movie-goers should pay attention. The first is that of the existence of God. The movie shows how a traumatic experience could so well cause someone to lose faith in a higher being. Yet even if we don't believe in God, there are hints that He is trying to speak to us. This movie shows that very well. The other is that of science versus religion. We see both extremes in this movie, but we also see the logical middle-man. Matthew McConaughey's character makes a statement that both science and religion are aspiring to the same goal, which is the search for truth. Of course this movie cannot change the beliefs of either extreme, but it is something to think about. God and science can coexist. Palmer Joss is the proof in this case. Overall, this film has the conflict which will cause people to either love it or hate it. It is not meant to be a triller. It is supposed to be spiritual, like an M. Night Shyamalan film. Whether we choose to acknowledge that or not, that is our own choice to make.",8,0,2,31 August 2002
