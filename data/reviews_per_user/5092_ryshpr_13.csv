The Hangover," Sure To Become A Cult Classic
","'You mind putting on some pants? I feel weird having to ask you twice.'It has become so rare in this century, to find a genuinely decent and funny comedy. In the crowd of Scary Movie type comedies, Todd Phillips' fresh and hilarious The Hangover stands out as a clear winner for modern comedy.The plot is simple: four friends travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and wake up the next morning with no memory of what happened the previous night, this plus the fact that they don't know where the groom is makes for a roller-coaster ride of hilarity as the remaining three friends try to find him in time for his wedding the next day.In short, The Hangover is just genuinely funny. It may actually be the funniest movie I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time, so much so that it has become one of my favourite movies. Galifianakis, the 'child with a beard', effectively makes this movie the brilliantly hilarious trip that it is. His unashamedly idiotic behaviour provides much of the hilarity and it seems as if the movie would be pretty empty without him. But all three leading men have brilliant chemistry together and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing a different role in this movie.The Hangover is sure to become a cult classic and I don't see it ever getting old. I also really never thought I'd be feeling sorry for Heather Graham's character at the end. So far I've seen this five times and I'll probably watch it a hundred times more. A definite must buy!http://ukmore.tk/",10,3,6,18 May 2010
Se7en," A Great & Sadistic Action Thriller
","This review contains minor spoilers.I heard about Se7en from the DVD cover of Saw in which The Guardian compared the two movies, claiming Saw to go 'up to EI8GHT'. Naturally, I expected a movie quite similar to Saw in terms of violence and gore. I didn't get it. The stories of both movies and are relatively similar, but Se7en is more of a crime thriller in which a serial killer murders his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins, claiming the people he killed deserved it. That's where the similarities end.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have great chemistry on-screen. They are genuinely believable in their roles, the tried and tested 'retiring cop' and 'new cop' formula. The crime scenes they visit aren't shown in great detail, leaving much to the imagination. For instance, the crime scene in which a woman has had her nose cut off 'to spite her face' (in an effort to teach her that inner beauty is more important than outer) simply shows shots of the body at a medium long shot and shows no close- ups of the woman's actual face.All-in-all, it's a brilliantly constructed movie that deals out the suspense and tends to keep the viewer guessing. Arguably the highlight is the climax in which all the questions you're asking yourself throughout are answered, not to mention the nasty shock Brad Pitt's character gets. I'm pretty sure that the ending is widely known even with people who haven't seen the movie, as I myself knew the ending prior to watching it. I would expect I'd have enjoyed it much better if I hadn't known how it ended but despite this, I did thoroughly enjoy it.http://ukmore.tk/",8,0,0,5 February 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Brilliant
","Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd caused a bit of controversy when it was released in 2007. It's a musical, although you wouldn't know it from the trailer (below). As usual, Burton gives the story his own unique twist of weirdness and it, again, pays off.Johnny Depp is in the lead role as with most of Burton's recent films and although his vocals aren't his strongest point, he sure does play a convincing Todd. His negative and vengeful attitude is portrayed brilliantly. It's easy to see why Burton has a fondness for Depp.The cast of Sweeney Todd isn't too shabby either. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Sacha Baron Cohen and Timothy Spall co-star as Mrs. Lovett, Judge Turpin, Pirelli and Beadle respectively and they do a great job.The musical aspect was what I was most concerned with, not being a huge fan of musicals myself. But it made for great viewing and I found myself thinking that the story wouldn't have quite been the same without the musical numbers there.Aside from the musical aspect, the film's 18 certificate delivers as there's a fair bit of bloodshed with enough slit throats and battered heads to keep any bloodthirsty horror fan happy.I won't reveal any of the story, I'll save that for when you sit down on your sofa to watch it, but rest assured Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is an entertaining tale.http://ukmore.tk/",8,0,0,6 February 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Funny & Heartwarming
","The Devil Wears Prada is a loose adaption of the book of the same name. It follows Anne Hathaway as Andy who moves to New York city aspiring to be a journalist. She ends up getting a job as an assistant to fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).This is a review coming from a blind-viewer; someone who has never even leafed through the book on which the movie is based. But from the opening lines of KT Tunstall's 'Suddenly I See' it's clear what kind of movie this is. But chick flick or no chick flick, The Devil Wears Prada is something different. It's a feelgood movie that really anyone can enjoy.Meryl Streep is brilliant as Miranda Priestly, the 'bitch' of the movie, who never raises her voice above usual speaking level throughout the entire movie, leading you to think there's something more to her character. Anne Hathaway, as usual, plays the charismatic and 'sweet' role and does it perfectly. It's odd how funny it is when Hathaway swears. Emily Blunt, appearing in one of her first major supporting roles here,There is a bit of a story twist during the second half of the film which makes the story a little more three dimensional than how it was previously running. You get to see different sides of the central characters too.You can pretty much guess the ending, but that doesn't stop you from getting a warm feeling inside and a sense of satisfaction that everything worked out okay in the end. The Devil Wears Prada doesn't ask much of you, it's a very funny and heartwarming tale.http://ukmore.tk/",6,1,2,19 March 2010
District 9," Epic.
","After plans for the Halo movie fell through, Peter Jackson went to Neill Blomkamp and offered him $30 million to make whatever he wanted. This was the result.Oscar nominated? Normally the typical sign of a snore-fest. However, District 9 is a pretty fun ride. The thriller is presented in a mockumentary style from the opening and that gives it a little more charm. You get to identify with Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the main character who we follow right through to the bitter end.District 9 sees a world or at least a part of the world, where aliens living on the same planet as humans is seen as the norm. Wikus, working with the government, polices their activity and stumbles upon an unknown alien object which starts to have strange effects on him. If you're not interested now, you probably close this page and go rent Steel Magnolias or something.The story moves along at a rather quick pace so much so that the opening scenes feel too rushed. It does keep you hooked all the way though to the epic final scene though. The visuals are stunning. The CGI is flawlessly realistic, the aliens (or 'prawns') didn't look as computer- generated as I'd initially anticipated and the various explosions, bloody battles and shoot-outs are brilliantly entertaining.The $30million budget is surprising considering the film looks like the budget was considerably higher, I was simply amazed with the special effects and would probably go as far as to say that this is one of the best science fiction films of the decade. I don't give a five-star rating often, but it really couldn't be recommended more.http://ukmore.tk/",10,0,4,28 February 2010
The Football Factory," It's nothing brilliant, but it's a pretty good watch.
","To be honest, movies like The Football Factory aren't usually ones I enjoy. But this one really surprised me. The Football Factory is a study of the English obsession with football violence and hooliganism, but there's so much more here. It's documentary-like presentation gives the film more charm than if it was presented as just a generic movie.Although I do have to say that Danny Dyer seems to play the same character in every movie he's in (Doghouse, Severance and Mean Machine are just a few examples) you can't fault him for it because he does it well and believably. His character, Tommy Johnson, is a typical British football fan who just, as he puts it, 'loves to f*cking fight'.Dyer also narrates the movie, giving it that documentary vibe, making you think you're actually watching a retelling of events that have actually happened. Dyer's narration also gives his character a little more depth and does a good job of effectively separating him from the rest of the cast.The Football Factory is essentially played out as a serious approach to the issue of football hooliganism, but there's something more there. The sub-plot of Tommy's granddad and his war-time friend moving abroad together with Tommy's recurring dreams that play out like sort of Final Destination-esquire premonitions give the story that little bit more depth.The Football Factory is a hugely entertaining and funny movie that isn't exclusively for only football fans. It's nothing brilliant, but it's a pretty good watch.http://ukmore.tk/",5,2,3,24 March 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Amazing. But what do you expect from Tarantino?
","Quentin Tarantino does what he does best in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, his fourth film. The movie sees The Bride (Uma Thurman) who decides to escape her life as a killer. She fled to Texas, met a young man, and on the day of their wedding was gunned down. Four years later she wakes from a coma and discovers her baby is gone. She decides to get revenge on the people who were responsible for her death.It's pretty mind blowing and gruesome stuff, but that's what Tarantino is known for. The blood is so gratuitous but that's what makes it brilliant. As with Tarantino's other films, he mixes dark humour with peril and mixes it amazingly well. None of it is pointless and none of it takes anything away from the story. It just flows seamlessly.Uma Thurman is superb in the role of 'The Bride'; the vicious woman seeking revenge on Bill. You can really feel her rage and determination as she ticks off the people on her 'death list'. Lucy Liu also does a fine job of portraying O-Ren Ishii; one of the five people who played a part in almost ending her life.The lengthy sword fight scene will keep you wanting more and the cliffhanger will ensure you will want to watch Kill Bill: Vol 2. Brilliant.http://ukmore.tk/",8,2,5,19 March 2010
Paranormal Activity," Brilliant
","Paranormal Activity's poster recommends that you don't see it alone. I'm glad I did though. I also watched it in a dark room whilst wearing headphones.I had heard a fair bit about the film and there was a great amount of hype surrounding it. I wasn't let down. The film follows Katie and Micah as they try to record bizarre events that are happening around their home.Maybe it was due to the fact that I watched it on my own or maybe it was because I used headphones. But Paranormal Activity made me jump and shiver more than a few times. The strange events get more intense as the film goes on and as a result the tension is built up brilliantly. I never thought I'd actually be scared of a shaking light fixture, a shadow or a door. But I was.I've seen all three endings to Paranormal Activity and I have to say that it really doesn't matter which one you see. All the endings are effective and chilling in their own way. I'd have to say I prefer the original version the best, it's the most unexpected ending of the three.The movie was actually made in 2007, but didn't get a release until 2009. I'll never understand why it took so long to find distribution. It's one of the best horror movies in recent years.http://ukmore.tk/",9,2,4,14 February 2010
Alice in Wonderland," A brilliant new take on a classic story.
","If you're interested in seeing Alice In Wonderland because you love the classic story, perhaps this isn't for you. Tim Burton's version is quite different to the classic Lewis Carroll and Disney versions in that the story is more or less completely different.The film follows Alice, now nineteen, as she returns to Underland, although she believes her first trip to the magical place was all a dream. All the classic characters are there: Matt Lucas as both Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, Anne Hathaway as the White Queen and, of course, the outstanding Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter.The film itself is pretty much 95% CGI, which gives it the 'Wonderland' look. It's simply a brilliant film to look at, nothing looks too 'computerised', even when taking into account the drastically varied heights of the characters compared to the actors portraying them. The acting highlights for me were Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter. They are by far the funniest characters, even if Hathaway's White Queen may not be intended to be all that amusing.As for the 3D aspect, as with most other productions being released in the format in recent months, it brings a bit more charm to the scene. Nothing too gimmicky is there either.I'd highly recommend a trip to your local cinema to see Alice In Wonderland, but make sure you see it in 3D for that little extra magic. Tim Burton really can do no wrong.http://ukmore.tk/",9,17,32,10 March 2010
Avatar," Believe The Hype
","I'm sure even before you started to read this review you knew it was going to be a good one. But it's hard to find faults with James Cameron's Avatar. The fact that the movie has been in development since 1999 says a great deal about Cameron's determination and the sheer volume of work that went into producing this cinematic delight.Avatar is a tricky one, you do actually have to pay attention and follow the plot as it happens. It's not a sit down and lounge about on the sofa movie. I'm not going to waffle on and tell you the plot though, I really don't want to ruin it for you. You can use WIkipedia or IMDb for that anyway.The visuals in Avatar are just stunning. The CGI is literally flawless. So much so that it's not directly obvious that you're actually watching computer generated images, it all looks extremely realistic. Sam Worthington, of Terminator: Salvation fame, is absolutely brilliant in this, the same can be said for Sigourney Weaver, who features in the film quite surprisingly, as she isn't featured prominently on any of the promotional material.There is really no reason not to watch Avatar in 3D or in an IMAX theatre, I couldn't give a completely accurate comparison of watching in 3D as opposed to 2D but the three dimensional aspect of the film worked amazingly well, people in the cinema were actually wow-ing throughout. The world of the Na'vi tribe is literally breathtaking and full of colour and life. You really do have to see it for yourself.http://ukmore.tk/",10,1,3,5 February 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi is back to his best.
","This review contains very minor spoilers.I really wanted to see Drag Me To Hell because I'm a big fan of Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead movies. I've always thought Raimi was a brilliant horror film maker. Drag Me To Hell's opening scene is extremely effective. It just keeps you wanting more. Raimi works brilliantly at letting the audience know what they're in for.There's more than just a hint of The Evil Dead in here. Raimi works on convincing you that the characters are just every day normal people in which extraordinary things are going to happen. Within 15 minutes, you know Lohman's character is in trouble and that's where the jumps start. Most of them are cheap shocks in truth, but they all work really well. You'll know what I mean when you jump out of your seat because of a handkerchief.When I went to see this at the cinema with friends most of them had pretty much the same reaction. Not being familiar with Raimi's work or that the movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek and quite funny in parts, the general opinion was that it failed as a horror movie, but succeeded as a comedy movie. The 'gumming' scene comes to mind as a particularly funny scene which is also quite sinister at the same time.I find it particularly amusing that I went to see this movie three times at the cinema and this is my second view of it on DVD and I still jump out of my seat at some of the scares. Some of them are just so unexpected that when you watch it again you just forget they're there.There are two different versions of the movie available in the US, theatrical and uncut. The uncut version is the only version available in the UK, although the DVD artwork does not specify this. A few scenes are bloodier and the F-bomb is dropped. The certificate is still 15 though. I couldn't recommend picking up Drag Me To Hell more, it's officially one of my new favourite movies.http://ukmore.tk/",10,2,5,5 February 2010
Hancock," A fun night in.
","Hancock is quite simply Will Smith's best comedy film since 1997's Men In Black (we'll ignore MIB:II). As the title suggests, the film follows Hancock, an alcoholic 'superhero' living in Los Angeles who causes nothing but trouble and unnecessary damage whilst saving lives.Hancock isn't your typical superhero movie and wasn't what I expected in most aspects. Although it's not exactly a huge budget movie based on a Marvel or DC Comics character (Spiderman 3 had a budget $58million more than Hancock) the special effects aren't too bad, with the exception of the computer generated fight, it's just too obviously CGI.At the risk of sounding offensive, Will Smith is brilliant at playing a rude and obnoxious character. He pulls of the 'a**ehole' character pretty well. Writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan really know how to create a 3D character that the audience genuinely cares about.Although it does start to drag on a little towards the end, it really keeps you interested right up until the end credits start to roll. It's laugh out loud funny at times, the twist is brilliant and there's even a little tribute to Superman in there, if you can spot it.Watch it, it's a fun night in.http://ukmore.tk/",6,0,4,4 March 2010
Sherlock Holmes," A brilliant reboot.
","Sherlock Holmes, the latest offering from Guy Richie is a pretty decent movie if I'm honest. Not at all what I expected. For the most part you don't even feel like you're watching a movie. For instance, part of the opening titles are superimposed onto cobblestones and the other part is written in a newspaper-like form. It's a pretty refreshing change.It's pretty clear from the outset that Downey Jr. nails Holmes' accent and speech patterns. Not once do you believe the actor playing Holmes' actually has an American accent, and the same can be said for Jude Law as Watson.Although I don't usually comment on the soundtrack of films, I do feel I should mention the soundtrack in Sherlock Holmes. Hans Zimmer's 'Discombobulate' is used at various points in the movie, most notably in the opening credits and it helps greatly in setting the scene. It's hard to imagine a better fitting score for this movie.Although this is going to sound pretty cliché, Jude Law is on fine form here, his portrayal of Dr. Watson as both a friend of Holmes and as a professional is literally flawless, the chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law works extremely well. Mark Strong is brilliant as the movie's villain Lord Blackwood, he seems to play bad guys pretty well, he's all you could want from the 'dark side': mysterious, cunning and quite creepy. A notable highlight here for me was Rachel McAdams' portrayal of Irene Adler, a criminal and past love-interest of Holmes'. McAdams has certainly come a long way since her Mean Girls days and really shows exactly what she can do with her acting skills here.Acting talent aside, I was pleasantly surprised when I went to my local cinema to see Sherlock Holmes. The martial arts aspect was new to me. I've never pictured Sherlock Holmes as a martial artist, but it did bring a decent helping of action to the table. There's a pretty decent helping of humour here too; the movie works surprisingly well with a small helping of comedy thrown in here and there, although there's not enough there for big laughs, it brings a certain charm to the scene.I won't ruin any of the story in this review as I'm aware my past two reviews were a little too revealing in terms of plot details and spoilers. All I can say is if you haven't already, I would strongly recommend going to see Sherlock Holmes. There really is something there for anyone.http://ukmore.tk/",9,0,0,5 February 2010
