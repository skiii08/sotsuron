Mission: Impossible III," The television show, it is not!
","When the first Mission Impossible movie came out, I went to see it, knowing that it could not possible be as good as the television show. I was right! I did not even bother going to see MI2. But I had some time on my hands this weekend, so I thought I'd go to see MI3. It was not even as good as the first; and that's pretty bad! About the only thing MI:3 has in common with the television show is the title and some of the music. And the music is recycled.The story is nowhere as good as the plots in the television show. And, although Tom Cruise is not a bad actor, he is no Steven Hill or Peter Graves. If either of them have bothered watching the movie, they probably laughed.I give the movie a 5 (which may be generous) because it may be a fair movie, if you are not expecting anything near the original show. But if you were a fan of the show, just be happy with some of the episodes you may find on VHS or DVD. Don't bother spending good money to watch a fair rip-off.",5,5,14,7 May 2006
United 93," A thought-provoking look back at 'that day'
","This was a well-done look back at a day we will all remember. I was especially amazed how the writers/directors took some scenes that, by necessity, were chaotic, and made them make sense.Now, to be sure, this movie was not, nor was it made to be 'entertaining', but it seemed to convey the urgency of the day's events and did a good job of changing the victims from sheer numbers to understandable characters.The 'beauty' of this movie, if you want to call it that, is that it was a movie that will stick with you (my hands were sore after the movie from gripping my armrest through most of the picture).This one should be around come Oscar time for Best Picture. Due to the nature of the film, I'm sure none of the cast members will earn any awards; but that simply means that they were doing their job. This movie was about the events and the people. It was not made to call attention to any of the actors.I would heartily recommend this one for adults. Of course, I wouldn't want any child (or adolescent, for that matter) to relive this day unless they are really up to it.Thanks to the Paul Greengrass for having the courage to do the movie; and thanks to the families of the victims for sharing their stories with us.",10,4,10,30 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Go ahead and give Hanks and Howard their Oscars.
","This movie is what great movie-making is all about. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou are flawless in the film. The writers manage to make the movie both interesting and easy-to-follow for those of us who sometimes have trouble doing so.Paul Bettany does a superb job in a role which could not have been easy to do.And Ron Howard has created a masterpiece. The movie is visually stunning.Now, to be fair, it should be said that those who go ready to be offended probably will be. But, having said that, I think the movie will be a big hit at Oscar time and will withstand the test of time.",10,1,3,21 May 2006
