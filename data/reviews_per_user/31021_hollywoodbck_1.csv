Hereditary," This movie is bad for the soul
","Don't, please do not watch this movie. This movie came from the pit of hell. What happened to the days of Hollywood not displaying horrible things happening to children? The Jason movies would kill teenagers but no movie writers would go further than that. Even after all the terrors you force yourself to get through the end of this movie, there was no light at the end of the tunnel. Just torcher from beginning to end. So if you watch thus a second time, something is psychologically wrong.",1,1,5,2 February 2019
