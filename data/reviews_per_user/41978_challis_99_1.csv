Source Code," Uninteresting, deserved to be a bomb at the box office.
","I usually like foreign and independent movies, so I don't need to be entertained by a bunch of explosions. But this movie was incredibly dull and nonsensical. Dry, and the longer the movie goes on, the more you start to realize that you've wasted your time and can never get those minutes of your life back. A plot line of Jake Gyllenhaal's character trying to go back in time to stop a tragic accident devolves into an unnecessary 'conspiracy' type story with characters you couldn't care less about. And I now hate Michelle Monaghan, because if I ever hear the words 'I took your advice...' again (it's repeated as a loop throughout the movie), I might punch someone. This is the poor man's Memento.",Null,10,17,28 August 2011
