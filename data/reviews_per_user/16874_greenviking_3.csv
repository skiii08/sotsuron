Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Still Sucks
","Yep, even after seeing how bad The Force Awakens turned out to be. Two wrongs don't make this movie right, folks.In fact, I spent years analyzing exactly how much this movie sucked, beginning with standing in line 17 years ago, and very much continuing on through the subsequent excuses.'Sure, it wasn't a great movie, but it's just a setup for the next one, and that one will be great.' Which is what they said about the next movie... and the next movie...I've concluded that TPM was the 9/11 of American cinema: a monumental disaster that we all saw coming (Independence Day, Twister, etc setting the table for hollow CG 'blockbusters'), and yet seemed powerless to prevent. Because 1999 turned out to be something of a watershed for the endless slough of BOOM BOOM crap ever since.Transformers. Jupiter Ascending. The Hobbit (and LOTR itself, depending on who you ask). The Matrix sequels. Jurassic World. Avatar. You know what I mean.The Floodgates of the Subpar had broken; Pandora's Box of flashy kitsch could never be closed again. Jar Jar - frighteningly - became the new normal. What, you consider a franchise where a car urinates on a guy's head to hold *any* artistic integrity? Maybe not, but you know you paid to see it.Good job, George.",1,4,18,8 January 2016
Avatar," Who's the Hottest Garbage of Them All?
","As the pandering Frankenstein that is the new Star Wars 'movie' steamrolls its way toward dethroning Avatar's (inexplicable) preeminence, I thought I'd finally get around to copping a squat on this most mind-bogglingly absurd success story.As with The Force Awakens, people just couldn't hand over their money fast enough, and as with The Force Awakens, I have absolutely no idea why. Because I'll just never be on board with the one & only 'argument' for this movie: 'the effects are really great and it looks like a lifelike world to escape into'. Or some variation of such.But notice that *serious* components of story-telling don't get mentioned... stuff like story lines, acting... you know, crap like that. Instead, it would seem that this movie reached $2.7 billion because it's 'pretty'.Okay, so it looks nice... right?Nope. In fact, I was so overwhelmingly disappointed with ALL of the effects that I just could not reconcile myself with the fact that people became so obsessed with 'Pandora' that many of them were seriously depressed when the movie ended. The blue people themselves were unusually inexcusable in this regard. What the hell were the masses smoking before going into theaters around the world?This, incidentally, is one of those 'life lesson' moments, especially for the 21st century: if you're so disconnected from the real world that you need shallow entertainment to break free of your own self-imposed mental prison, then...GO OUTSIDE. Seriously.There's a whole world out there! Sights! Sounds! Living things! Or just switch over to PBS once in a while. You'll see critters that don't look stupid! There really is life beyond James Cameron's (allegedly) plagiarized movie, folks.And to address an amusingly secondary factor of the film-making process: the actual storyline. I remember back in 'the old days' when I would hear about Director's Cuts, and how superior they must have been to the versions of movies that got past the studios, focus groups, etc. But boy, did this movie change that.Avatar is a prime example of what happens when no one says NO. This whole thing just felt like a rough draft. From repeated lines to extraneous dialogue, it felt like a significant rush job (not least because the effects were so surprisingly weak as well).One glaring example that stood out for me: the assessment of the dangers the military would be facing. Early in the movie, it was described as 'worse than hell out there', and yet it's also shown that the worst the blue people could do was fire arrows into tires so massive that they didn't even have an impact.And sure enough, the later onslaught was met with such flimsy resistance that The Bad Guy was calmly sipping coffee in a flying vehicle during a major firefight. 'Worse than hell'? Why, because he risked his coffee cooling to room temperature?I don't get it. I never will. The only high point of the movie, as far as I'm concerned, was Michelle Rodriguez's low neckline. I'll never get sick of seeing that woman with a gun.But do a few shots of cleavage make up for two and a half hours of smurf puke? That, friends, is what we call a rhetorical question. Look it up.",1,10,15,9 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Pavlov's Demographic
","Remake? Reboot? Retread?Maybe a recap? It is - as has been observed ad nauseam - the first six movies rolled into one. And thus one could summarize this project as a super long 'previously, on _____...', with some sort of retro/remix shake & bake machination going on.But here's what this movie IS NOT: a movie.What the hell does that mean? It means that the entertainment industry has finally figured out how to make one film into all things to all people. Not a script or an idea later fine-tuned via test screenings, but rather a gargantuan project that *began* with test screenings. Except on a global scale.So yeah, it's The Perfect Movie. On paper, anyway. Perfectly timed references, perfectly excusable plot holes, perfectly cast characters... the overtly Nazi 'not-empire' versus a black guy & a chick being the glaring example. Yep. For what Disney spent to acquire the franchise, you're damn right they're going to pander to even the 'subtlest' of zeitgeist sensibilities (is it politically incorrect to call this movie out on its political correctness?).You have to look no further than the positive reviews of TFA to see what a paper tiger it is. Apologetics abound! 'Sure, it's THE SAME MOVIE AS THE FIRST ONE... WITH A BAD BOOB JOB (metaphorically, of course), but otherwise it's like living your childhood all over again!'Really, scroll through these ratings & reviews. Grown adults with educations are shelling out these rationalizations by the hundreds. To quote, by contrast, a good movie: 'did IQs just drop sharply while I was away?'Let's review a specific moment of the Cosmic Cash Cow that is TFA. Yep: spoilers.Not-Luke on not-Tatooine (with not-R2) is destitute. She's looking for scraps to sell for food. This obviously suggests a bleak landscape. And then she runs by the 'garbage' ship... oh, ha-ha, it's THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!!!1!!! OMG OMG YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYExcept that this 'derelict' ship 1) still runs perfectly, 2) is sitting out in the open, in plain sight, 3) more/less has the keys in the ignition, and 4) can be flown around & through tight spaces by this chick with zero experience doing such. But no one thinks of scrapping/selling/stealing it. Huh?Oh, and yeah: out of the whole entire vast expanse of the ~H~U~G~E~ universe, naturally she flies the thing straight to its former owner.That's right. It's as preposterous all around as it sounds. And people with *doctorates* can't hand over their money fast enough for this crap.Garbage, indeed.The 'movie' is a patchwork of this at literally every turn. It's nothing even remotely coherent, it's simply a magnificent sociology project. It is cinematic proof that you can haul a wheelbarrow of cold dog feces in front of a crowd of people... but if the excrement is presented in just the right way - with just the right amount of glitter on a Star Wars nametag shoved in there somewhere - people will salivate, salivate, salivate.If the best the masses can say about TFA is 'at least it's better than the prequels', then please... bring on the apocalypse before the next chapter in the 'saga' drops unmercifully from Uncle Walt's cold cryogenic crapper.Which reminds me: what's up with many of my fellow naysayers using TFA to start rewriting history as it pertains to George Lucas? What, the guy gets a saintly glow and an attempted collective amnesia because this installment was nothing more than bloated candy?No.First off, George sold the franchise, and while he does have the right to complain about it as much as anyone, let's not forget what an epic middle finger The Phantom Menace was to the world. Yeah, yeah, Jar Jar sucked. But more than that, it was six years & three disasters of FFFF YOU.Remember when the practically legendary Darth Vader was demoted & denigrated into Twilight in a plastic hat? And it only took roughly seven hours of ~RETCH~ masterful ~RETCH~ storytelling to get there! ~RETCH~ Christ in a cardboard box.We know, George. You worked 'really hard' to make 'original worlds' and all that. Sure. Like shoehorning Jabba into Phantom, and having Anakin not only on Luke's same planet, but also building C-3PO! There's that small universe again.You blew it, George. The enemy of my enemy is not my friend. Not in this case, anyway.",1,29,39,4 January 2016
