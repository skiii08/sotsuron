10 Cloverfield Lane," Not that good & previews still spoiled it such a bummer!!!
",Well here we go...I really do hate spoilers in fact I go into the movies 15 minutes late just to avoid the previews yet still the TV commercial previews ruined this movie for me...The small plot twists are revealed in the previews all of them in fact so stop with the no spoilers thing...I do very much appreciate the attempt by the filmmakers and actors they did their best to keep it secret but any trained film-goer can tell the twists just from the simple things in the previews...I was so excited to see this movie hoping that the previews gave nothing away but alas just like The Score (A Great Movie had I not seen the previews)this was done in by a released trailer spoiler...Total Bummer!!!,3,3,7,25 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," 70 MM great experience thanks Quentin for real filmmaking!!
","Great movie great experience so happy to see in 70 MM the Overture and Intermission brings back a time when you go to see a film to actually see a film...Just wonderful to see this come back I hope others can learn that trailers that give away plots and internet blogs that give away movies main themes ruin the experience of going to the movie... Put away your cell phones and stop with all the texting and please stop the twitter universe that is killing the creative universe everything is being re tweeted or copied...Get it if you don't watch your movies online or on demand you drones and sheeple. Stay true thank you Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer & Quentin!!!",Null,10,34,31 December 2015
The Revenant," A little overrated some inconsistencies caused my disbelief...
","The opening scene was great excellent cinematography, directing, editing and all the rest of the whole Hollywood Oscar thing of it...The following scenes were all fairly decent but after about 30 minutes into the film it just grinded to a slow crawling pace pun intended with long extended shots of yada, yada, yada... I love the scenery but some of the long extended pain and flashback scenes were just a but much...The biggest problem I had with this film are the major inconsistencies with the weather snow levels to be exact. (Maybe Global Warming is so bad it is causing our greatest American commodity to be messed with that being the Film Industry) I know it is very hard to match up weather with shooting sequences but come on Alejandro you can do better after that Academy Award for Birdman!",6,0,2,4 March 2016
1941," Excellent Movie you must watch w open mind & goofy soul!!!
","I just love this movie so many great scenes with so many classic actors... I am not sure why this great movie is so underrated & so unappreciated it is truly one of the greatest movies to come out of 1979 as I consider it one of the greatest comedies of the 80's & of all time...Just look at some of the individual scenes on their own...The great Jaws opening spoof... John Belushi is incredible with both of his characters...Dan Aykroyd and John Candy fantastic especially later in the tank scene...Timothy Stack, Treat Williams, and Nancy Williams all great...Warren Oats and Robert Stack both great...Every scene with Slim Pickens just classic the Submarine scenes some of the best pure gut laughter the spoof of Dr. Strangelove great stuff...And the dummy just hilarious my god the dummies right...If you don't laugh at this wonderful film you are dead inside...Steven deserves some recognition for this well directed film!!!",10,0,1,4 March 2016
