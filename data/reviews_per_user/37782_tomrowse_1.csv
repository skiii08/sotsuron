The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Truly Outstanding
","To say this movie was great would be selling it short. It became increasingly hard for me to find faults in such a deeply moving yet charming tale of a junior and his battle with starting a new era in his schooling life, and thats not to say I didn't look for some. I was more than ready to put it down as yet another lame high school film that will halt the progress of up and coming star Logan Lerman, yet was pleasantly surprised to see him absolutely smash the role out of the park, his performance was gripping, disturbing and as convincing as you could possibly ask from your lead actor. Probably my biggest surprise was to see Emma Watson really step up to the plate in what I would say is a career defining role, obviously Harry Potter put her on the map, but her portrayal of Sam, a scarred hipster trying to find her way, will really set her free of her image as 'that girl from harry potter' something I can't imagine Daniel Radcliff will be doing any time soon.As all good movies manage to do, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower manages to take you in and for 100 minutes you actually forget your watching a movie and feel like your on this journey with the characters. It sounds clich√© but any film that can take you on this sought of emotional roller coaster is a winner in my books. 4.5/5 stars",9,1,2,17 December 2012
