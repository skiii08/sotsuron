First Man," Just fantastic
","Everything about this is impressive and deeply touching. Anyone expecting glossy sci-fi look elsewhere, anyone expecting a sincere look into what it really meant to go to the moon step this way.Those writing it off as depressing and gloomy are missing the point, this wasn't a jolly adventure, this was serious hard work done by serious people with immense pressure on their shoulders.Outstanding effort from all involved and a fine tribute to the spirit of those that went above and beyond.",10,1,3,22 February 2019
