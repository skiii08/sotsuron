Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," For a Selective Audience
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a movie for a very selective audience, who have an unmeasurable passion for movies and knows the history of Hollywood industry, also you must know the Quentin Tarantino movie style and be ready for the surprise.
The meandering leads all three inexorably towards the night of 8 August, 1969, when a violent confrontation with the Manson Family occurs and all were murdered in their house. but instead of showing the real story Quentin Tarantino use his fictional mind and trick you by ending with fiction.Overall, the movie is marvellous especially, Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Pacino methodical acting, super hot Brad Pitt and amazing look of 1970. however, the movie will force you to study a glance of Hollywood history to understand the movie completely.",8,2,4,24 December 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Bent the Knee to Almighty Love
","So in the beginning, I thought this is ridiculous mainly Kate Winslet because her acting was a bit unusual or overreacted. but wait for it, it got interesting after the break up when Joel wants to forget Clementine, but in the prosses of erasing her from his brain Joel change his decision and tried to stop the prosses which he could not while half unconscious.I believe, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is about the power of love and how much difficult is it to forget our beloved one, even if want to forget the power of love and attraction will continuously find and compel us to bend the knee to the almighty love.In my opinion, the movie is excellent, especially Jim Carrey's acting, the script, and the way it is manifested through the power of abstract.",7,0,0,1 January 2020

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," LOVE LOVE LOVE without Rules
","This movie is a masterpiece especially if you are into Art. After watching the film you will notice how much we are wasting our precious time and money on watching those Superheroes movies which give us an hour of pleasure and nothing else, The writer shows us the real angle of the life and love plus it forces us to think about how much we will be happy if we try not to label relationships and forget about what is right and wrong in Love and love each other with pure Heart then imagine how much our life will be peaceful and beautiful. Woody Allen tried to explain the things we barely imagine about it and these things are LOVE LOVE LOVE without rules. Now as a filmmaking student, To me everybody did his/her job with 100% passion. from writing to Music, Directing, and Acting everything is perfect. in my head, I was thinking about Javier Bardem as a villain but in this romantic movie he nails it and proved that he can fit in every act. while watching the movie I was thinking to give this movie 10 stars but the only thing which held me was the ending, maybe from my perspective but Anyway I give it 9 stars and everyone should appreciate this kind of work.",9,1,1,26 November 2017
