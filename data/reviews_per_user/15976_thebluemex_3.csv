Hereditary," Horror? Hardly!
","I heard much, good and bad, and had to see it myself. The acting was truly terrific, the depressing mood got me depressed, but...The story line was stupid, utterly dumb. While it certainly captured the tragic loss of a family and the resulting chaos in search for answer, it still made no sense. Horror? Nothing scared me, just weird scenes that made no sense and the heads, what's with the heads? Totally disappointing. Poor 'Pie man'. He should have been hit in the face with one, at least that would have made sense.",2,1,5,12 August 2019
Doctor Strange," More CGI
","Another CGI infected movie. Story is plausible but predictable. Heavy on philosophy which is kinda cool, but a bit overdone. As is typical of films of the Marvel genre, the CGI and special effects dominate the film. Seems to borrow from Dark City, a true trend setter, in many ways. I lost interest midway through the film due to its bad guys vs. good guys overwrought with CGI.",5,0,1,21 March 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Kong Sized Fun
","I was hesitant to see the film, fearing it was another rehash of big gorilla discovered, fights, falls for girl, gets trapped, put on display, escapes, climbs building, fights off militia, falls and it ends. It was pleasurably different than I thought. Without any spoilers, it has a different spin and the big ape is absolutely awe-inspiring. I usually don't go for CGI infested films, but since it's Kong, I expected it and it was necessary for the story and done extremely well. I only have one criticism and that's I wish there was more background to the indigenous people of the island who were mysterious and deserving of further exploration. They looked pretty cool. Highly recommend! Kong is king!",9,1,3,18 April 2017
