50 First Dates," What is true love?
","Most people won't even come close to understand what true love is until they have kids, and then one day when your day has been a collection of efforts and calamity, and you are tired, mentally exhausted, but then you see your kids smile in a huge part thanks to your efforts and then you know that everything you are doing for them is worth it, that's when you realize what true love is.This movie is in my 'great movies that everyone should see' list because it has managed to explain the meaning of true love in a very beautiful way. Forget everything you have seen about love in all the so called 'romantic' movies, true love has nothing to do with that.",10,3,3,21 January 2020
