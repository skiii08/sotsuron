Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Top Billing?
","I came to this movie, as I often do with Tarantino movies, somewhat exasperated with his last movie. The first volume left me in a difficult position. I liked the movie as a whole, but couldn't help but get bogged down in the interminable 'look at this, and this, AND THIS' sequence of bravura set pieces. OK, so he is clever. But the montage of tableaux makes you just want to have a story, a plot, a coherent set of images, anything to follow in a linear fashion. Maybe I am just too linear a guy.
So the second volume was a nice surprise. Less pirouttes and showy 'look Mom I can do this' pieces, more character development and some great character acting. The story moves along at a nice pace, the dialog is wonderfully poignant in places (check out the arrival of Bill at the wedding rehearsal) and the main effort of the director seems to be in the right place, that is to say getting the story from a to b (or b to c I guess since this is part two). I loved the sequences with BB and David Carradine (and he is totally cool by the way). I loved the Mexican pimp. I loved Mother and the wedding chapel. The weaknesses are however glaring. Bill's brother and Daryl Hannah frankly added nothing to plot dynamics.And to put it clearly, this was not enough to warrant a second movie. It must be annoying to realise that you have made a movie and a half. But between the two of them I reckon there is a three hour opus waiting to get out. Long live the director's cut (yeah, never, never ever have I seen a Directors cut that gives a smaller movie).Better than the first, and nearly the best movie of the month.",Null,0,1,21 May 2004
Troy," Big, Wooden and there is a horse too
","This movie does not live up either to the reputation of the director (well, think das Boot) or the frenzy of positive spin I have been seeing on the web in the last few weeks. For the record, I saw this in English in a Swiss cinema, which meant an intermission (very roughly cut too, I almost saw the scissors).The film starts well; some cheeky humor and nods to the Harryhausen school of bad guys (cue 8 foot tall warrior). Brian Cox is pantomime-level bad guy number one. Brad P is lovingly shot in a variety of poses (running about) and we all settle back for a splendid night of entertainment. So far so good.Bring on Helen! Bring on Paris! From here it goes awry. Rather than go through the (hours) of dialog and pick out the best of the cheese, suffice to say that a) there are enough moments when the cringe-o-meter flickers up to 10 to have warranted bursts of incredulous laughter in the cinema b) enough bizarre accents to sound like an acting lesson c) enough sweeping panoramas and beautiful people to make if feel like midweek in Cannes.This movie proves a lot of things, namely -that when he is not confined to a small space, the director seems lost.that Peter O'Toole needs a better hairstylist (Siegfried! Roy!).that Brad Pitt is not able to carry a movie.that Legolas should have stayed in the woods (awful, awful, awful).that quite a few English soap opera and movie actors were happy to have their day in the sun on this movie set.that the time of sword and sandals movies is now passed.In summary, a very disappointing movie, no coherence, no real feeling and just a huge amount of money thrown at a project that could have been a wonderful set of movies.",Null,0,1,13 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Morning after the Night before
","The equation runs like this:-Does Dodgy CGI - Wooden Acting / Stereotypes * Big Message in this case equal Godzilla or does it raise (?) it's game to Independence Day?We, lest people turn away at the mention of the rubber lizard be reassured, this movie does not in any way plunge to the depths of Godzilla. But it doesn't have the feeling of a runaway blockbuster like ID4 either. However lets look at the points compared to ID4 and Godzilla:-1) Random Euro-references; this time (gasp) Scotland gets a minor role! Frozen haggis! And my home country gets a split-second mention on the local radio!2) Painted backdrops; more of the same. Cunning mixture of wildly expensive CGI and hand painted stuff. Looks a bit odd sometimes ('look, the sky doesn't move')3) Cute dog (ID4); This one wins hands down!4) Oh-good-grief acting; Some people have been revising their soap opera acting skills - Hold that pose until I tell you to move again - wait- wait - wait - wait - wait - NOW move on, to the sound of creaking wood.5) CGI helicopters; beats Godzilla hands down. Now they are neither believable or threatening, just plain silly.So that just about covers it from a mechanics point of view. What is pleasant to see (as a Eurobod) is that the flag waving has been toned down and even a little touch of humility has crept into the scenario.
Of course, dealing with Nature not even the USA could claim they invented it. But the overall view of the picture from a 'random guy in the front row with the big box of pop-corn' standpoint is much less cloyingly American. And judging by the other review posted here, it is a state of mind that is sadly not as widespread as the rest of us would like. Let's get this straight. I don't care about who said what or who did what, who invented this or that, I go to the cinema expecting this film to be baseline entertainment, not a political battleground. And I review it as such. 6.5 out of 10 especially for NOT being Godzilla.",Null,0,0,26 May 2004
Where Eagles Dare," The Film Rainy Sundays Were Made For
","I grew up with this movie. It forms part of my basic makeup. I have seen it so often I think I may actually have been in the movie in another life.The most expensive movie of it's time, it makes its mark by squeezing as much derring-do out of the stirring book as possible, bringing in major stars (Eastwood, Burton, bundles of great British actors and actresses) and throwing all of it into a wonderfully ridiculous plot, involving triple-crosses and misinformation for everyone in sight.Some great, great action sequences (the cable car, the bus escape), some wonderfully wooden dialogue down at ye friendly local hostelry 'zum wilden Hirsch', and some great work by the stuntmen(seeing Burton was more than a little overweight by then, I still find it a long stretch to imagine him doing more than staying in the pub).The plot itself is not really important, they just don't make movies like this any more! To believe it, get hold of the disc and watch the original 'making-of'. A more portentous piece of self important nonsense you are not likely to see, but that is what gives this whole thing such charm.Throw in a by now quasi-anthemic soundtrack (whoever has seen this film can never forget the opening sequence as the Junkers come puttering towards the camera) and you have boys' heaven.8 out of 10!",8,2,3,6 June 2004
True Romance," Bring it On!
","I speak as a relatively lukewarm fan of Tarantino, but this is one film that he has had a hand in , that I really think deserves a place in the all-time top 200 films.With hilarious characters :Christian Slater, in possibly his most entertaining, and well acted [rare, I know] role. Clarence is the core that holds the movie together and I enjoyed watching his slide from comic book nerd to full scale gun-wielding hero. Although we are witness to the descent into Hell, it never has a Straw Dogs kind of push-the-nerd-to-the-limit feel. It comes across that he is just living out his comic book fantasies for real.Patricia Arquette, full on drop your popcorn screen bomb, the scene in the phonebox has to be one of the sweetest and sexiest couple of minutes a guy could ever dream of. Ah, sweet Alabama.Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper play what to them must be light entertainment roles. But the heart is in it (unlike many so-called cameos in movies these days) and they bring the whole thing a lovely feeling of an ensemble piece. Not forgetting the rest of the crowd, and some incredibly funny set pieces (witness the cocaine in the car, and the 'who the f**k is Dick?' sequence). This is a movie for a lonely or sad Saturday afternoon. Slap it in the DVD and sit back.The plot follows along at a very snappy pace and the conclusion, complete with the ultimate hommage to shiny guns and cigarettes (Freud, would you please like to comment? :-), leaves us content and satisfied, Heavens it almost has a touch of skewed Disney movie about it. And the catchiest theme to go with it. Great stuff.",Null,1,2,23 May 2004
