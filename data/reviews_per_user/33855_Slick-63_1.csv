Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Now I know why Lucas had to start with episode 4 to sell this
","If George Lucas had started with Episode One, Star Wars would had never been made.  The whole genre would have never got off the ground at all because of the special effects that would have been required to have pulled it off. All in all though this movie was a bore.  Totally predictable and without a lot of suspense.  With any luck Jar Jar Binks will get zapped in the second episode.  Sad is the business of Hollywood that the only way Moguls will help fund movies of this type is with a character like Jar Jar.
Let us all hope the Episode Two will be a lot more lively and truer in the tradition of episodes 4 and 5.",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
