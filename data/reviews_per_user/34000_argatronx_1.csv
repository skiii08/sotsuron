It," a failure
",This is my first ever review and i only felt compelled to add my negative review in the hopes that another one star would help bring down the high rating that this overrated movie has gotten. my complaints are similar to other reviewers here who gave a low rating of the movie. there's no character development. the kids were trying too hard to be funny. bill's interpretation of pennywise was horrible. i am still cringing at that dance number he did before he strangled beverly. i just want to punch his bunny teeth in every time he shows up on the screen. this is so sad for me as i love the book very much and i remember watching the original mini series and being really scared for days esp that sink scene with beverly.,1,0,3,12 May 2019
