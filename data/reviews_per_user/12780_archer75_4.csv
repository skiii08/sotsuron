The Longest Yard," Not as good as the original, but yards better than Vinnie Jones's effort
","As always the good guys wear white wear the bad guts wear black. or do they? Once again, viewers are asked to decide whether law and order are naturally the good guys, or whether it is okay to cheer for the bad guys, especially if the good guys are the bad guys, representing the good guys who are really the bad guys. Confused? You shouldn't be.Adam Sandler makes a decent job as portraying the all-American superstar gone wrong in this remake of the Burt Reynolds '70s movie. Sandler, like Reynolds rarely stretches his acting and it felt like a vision of what Sandler's life would be like if he had not made a living making movies.The difference between the two films, for me, however, seemed that the original attempted to educate people about the complexities of American Football. The remake assumed a knowledge about rules and scoring systems, yet at the same time decided that keeping the scoring system simple made for an understanding. The original had missed kicks etc. This one keeps the more technical aspects such as the drop goal and the safety kept back in the locker room.The sports clips are well made and the convicts feel more realistic. The original tough guys lacked a certain menace, whereas people liked Dulip Singh bring an all too real physical presence. In addition, the guards are more physical and commanding.On the negative side, Cloris Leachman should have not stooped so low for a paycheck. She's better than that. Why Rob Schneider suddenly appears is also a mystery? I guess he replaces Chris Rock as the comedy provider.In the original, Paul Crewe spends time in the swamps before caving in, whereas this time, it is time in the hole. In the swamp, you really felt the punishment, whereas the film failed to portray the hardships of the hole and the desert in which he was detained.I am always critical of remakes. Why? because they often fail to produce anything new and often detract from the vision or the impact of the original. Fortunatly, this is a remake worth making, if not to put the abysmal Vinnie Jones' Mean Machine into the relegation zone.",7,0,2,19 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," They should have buried this in the Dead Man's Chest
","I watched POTC, prepared for the worst and really enjoyed it. It was a great shame when the film ended.First chance I got, went to see POTC2, full of optimism and was left painfully disappointed.Everyone, from the director down to the person who carries the props, seems to have believed that if they put Johnny, Kiera and Orlando in the same film, give them the same character names and tell them its about pirates, then a wonderful film would surface.It didn't.The humour, such as it was, was scant. Depp seemed to be trying too hard to be funny and he had lost some of the 'campness' which made Captain Jack Sparrow a classic character.Knightly seemed unsure as to her role. Is she there as a role model, a foil to the humour, a heroine or a combo of all. Whichever stool she thought she would sit on, she fell slap back in the middle.I'm afraid, and I know many people will disagree, but I have yet to see Orlando act! To me, he is eye candy for the girls.In much the same way that Empire strikes back / Two Towers were sequels that set the scene for the final episode, the second installment gives the impression that the baddies have the upper hand. As we know from Return of the Jedi / The King, the good guys will, eventually, come through.Hopefully, by the the time POTC3 is finished, Captain Sparrow will be clear as to what he is, good or bad.A real waste of time and money. Brace yourself before going in",4,1,3,14 August 2006
Saw III," Will this be a trilogy in 4 parts?
","The third and final (?) installment of the Saw movies lead me again through a roller-coaster of plots, subplots and red herrings. My assumptions, based upon Saw II, were proved wrong in a matter of moments and I found myself itching, and occasionally squirming, in my seat. This was partly due to the length of the film, but mainly due to the visual and audio battering my senses took during some of the painfully and stomach churning 'games'.Indeed, in the cinema, 2 couples left, never to return and several more left and returned looking worse for wear.I wanted more, but also wanted less. I wanted more torture, more blood and guts and more dialogue.I wanted less stop / start photography and X-file style movement. This is my only gripe. Without this cinematic style, it might have been nice to see just how big the warren of rooms and traps ran.The ending surprised me. After three films, you would think that I would know better! However, Jigsaw's final piece might be a clever 4th episode from beyond the grave. The magic now of these films is that so many recipients of his style of crime and punishment could be locked away in the belly of the city that the floodgates could be wide open for an ever expanding franchise of films.I hope so. Jigsaw has left me annoyed, frustrated, impressed and ever so slightly nauseous.I like it, I want more. I want to play, a final, final game!",8,0,1,30 October 2006
Casino," The scene where Nick and Frankie die still shocks me
","I like casino, even though I am not a great fan of any of its principal players (De Niro, Pesci or Stone). The film is good in places, drawn out in others and sometimes just takes my breath away.However, my lasting memory is the killing of Nick and Frankie by the mob, to the tune of The Animals' House of the rising sun still stuns and shocks me. Even though you see it coming, the end result is graphic, simple and well acted, even to the point where the hoods get exhausted from the beatings they administer.I sit there, watching this scene and I wonder what, apart from the baseball bats, would be going through their minds, especially Nick knowing that his brother is going to be killed and he will soon join him. I hope I never find out!",8,1,2,14 November 2006
