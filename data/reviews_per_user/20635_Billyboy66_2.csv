Love and Death," One of the funniest films of all time
","Yes this is one of my all time favorite comedies i have never seen a funnier film with so much jokes, its so fast paced and blended performances by diane keaton and woody allenjust a superbly joy of a movieWoody Allen at his peak as a comedianHe owe some of the jokes to Bob Hope but what the h*** i just like the references to war and peace and Ingmar Bergmanthe herring joke,the village idiot, the advanced monologue about subjectivity is objectivity yes countless of jokesjust a fantastic funny movie and very well made too",10,2,2,2 May 2007
300," a totally awful movie
","Well, it just got to be one of the worst movies of all time a bad mix of gladiator, lord of the rings and probably the historyThermophyle actually happened in real life so why make this totally fictive version of it, even if frank miller had make a comic paper of it, what might the next movie have for a plot? ww2 in lord of the ring styleyes this might be funny if you are between 11-17 year and have absolutely not a clue about real historyand the Persians are almost all black people, well it just had to be political correct, and not historicaland in the end they just got to have the death scene in a wheat field (thats really 'original', and nobody who has seen gladiator could recognize it) well this movie doesn't deserve a turkey but an albatross award",1,24,74,27 March 2007
