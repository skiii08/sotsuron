Mission: Impossible III," M:I is Classic Again
","When Mission: Impossible was released I was a fan straight off, and in my opinion, the sequel, M:I 2 topped the first and was an excellent movie. But the Third, three words 'Oh My God' it is amazing, beats the other two by far, a brilliant piece of work by J.J. Abrhams and Tom Cruise, Happy they brought back Ving Rhames (Top Actor)as Luther, but Cruise is excellent once again, in my opinion Cruise never puts up a bad performance in any of his films and he doesn't disappoint either in M:I 3. Ask me last month what my favourite Tom Cruise movie would be and I'd say War Of The Worlds (Brilliant) but now Mission: Impossible 3 is the best piece of work he's done and I hope for a fourth M:I in the future. If you haven't seen this film, take time out of your day to see it, it's worth it and you won't be disappointed.. I guarantee it.",10,0,1,5 May 2006
Silent Hill," Finally A Great Game-based Film.
","Finally, a good movie based on a video game. These Directors who take videogames and turn them into movies were getting nowhere, Resident Evil and it's sequel Apocalypse was a let down, Resident Evil 4 the video game is much better.. But finally a great video game has been remade into a great movie, Silent Hill is an amazing movie, a great cast, a great story. They kept on the same lines as the video game story, the odd one or two things were changed but who cares, nothing can be perfect. But finally nearly half the horror movies released in the past 4 or 5 years have been poor, it's not like it used to be but Silent Hill changes the face of horror completely, which is in a good way. If you haven't had the chance to watch this movie then watch it, if you're a fan of the horror genre or Silent Hill then watch this movie, it is the first great video game turned movie.All I can hope for now is a sequel, bring it on..",9,3,6,6 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-3 Good But A Disappointment
","I am a huge X-Men fan from the Comics. The first X-Men Movie was a very impressive attempt at turning it to a Film and was a great Movie as was the sequel 'X2'. But when I was reading things on the Internet and Magazines etc. The hype was building for 'Last Stand' to be the best in the series, when Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast, played brilliant by Kelsey Grammar) was confirmed and when Warren Worthington III (Angel, once again played superb by Ben Foster) was confirmed then you'd expect this to be a great installment in the X-Men series, but I got the chance to seeing it yesterday and if you all want my honest opinion, it's the worst in the series. I was disappointed when I discovered Gambit wasn't going to be apart of it, and although Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman (Magneto, Storm and Wolverine) played the roles once again of the X-Men characters so perfect, and were brilliant at doing the job. The action in the Movie was brilliant as were the Effects, but there was Disappointments, I have to agree with past comments posted there were casulties which were shocking, and once again I agree with some past comments posted, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and Angel's roles were not used well enough, but in my opinion, I'm English myself and Vinnie Jones in his day was a great Soccer/Football player and has shown he's a brilliant Actor but I think he shouldn't have took on the role as Juggernaut they should've used someone that's big by nature (i.e. WWE's Paul Wight 'Big Show) but nevermind Vinnie Jones did well for the part, but once again a Disappointment in many ways and a Good film in others.",8,4,8,26 May 2006
Casino Royale," Casino Royale.. 007 Great Again
","I got around to seeing the latest 007 movie last weekend, honestly before I was to see it for myself I didn't know what to expect. Truth be told I didn't expect it to be much good, but was I wrong.. too wrong. What a movie, this has got it all and Daniel Craig is brilliant he captures the Bond persona perfect. Another good performance by Dame Judi Dench (as M) and Craig's unforgettable start as the new 007 was excellent. I'm not going to lie I've seen many of the Bond films and this is one of the best maybe the best. Don't mean to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet but the scene that got me laughing was the one which involved the lines 'Sorry.. but that last hand nearly killed me.' if you've seen it you'll know what scene I'm talking about. Cannot wait for the next 007 film to be released in 2008 which is Bond 22 (working title, most likely to be named 'Rosicio') bring on the next 007.. if Casino Royale is this good then the next should be awesome.",10,1,3,20 November 2006
