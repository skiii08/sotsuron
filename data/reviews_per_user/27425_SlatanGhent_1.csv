Scarface," What a movie
",Probably the best gangsta movie ever made ( all though that's hard to say with Godfather / Goodfellas movies been made ) It takes you back to the age where Cubans came fresh from the boat to America to live the American dream and to do so they had to use everything they learned in there home country.In my opinion the best Al Pacino movie out there he is so young and what a performance he gave.Michelle Pfeiffer as the lady in red being hooked on stardust.Violence Drugs Sex and so on This is a must watch to anyone who loves gangsta movies in general.If you didn't see this movie you have missed something in your life and you should watch it now ;-),9,2,4,20 July 2016
