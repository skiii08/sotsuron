Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Fury in the Shaolin Temple (1979) inspiration for KILL BILL
","Now I'm not gonna say this film is bad or good (Thats partly what the films about) and i can see that every other dunder head has tried to review it (2000+ and counting) and no ones probably ever gonna read this cus it's gonna get lost in the main stream.But, I don't know if any of you have seen the pretty obscure 'Fury in the Shaolin Temple (1979)', probably not; I'm pretty sure its the inspiration for the Kill Bill films.Its got a bloke who looks stunningly similar to the long of eyebrow master in Kill Bill2. It's got chopstick training. And the whole film is about the student/master relationship.Now this is driving me a little crazy cus I might be the only person in the world to know this (thats a hell of a responsibility).Watch 'Fury in the Shaolin Temple (1979)', pass this on, prove me wrong.Ha and i didn't even mention Master/slave morality and all that trap",Null,0,1,28 October 2004

","Yes like everyone else i have seen this film, And yes like everyone else it is good. But I'm pretty fed up with everyone having the True reason behind its making. And id be a Fool to say what i thought but...the point of this film is to say there are no Truths.The history of man is suffused with the patriarchal archtype, the leader, the tool maker, the truth sayer. It is those people who claim to see the truth, and so are able to control the future, who are blind to reality. Frank is another word for Truth, Dur.So to say it has no meaning and is open to interpretation is neither true nor false, because the whole premise of the film was to deny a structural analysis of life. Fear----------LoveFalse---------TruthWoman-----------Man And further more, this film, I think, shows the future of women in films no longer a structural opposite, a dialectic daisy, a mindless muse.
