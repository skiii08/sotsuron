The Blair Witch Project," Over-rated Schlock
","When this movie came out I listened to the hype for quite a while. I've loved horror movies most of my life though I gave up on them when they sank into special-effects gore-fests and expressions of very personal paranoia in the 1980s. I finally gave this film a try when it came to a second run house in my city that charged 99 cents per ticket. One can see anything for 99 cents. When I left, the manager asked what I'd thought of the movie. He knew that I was a regular and that I liked films generally. I told him I thought he owed me at least 98 cents.In summary, a group of young people with video equipment wander out into the woods on the Maryland/West Virginia border. To characterize their combined I.Q.'s as 'super 8' would be too generous. The area in which they get lost in the woods is rural but not the Amazonian rain forest or the wastes of Siberia. Walking for less than an hour in any direction would bring them to a road, a task that is far from impossible to accomplish. Still they get lost. Once they are lost they descend into fear and get, as if such a thing were possible, even stupider. In the end the alleged Blair Witch does us all the great service of removing these self-indulgent idiots from the gene pool. The really bad news is that the witch takes about 90 minutes to accomplish that removal. She's just too darned slow.This movie does not have the utterly misguided and endearing incompetence that make Ed Wood's films like Plan 9 From Outer Space a guilty pleasure. It's not even worth renting for the pleasure of throwing popcorn at the screen.",1,2,4,17 January 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Wanted to Buy: Competent Writers
","The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has always been fluff. After all, what can one expect from movies derived from an amusement park ride? Given that genesis the first two movies were a rather entertaining ride. The over-long sequence of Jack in the bleached out desert from which he must be rescued in the third film served as an extended metaphor for the life that was visibly draining out of the series. Now we are into a 'walking dead' continuation of Capt. Jack Sparrow's biography as it moves from bang to whimper to bleached skeleton.As a filmed amusement park ride the basic premise of the Pirates films is stringing together fights and chases like (black) pearls on a slim filament of plot. Unfortunately for On Stranger Tides the filament is absent. What we get is a disjunct pile of, to be kind, faux pearls. Each action sequence is brief fun but they all seem to be rolling around independently. First Mate Gibbs is back but only as a creaky plot device. The same is true of the male half of what becomes the couple in love sub-uh-plot that vestigially fills the gap left by the absence of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.Rob Marshall's direction isn't much to write home about but it sometimes serves which is far, far more than I can say for the script, that missing filament. It starts out promisingly enough with picking up the teaser from the end of At World's End about the Fountain of Youth and even manages to end on the same theme for the most part. In between though we have hackneyed cliché after hackneyed cliché and nothing near as imaginative as the 'fruit kebab' or water wheel sequences of past films. In the course of this attempt to construct a coherent movie the writers senselessly rip off past literature and movies from The Odyssey to Hans Christian Andersen to Moby Dick and even Splash. I searched in vain for a writer involved in the script who had a single original idea. In fact, even the the 3-D seems tacked on and the Spaniards who open the movie seem like an accidental afterthought.Take, for example, poor Ian McShane's Blackbeard. He appears to have some magical control over his ship through the cutlass he carries at his side. We don't get any explanation even in exposition for this power. Does this power belong to Blackbeard? To the sword? Is it imparted by the ship to is captain? We never know. There's a reference to Blackbeard having been beheaded at some point in the past. It's there in the movie but it's one more loose...ah...pearl rolling around the pitching deck without a filament to make anything coherent of it. And Ian McShane is no Bill Nighy. There's as little energy in his Blackbeard as there is in the script itself.Though the direction is pedestrian - deadly for an amusement park ride - and the script an incoherent mess that doesn't stop the actors from trying to inject some life. Johnny Depp minces around and tries mightily to extract some wit from the not-quite dialogue with which the alleged writers have afflicted him. Geoffrey Rush is a wonderful, delightful, talented actor despite the fact that he's been shamelessly ripping off Robert Newton from the first film in this series onward. Had there been some real point to his presence in this movie I'm sure that he could have delivered the kind of performance that made us so glad he'd returned in for At World's End. Penelope Cruz, besides being beautiful, is also a wonderful actress, just watch her in her films with Pedro Almodovar to confirm my opinion. In this movie she's mostly window dressing and the main attempt to replace Keira Knightley. Ian McShane is the actor for whom I feel both the most and least sympathy. He does what he can with the script pages he's given but I couldn't help wishing that he too had more of a chance to break out of the prison to which the lack of a script condemned him. Then I think that he could have made more of an effort. Perhaps it's McShane's fault but I think he could have done much better.On Stranger Tides is worth the price of a matinée on a rainy afternoon. Johnny Depp is fun. Geoffrey Rush is fun too though less so. Penelope Cruz is beautiful and delivers the line which will undoubtedly become the quest and McGuffin for the inevitable fifth film. Still, unless Disney can find a good writer(s) for the next script and an imaginative director, I'll wait for Pirates of the Caribbean: To No Real Purpose to show up on cable before I watch it.",3,3,7,23 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter and the Deadly Pacing
","I suppose it was inevitable. As J. K. Rowling became a phenomenon her books got less and less editing though they needed it more and more. With the cynical, money-grubbing decision to make two films out of the last book a similar thing has happened. The triangular friendship and love of Ron, Hermione and Harry provides the personal, human tension of the over-all story but we all know that it can't be resolved until the last chapter/reel. The consequence is this movie bloated with empty calories to deprive us of the price of a ticket bought more to say we've seen the whole epic rather than because we've been truly entertained. We get a few loose ends tied up and a brilliant animated sequence telling the back story of the Deathly Hallows. Unfortunately more of the movie than any narrative line can stand consists of the three young people wandering the English countryside to no particular purpose except to pad out the space between opening and closing credits. At best the film is an over-long trailer for the final installment. Poor Harry and his friends haven't been this badly served since the series wisely, thankfully jettisoned director Chris Columbus and his attempts to drag the series down into the hell of Home Alone with witches. The best I can say of this film is that someday, in order to sell more copies of the series, someone may re-cut the films and combine Deathly Hallows Parts I & II into something like a watchable film. I have no confidence in that, however. The fashion is to add scenes that were left on the cutting room floor and, usually, should have made it to the cutting room incinerator. I am a father of the children of the Harry Potter generation and thus once removed from Potter-mania. Still I also have a deep affection for Daniel Radcliffe's and his Harry, Emma Watson and her Hermione and Rupert Grint and his Ron. I have watched them grow as I watched my daughters grow. Thus it's partly out of fatherly affection that I dislike this installment as a great disservice to three young actors who have worked hard and deserved better.",Null,1,1,15 July 2011
The Illusionist," Light touch and great performances
","The Illusionist is set in the Vienna (not Venice) of the turn of the last century and draws on the Mayerling Affair as one of the threads of inspiration for the story on which it is based. Writer-director Neil Burger shows a superbly light touch in creating the period and telling the story. Edward Norton continues to demonstrate a talent normally associated with only a few exceptionally great actors on the order of Olivier and Orson Welles. Paul Giamatti is excellent as is the entire cast. What is most striking is the evocation of the period in the cinematography. Dick Pope's camera-work gets into the rarified realm of James Wong Howe and Sven Nyquist.This is an exceptional movie that shows a superb writer-director, with a perfect cast and crew making a movie well worth the price of admission and the 2 hours in the theatre.",8,1,1,9 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Could be better
","First, let me point out what's good about the movie.BB-8 is a clever re-imagining of the R2D2 we have long known and loved.I think that Daisy Ridley will be a fine Luke Skywalker.John Boyega gives a good performance. He plays a soldier out of his element and unsure of everything that's happening to him well.Lupita Nyong'o's Maz Kanata is the a great addition to the pantheon of memorable Star Wars characters. I hope that we see more of her.I was very glad to see Max von Sydow in the opening sequence. The special effects are expertly executed and J. J. Abrams keeps the action rolling.If you're getting the idea that this review is going to damn the movie with faint praise, you're correct.I was very hopeful when I heard that Lawrence Kasdan, who was responsible for the best script in the first three movies, The Empire Strikes Back, was going to be one script writer. The biggest problem for The Force Awakens is that the script is thin on ideas and character, long on action and the worse for it. For example, Han and Leia are now an old married couple. They are separated but still love one another. In the first three movies they expressed their love through a fusillade of shouted insults. In this script the fires that made their romance so delightful aren't just banked, they are thoroughly doused.In the original three movies the Millennium Falcon was as much of a character as C3P-0 and R2D2. It was the bucket of bolts under constant repair. Han and Chewbacca did their best to keep from damaging it. In this movie the Millennium Falcon bounces off snowfields, wrecked spaceships, and miscellaneous other obstacles without any deleterious effects. The Falcon has suddenly become Supership, stronger than steel, faster than a speeding boson and it loses in the process. And, yes, there are two repair scenes but none after any of the scenes in which the ship should reasonably be damaged.What we have is essentially a rehash of the original Star Wars script from 1977. There are a few variations and permutations but essentially, it's the same story. Supreme Leader Snoke fills in both for the Emperor and serves as the Dark Side's anti-Yoda.For reasons that no one has explained the weak reestablished Republic is still an underdog fighting an inexplicably resilient empire. In real life we have our own difficulties keeping down resurgent fascism but it is a discredited, fragmented and derided force seventy years after World War II, not a force with vast clone armies and star destroyers patrolling the skies.Does anyone in Hollywood have enough imagination to come up with some motive other than teen angst and rebellion against one's parents as a motive for a child turning to evil? At least Adam Driver has some acting talent unlike the execrable Hayden Christiansen but there are much more interesting possibilities to explore than Ben Solo's current motivations for becoming Kylo Ren. Thin script and little imagination again.We always knew that there had to be someone who'd trained Palpatine to become a Sith lord and emperor. Snoke comes out of nowhere. Why? Isn't there enough evil in the hearts of men already to feed a near infinite number of dark sides? I understand that we've embarked on a saga that will see the redemption and probable destruction(when you have the script from Return of the Jedi already why write a new one?)of Ben Solo but wouldn't it be more interesting if we got a different story this time around? We expected to see R2D2 again but the script also fails us when R2D2 awakens. Why? If Luke Skywalker as a King Arthur figure sleeping on the Isle of Avalon until his people are in the direst need, that's fine, but put it in the script, please? Cutting one or two explosions to for some snappily written exposition might help.I would love to hear Neil deGrasse Tyson explain the physics of a planet sized Death Star that either had to move through space (with what motors?) or risk running out of nearby suns to consume. Just because one can imagine a thing doesn't make it plausible and that goes double when the thing you imagine has to conform to basic physics.And what's with Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron? Isaac is a perfectly adequate actor but his character in this film comes off as the proverbial teats on a bull. He shows up early on, disappears for great swaths of the film and then reappears to no great effect or consequence in the last third. Huh? My current feeling is that J. J. Abrams is the unseen Jar-Jar Binks of this new series: the embarrassment that we all will wish would just go away. He knows how to handle action and CGI but can't properly direct actors. Without believable connections between the characters the series is going to fall flat.So, if the new Star Wars saga is to become that wonderful continuation of a story we all love it needs a director who has some real interest in getting performances out of actors and a coherent and interesting script. Those things The Force Awakens does not have. I wish it did. I would hate to see the Star Wars franchise peter out because we never get to love Rey, Finn, Poe and even Kylo the way we did Luke, Leia, Han and Darth because there needs to be another crash or explosion.",5,12,16,2 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter and the Deathly Pacing II
","So now we reach the end of Harry Potter and the Tortuously Extended Franchise with the final installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Pacing. Who is at fault? Certainly not the actors young and old who give very serviceable performances despite, in most cases, being given next to nothing to do. Director David Yates can manage some serviceable pacing when he needs to. I rather think that the fault lies less with an unimaginative director than with the author and producers of whom Rowling was one. Ultimately I attribute this film's failings, as I did in Part I, to greed. Deathly Hallows, Parts I & II might make a very good 2 and a half to 3 hour movie. Instead they combine to form a deadly dull 4 hour and 36 minute snoozer. Take just 1 scene as an example. Harry, on his way to confront Voldemort, uses the Resurrection Stone, one of the Deathly Hallows that he obtained in the preceding film. The ensuing scene is utterly superfluous. It does nothing but slow the action. At a moment when we need desperately to get on to the confrontation we are stuck with a convocation that does not include all the people who have been closest to Harry and spends minutes that pass like hours in soulful looks and some babble that we and Harry all knew already. It is a waste of celluloid or disc space or whatever medium is appropriate at the moment. Even Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are given precious little to do in this film but I'm not sure that is a fault as much as I enjoy their acting. This film is, after all the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, the moment toward which we've built over the 7 previous films. It's more than time to focus on Harry and Voldemort to the exclusion of most of the rest of the cast. Still, that's not what we get. We get much tying up of loose ends with interjected back stories that only contribute to the deathly pacing. We learn things that we should have learned in Half-Blood Prince and several other movies. Though those interjections may have been part of the 7th book they simply interfere with action of this film. We also get boxcar loads of exposition to explain plot twists for which no one ever laid the prior groundwork. The movie is a mess that completes the story but becomes a disservice to to the actors and fans. At one point late in the film Maggie Smith's Prof. McGonagall casts a weary, quizzical look in medium close up that seems more to say, 'What am I doing here if not for the paycheck and how fast can I get back to the set of Downton Abbey where I actually can display my talent and craft.' I feel for her. I do blame the directors to some extent but the producers and J. K. Rowling even more. From the start of the series the money people made great casting decisions and then put their wonderful actors in the hands of hacks like Chris Columbus and David Yates while giving fine directors like Alfonso Cuaron the boot after a single episode. Perhaps, one day once J. K. Rowling passes on to some other worldly Enchanted Forest, someone really competent who loves the stories will hire an elderly Daniel Radcliffe to play Albus Dumbledore in a really good remake of the series. I surely hope Harry Potter gets better treatment one day. He deserves it though he didn't get it here.",Null,2,2,30 July 2011
