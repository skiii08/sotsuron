Your Name.," A magnificent and emotional work of art
","THREE REASONS THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FILM: 1. QUALITY OF ANIMATION/CINEMATOGRAPHY
2. EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND PLOT TWISTS
3. ATTENTION TO DETAIL1. QUALITY OF ANIMATION/CINEMATOGRAPHY - I cannot remember the last time I gasped at how beautiful the background art was in a film. Some scenes are downright amazing to look at and left me with the feeling of awe.2. EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND PLOT TWISTS - Starts off at a funny romantic comedy then unexpected plot twists move the film and audience into such deep emotions at the same level as 'The pursuit of Happiness' or 'Lion' Themes of deep, painful longing, abandonment, hope and love. I was moved to tears. 3. ATTENTION TO DETAIL - I am astounded at how every little detail all ties together in the end. The plot was so complex and yet, when I watched it a second time, I saw so many clues and signs that hinted at the dramatic changes. Incredible attention to detail. If there's any fault to the movie, it is a lack of story with Taki's character who probably deserved a little more screen time on his history. I thought the ending also took too long to resolve. I don't want to spoil it so I'll just leave it at that. Such amazing and moving story telling. One of my favorite films of all time.",10,1,4,29 August 2018
