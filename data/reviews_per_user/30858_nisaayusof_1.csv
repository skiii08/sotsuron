The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Can't wait for Part Two
","It was a very best movie to watch. I don't understand why are there peoples criticize this movie. They just act perfectly. And I can even imagine the scene when I read the quotes from this movie. Yeah, every movie will have goofs, but as long as it not that clear, i think that's good enough. Well, I maybe a bit biased because I'm just a girl who in love with Edward Cullen, please forgive me. / / And I just can't wait for the sequence. Hopefullly it will gives me impact just like the Part 1 did or even more.And anyway,Taylor Lautner is not that handsome, I wonder why friends are crazy over him. Or maybe, i'm the one who is blind after all?",Null,2,9,29 November 2011
