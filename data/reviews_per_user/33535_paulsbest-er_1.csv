Iron Man 3," Why need Iron man when you have Plastic man!?
","The movie is an entertaining movie with Robert Downey Jr, lots of action and some funny scenes, but overall it is a major disappointment! This is mainly because of two reasons – Weak, useless suits and useless stupid people that got some kind of superpower because they were injected with some virus, vaccination or something.The stupid mutated people with super strength, regenerating bodies and bodies that can reach 3000 degrees completely owns iron man suits(from here on plastic man suits). In the final scenes the main villain with this vaccination superpower destroys countless plastic suits and ultimately plastic man is left with nothing – he is even without his plastic! If I remember correctly plastic man fought on par with Thor (A demi god), Thor fought on par with the hulk and hulk owned Loki (Another demigod), thus these super humans is stronger than any demi gods, the hulk and thus far stronger than the avengers.So my conclusion is, we do not need the avengers if there is an alien invasion, in fact we do not need any help what so ever, all we have to do is make a few of these super humans and they will own any aliens trying to invade our world!Thus rather not waste your money on this movie; it completely destroys the iron man concept and image as a superhero! His new image is PLASTIC man according to this movie!",3,28,56,2 May 2013
