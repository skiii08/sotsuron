Scarface," What?!?
","Maybe a classic, but it's nonsensical. Acting is horrible, the dialogue is dumb and nearly incomprehensible if it wasn't for subtitles. I respect this film for its legacy, but unless you have almost 3 hours to waste to see the iconic end scene don't bother.",2,4,10,16 July 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Fine
","My wife and I saw the film and be both have the same review. Movie was fine, it was just a movie, it was not bad, it was entertaining for sure but definitely not great. With that being said this film was for sure the worst Marvel film but only because MCU films are typically great or incredibly great and this movie was neither so by default it was the worst one. Best we can come up with is that Captain Marvel was like an episode of Agents of Shield with slightly better CGI.",1,51,88,14 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Absolute Perfection
","This movie an unapologetic perfection of a movie for Marvel fans. For those who have paid attention and appreciate the pure joy Marvel Studios has brought to cinemas for the past 10 years you will not be disappointed. There is twists, turns, unexpected moments, visually stunning action sequences and packed full of edge of your seat emotions. All characters get their moments to shine which in its self was incredible but the story that was told really knocked it out of the park. Can't wait for 2019.",10,2,4,29 April 2018
