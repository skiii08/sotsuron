National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Excelled my expectations
","Words can't describe how much I loved National Treasure when I first saw it. It's so historically inaccurate but so much fun to watch. When I found out a second one was being made, happiness over came me. After seeing the trailer for the second movie the first time I had such high expectations for this movie. It met and excelled everyone one of them.There are a lot of plot holes but it's an all around good time. Nicholas Cage is not my favorite actor but I have such respect and love for this man after seeing him. My favorite line from him has to be 'Conner rocks!' And don't even get me started on the love I feel for Justin Bartha. He's just so funny and has great comedic timing. 'Save the Queen.' I recommend this movie to everyone because it really does have something for everyone. I'm already looking forward to National Treasure: Page 47.",10,2,9,23 December 2007
The Other Boleyn Girl," Give Natalie Portman an Oscar
","Never have I seen an actress take control of a movie as much as Portman did with Boleyn. She stepped into the role so perfectly and did it was so much confidence. I could feel her pain and ambition. I started shaking during her downward spiral and couldn't stop. It was so intense and heart pounding.Jim Sturgess also made a huge impression. His part was small but his performance was big. I wished there had been more of the brother.The costumes also should win something, anything. They were amazing and really stood out.All in all it was a a pretty good movie. It really grabbed you and kept you in their world for two hours. I would recommend this to anyone who's old enough because there is a lot of adult material.8 out of 10 stars",8,112,196,1 March 2008
21," Best movie of 2008 so far
","I went to this movie with high hopes and this movie met every one of them. It was full of suspense, humor, and an all around good time. I've come to love Jim Sturgess in everything he does and this movie was no exception. For being a really good looking guy, he played the nerd character quit well. His American accent was flawless and his chemistry with both Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey was perfect.I was never a fan of Spacey. I'm still not but he did a really good job in this movie. I actually enjoyed watching him play with his students emotions and use them for his benefit. I'm gonna tell everyone to go see this movie. It's so much fun to watch and it's one of those movies that get you thinking. The math behind all his moves is genius. It was so great I had no idea what was going on. So yes, everyone should see this movie. Go Now!",10,7,19,29 March 2008
