Saturday Night Fever," Night Fever
","I believe that this was the first movie that I saw in the theatre when I four-years-old. (My second movie was Star Wars-also in 1978-then the Muppet Movie, and then I am sure the next was Popeye).  The baby sitter took me to Saturday Night Fever, and I remember my legs fell asleep sitting in the seat for so long.  I viewed the movie again tonight, and this time nothing fell asleep.Despite the fact that the lead actress was completely the wrong chick for this film, and although the movies ending was sort of lackadaisical; nevertheless, the acting was all pretty honest, nothing was forced, and the film flowed very, very well.  Coupled with the fact that the soundtrack is superb & the dancing was top-notch it tells us a lot about how we took a relatively cool style of music and mistreated it with coked-up lifestyles and loud polyester.  Sure, it might look cool en-retro; however, asked someone who lived the discotheque life and they will grin and bow their heads in shame.This is really a fun movie that actually contains substance.I think Saturday Night Fever deserves a lot better rating than most IMDB users give it.  As for me, I am going to break out my platform shoes and give it a solid 8/10.",8,0,1,28 July 2003
Mississippi Burning," House Burning Down
","What keeps this movie from being a '9' in my book?  Well, it is not the story.  It is not the acting or the cast.  It is too many houses burning down, when all we needed to see was a couple: a couple of houses burning, maybe one or two acts of viloence--we would have gotten the picture, and maybe the movie could have been trimmed down to about an hour and forty-five minutes. Believe me, I love a good move that can just take you in and you don't care how long it is.  It is just too bad that this one keeps its length in repetition, and not solid content.  Please don't get me wrong, however, the movie is rather brilliant, and Gene Hackman is perfect as always; therefore, I will give it a solid 8.2",8,0,0,25 August 2002
We Were Soldiers," Not Black Hawk Down (thank God)
","The opposite of Black Hawk Down, it was nice to see a post-World War II movie that did not condone our actions there.  I am convinced that the American experience in Vietnam was not one that all of the soldiers who fought there shared, but more of a highly personal experience: that is, more than any other war in our history, each man viewed it radically different from the next, but they seem to always agree on the major points.  We Were Soldiers agrees on the major points, and shows another side of the war that we are not use to seeing in the movies.  All points are valid; but a few are just different. I am so glad this movie did not try to delude us into thinking that patriotism is watching your friends die for nothing.  I give it an 8.75",8,0,1,25 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," In a Galaxy Far, Far Today...
","Now that I have seen Attack Of The Clones twice, I have decided to give my spin on the movie, and the whole Star Wars phenomenon, for that matter.  I think I have read every IMDB review of Attack Of The Clones, and while I appreciate conflicting opinions, and multifarious theories on the movie; nevertheless, I believe that perhaps, we as a whole (the long time fans), have been missing some various points concerning our movie watching habits and the perceptions of our youth that drew us to the movies in the first place.I have tried so much to not pick apart Episode II: Attack Of The Clones, and I have good reason for not doing so.  When I first watched Star Wars-A New Hope in 1978 (I was too young in '77) I saw it as most little kids did:  full of wonder, through the eyes of a child, and Lucas made me believe that it was real, or almost a real happening, `a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.'  It was not selective perception in 1978, 1980, and 1983, that made me love the movies so much; nonetheless, all of us grew up, and became adults, and now we see through filtered lenses, and no longer through the original eyes in which we first witnessed out beloved Star Wars movies.  We never questioned, for a second, `is this what George Lucas wants us to see,' or, ` is this Academy Award material?'  We simply watched and believed, as if somebody had opened up a window through the past, and let us all witness a beautiful story.  The person who opened the window and let us look in-to believe-was George LucasÂ…and he has not treated our eyes and imaginations any differently in 1999, or 2002.I am really beginning to believe that it is us, the fans and moviegoers, that have changed and not Lucas.  Therefore, why pick apart these films and spoil them for ourselves-totally unlike we did when the movies first came out?  Lucas has always had a very simple story to tell us, something fantastical and innocent, and we have turned around and made it into something it is not.  After all, it is George Lucas's story and not ours.  It is his baby; and do we tell the parent of the child, `why is your baby's eyes blue,' or `how come you didn't name it such-and-such, or this-or-that?'  Do we ask God, or the universe, why are there mosquitoes, and why is water wet?  No, most of us just accept these things for the way they are and move on.  And, if we do ask these redundant questions enough times, and always hear no answer in reply, then we can drive ourselves crazy and miss out on the simplistic miracle of life.Every time Lucas put out another Star Wars movie, he is opening the same window he has always opened, as he did with every movie; it is just a different time and place that we are watching.  Very simple.  Take them all as the `truth' of the Star Wars universe, through the magical portal of movie making, and try to believe as you did as a child.Too fast, too slow, not enough action, CGI flubs, blue-screen disasters, corny dialog, poor acting-nothing has changed since day one, and it will never change:  Remember, these are not 21st century humans we are suppose to be watching on screen, but beings from a different time and place.  Evidently, they interact, and speak a bit differently from the way we do (judging from all the Star Wars movies, past and present), yet they have enough `earthling' characteristics that allow us to relate to them. Completely unlike our time and space.  I, as well, would have liked to have seen a planet Wookies, and not Ewoks, but that is not the story that was told.  That is not what happened.Attack Of The Clones is the movie to watch at this present moment (old fans and recent converts alike).  We are blessed to be a part of history. Not movie making history, nor a deep lesson to be learned, but the history of ourselves, and can we really be taken back `a long time ago,' and `in a galaxy far, far away,' even though it appears that we might have lost touch with our youthful magic.  Just ask a 7 or an 8 year old if Phantom Menace or Attack Of The Clones are good movies.  I bet you will not hear the same over-analysis that you hear from so many hardcore fans (even if the kids prefer Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings-I bet they would even prefer any of the new corny dialog in the new flicks over that of Return of The Jedi). By all means, analyze what you will in the movies, but please try to recapture some of the unsullied enchantment that has always made the story as a whole so appealing.  I mean, Oasis might not be the Beatles, but that does not mean that Oasis does not write good songs.Having said all that, that does not cut out the factor of preference; thus Attack Of The Clones has realigned my new favorites, from best chapters to worst chapters (although they all serve their purpose well): The Empire Strikes Back, A New Hope, Attack Of The Clones, The Phantom Menace, and Return Of The Jedi.Peace.",8,0,0,19 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Revisited
","I simply will not be suckered into all the hype surrounding a movie with no plot and as slow as turtle soup.  I know this movie is a 'classic,' but so are Vlasic pickles--and that does not mean they are any less sour.  Now, the Robert Deniro segments are nice, but so is 'Once Upon A Time In America.' Along with 'Annie Hall' (and I love Woody Allen films) & 'Shakespear In Love,' we see how the best movies for their respective years do not always win the little gold statue.  I guess that is all I have to say (besides why did Brando have to die so soon in the trilogy/).",7,2,10,7 July 2003
Grease," Re-visited
","The songs are wonderful (all but the `Sandra Dee' number), the scene with Travolta trying out for the different sports is top notch, and this musical/movie has been an inspiration for many.  The last 15 minutes of the movie is pure musical brilliance (except for possibly the dumbest scene in musical history: when the car started to fly).  Personally, I had not seen this movie in 18 or 20 years, and I must admit that it has tarnished quite a bit for me over time.  In fact, I can only give it a 6.8/10Bottom line, I think most people must have a sentimental attachment to `Grease' in order to like it after all these years.  Too much fluff for me, but I can see why people dig it.  Not that I cannot get into syrupy type movies; however, I found myself loathing the parts where it sounded like everyone talking at once.  There was very little breathing space and only so many leather jackets and 30-year-old teenagers the eye could take.  Also I am more of a film-as-art critic than I was the first million times I saw `Grease' )back in the early eighties).  Don't get me wrong. I mean, I am of the generation in which this movie came out; nevertheless, I have since become a firm believer in keeping stage productions off the silver screen.  Combining the two genres has done nothing but muddy the waters a bit.  It is like 99% of the time when a band covers a song it is never as great as when the original artists did it. What's more, it does not really seem like art to me when a Director or a Producer takes an existing stage production and trys to pass it off to the film crowd as something new.  If all it takes to make a box office smash is to take someone elses work, add a few extra lights, nifty camera angles, and a few big names, then hell, I want a piece of that action!  It is a lazy man's game and it does not support artistic integrity.  A case in point, take any opera, film it, put it on DVD...a few people will buy it, but most of the purist will snub their collective noses at it. Then again, the movie going public (in general) do not SEEM to be so pure in the search for excellence in their chosen genre. *NOTE* I am not so much talking about 'Grease' here, but a certain movie named after the Windy City, that won a best picture Oscar. What a travesty  But, hey, if people never mixed different styles of art together then we would not have nearly half the music that we have todayso who am I to complain?Nonetheless, as pure film/art I think `Grease' would have been better off on Broadway.  And I bet John Travolta was not even driving that car in the big car race scene (ha) (Not really funny).Fun to watch 68% of the time.  6.8/10I could say so more, but nobody reads this stuff anyway.",6,0,4,22 July 2003
Black Hawk Down," Shades of 1898
","Like many things in life, one cannot very well complain about things that cannot be helped, things that you cannot change, and things that simply 'are.' So, I am not going to come in here and vent about the woes of American foreign policy; nevertheless, while Black Hawk Down might have been a well filmed movie, the false sense of patriotism  that it portrays (in a place much like vietnam: a place we had no business sticking our noses in), it was hard to watch the movie, and see our boys being killed for something that does not even belong to us. I love America, but I cannot condone any action that leads to the senseless slaughter of our youth, while as a nation we are unprovoked by outside forces. Since the year 1898, when our forces were sent into Cuba to fight a conflict that was not ours, there have been only two wars that America had a right to become involved in. In WWI and WWII we were essentially provoked in to the conflicts and thus had some sort of meaning to be there. George Washington, in his farewell address, all but begged and pleaded for us to stay out of foreign affairs and wars, but we have never listened. Ok, that is the way things go, and I will not cry over split milk. Nevertheless, if there is any measure of patriotism to be found, it is in the wars where AMERICA'S freedoms were maintained, and not the freedoms of those countries that have made poor choices along the way. America has made enough poor choices of our own: things that we must swallow and move on. Therefore, movies like Black Hawk Down, are simply plasticine portraits of what patriotism is suppose to be. If you want a 'feel good' American movie, watch 'Ben and Me'(1953): the movie about that little rat that hung out in Ben Franklin's pocket. Sure, 'Ben & Me' is a cartoon, but so is Black Hawk Down.",7,0,0,23 June 2002
Singin' in the Rain," Said Before...(I'm Sure)
","I have to admit that I am not much up on my musicals.  Nevertheless, after watching this movie it makes loads of sense why this might very well be the greatest musical of all time.  This flick was really enjoyable from start to finish! However, not being a big musical buff, a few things really stuck out to me: 1.) For all the greatness of Gene Kelly, Donald O' Conner stole the show (although I realize that Kelly is the one who choreographed all the moves). 2.) The only thing that keeps the movie from being a '10' in my book is the whole 'Broadway Melody.'  While it is very entertaining in itself; nevertheless, it made no sense in the grand scheme of the movie.  In other words, it seemed liked SUPERB filler...yet it is still seemed to be filler material. There is no excuse for any movie, no matter how good it is, to contain stuff with no relevance to the picture as a whole. Not that anybody will read any of this, but I thought Singin In The Rain was great!",9,1,3,9 July 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," Bzzzzzzzzz
","The lyrics to 'Big Bottom' says it all in this classic rockumentary: Clever, witty, stupid, and loud!  I love humor where it is great on the surface and also when you read between the lines. For anyone that loves the sound of a major 5th played on guitars set to 11!  I give it an 8.5",8,0,2,24 August 2002
From Hell," Hannibal Lecter, Eat Your Heart Out (a bad pun, but I could not resist).
","Well, the Hughes Bros. really have their stuff together in their latest movie, From Hell.  When I originally saw the movie at the theaters I gave it a `7'; but not that I have scoped it out on DVD I believe an `8' is more in order for what is surely the new definitive Jack The Ripper movie.  The directors (and writers, for that matter) took the least plausible `Ripper Theory' and turned into to something that is very much believable.  For what it is worth, as a child, I read up quite a bit on the Whitechapel murders, and although I espouse I different belief in what happened in London in 1888; nevertheless, From Hell, took enough turns to make me second-guess my theory. The imagery in From Hell was top-notch all the way, and while Heather Graham's Irish accent was abysmal (as well as about half of her acting), Johnny Depp was aces, as always.      If you ever get a chance to check out the deleted scenes on the DVD release, you will notice that the Hughes Brothers intended the movie to be a bit more seedier then what we saw in the theatrical release.  From Hell was pretty dark as it is, nonetheless, I wish they had kept some of the more grittier scenes and thus showed more of the underbelly of 19th Century England.  The deleted scenes are fun to watch.  For the most part, however, the Hughes Brothers did not pull any punches, and what we see in From Hell really is a parallel to our present day sub-cultures of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, thievery, and basic skullduggery. The Hughes Brothers did their research into the Jack the Ripper mystique more than any other filmmakers to date (and I have seen them all the Ripper movies).  Down to the last cobblestone of Mitre Street, and the paint on the buildings-even the way each victim was mutilated, and how they lay in the street-taking every jot and tittle from the original police and forensics reports, this movie makes the grade. I really can't say why I did not give it a higher rating.  Something was missing from the flick, but I don't know what.  Nevertheless, if you want a good, solid movie, with lots of fiends and villains, history and mystery, you can't go wrong with From Hell.",8,0,1,17 June 2002
Paths of Glory," Always Needed
","What is amazing, and given that it was made in 1957, is the almost complete lack of 'cheese' that this movie could have had. 'Paths of Glory' was way ahead of its time as a war movie: a semi-film noir masterpiece that shows Kubrick stretching his wings and getting a real feel for the world outside of Leave It To Beaver. However, thank the great acting, as well, that carries this movie. Although the groups of actors, including the great Kirk Douglas, never even attempts to try out a French accent; nevertheless, the whole cast does a great job, and only a few times do the actors get carried away into some 'stage theatrics' that was common in the movies of this time period.  But, we need WWI movies like this, and I am almost ashamed that I had not seen it until now. The photography is beautiful, as well as the realistic battle scenes, and please take special note of even how the soldiers wore their facial hair back in 1916. Everything looks authentic and down to the wire. Even the extras in the film are shown how they really were in the French enlisted army of that time: a mixture of all ages, from very young to men in their 50s. The complete absence of showing the Germans? The enemy is truly within! I could go on about this flick: from the walking down the trench scene, to the photographs of grand halls and architecture, but I will end here, and just say to watch this film, even if you are not a fan of 'old' movies. Almost a 10!",9,0,1,10 July 2002
Gangs of New York," Sad but True
","It is kind of sad, but 90% of the people who go see this movie will never realize that 95% of the movie either really happened, is based on real events; the people were one time real people, the costumes were very close to real (maybe a tad exaggerated, but not by much), and that New York City, of 2003, is probably a much more wholesome place than it was 140 years ago. Read the book `Gangs of New York,' published in the 1920s, in which the movie is roughly based.  The movie will look less fantastical, and maybe people will appreciate the movie for all its `realism.' (Although you can bet Hollywood creeps in from time to time.).",9,0,0,8 January 2003
Windtalkers," Not Even!
","Modern World War II movies that cut the mustard?  Try Saving Private Ryan, Das Boot, When Trumpets Fade, and even The Thin Red Line (if you like the premise of Walt Whitman goes to war).  Try Band of Brothers (if it ever comes out on DVD/VHS); but don't try Windtalkers! Try Stalingrad (and if you like a love story, even try Enemy At The Gates); but don't try Windtalkers! Try Cross of Iron!  Don't try Windtalkers!  Hell, even try The Big Red One (at least that one is funny, and you get to see Luke Skywalker carry a M1 Garande instead of a lightsaber).  I would rather see all of the old episodes of the 50s T.V. show, `Combat,' rather than the senseless fodder of Windtalkers.  Poor Nick Cage makes Audey Murphy look like Corporal Upham, from Saving Private Ryan.  The Bronze Star, the Silver Star?  Forget it, Nick Cages' character should have won the Congressional Medal of Honortwice over!!!  Maybe I was wrong, but I was expecting a realistic portrayal of the war in the Pacific, but what I got was Crouching Stupidity, Hidden Plot-lines.  The acting, apart from the action scenes, was not all that bad. I guess the wait continues for a realistic WW II movie of the Marines in the Pacific Theater. Hey, how come we haven't had a realistic World War I movie in the last 20 years?",4,0,0,16 June 2002
