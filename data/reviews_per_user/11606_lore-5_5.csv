Antz," Kind of creepy. Not for kids.
","While some of the jokes were good, and I liked the animation and the film's perspective, I found some of the plot twists pretty creepy for a film that many kids could be watching.  There are some pretty violent scenes, including one very disturbing death and several mildly disturbing deaths, as well as an interrogation which leaves one character bruised and slightly bloodied.  I was surprised to find these elements in a film that I had thought was intended for children, then I realized that it was rated PG. Does no one make kids films for kids anymore?  Must everything be 'gritty' to be entertaining?",7,1,2,1 May 1999
Notting Hill," A film that trusts its viewers' intelligence
","A few hours after seeing Notting Hill I'm impressed by the way the film makers underplay plot points that in a less subtle film would be telegraphed and overdone.  No, this probably won't win any Oscars, but for a light, romantic comedy it's exceedingly well done.  And yes, Hugh Grant plays pretty much the same character that he always does, but he does it well.",9,0,0,2 June 1999
American Beauty," Some characters well drawn, others cartoonish
","This film struck was a mixed bag. On the one hand, some of the characters (Lester in particular) were well written and well acted. Kevin Spacey is a delight to watch as he fully inhabits his character and makes us care about and understand him. On the other hand, several characters are overdone to a cartoonish degree: Annette Benning and Chris Cooper's characters in particular. I found the unrealistically dysfunctional military family particularly offensive. (Why, whenever there is only one set of characters in a film who are associated with the military, they are invariably psychotic? If other types of people were so regularly misrepresented there would be an outcry.)So, I'd say that 'American Beauty' was interesting, fairly well done, but still somewhat flawed. It did make me think while watching it and afterwards. It's worth seeing, but go to a matinÃ©e or wait for the video. It's not quite $6.50 worth.",7,0,0,23 October 1999
Moulin Rouge!," What a freakin' mess
","Oh, my, what a disappointment this was.  There was just TOO MUCH.  Too much spectacle, too many cuts and jumps, too much directoral cleverness, too much mugging for the camera, too much noise, too many pop song references, too much STUFF.  Even the musical numbers, which could have been what made this movie very very special, each were made up of multiple songs and intercut storylines.I considered getting up and leaving halfway through, but resisted the urge in hopes that the film would improve.  It did, slightly, calming down in the second half.  But by that point I was too annoyed to get lost in the story.'Moulin Rouge' is to 'Strictly Ballroom' what 'Phantom Menace' was to 'Star Wars'.  When the directors didn't have access to enormous budgets and whiz-bang special effects they gave us well crafted, entertaining stories instead.  Given free rein the story is lost to the visuals and I, for one, am left wanting my $6.75 back.",4,0,1,11 June 2001
Toy Story 2," As good as the first 'Toy Story,' but clearly a sequel
","'Toy Story 2' has all of the same positive elements of the first film: great characterizations, emotional plotlines, wonderful animation.  The only failing I can identify is that there are a few unexplained plot points from the first film that are carried over into this one.  More than most sequels, a viewer would need to see the first movie in order to understand this one. Otherwise an A+ effort.",9,0,1,7 January 2000
