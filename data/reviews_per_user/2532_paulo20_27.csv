The Blair Witch Project," A Tale of Three Idiots or Why TBWP doesn't work...
","...at least for me. [WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS]First, to be fair, I thought the three actors (Heather, Josh and Mike playing Heather, Josh and Mike) did well with what they had to work with (i.e. next to nothing); I honestly think they did the best they could. Yeah, they were grating with their constant bitching and cussing and whining, but they had to make up this s**t as they went along (and they only got $1000 bucks each), so I can't really find fault there.  I also thought that the film did well in building up suspense... ...unfortunately, that's part of the reason the film doesn't work, because it doesn't pay off.  I kept something really terrifying, but the film just didn't deliver.  But more on that later...The first and foremost reason why BWP doesn't work is that three students CONTINUED TO FILM TILL THE END.  I mean, this should tip off anyone who might have thought this was real that it was,in fact,not real; at all.  It shatters even the illusion of reality, and the characters' attempts to explain their continued filming don't hold water for me.  No rational person would film running scared in the night or alleged bits of Josh or while fearing they are lost.Which brings up the next reason why BWP fails: how could they possibly get lost in the first place?  Like they themselves said, the woods aren't that big.  They just walk in a straight line and eventually they'll get out. Yet they manage to walk around in circles.  Does the film explain this?  Not at all.  We can only vaguely infer (and it's a long shot) that the 'witch' is making them lose directions.  But there's never any strong indication of this, unless those stick figures and rock piles are supposed to mean something.  Plus they had that compass!  Are we supposed to guess that maybe the witch threw their compass off?  That seems, to me, to be a heck of a lot to ask from the viewers.  So, anyway, the trio come round full circle to find that they've come upon the same log they'd already crossed over a creek(and they sure seem to cross a lot of them in this picture) in their southbound quest to get the heck out of the woods, which is in itself odd since you'd think they'd have recrossed it at some point and had some sense that they'd flipped directions.  But the main thing is why not follow that damn creek out of the stupid woods?  When Mike in a fit of semi-demented glee confesses he kicked that useless map (previously thought lost) into the creek, he unknowingly provided the clue to another ticket out of there. But, unfortunately, the three students are too unBELIEVABLY stupid to pick up on this (I have to believe that they are monumentally stupid, else I can't buy this at all).  But I willingly overlook this in the hopes of some big scary payoff at the end.Which brings me to the third reason why The Blair Witch Project is nothing more than a house of cards.  That payoff never comes.  It just doesn't happen.  What we get is a shot of Mike in the corner taking a leak, or at least it looks that way.  All that expectation I had building up got quickly deflated.  What's that about imagination?  I'm supposed to use my imagination?  Come up with my own vision of the witch?  Pfah, any schmoe can do that.  Let's see, she's supposed to be this hairy ghost woman whose feet never touch the ground and in the middle of the night, she snags Josh in the middle of the night.  Ooohh scary... but... what if it's not a witch.  I most certainly did NOT see a witch.  Not so much as one nose-wart.  Did you see a witch?  Then how the heck do you or I know it's a damned witch? What if it's aliens, who stake out the place, to observe the locals and notice three idiots stumbling about in the woods and decide to kidnap them for study or their own amusement.  Hey!  Maybe it was those aliens who screwed with their compass and made the poor fools lose their way.  Stupid?  Damn straight!  But the filmmakers have left such gaping holes for the audience (the AUDIENCE!) to fill that I or anyone else can come up with some crazy BS to fill in those huge blanks.  And no one can tell me I'm wrong because there is nothing to say that's so.  NOTHING.  If witches, why not aliens? Why not faeries from the magical land of Narnia?  Hey, didn't you say to use my imagination?  And I could go on, but man would it ever get stupid, but as it stands I'm left unsatisfied with the movie's conclusion.Some good examples of leaving the imagination to the viewer?  How about Jaws.  Steven Spielberg knew the power of not showing the shark.  We hardly see it, but we know it's there, because we've seen the damage it's done. Or take the Excorcist.  Sure we see that a little girl doing all those ghastly things.  But we never see the demon that possesses her, but we can only imagine what it would like if we could see it and it would no doubt scare the p**s out of us.  Because we have something solid, something strongly visual on which to base our fears.  That little packet that Heather found? What the hell was that?  Looked like it could have been teeth and possibly a tongue, but it also could have bits of porcelain and a chicken gizzard (and very well could have been).  It raises tension, but doesn't truly raise any hairs.  It tells me almost nothing.  It doesn't stack up against mangled corpses and little girls with heads that spin 360Â° .  What you can't see has to be balanced with something you can, and BWP simply doesn't provide enough.One last word on the theory that what you don't see is scarier that what you do.  I'm reminded of a story I read somewhere:  Some guy enters a graveyard to rob a grave or something.  When he tries to leave, however, he finds something has grabbed his coat.  In a superstitious frenzy, thinking the resident of the grave he just robbed has snagged his coat, he struggles to get free, never bothering to turn around.  He ultimately dies of fright. Turns out what's snagged his coat is a sword stuck in the ground.> Sometimes, that noise you hear in the night is some insect or bird, or maybe the wind flapping the shutters,10 or your cat screwing around in the basement.  Sometimes what you don't see turns out to be a sword stuck point down in the ground.  And sometimes what we do turns out to be some psycho trying to stick that sword between your ribs.Well, that's it.  I've said my piece.  You can say I'm talking BS and send me e-mail illustrating the point, but I doubt very much if you can convince me to fear the sham that is The Blair Witch Project.",3,1,4,11 August 1999
The Birth of a Nation," A remarkable film, yet also a deplorable one
","Even I, being a casual movie viewer, can recognize some of the things that make The Birth of a Nation such a landmark film. But like any casual viewer of films, I can't overlook the outrageous racist propaganda that is its subject. All the apologist remarks and arguments about historical context or what have you t won't compel me to view this film again (though I do think it should be seen at least once by anyone with more than a casual interest in the history of film). As it is, when I watched it, I often had my thumb firmly on the fast forward button. I may have missed a few nuances of story but I couldn't imagine myself sitting still through a 3-hour silent film.Which brings me to my next point: why did this film have to be 3 hours long? The film's racist ideology aside, this film is faulty. More specifically, as I suggested before, it's too long. The second and third acts justify their length, but the first act takes too long establishing things. When we're given the gist of a scene with the title card (or whatever you call it), why do we need lengthy (or at least substantial) stretches of soundless dialogue and theatre-acting? Hello? The audience doesn't know what the heck the actors are saying? Why prolong these scenes? When we're told Lincoln is to sign such-and-such bill (for a more concrete example) why do we need to see Lincoln actually sitting down and signing the bill? Let's face it, the most remarkable thing about the film are its innovative battle scenes and various other innovations that modern moviegoers take for granted. In other words, except for the battle scenes, when the film isn't' being offensive, it is being boring. The other quibble I have with the film is the choice of music. Using Civil War time music is fine, but why bring Beethoven into it? I felt the use of Beethoven's 6th was incongruously used and somewhat profaned in this film.Anyway, all told, it would be hard enough to make the average movie viewer, weaned on colors and sounds and special effects and whatnot, to appreciate this film if it WEREN'T racist. As it is, its subject remains a formidable barrier against such enlightenment. As a final note, to those who defend the alleged truthfulness of the film, well, there is perhaps a kernel of truth in every instance of propaganda but, remember, it was also true that white Americans owned black slaves. And there is very little propaganda surrounding this particular truth. So I hope you'll forgive me if I fail to feel any sympathy for 'the poor, white Southerner.'",3,4,9,13 December 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," I think I'd prefer a Terence and Phillip film
","They were the funniest part of the movie.  I laughed uproariously at their musical number.  That was almost absurdly hilarious.  After that, however, my laughter waned.  Sure there were a few highlights here and there but nothing to match Terence and Phillip.  I also thought they overdid it with the musical numbers.  That just sort of got a little too loud and frequent for me.  And yeah, as others mentioned before me, the kids cursing their big mouths off just isn't funny after a while.  Lastly, the message was just a bit too heavy-handed.  Subtle Trey & Matt ain't.  So, overall, I found it an uneven effort; but that's just me.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
Spider-Man 2," Wow, the cops in New York must suck.
","Once Spidey takes a hiatus, the crime in NY shoots up 75%? What good are the cops if they need Spidey to do 75% of the work? What was the crime rate before Peter Parker got bitten by that mutant spider?And what is the deal with Peter Parker's 'promise' to Norman Osborn (a promise he never actually made) not to tell Harry that he was the Goblin? This 'promise' compromises Peter's ability to clear Harry's misconception that Spider-Man killed his father. But why can't Peter simply tell Harry that the Goblin killed his father? It wouldn't be anything but the truth, would it?Lastly, why the heck don't Doc Ock's tentacles feel the pull of that energy nexus thingie?But, seriously, I don't want to pick this movie apart too much. In fact, part of the appeal of the movie is the fact that these sort of outrageous situations are depicted almost believably on the screen. Of course Spider-Man needs to be important to the crime-fighting effort. Otherwise there'd be no real reason for him to exist. And Harry Osborn needs a reason to hate Spider-Man; otherwise he'd never end up as the next Green Goblin (oops! Hope I didn't spoil anything.) And Doc Ock would look pretty silly if he didn't 'magnet-proof' his tentacles (this may have been explained during the movie; could be my attention lapsed at the moment)The movie is basically a comic book, faithfully and believably adapted to screen and that, apart from the human interest story, is its main strength.",Null,1,2,27 July 2004
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man jumps the shark
","This is a bad film and, by association, if nothing else, the other two have become sullied. I have to wonder if any of these films were ever any good. Maybe I've just been fooling myself.Anyway, there is little to say in defense of THIS film and whether or not the other two are any good, this 3rd film has put me off watching them ever again. Because Sam Raimi has clearly lost the plot, if he ever had it.The film is a complete mess. There are at least four story lines going on here, and they are rather clumsily intertwined.First we have a look at Mary Jane's attempt at a singing career and why it fails. Of course, I was under the impression that she wanted to be an ACTOR, not a singer and that she seemed as if she would do OK as the former. It's an obvious contrivance but it's not the only one. BTW, this is the character at her utmost unlikable (and about as far from the original vivacious comic book character as possible).Then you have Harry Osborne becoming the next Goblin. He sneaks up on Peter Parker while he's on his bike (btw, what happened to his Spider-Sense? It's entirely missing in this film) then starts wailing the tar out of him, until Peter finally turns the tables and knocks Harry out cold. After a brief scare that he might be dead, it turns out he's OK, except for partial amnesia (another weak plot point).Then you've got the Sandman, yet another sympathetic villain (and one who comes by his powers for no other reason than that the plot requires it). In the comic, he was a thug (except for one short period) who's fairly powerful and menacing. Here, he's a caring father who pulled off a heist to get money to save his dying daughter (well cry me a river, why don't you?) and not very effective or menacing (and Thomas Haden Church, the actor portraying him, seems to concede most of the characters' screen time to a series of roaring and groaning special effects). During this heist, he accidentally shoots and kills Peter Parker's uncle Ben. The purpose of this otherwise purposeless alteration of the Spider-Man origin story is to present some sappy message of forgiveness at the end. YAWN! Why can't we just have villains that are jerks?Oh wait, we do, in the form of Eddie Brock, a rival photographer who's attempting to land a staff job at the Daily Bugle. But if not for the major plot point of the squishy black glob from space, I'd say he comes off as little more than an after-thought. And his alliance with Sandman is never explained and never convincing. Add to that a rather poor performance by Topher Grace. That's not to knock Grace, though; I think he could have done better if there were time to focus on Brock/Venom.Somewhat intertwined with this storyline is Peter Parker's turn to the dark side. The squishy blob envelopes him, giving him a black costume and he becomes Dark Spider-Man, one who acts without inhibition or remorse when dealing with his enemies or even his friends. We witness a campily embarrassing scene parodying Saturday Night Fever and another where he attempts to humiliate Mary Jane by interrupting her jazz number with his own (btw, it was never established, to my knowledge, that Parker played the piano).Then, there's Gwen Stacy, a significant character in the comics, but here she's just reduced to nothing more than a weak plot device. (Also, in an ironic bit of casting, the actress's natural hair color is red, as is Mary Jane's, while Dunst's natural hair is blonde, just like Stacy's). Actually, she serves as a reminder of how the filmmakers dropped the ball from the very beginning. They failed to feature Gwen in the first movie and create a significant story out of it and now they're reduced to presenting the character as a cypher. Better not to have used her at all, I think(I've always wondered about wanton changes to comic book stories when they're adapted to film. I mean, these things are already STORYBOARDED and at least some of them are GOOD STORIES).Added to this convoluted mess is the suggestion of a sort of 'The Cult of Spider-Man.' Footage of him shows up on giant screens; he's invited to and shows up at a ceremony to receive the keys to the city and get kissed by Gwen Stacy (part of another weak plot device); plus the final battle scene involving the Sandman, Venom, the Goblin and Spider-Man; and all the while you've got hordes of idiots screaming 'Spider-Man! Spider-Man!' as well as a female and (for some reason) British reporter portentously describing the events of the battle. It is as embarrassing as described and it struck me that it was not unlike this in the other films, though those films were infinitely more watchable, if nothing else.What's basically happened here is that at least a year's worth of comic story lines (Harry Osborne, black costume, Venom) is being ham-handedly smooshed into a story that already features the 'touchy-feely' Sandman storyline and some angst-ridden crap about MJ. The final results aren't pretty. The movie should have focused more on Brock/Venom and left Sandman out of it. There was already enough to go on with Harry and Peter for another plot thread. The movie also could have, nay should have, done without Mary Jane's ordeals. And I think we've seen, and heard, enough of her being dangled off of something and screaming her stupid, red-dyed head off.",2,2,3,29 December 2007
Sleepy Hollow," One instance where the effects actually make the movie
","This is a gorgeous film, such that it hardly matters that the story is perhaps a bit faulty.  Story, as I said, scarcely matters.  Whatever story there is is enough to hold the movie together and maintain minimal interest.  Sleepy Hollow is a very visual film.  The costumes were great, the sets of New York and Sleepy Hollow were amazingly authentic and the effects so awesome, that I scarcely paid attention to the story or even to the notion there was supposed to be one; I was too busy marveling at the spectacle of the Headless Horseman and other remarkable effects.  This is one film where the effects actually make the movie (Jurassic Park was another such film as was The Lost World  - marginally).  There was also a surreal, quirky feeling about the film that I rather enjoyed.  There's even a sequence that is reminiscent of the Disney cartoon.This film is also about legend, i.e. elevating and expanding the status of the legend of the Headless Horseman to the status of the (hackneyed) vampire and werewolf and doing a damn good job of it.",8,0,0,13 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'Well...it was better than Phantom Menace...'
","That's pretty much the general sentiment about the Episode II, but I would have to disagree because that would imply that The Phantom Menace was any good.  A better assessment might be that Attack of the Clone was no worse. It's basically a bunch of long drawn out sequences involving indiscernible politics (except, perhaps, to the fanatics)  and a painfully forced romance, plus another annoying scene involving a fat, four-armed alien in a diner, punctuated by a string of action sequences that just barely save this film from being a total waste of $9.25.But one other thing that kind of spoils Star Wars for me is that Boba Fett is given an origin.  I don't know about anyone else but I thought the one thing that was cool about Fett was that he was just this bounty hunter sent by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo.  Period.  He didn't seem to have to do anything with the Jedi; he only entered the picture because of Solo.  He was a character that seemed to exist apart from the whole Jedi storyline and simply was doing a job for a powerful gangster.  That made the Star Wars mythos richer for me, the idea that the Jedi storyline wasn't the only thing going on in the universe.  Now ATotC has gone and entwined his story with that of the Jedi and it suddenly all seems less plausible.  Now, presumably, Boba Fett will exact his revenge by killing some Jedi or some such but then what?  In eps IV-VI, we see him as *just* a bounty hunter and, considering the import attached to him in ep II, his death in ep VI (falling into a living pit) comes across as anti-climactic.  Just my impression...",1,36,69,8 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The mighty Frying Pan (SPOILERS)
","I've discovered that's it not easy (at least for me) to comment on this movie in its entirety in one review and to cover all the aspects that bothered me without getting impossibly long-winded, so I've decided instead to comment on certain things as (or if) they occur to me.OK, I thought the movie did a good job in conveying a sense of urgency and terror that I don't think I'd felt as strongly in the book (it's been nigh 14 years so I may not remember too well); I figured the next time I read the book I could recall the urgency of these sequences from the movie for a greater reading experience.  But on closer inspection you wonder if there's anything to be worried about.None of the characters, except Frodo, (stabbed by a Ringwraith), Gandalf (fell to his apparent death) and Boromir (killed in an overlong death sequence) show so much as a scratch.  Samwise, a humble gardener, dispatches orcs with a frying pan.  Frodo is again attacked and wounded, but is luckily wearing some impregnable armor.  Orc-arrows seem to be shot at the Fellowship's feet or otherwise wide of their targets.  Now, I don't remember if any of the characters got nicks and scratches in the book but I do remember the Moria sequence occurring much more swiftly and none of the instances describe were milked for cheesy drama.  I remember it being more described as a frenzied flight for freedom.  It wasn't a staged battle where enemies are slain, apparently to the last orc; when the battle is over, the Fellowship has time to dote over Frodo and his 'near-death' experience before the orcs, with big booming sounds, remind the company that they are again in danger.  So it's another dash for freedom, but now the gang is surrounded by orcs that can climb down vertical surfaces like roaches and snarl and hiss at our heroes.  You wonder how orcs this skilled and threatening can be defeated with cooking utensils.  But then, that's all they do, snarl and hiss, conveniently, until (again, conveniently) they sense the coming of a nastier presence and then scatter like, surprise, roaches.  I may be wrong, but I don't remember this happening in the book. The orcs did hang back when the Balrog appeared but they didn't just go back to their hidey-holes.Now, about that much bally-hooed Balrog: yeah, sure it looked all big and impressive and stuff, but was it really all that threatening?  When I envisioned a Balrog I thought of something faster (and certainly smaller) and more vicious; something that moved with alarming speed.  The movie Balrog sure does roar a lot and rear up menacingly but it moves about as fast as a sedated tortoise.  Gandalf has plenty of time to block its downward swings and the other guys have plenty of time to split.Then there's Boromir's death scene.  I don't really mind them moving this bit from Part II to Part I.  I suppose it gives the film a sense of closure. Boromir is killed, supplying tragedy, then avenged, signalling triumph. But did it have to be so overdrawn?  Think about it: Boromir is shot with an arrow.  Shocked he falls to the floor and ponders this.  But then, he musters strength and fights some more until another arrow impales him. And then again.  But each time Boromir sits there after each fresh arrow, the orcs he's fighting LET HIM SIT THERE.  They don't take advantage of the situation and stab him but gamely wait for him to get back to his feet and kill them.  Meanwhile, the two hobbits that Boromir is defending stand idly by with blank looks while Boromir is making like a pin-cushion.  But the thing is, they're standing well off to the side and don't seem to be close to Boromir at all.  Meaning that the orcs could just swarm in and take the two hobbits (their intended goal) without even bothering to fight Boromir. The point is this scene was at least twice as long as it should have been (and not very well staged, at that), taking time that could have been used for all the stuff that others have been clamoring for (myself included), like character and plot development.  Also, it goes back to the point about how nigh invulnerable these heroes seem; even when they are beaten it seems to take a few shots to the heart and lungs to put them down.Some points have been made that the Fellowship escaped largely unscathed and dispatched tons of orcs because they are the 'best of the best.'  OK, but then, why should we be worried?  If these heroes can cut swathes through orcs and walk through a flurry of arrows without getting wet, why should we care?Anyway, this has gone one too long and ended up being a long-winded mess after all.  The point is, though what I've described above (as well as other aspects) may be inconsequential or regarded as minor flaws by many, for me they are gaping holes and undermine the movie entirely.",1,6,13,16 January 2002
The Exorcist," Possibly the creepiest film ever...
","Or one of the creepiest, anyway.  What Jaws does for swimming at the beach and The Blair Witch Project does for camping in the woods, this movie does for, er, being a twelve year old girl and minding your own business. Actually, all stupid jokes aside, that is one of the things that sets this film apart from most other horror films.  In most horror movies, it seems the threat is mostly avoidable.  For example, Jaws: just stay the hell out of the water; BWP: TS for you if you can't follow a friggin' creek out of the woods; etc.  But in Exorcist, the girl and her mother do nothing that we can see to incur the terror that comes to plague them and could have done nothing to prevent it.  It just happened.  Of course, one has to believe that this kind of thing can happen in reality for the film to have maximum impact (and there is, at least, a basis in reality).  But, for my money, even if you believe demonic possession to be so much hokum, this film does a good job at being creepy anyway; it's just that well made.",9,1,2,16 October 2000
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Excruciatingly dull
","I dunno, maybe the fault is with me; I'm open to that possibility. But I just couldn't sit all the way through this one. I gave it about 2 hours (of its 160 minute running time) but it felt more like four. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is one minute longer than this film but it's highly watchable from beginning to end.I realize the movie was perhaps more character-driven than plot-driven, but that's still no excuse for a film to be this lugubriously paced. Check that, there is no pacing in this film. It just sort of rolls along like the clouds that are frequently and lovingly focused on in this movie. As with rolling clouds, it's hard to get a sense of movement in the movie.To be fair, the cinematography and the photography is gorgeous but it doesn't make up for the lack of anything interesting going on. Characters sit around and talk a lot and there are a lot of what I think are supposed to be menacing and enigmatic looks from Jesse James but which only really added to the overall tedium.And here I thought ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST was slow. And it was, but it has absolutely nothing on THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES (and at least the former film had Claudia Cardinale to look at). WEST is actually 15 minutes longer than this film but I wouldn't be able to notice the the difference.On a different note, it says on the Trivia page that 'When casting for the role of Robert Ford it came down to Casey Affleck and Shia LaBeouf. Affleck eventually got the role, because LaBeouf was felt to be too young.' Weird, since Robert Ford was 20 and LeBeouf was 21 at the time of the film's release, while Casey Affleck was 32.",3,8,17,16 May 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," A mess
","Hard to fathom how this scored a 7. It's also hard to say which is worse, SPIDER-MAN 3 or this turkey. I'll call it about even. Both feature shoddy plots and poor characterizations with dubious motivations.The most egregious example in X-MEN 3 is the Jean/Grey Phoenix character. Jean Grey died in the 2nd movie and is reincarnated here as the Phoenix? Why? Because it happens in the comics, I guess. But what's missing from the comics is the story behind it all. I'll admit, I missed the first 20 minutes of this movie so I missed the actual resurrection but I somehow doubt I missed enough that it would have made any sense in this movie. Killing Cyclops and the Professor sure didn't make any sense. In short, the idea of the Phoenix is poorly realized here (for starters, the Phoenix-Force manifested itself as a bird of fire, not some sort of bug-eyed vampire queen). The filmmakers simply have no idea what to do with it. At the end, the solution is for Wolverine to stab her. Yay. (As a brief aside, Wolverine, it seems, is the only one who can approach the Phoenix because, while she is able to disintegrate everyone else, she can't do the same to Wolverine because he can instantly heal any damage done to him? How does this work exactly? Where does he get the biological material to patch up such terrible injuries? Is it magic?) Other characters hardly register. The new characters are just there, though admittedly there isn't enough time to develop their characters. But the established characters hardly fare any better.I'd like to comment about the look of the film. The effects are nice but I'm finding less and less reason to give a movie good marks because of them. Good effects should be a given. Of course, so should a good story but I would suggest maybe it's not as easy to craft a good story as it is good effects.Anyway, the characters all wear fancy leather uniforms in these movies because, supposedly, 'spandex' would look stupid on film. But the movie outfits look stupid in their own right, with a few arguable exceptions, and lack the pizazz of the comics. Magneto looks sillier than most, certainly a ways sillier than his comic book counterpart, and would look silliest of all if it weren't for the film's Juggernaut character. I mean, were they serious about this? Did they really think this is an improvement over the comic depiction? I'm beginning to believe that it's not the comic book costumes that look silly, it's the filmmakers' inability to bring them properly to life. So we end up with these ugly 'leather' uniforms. Blah. Meanwhile, Wolverine's hair looks atrocious. Storm's hair is actually an improvement over the banged wig but it's still not a style that works for the character. Lastly, I was never much of a fan of the casting in any of these films. Magneto, for instance, was never a wrinkled, joweled old man in the comics.Anyway, to sum up, the movie lacks in just about every area except special effects but so what? I can only hope this really was the 'Last Stand.'",1,0,0,25 January 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Needless ommissions and inclusions spoil an otherwise highly entertaining film (contains spoilers)
","Two Towers would have been a very good picture, if not a great one, if not for a few needless ommissions and intrusions.  The Arwen sequence was included for no other reason than to give the highly overrated Liv Tyler screen time.  There just doesn't seem to be enough of a reason to beef up her role. Yeah, sure, the reason commonly given is that it's supposed to give the female viewers something to watch, but it's not like the gals are bored with everything else that's going on.  I'm not saying the romantic angle should go unplayed, just that it should be lavished with such loving detail.Aragorn's fake death was played for dramatic purposes, as if there wasn't enough drama in the story to go around and if there hasn't been enough fake deaths in the first film.  Both of these sequences/occurrences squandered screen time that could have been used to include the Huorns (basically the reason the Ents were called Treeherders) and Shelob, the giant spider.  The Huorns are instrumental in routing the Orcs at Helm's Deep; they are an important element in the story. In the film, the defeat of the Orcs wasn't terribly convincing since there were still hordes of them.  There didn't seem enough of a reason for them to just turn and flee.  A burst of sunlight wouldn't seem to be enough, especially since these Orcs were the Uruk-hai, specially bred to move about in sunlight.  In the book, the Orcs were crushed between Gandalf's contigent and the Huorns, which make a lot more sense and would have made a much better movie.  There was plenty of time to establish the Huorns if not for unnecessary dream sequences.Shelob, the spider, was also ommitted for no clearly good reason. Presumably, Shelob will be featured in the the third movie (won't there be enough to take care of in the third movie?).  In the book, Frodo seems to be mortally wounded by her and goes into a sort of coma, yet one more time the fake character death card will have to be played (making Aragorn's fake death seem all the more excessive) but at least with Shelob and Frodo, it's warranted and would have made an astounding finish to the film, as it did the second book of Lord of the Rings.  (It probably inspired the less-than-happy ending in The Empire Strikes Back and look how good a film that was).  It also would have given Samwise (and thus, the Hobbits, who have thus far been little other than 'the little people) his moment to shine, as he takes on and defeats Shelob.  I disagree there wasn't enough time.  For one, as I said before, I don't think the time was spent wisely in telling the story; for another, an extra half an hour to 45 minutes would have been sufficient.  Judging from audience reaction to the film, very few would have minded an extended film.  Oh well, it will have to wait till the third film.  But imagine the anticipation for Return of the King that would have been created if Shelob was included in Towers.  Instead, it will just be something that happens in the third film that's quickly resolved (it will have to, I imagine, if the rest of the story is to be told with any sort of efficiency).Also, the whole Faramir plot was a total, total, hack job that I don't even have the heart to comment on right now.  Overall, a severe disappointment. The major bright spot was the performance of Andy Serkis/Gollum, truly an astonishing development in the world of CGI; he makes the severe disappointments of this film almost bearable.",1,8,21,22 December 2002
I Am Legend," CGI basically kills it
","All other weaknesses of this film aside (and there are several), it could have been an effective thriller if real people were used. I mean, why not go the extra mile and create real monsters? The cartoon ghouls are just not scary at all. They evoke laughter more than fear. When these CGI monsters open their jaws impossibly wide, it doesn't look scary, it looks stupid. Hollywood, buy a clue. Even when monsters are strapped to tables on labs, they're digital. It's utterly unbelievable.Real effects could have made something of this movie, which otherwise is rather dull, with frequent flashbacks to before the apocalyptic virus wiped nearly everyone out and scenes of Will Smith picking corn, talking to mannequins and shooting golf balls. There is one horrible scene where Smith is watching SHREK and parroting the lines spoken on the screen.But everything really falls apart because the protagonist is never threatened by anything real. SCOOBY DOO holds more thrills and suspense.",3,5,6,4 June 2010
Transformers," Why can't they ever get it right?
","Why can't anybody ever get the Transformers right? It's possibly one of the coolest concepts ever to be conceived and yet in every nearly incarnation, the execution has been wanting.First, there was the so-called G1 TV series, which I fondly remember but, sadly, it just doesn't stand the test of time.Then we had Beast Wars, an idea which never appealed to me, despite some good things I'd heard about it.Then we had various crappy anime series.Then we have this. Others have already ably described the various things that are wrong with this movie, so I won't bother to do the same, except to add that it's a damned shame that Frank Welker couldn't reprise his role as Megatron's voice and also that Optimus Prime seemed fairly powerless against Megatron and needed Spike to defeat him. BOOOO! As for the designs, I can appreciate the need or desire to update the designs but I don't see how that translates to changing them completely or making them overly complex. Less is more.And now, we have the new animated series, the pilot of which aired recently on Cartoon Network. Early returns don't look promising on that one either (in other words, I don't care for what I've seen so far).Sigh. I wonder if we'll ever see the Transformers done right.",2,10,18,28 December 2007
Grave of the Fireflies," Animated reality
","To reiterate what another reviewer said, the film is haunting. From the opening frame to the last (especially the last), that is indeed the best way to describe this excellent film. I have no idea how to explain how an animated film about orphaned, starving children in war-time Japan can be watchable, but this one is. Probably the fact that it's animated has something to do with it (and consideration of that possibility brings to mind comparisons to Art Spiegelman's comic book Maus, which employs cartoon animals to depict people in a biographical account - Spiegelman's father's - of Nazi death camps). In any event, a live action film would not be possible (or very difficult) for, I think, somewhat obvious reasons (the most obvious being the fact that it would be very difficult to effect the appearance of malnourished children). However, the fact that it's animated does not make the story any less sobering (just as the cartoon animals in Maus didn't soften the brutal reality of the situation).",Null,1,2,7 September 2004
Toy Story 2," Awesome!
","That's all I can say.  And I've gotta agree with those viewers who favored the sequel over the original; it can join the ranks of such films as `The Empire Strikes Back' and `Road Warrior'.  This movie was so good, in fact, it deserved a more original title than `Toy Story 2'.  Oh well, can't quibble about small stuff like that.  I can hardly believe they planned to release this gem direct to video!  I'm glad they came to their senses.  One thing that soured this film for me, though, was a bunch of people sitting behind me and laughing forcefully and idiotically at almost every thing that transpired on screen; a major distraction that undercut the film's enjoyment.  I'll have to see it again, next time unsullied (hopefully) by laughing idiots.",10,1,2,27 November 1999
Ice Age," Surprisingly entertaining
","My expectations weren't high for this film but, much to my surprise, I enjoyed it alot.  Certainly it was a lot more enjoyable than Shrek (to me) and perhaps even Monsters, Inc. even though it might not quite match the technical achievements of either of those films.  I just found the simple story that much more engaging and fun.  Also, it's set in a more interesting environment than either movie (in my opinion, of course).  I expected there to be a barrage of fart jokes in the film but was utterly amazed by the complete absence of them.  Well, there *are* two instances involving 'poop' but these are by no means gratuitous and have a lot to do with the development of the characters; moreover, they are actually quite funny.  All the voice work was great, especially (again, surprisingly) that of John Leguizamo, whom I expected to be annoying, but as it turned out, the Sloth stole every scene he was in.  He certainly gave Eddy Murphy's 'Duncan' a run for his money (now, the donkey, HE was annoying).",8,2,3,20 January 2003
Jaws," Still as effective as ever - spoiler warning (?)
","I'm as jaded as hell.  I seem to be excited or shocked by few things in the movies anymore.  JAWS is one of those few things.  I won't do any critiques of the movie because I'm tired and frankly, probably wouldn't know what the heck I'd be talking about.  But, rest assured, it is and effective movie. Take the fate of Quint at the end.  I just saw this movie recently and even knowing what his fate was to be, and seeing how fake the shark looked, I still found the scene extremely chilling, almost disturbing.  I really didn't expect this.  In fact I was anticipating this scene all through the movie, knowing how it would occur and it STILL managed to shock (also, at the time I was extremely tired and nearly nodded off a few times).  I think that's a pretty good indication as to how good this movie is.Oh, one last thing: Deep Blue Sea is a stinking turd.  Don't waste your time on it.  Rent or buy JAWS instead.",7,1,2,2 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A piece of Sith
","Strategically mix up the letters in the word Sith and you'll have an apt one-word description of this movie and the other prequels.I'm basically going to try hard to forget I ever watched any of these movies. Putting aside the problems with dialogue, acting, story, pacing as well as the utter lack of any interesting characters, anywhere, these movies look nothing like the original three They might as well have occurred in another universe entirely; for all intents and purposes, they did. That would have been the real challenge, I think: to duplicate the look and feel of those films, not creating these soulless, digital monstrosities. I'm going to have watch the 3 original, un-meddled with movies to try and wash the memory of these other so-called Star Wars movies from my consciousness.Did these movies really need to be made? I answer no, but perhaps only because the end result is so terrible. A better job certainly could have been done; I think anything the fans imagined is probably superior to this cinematic poo. But, of course, these are George's toys; nobody else is allowed to play with them. The best anyone can do is forget these prequels ever existed. Thank 'the Force' it's finally over. If there's any justice, there will be a restraining order to keep Lucas 500 ft. away from a camera.",1,6,12,6 June 2005
WALL·E," Great animation (as ever) but lacks a compelling story
","Nothing much to say, really, about the animation. PIXAR steps it up another notch. Simply stunning, which is par for the course for PIXAR. I gave the film six stars and at least five of them go to the visuals.However, the story didn't really match those visuals. And the two robot leads were cute, I'll grant, but not much more than that.SPOILERS FOLLOW.Basically, humans created the mess that made it necessary for them to leave the planet. And we're supposed to root for them to come back? I'm sorry, I just don't get it. It's not a strong enough reason for me to root for the protagonists. And the antagonists are, likewise, not compelling enough, with no real apparent motivation for keeping the humans from re-inhabiting earth, unless it's to protect the earth from humans overloading the world with trash again, in which case, I'm not sure we shouldn't have rooted for them instead.And what about the other species? We see fish in the end credits. Presumably, the planet was okay for them and other species? The movie doesn't really go into that, unless I missed something.Meanwhile, while the humans were away, they came to rely on being carted around on hover-chairs. As the film explains, this leads to some bone loss. And their ability to walk has apparently atrophied over the centuries. Only it hasn't, as we see the uniformly obese humans learn to walk again, much like overgrown infants learn to walk. Perhaps this is meant to be symbolic, but it doesn't make a lot of logical sense.Finally, I'm not sure why a live action Fred Willard was used, but this is a minor point. Given the rest of the movie, I find that I really don't care. I just find it a little odd.",4,29,61,30 November 2008
The Iron Giant," An amazing film
","I didn't really notice the similarities to E.T. while watching it, but now I can see them.  Still, I found this to be a much more entertaining movie. The animation was superb, the story was sharp and the giant's technology was awesome.  It's really a shame this film didn't do very well in the box office.  Hopefully it will make it up in video and DVD.",10,0,0,31 December 1999
Space Jam," Just flat out terrible
","I only saw the last 20 or so minutes of this travesty but just by the sequence where MJ tries to get those basketball players to touch the ball, I have no desire to see how bad the rest of it is... and no desire to comment on how bad the part I saw was. Instead, I'll echo what some other commentators have said about Bugs needing help to defeat a bunch of stupid-looking aliens. Bugs needing help? The Bugs Bunny who once single-handedly defeated the large, brutish baseball team, the Gashouse Gorillas [Baseball Bugs - 1946], needing help? The Bugs who once went psycho and sawed Florida loose from the USA, among other disasters[Rebel Rabbit - 1949]; needing help?? The Bugs who once trampled a huge, murderous black bull [Bully for Bugs - 1953] (who makes an appearance in this film in one of the film's few pleasant surprises). That Bugs? Needing help??? Uh...no, I think NOT. The 'character' in this film bears little resemblance to the real thing. To even suggest such a possibility of Bugs enlisting aidto overcome a challenge basically destroys an essential aspect of his character. That's what this film does pretty well, after all: destroys characters.",Null,0,3,9 September 2004
Beowulf," 4 stars...for the dragon.
","Others have said it better than me but that's not going to stop my putting in my 2 pence. Here we have yet another classic work that has been compromised to presumably tell a more, presumably, 'believable' tale. We're expected to believe Beowulf is flawed and that he's bragging about his exploits, yet we witness him performing the kind of feats he's supposedly bragging about. Perhaps someone can explain that to me.The part where he demonstrates he really is flawed is when he is seduced by the presumably irresistible 'Monster Queen' as played by Angelina Jolie. This is some pretty tawdry film-making. Basically, we're led to believe that no man, however hardy, can resist seduction and we're left with this bitter taste at the very ending of the film. That this is all part of some vicious, unending cycle.We also have an alleged romance between Beowulf and Wealthow invented for the movie, yet I never saw any evidence of it on the screen, so why bother? The character herself was annoying as all get-out. Most of her 'performance' was in giving endless wistful looks and showing off how pretty her face is. To be fair, some of these ideas themselves aren't really that awful...when explored on their own. When transposed on an epic work, they just ring false.As does the animation. Loved the scenery but the character animation didn't do it for me. Despite, the exquisite textures (on the main characters, anyway; the extras looked like they came straight out of the Shrek movies), the renderings of humans didn't strike me as particularly convincing, especially the eyes. They are just off. They come off as cold, and thus, so do the characters. And men riding horses came off as risible.However, the dragon sequence was awesome (despite the nature of the beast being changed for the film); cant' find any fault with that, probably because I'm a sucker for dragons. Hence the relatively generous rating.",2,4,7,9 December 2007
300," Watchable but still bad
","I gave this film a generous 4 stars but it's not one I would particularly watch again (except with the accompanying RiffTrax by Mike Nelson and co. - actually looking forward to that).I enjoyed the comic series for what it was - it was well-paced and nicely illustrated - but this film failed to invoke the experience of the comics. There are some well-done action scenes (the film even manages to make a sex scene into an action scene, although it comes off as more amusing than erotic) and endless scenes of guys getting impaled, decapitated or whatever, but it's all very thin. There is very little behind it all, despite it being based on historical events. Even Braveheart (a movie I no longer appreciate as much as I used to) managed to instill its battle scenes with some weight.Comparisons have been drawn between this film and a video game and they're not unfounded. Blood flies everywhere, but it's all fake and doesn't land anywhere. Impalements, dismemberments and decapitations abound but when the camera pans to the battle scene, nary a drop of the red stuff is seen anywhere. It's like the film cut costs by avoiding the use of fake blood. Whatever the case, it looks fairly silly and adds to the 'weightlessness' of the film.Then there are the beasts and monsters that appear in this movie, making the film something of a 'historical fantasy' but they really don't add much to anything. For one thing, the CGI is terrible, notably for a wolf and some elephants. As for the elephants, they are described as being 'clumsy,' so why should I care? There is a war rhino that is, of course, utterly ridiculous and an ogre's fight with Leonidas is just an all-too familiar rehash of recent cinematic melee. There is a thing with the cleavers for forearms that was just bizarre and I don't know what the story is with the goat-headed guy. These scenes are merely 'eye candy' and don't add much else to the film.The performances were ridiculously overstated, I thought, making the dialogue come off as cheesy. For instance, David Wenham, the actor who helped assassinate the character of Faramir in LoTR, was even worse here. He adopts an odd and unappealing narrative voice and just seems to go on an on, especially at the end of the movie.And then there's the villain, who almost makes everyone else look better by comparison. Rodrigo Santoro's performance would be utterly laughable if it were not almost painful to watch. Why Frank Miller decided to depict Xerxes in the comic book this way, I can't say, but one can more easily overlook Xerxes' appearance there. Here it stands out like a, well, a bunch of fake body piercings.I could go on and on, but I think the only way to see how bad it is is to watch it.",3,2,3,15 August 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," I will NEVER believe the hype again...
","Or never pay 11 bucks for it again, anyway. All I've heard was good things about this movie and assumed it would be $11 well spent. Well, so much for that.This movie is a 'boy meets girl' fairy tale story, and I don't mean that in a good way. I know it's supposed to be uplifting and heartwarming but it rings hollow. It's based on nothing more than a gimmick. Seriously, this movie is about a series of improbable events and the rationale by which we're to believe it all is that it's destiny. And, the thing is, I'd buy into it if I could buy that the two characters (boy and girl) had any sort of chemistry. But they don't.To sum up as briefly as possible: boy meets girl (who, along with his brother, is orphaned at a young age), then boy loses girl. Luckily, some years later, boy finds girl again. But, since his brother is a dick, he loses girl again (he loses contact with his brother as well). Some years after that, he is able to find her again (as well as his brother), but things are complicated. She has somehow fallen in with the wrong crowd and is married to a gangster, who then whisks her away, so boy again loses girl. But he doesn't give up and gets the idea to go on the popular game show 'Who Wants to Me a Millionaire,' which, he reasons, she'll be watching.He then goes on the show and answers all but the last question before the show's hour is over. He then ends up at the police station where he is roughly interrogated on suspicion of cheating. It is this point at which the movie starts, and we are then given the rest of the story alluded to above via flashbacks. That is the film's narrative device, to show each question and flashing back to the point where the boy got the answer (except for a few questions for which he uses his lifelines). Turns out, each answer was gotten in the same order as the questions on the show.As you can probably imagine, yes it's all HIGHLY improbable. ASTRONOMICALLY improbable even. But hey, it's DESTINY and the girl actually does come to watch the live broadcast of the game show and even ends up being one of his lifelines! (Although she doesn't know the answer  more on this later) Then they meet at an oddly empty train station, declare their love for each other and touch lips. Then they, and a bunch of mysteriously appearing other people, go into a funky Bollywood dance number over the end credits. YAY! Except not YAY! BOO! Again, I think I'd be willing to buy this fairy tale if the love angle between the boy and girl was in any way believable. But I didn't see it, feel it or believe it for a second. The characters barely had time to know each other. When the two first meet, they're about seven years old, i.e. a while before puberty, and together for a few days at best before they are separated. When they are reunited a few years lager, they are together for perhaps an even shorter time. When they meet still later, well the girl is hot, but the chemistry between the two still fails to come through, mostly because it's never adequately established before this. The fact that the two characters (as well as Salim) are played by three sets of actors (young, older, oldest) doesn't help. Thus the message of destiny ultimately falls flat.The movie even poses a multiple choice question asking how Jamal could have known the answers to the WWTBAM questions. Choice A was 'he cheated,' choice D, 'it is written' (I forget what the other two were). When I saw this, I had no idea that the answer would actually turn out to be D, 'it's written.' Yep, it's written alright. And do you know where it is written? In the script. I'm sorry to say, it really doesn't go any deeper than that.",4,16,25,8 February 2009
Gladiator," Way too drawn out
","Gladiator was a severe disappointment to me.  Firstly, it was too long, at least 45 minutes too long; 2h45m total.  But length alone doesn't make a movie seem long.  In fact, some movies that are very long don't seem very long at all, such as the Lawrence of Arabia, the Godfather movies and Braveheart, all riveting throughout.  No, Gladiator's problem was that it was obviously going for the look and feel of an epic.  It got the look just right.  No question, this movie looked fantastic; can't possibly give an argument there.  Unfortunately, the film didn't have enough story for an epic.  Solution?  To have long stretches of dialogue and to have long pauses between each line of dialogue which, by the way, was very, very bad.  The acting, therefore, was understandably average as no actor could possibly seem that convincing behind such overblown dialogue.",2,0,2,8 May 2000
Pocahontas," Perhaps the only bad Disney animated movie I've seen
","The only redeeming elements are the standard gorgeous scenery and character animation (at least concerning the titular character) but everything else is so...blah.  It seems the cute little animal sidekicks are there just for the sake of being cute and funny (there was absolutely no reason for that dog to even be in the movie.  So he starts out as the bad guy's pet but then befriends the raccoon - who cares?)  Considering the deep subject matter, the cute animals come off more as 'cutesy' than cute.Considering the subject matter, why did they even tackle it at all if they're going to put a heavy sugar coating on it?  I can't fathom taking a heavy historical subject and basically making an idyllic fairy tale of it. Oh well.  Anyway, a few other things that bothered me: 1) language barrier apparently not a problem (I think it's supposed to be inferred that Pocahontas 'magically' learns to speak English - oh brother) and 2)Tom, the kid with the hat tells Pocahontas that John, after being wounded, has to go back to England because he has no chance in America - what do they have in England that can heal a musket wound that they don't have in America? This movie is such a crock.",Null,7,13,12 August 2002
