The Legend of Bagger Vance," Good, Not Great, But Good
","I saw this movie in the theatres a few hours ago and I thought it was pretty good. But it was slow in the beginning and Golf really isnt a good topic for a movie. Will Smith didnt do much in the movie considering his character was the title character. Matt Damon did some good acting in this also. Besides the slowness in the beginning, it was a great movie and I recommend it.",8,0,1,11 November 2000
Halloween," Not Perfect, But Suspenseful
","I first saw Halloween last Halloween night when I got bored and went looking for movies. Since then, I cant stop watching it. The movie is extremely suspenseful and the music really adds to the suspense. Sometimes though, it seemed to drag on and it was a little overly quiet. But thats a small gripe. If you havent seen this movie yet, RENT IT or BUY IT!",9,0,0,14 July 2002
