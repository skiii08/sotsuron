National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Utter claptrap
","What a boatload of pure, unadulterated hogwash. Shame on Helen Mirren, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, and Ed Harris for being in this piece of absolutely Bush-Patriot-I'm An Amurrican Hero riddled crap. From Nicholas Cage I would never expect more, he is one of the world's lousiest actors anyway... I mean, have you ever wondered how come a piece of firewood seems to have more emotional range and depth? No spoilers here, none needed. This movie should be avoided at all costs, except if you are trapped on an airplane or possibly in prison or some other confined space with no other choice available to you... In my case, I was held hostage by a German woman I know and forced to see the dubbed version of this piece of utter detritus. I can tell you, dear reader, that having only shortly before-hand been subjected to the sheer agony that is Alvin and the Chipmunks by my nieces, 12 and 8, on a visit to the U.S. over Christmas, that piece of sheer crap was a million times better and ultimately more deserving of every prize that could be thrown at it than National Treasure: The Book of Secrets, especially if you see it dubbed in German. There is no greater 'treat' (other than possibly being forced to eat dog excrement for dinner?) than hearing lines which must have been unbearably bad in English come out of the single-emotion, no-talent lips of Nick Cage as Ben Gates. And I pity poor Riley Poole for having accepted a terrible role as sidekick to an idiot in this ultimately boring, totally predictable piece of rotgut which plays to all that patriotic crap which has been rammed down the throats of Americans (and thus the world) since the 9/11 attacks on New York in the name of 'patriotism' by the fascist Bush regime.",1,11,21,19 February 2008
The Equalizer," Action's Back and It Has a Name - Denzel Washington!
","What a ride! After having wasted 110 minutes of my life watching A Certain Justice - Puncture Wounds because I pressed the wrong button on the website purchase screen, I righted my wrong and treated myself to The Equalizer, which was the perfect antidote to one of the worst movies ever made.Denzel gives a stellar performance. The plot has a few question marks, most of which are cleared up satisfactorily in the run of the film, but basically this flick has it all - action, action, action. I remember feeling just as excited when Bruce Willis and Danny Glover appeared in the first Die Hard. The characters are well portrayed, the brutality is realistic and not utterly gratuitous, the empathy viewers feel is tangible. The plot unfolds like a good book and takes us through everything we need to stay glued to the screen and on the edge of our seats. The supporting cast is very good, but this is definitely a one-man show - and the credit goes to Denzel Washington.I hope they make a sequel...and that's something I rarely hope or ask for!",9,5,18,27 September 2014
The Happening," MNS might want to look at retirement
","I have not had to watch a more dreadful piece of utter schlock garbage in years than 'The Happening.' The notion that plants could seek revenge or defend themselves against humans is credible, as research has shown, but this movie does its best to make something that is serious seem utterly ridiculous. No attention span is needed as everything is fed to us spoonful by spoonful. The writers have also obviously been out of touch with their own educational experience for some time now - any high school science teacher who spoke to an inner city senior or junior class the way the script has Mark Wahlberg pontificating would likely be knifed in the halls or sent down to Kindergarten to teach. He is so utterly patronizing in that scene that it is hard to believe that he wasn't just rushed and put out of his misery right there and then, which would have saved me another hour and 15 or so minutes of pain...John Leguiziamo's role is also disastrously badly written, and the 'doe-eyed' Zooey Deschanel is just plain dumb and creepy. The attempts at character development in this film are so bad, one wonders if they were not written by MNS's daughters, nieces, high school-aged groupies - what have you...From the point of common-sense alone (the plants spread their toxins by giving off the deadly, invisible brew which is wind-borne, but the wind apparently can be magically summoned by the plants to do their dirty work - this entire premise is never explained or even alluded to as it would have exposed the entire premise of the film as the ridiculous tripe it was) I went after reading another review here (warning me dutifully of plenty of spoilers) but the description of this film as utterly shocking and extremely bloody was unwarranted and overly cautious, probably the work of a soccer mom... Sweeney Todd the musical is much bloodier and more extreme in its scenes of mayhem than any part of The Happening except for one scene in which Mrs. Jones does herself in toward the very end...If this is the best MNS can now bring forth, his steam is obviously running out. Time to hang up your hat, MNS???",1,4,10,23 June 2008
Lucy," Rollicking good fun!
","Color me tickled - two of the most talented actors out there - Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson in one movie, and Sci-Fi to boot! After reading all the 'goofs' and other demerits people love to post here, my response was a resounding, 'So who cares?' A movie is supposed to be a little bit of escapist heaven. A few hours off from life. A break in the continuous hammering from reality which most of us endure daily, hourly, minute by minute. Lucy is an excellent escape. The end, almost spiritual, along with some of the wonderful pearls of wisdom that drop from Lucy's lips throughout this truly entertaining film alone were worth the ticket price. And as far as the 'myth' that we only use 10% of our brain being a fallacy, I personally have met many, many people around the globe who made me wonder if they were even using 3% of theirs. So, true or not, the 'myth' does make for a rollicking good time, supported by a truly entertainment value provided by Johannson, Freeman and a cast of unknowns (well, at least to me before this!) who all did their best to make a marvelous bit of celluloid.Go see it. And enjoy some popcorn, too. Lucy is prime popcorn-munching fare.",10,36,75,8 August 2014
