Walk the Line," Not just another biopic - a must see performance and movie
","I was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets for the premiere of Walk The Line in New York. I wanted to see the movie so badly because after all it's starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon - for me, reason enough! Before I watched the movie, I didn't know anything about Johnny Cash, June Carter or their lives. In fact, I am not even particularly interested in Country music, to say it mildly. I am however always interested in movies that are depicting somebody's real live and especially in movies with music, any kind of music. And music you get in Walk The Line - a lot! The movie's plot is kept simple and James Mangold focuses on the early years of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The movie ends - and that's hopefully no spoiler - with an upbeat! After 135 minutes of fine entertainment you'll be leaving the theater in a good mood because the tone of the movie - despite all the conflicts and problems - is set quite romantic. The chemistry between the two main characters is totally believable. The couple shows you the meaning of the word 'soul mate'! And then there's the singing! Mr.Phoenix learned to play guitar and got into Johnny Cash's style. He even gets his voice sounding like the legend's voice. And Ms. Witherspoon? She is no less stellar as June Carter. Both do a very fine job and all the talk about Oscar noms is more than justified. I really enjoyed the movie and will watch it again once it opens on Friday. - And on a private note: the cast of the movie I met at the black carpet premiere was all very charming. Thank you guys! 9 out of 10 points.",9,1,8,16 November 2005
Blood Diamond," Important and perfectly executed - one of the best movies ever made!
","Living in New York City, I used the opportunity to see a pre-screening of Eduard Zwick's latest movie and with BLOOD DIAMOND we have this year's major Oscar contender. Not only will this film get nominated in all main categories but it will most likely take home the big ones like BEST MOVIE, BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY, BEST SCRIPT, BEST EDIITING, etc.If not BEST DIRECTOR, as well as the BEST ACTOR trophies for either DiCAPRO or HOUNSOU - are they going to be pitched against each other?! JENIFFER CONELLY is excellent too, but she will face the toughest competition since female supporting roles are the ones women usually get in Hollywood, but let's not get side tracked.Enough Oscar talk, the season is not yet here and there's still room for another movie to convince that much as Eduard Zwick's masterpiece does. I doubt however that any other still to be released movie can keep up with the high quality of BLOOD DIAMOND. The topic is as relevant and important as the topic of a movie can be. It's almost filmed as a documentary. Mr. Zwick never lets you from the hook. There's lots of shooting and dying and only occasional breaks that let you breath again. There's no room to slow down, there's no shelter to take, no room for peace.Life, as we, who are able to peacefully watch movies in theaters, know it, is put upside down. The society has gone bonkers! Violence, injustice, cruelty everywhere. No fine place to live regardless if you're about to smuggle diamonds and making million of $$$ or just want to properly raise your children.BLOOD DIAMOND is one of the best and most relevant movies ever made, hands down. Go and watch it!",10,4,9,3 December 2006
