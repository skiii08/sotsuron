Walk the Line," One of the most inspiring movies that I have ever seen,
","One of the things that separates Walk the Line from other movies about famous musicians is that it tells what the artist felt through his life and what inspired him to write the music that he did. I saw it back when it came out for my birthday back in 2005, and just bought the Collector's Edition and watched it again last night. I had forgotten how good it was. It was amazing what Johnny Cash had to go through in his lifetime to get the girl, and I cried in the end because it was so powerful how Phoenix and Witherspoon depict these two lovers that can't be together is a perfect romance story with really good adaptations of Cash's music and a constant reminder that you can get what you really want if you just try hard enough. This movie has just entered my Top Ten List, hopefully it can find a special place in you heart too.",10,2,3,16 January 2008
