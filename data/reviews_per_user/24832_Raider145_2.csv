Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stop it Lord of the Rings Fans
","I was born in 1989 so I was unfortunate to not see the original movies when they were shown in theathers but my parents showed me the original 3 and I instantly fell in love and when I found out that they were re-releasing the original 3 back in theathers I was very excited. My father who did see the original 3 in the 70s and 80s loved the movies also and as I did loved the remastered movies. He is not what I would call a star wars fan boy by any means of the word, but I consider myself a fan boy and the impact that it had on my father (average movie goer) was very successful. When The Phatom Menace came out I was excited and at the end I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED. I am very tired of people saying that Lucas is bad and should give up, that his movies are bad are you serious? As a story goes it does not reach that of the original but the story that is depicted not only in the phantom menace but in the others are extremely solid. I feel like there is a hatred for these movies for some reason and my only conclusion is that a massive amount of lord of the rings fanboys do not have anything better to do with their time than bash a saga that is way superior then them in every form of the word. I hope that they do release the other 2 prequels and the original trilogy because seeing them on the big screen is something worth paying for.",10,4,9,1 February 2012

","If this movie does not dazzle your eye then their might be something wrong with you. Hot chicks fighting impossible odds, Zack Snyder kept it simple, he was not looking to win Oscars he was just looking to entertain people in a unique way. This movie will entertain you plain and simple. The story structure is a little messy and at times you do not know what reality you are in.The movie carries a big backpack of action and like just what us Americans like our movies. I like rating my movies into categories Visuals 10 Audio 9 Entertainment 10 Story 7 Imax Experience 10Lets rate movies for what they are not compare an action cgi movie to black swan.",8,5,9,24 May 2011
