The Incredible Hulk," The best hulk anyone needs
",Well i saw the on 12th June 08 on Thurs on the first UK day it was SO good and Lou freaking was great as voices and cameo and the jokes were good angry/hungry and excitement and oho sh and the other ones banging head a movie to like HULK SMASH thats a hulk movie ABOMINATION was cool too first time I've seen hulk struggle and iron man at end was bad and the lonely man theme was good reference and the chair featured in the series and the David banner scene at the end to support the comic and TV series with each name and iron man spoiled it the only thing. i should be with hulk. better than the split movie witch crapped last 2003 but this is a real hulk movie anyone needs,9,2,9,13 June 2008
Skyfall," Unfortunately this didn't work for me.
",I have been a huge fan of James Bond for years and unfortunately this film didn't do it for me.The main problem I had with this was the 60s vibe and the music that they went for. Don't get me wrong I am a fan of old films such as Alfred Hitchcock and other but I don't see why they had to add a 60s vibe into a 2012 film. This movie also didn't connect with the previous two. The positives that I thought this film had was the casting and to be honest for what they were going for I think this film did it good. I thought the action was weak. I didn't understand this film that much. I will keep watching this movie until I am satisfied with it. What did annoy me on the release was people stating that it is the best Bond film. I highly disagree. Compare this movie to any Connery and Moore movie. Spectre will be a much better movie. I would have enjoyed this movie more if they went for a vibe mix.,6,1,5,10 June 2015
Man of Steel," Not my Superman
","I was disappointed with this movie. I will talk about the positives and negatives.Positives: Casting- Henry Cavil is a great choice for Clark Kent/Superman, that also goes for the supporting cast. Suit- The first time I saw the suit I was very disappointed with what they were going for but I finally came to like it when it was brightened up. Special Effects- This was very good!Negatives: Vibe- This movie gave me a very dull and depressing vibe due to the acting and the cinematography and story. I would have preferred Zack Snyder to have brightened this movie up. The grey scale didn't work for me. Action- The action in this movie wasn't thrilling or appealing. They overdid the action, the action never worked for me at all. Acting- the acting was dull and there wasn't enough acting.I look forward to the next film and hope it will be much better.",5,3,5,10 June 2015
Titanic," titanic rules
","Leo is a good actor he has a good character. The ship is good because the beginning was a real ship footage. Titanic is the ship of dreams especially the beginning.The Ice-berg has nice work of special effects.This film i enjoyed because of the story so long something you never expect it to happen. The ship sinks.Jack dies of cold and Rose says she will never let go. Deep sea explorer, Dr. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) leads a team to search for a fabled diamond, rumoured to have been lost when the Titanic sank. Using both a submarine and remote-controlled robot submersibles, they explore the ghostly wreck, concentrating on the guestrooms of the first class passengers. Retrieving a safe believed to contain the jewel, they are disappointed to find only papers and a drawing. However, the picture depicts a nude young woman wearing the jewel. When he discovers that the woman is still alive , Lovett brings her to the exploration ship, hoping that her recollections may help him find his treasure. Her memories transport her back to the final days of the Titanic's first and last voyage",10,3,5,4 December 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," The Rocky Balboa of Batman.
","In this movie; they had the best villain played by an amazing actor. This movie is about hope. I thought the casting was brilliant in this movie, I thought the fight scenes were intense with Batman and Bane. This movie had a fear vibe with what Bane was attempting and it was a thrill to see Gotham fight back and win. The problems that I had with this movie was the aspect ratio switch on one scene. Another problem I had was the ending, I didn't understand how Batman survived the bomb drop but it's down to interpretation. To me, The Bat had super speed. The final ending could have been much better. At the time it would have left some viewers to think that the next film would have featured Robin being the next Batman. But only for those who would not have been aware of the DC movie plans. This movie had a great epic thrill feeling which excites me.",10,3,5,10 June 2015
