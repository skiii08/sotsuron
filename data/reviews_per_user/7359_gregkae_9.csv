10 Cloverfield Lane," Oh, come on
","If you want tension stick your fingers in an electrical socket. If you want to feel on the edge of your seat, sit on the edge of a chair. But just don't watch this soulless sackful of sour grapes.This is as subtle as 'american' can get. This is entertainment for the intellectually debilitated brats of the smartphone era. No nuanced performances from any of the 'performers' at any point of this catatonic attempt at breakdance. You just gotta love the protagonist grunting and panting and sighing and gasping and heaving and huffing and puffing and grasping for air all the same perfectly made up with no smudged mascara.If you absolutely must, make sure you bring a trashy newspaper or read a magazine in the meantime, no need to pay close attention to the on screen action, this is Brazilian soap opera pacing at its best. With acting to match.Oh, if that weren't enough, the 'story' blows, too, like the alien 'ship' set on fire with a makeshift molotov cocktail which just happened to lie about on a car seat in the last scene.",1,2,5,10 August 2017
Hereditary," Cool effort
","At 120 minutes running time it is a bit of an exercise without a soft cushion, so just be aware of that and have a drip and a catheter handy.First hour is more of a heavy yet watchable family drama and the second hour is just descent into weirdness. Not sure about the plot and its otherworldly outcome, it is nonetheless captivating, slow but not boring, well executed and fantastically acted. Reminded me a lot of Polanski's works.It is not a gross out, not a slasher, no happy ending by the numbers crap and does not cater to all tastes, hence may be disappointing to some. The production values alone warrant 8 stars and please don't moan about the believability, it's a genre flick so stop whingeing.",8,1,1,29 April 2020
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the death of horror
","I loved the acting - very believable, almost like a school play.I really cared for the characters in this movie, I mean, you have to feel for them for this is most likely the end of the actors' careers if they ever had one.I was stunned by the make up effect, I want the same set of crayons for my kids, they would kill at their primary. It felt good to be stunned, sit in a stupor and miss most of the 'action', like REALLY good. I felt like one of those 'zombies' I guess, I'm sure they were stupefied at how this epic turned out.Multilayered like a nappy, deep like bubbling intestines, fermenting and ready to launch. A few moments at the very very beginning showed promise but after 5 minutes it's been diarrhoea all the way to the end. And no-one had the courage to wipe afterwards.",1,2,7,7 November 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," It wears crocs. That's all.
","Predictable like Zara spring shows, boring like H&M rags, flat like a pair of cheap sandals at a beach stand and simple like the blouses Hathaway is wearing in this dud. It's all been done to death with far more flair and humour and there's absolutely nothing fresh about this fashion flop. It's a rotten low-hanging fruit which does not want to fall into oblivion and decompose to the benefit of all nature. It got 2 nominations? Well then where are its raspberries?",2,0,0,14 May 2020
The Conjuring 2," Scary mediocre
","Run of the mill, average chiller. Overlong story gets tired quickly, many scenes make little sense, seem more like plot devices. Just when you think it starts getting somewhere, just like public transport, you're asked to get off and wait for the next bus. By the time it gets going you'll be worn out like spandex corset after award season. It is well made and decently acted but there are so many missed opportunities along the way you're left wondering if it's got something to do with brexit. The ending is anticlimactic and feels like a hand job with no happy ending. I say only for die hard franchise fans. I just didn't care and so shouldn't you.",5,0,1,23 December 2019
Ex Machina," Yes and no
","Certainly not thought provoking. A good idea marred by the script. The dialogue is rubbish, the set up ridiculous - no suspension of disbelief. It all feels very contrived.For what it is the acting was good, Ms Vikander steals the movie and that in itself is a bonus. Sadly, none of the characters is likable.Beautifully shot with fantastic CGI (I live) with some disturbing imagery, but not overdone. However, some scenes are just not believable and raise many questions about the logic and motivations.You can see it as some sort of modern curiosity just don't expect fireworks and you'll be fine.",6,1,2,4 August 2016
The Witch," It does say folktale
","First I watched it then I read the reviews. What is disappointing is not the movie but the moronic opinions of some.It is a folktale based on superstition, live with it. It does what it says, it is beautifully shot and acted and if one does not understand the language here's a hint: finishing primary school may be crucial in intellectual development.Not for everyone, no matrix style action scenes, cgi and all out gore, more surreal, ethereal spookiness and hysteria of a family in seclusion. Somehow the atmosphere reminded me of 'Under The Skin' with Scarlett Johansson. Watch at own risk but don't complain like an old woman.",8,1,3,29 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," True classic
","The whole picture is one grand build-up leading to the edge-of-your-seat finale. Every scene feeds to the tension and suspense. One of few movies that are gripping right from the beginning to the very end. There is a pinch of hidden jet black humour here and there and a sprinkle of camp every now and then only enhancing the atmosphere of desperation and disgust. I thought the killer's motivation and backstory somewhat lacking, I'd given Foster less screen time as she was well acted but boring character in the end, stiff, ambitious student, one you would not be friends with in high school. Nonetheless everyone partaking in the production is a professional and it shows. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,10 June 2019
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Sharp!
","Compelling! Every minute is enjoyable, especially if you are a Woody fan. The characters are so predictable and right of the bat we know who is going to deliver the drama, who will be comedic and who is going to be the tragic one - you just sit and wait anxiously for the bomb to explode, fantastic!. I was not entertained by the male protagonist but they rarely are. So Johansson is herself, the poor thing cannot act to save her life but she fits her pigeon-hole just fine, the British chick is cast as the annoying uptight sidekick and delivers on that front plus she is the real eye candy here not Johannson. The whole movie is stolen by Cruz, who is as hysterical, unpredictable as only the Spanish can, she has the charisma in buckets. One star less because we do not really see how beautiful Barcelona is and it is a big let down. Shame the city partially paid for the movie to be shot and it is not featured heavily, I would expect more. Anyhow, money aside, Allen is here in his top form, highly recommended watch.",9,0,3,25 December 2012
