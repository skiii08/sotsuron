United 93," This movie was about 911 and the events that unfolded during the event
","This was a powerful movie that captured the views of all of those involved in 9/11. I was concerned that this movie would spark additional hate crimes, but found that it provided an accurate depiction of each side of the matter. Itleft me on edge the entire time from feeling anxiety to sadness about the event as a whole. It was interesting that even though I knew the outcome the producers found a way to make the entire film intense,leaving the audience wondering what is going to happen next. As I was watching it was interesting to see what all was going on before I even found out what happened we I would highly recommend for anyone to see this movie!",8,2,5,9 May 2006
