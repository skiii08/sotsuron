Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It actually makes the first film seem bad in comparison (not that it's bad, but you know what I mean)
","I can't believe some people said that this was worse than Kill Bill volume 1. This is honestly much better than the first film. It actually makes the first film seem bad in comparison, not that it is bad but you know what mean. Kill Bill volume one was great. It had a few moment that I didn't like but it was anything but bad. Kill Bill volume 2 hits the spot perfectly. It really summarizes most, if not everything that I look for in a 'good' movie. It has clich√©'s, but that's the point. And they're played out excellently. It has that campy feel to it, a common trade in Tarantino's films. It even has a few 70's kung-fu moments which I just loved seeing. I admire Tarantinos love for classic cinema (or retro might be a better word). This movie unlike the first one has a few funny moments, but still manage to stay serious. And I mean that, it is a serious film. but then again, what revenge movie isn't. And I must say I really loved the ending. It surprised me as well, which is a rare thing to happen. I was sort of moved, or at least intrigued by the ending, and for that I am very happy, because that is such a rare thing.So why is it better than Kill Bill volume 1? Well, I'll it's longer, hence manage to build up a better and more variable story. Secondly, I like the character better,a nd we finally get to see Bill. So I must say, Kill Bill volume 1 serve as an introduction, so Kil Bill volume 1 is what makes Kill Bill volume 2 so much better, because now we know what's going one. And third, if you for any reason should have read my review for Kill Bill volume 1, you would know that I criticized it's violence. I'm not against violence in any way, in fact it is important in many films. This is one of them. Unlike Kill Bill volume 1, Kill Bill volume 2 is not focused on the violence, butt he story. The violence supports the story, not the other way around. I understand Tarantino was trying to make a kind of anime live-action movie, interesting idea, but I felt it was over the top. Think bad of me if you wan't. But this movie, ditch that idea, and I could enjoy the movie, and even it's more violent scenes.So what more can I say? I finished the Kill Bill volume 1 review by saying I'm looking forward to Kill Bill volume 2. Well I love this film. it should be considered a cinematic masterpiece, and is probably already a classic. 10/10.",10,2,4,9 July 2010
Spartacus," Kubrick can turn anything into a masterpiece.
","Considering what little creative freedom Stanley Kubrick had in the making of this film, he sure did make it into a very memorable film. Sure there are certain scenes were I can say 'that is definitely not a Kubrick scene', but at other times one can say 'oh yes, that's a definitely Kubrick scene'. it amused me how kirk Dougles (as Spartacus)first the first director and then hired Kubrick, thinking he could manipulate him. Oh, no, if anything Kubrick manipulated him. it is as Dougles said after the release of this film 'Kubrick is a talented sh@t!', which in it's own way is a way of saying, 'he pisses me off, but he's a damned good director'. And I love seeing what Kubrick can do to a film, on the verge of failing.What more can I say, the cast is excellent. the movie is long, very long! But it serves it's cause. Such an epic can't be told in a mere two hours. And the ending is some of the greatest in all the history of Hollywood epics. I give this film no less than it deserves; a 10/10.",10,4,9,12 April 2010
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A wonderful tribute to the classic Cartoons.
","What can I say, Robert Zemeckis is a master in directing special affect based films.In many movies have we seen real life actor interact with cartoon characters, but no one get's even close to this movie. This movie will make you shake your head and think;'in the the world did they do that?'. Of course today we may detects some minor errors, but still it's a movie far ahead of it's time.Ofrcourse I have to point out, it's not exactly a movie for small children, this is for the adults, and teenager for that sake. The movie has it's obvious PG rating because of it's obvious references to sex, some very mild violence. And let's face it,the movie is about a Toon being framed for murder. Let's just say I wouldn't advice you to show to anyone younger than 10 or 9.The movie takes place in 1947, and is based on the idea, what if Toons were actors rather than just drawings. The Toons work for the film studios in L.A. but live in ToonTown, sort of like a mixture of a ghetto and a magical dimension. Let's just say, Toons don't have the same right as humans, since they're technically just drawings. The story basically is about he Toon Roger Rabbit who is framed for murder, and the private detective Eddie Valiant played by Bob Hoskins, who resent Toons for having killed his brother a few years back, is forced the clear his name. I won't spoil more so I'll just say that.Bob Hoskins interacting with characters that we all know isn't really there is just amazing. And how the Toons interact with the environment is even more stunning. Of course today, when we are used to CGI and such, finding some few mistakes now and then isn't hard. But believe this, after 10 minutes of this film, you'll stop looking, and who cares if there's a few mistakes the film is from 1988, it was way ahead of it's time.So if you're a fan of classic cartoons, or just want laughs and excitement and haven't seen this film; what are you waiting for, buy it, rent it whatever, just see it now. i give this movie a 10/10.",10,0,0,30 November 2009
The Big Lebowski," I don't know. It's funny, but ends in nothing.
","I'm not sure what to think about this movie. The movie is at times funny, very funny, intelligent, artistic. But at other times it is simply, flawed, annoying, silly & stupid. The main character is an interesting character, I liked 'the Dude'. His friend Walter must be the most annoying film character I've ever seen. But he serves his purpose. But then again, you got Buchemis role, he just pops up now and then, never really contributes. The story was good, 'the dudes' struggle was funny. But it just kinda ends up with nothing. I don't know. Some call it the 2001 of bowling and weed smokers, fair enough, it has a few clever trippy moments. But I don't know, it lacks structure. I give it a 7/10.",7,1,3,11 July 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Among the best films of the decade.
","This is one of the best films I've seen in the past years. And for you who haven't seen this film yet, yes it does change history. Apparently the director Qentin Tarantino didn't think the real WW2 was fancy enough, so he spiced it up for this crazy film.Being a Tarantine film it is a little nasty at times. But it's hardly he's most violent film so most adult people should get trough this with no problem. Just don't show it to anyone under at least 15 or 16. Still war is violent and this film reflect on that very well. And it's mostly the Nazis that die so you won't feel that bad.The one unique thing I liked about this movie was it's apparent homage to Sergo Leones 'the man with no name' trilogy. Especially 'the Good, the Bad and the Ugly' which happens to be Quentin Tartinos favourite film, as well as one of mine (I recommend them as well by the way). i think Sergio Leone would be proud of this movie. The dramatic music and the long but not boring scenes make this an unique film which finally goes back to classic film values. To be honest I'm a bit tired of todays film tendency to do everything very fast paced. Another film I think you'd like, which also has had an obvious influence on this film is 'the Dirty Dozen'.The acting in this movie is marvelous. there has been rumours that Christoph Waltz may get an Academy Award for this film, and I really hope he does. The rest of the cast is also great. The character of Brad Pitt is just what I expected for an Tarantino film. brutal but hilarious at the same time. You'll love this film is you like a little black humour.So in conclusion I can't think of anything to give this movie but a 10/10.",10,1,7,19 December 2009
Constantine," Keanu Reeves as a sort of super exorcist, still it's a fun to watch movie.
","My first though when I started to see this movie was; this is some kind of exorcist film. Not quite wrong, but I would call it a super exorcist. A dilemma similar to the whole movie from 1974 called 'the exorcist' was here solved in about 10 minutes and then Keanu Reeves goes of to kill demons, monsters, visit hell and fight angels. Obviously this movie has a lot of Catholic, religious and occult stories mixed together. But it is a fun fantasy movie with an obvious horror film feel to it.Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, has by many critics been called his worst performance, I fail to see why. It's not his best, but I felt he created a very cool and enigmatic character. Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson was just plain good. Shia LaBeouf as Chas Kramer was a good character, which sadly was forgotten in about half the movie and never got the chance to evolve. They should have involved him more into the film or just ditched the whole character. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Satan is just great.The effects like most movies today, are great. What can I say, it's a lot of high budget CGI that creates some really cool demons and monsters.I give this movie a 6/10. Half original idea, good acting, but moved a little slow. Still fun to watch if you like religious based horror films.",6,1,2,29 November 2009
Yes Man," Simple and fun, with a good point to tell.
","It's a simple and fun movie. Jim Carrey is as fun as he usually is, and the supporting characters are good. it's basically about a man who says NO to everything and therefore has a boring life. Then he is inspired to say YES to everything and his life takes a spin. The main question in the film is, is saying yes to everything such a good idea in the long run.This movie is funny and charming, but that's about it. it has a fun point to make and it's entertaining. PS: I wouldn't recommend it as a family film, I mean it's a innocent film but there are a few PG scenes, a swear or two and some slightly odd sexual references. So my verdict are a 6/10.",6,0,0,24 September 2009
The Terminator," I regret waiting so long to see it. A nice start for James Cameron's career, and Arnold Swartzenegger for that sake.
","I regret waiting so long to see it. A nice start for James Cameron's career. And Arnold Swartzenegger career for that sake, although he had made two movies prior to this, but this kinda put him on the 'map'. Also it's cool to see him as the bad guy, and not the invincible hero. i know it's a bit ironic as he is an almost invincible cyborg here, but it fits better for a foe rather than a friend. hero's need to struggle, while the enemy seem almost impossible to kill. It builds up tension, and this movie is packed with it.I don't think I neither need or should tell the plot. it's about a robot trying to prevent a person to be born, so he goes back in time to kill his mother. That's about it, unless you want details, but then I advise you to see the movie instead.The effects are great, especially considering it's budget; US$6.5 million. Not much for Hollywood standards, and it hardly shows. Even though some times the robot is a stop-motion effects, and the terminators's eye looks a little fake, it's nothing you really should bother to point out. It's from 1984, has a small budget, and it's about a cyborg killer, I'm impressed by what James Cameron achieved in this film.I really look forward to see Terminator 2, and sadly I saw the third one first. Seriously skip it, it's horrible. I recommend the two made by James Cameron and that's number 1 & 2. I give this film a 8/10.",8,0,1,5 February 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A little hard to get, but still very funny.
","This is truly an excellent view into both Kubrick's humour and view of the world. The movie is basically about the paranoia and stupidity of both the US and the Soviet. Both try to prevent getting killed by the other, and end up blowing each other up. I think this is the only funny nuclear holocaust film I've ever seen. It's just one problem after another, more prejudice, more stupidity and more paranoia after the other. And Peter Sellers plays excellent as three distinct characters. he's the president of the United States, an British RAF officer, and the rather strange ex-Nazi German scientist; Dr. Strangelove. The special effects can be a little quirky, but you hardly notice. This is the ultimate black comedy, and I give it a 10/10.",10,1,2,11 February 2010
Alien," I give this film credit for the inspiration it has given to so many other movies. But I felt certain things where missing.
","Now as you can see by my rating I did not hate this movie. It has a great story and a really creepy atmosphere. The acting is great and the special effects can not be looked down on.The story is simple, a cargo ship picks up an transmission of alien origin, they land on a planet and find a ship. The ship appears to have been attacked and there a bunch of eggs in the cargo hold or whatever it is. One of the crew; Kane(John Hurt) get's attacked by a thing in the egg that grabs his face. And that's when the nightmare starts. Soon there an vicious alien on board and it's all about survival. Now I'll stop right here.What I liked about he movie was especially the acting, believable and it truly gave the movie it's dark tone. I liked the start of the movie when they found the alien spacecraft, and John Hurt's character got infected by the Alien. But that's where the fun ended slightly for me. From that point on it had some really boring scenes. The scene where Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) went to find the cat, was way to long and killed the suspense. We all knew he where gonna die, and prolonging it was just annoying. The flickering lights in the end was annoying and again ruined the suspense. When you can't see either the main character or the alien, well then it's suddenly nothing scary to see anymore.Still there where many good scenes in the last part of the movie (SPOILER alert) the whole robot ash thing was a really clever and unpredictable part. It came as a shock and the effects where great. But just to complain a little more, why did the ship explode three times? In conclusion, once again, I did not hate this movie, I just feel there where things that could have been avoided. but I like the fact that this film has been an inspiration to many other filmmakers in it's following years. If you like this film I recommend John Carpenter' s'the Thing'.My verdict for this film is 7/10, I was originally considering giving it a 6, but considering the film's great impact i must give it one star more.",7,3,6,7 October 2009
Taxi Driver," A chilling performance by De Niro. And Scorses dark urban masterpiece.
","As the trailer so often says, it's one of the coldest performances you'll ever see. Robert De Niro makes a very terrifying character that you feel could burst at any time. Director Martin Scorsese makes a truly enigmatic main character here. It is New york through a nighttime taxi driver. He sees the worlds dark side, he sees the crime and the corruption, and he's fed up with it. People are shallow and ignore the worlds dark side, and the politicians only give false hope. When he then meets a twelve year old prostitute, he decides to take matters in his own hands.Scorses creates the perfect dark tone for the film, and De Niro completes it with his chilling performance. It's a very blunt film, which isn't afraid of showing us the world as it really is. It's extremely authentic and being a film from the 70's I admire Scorses for the tremendous research he must have done for this film. Pluss he himself have a cameo in the film, as one of the many 'scum of the earth' (as De Niro calls them) that enters our taxi drivers taxi. Also it features one of Jodie Fosters first movie roles.I think the relevance and realism of this film is well summarised in the horrible fact that a man called John Hinckley, Jr. felt so connected to the main character, that he went and attempted to assassinate president Ronald Reagan in 1981.he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. His attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie for the jury.But staying on the subject, this film deserves nothing but a 10/10. And I regret waiting for so long to see it. I recommend this at it's highest, but it's not for the squeamish.",10,0,0,25 May 2010
Barry Lyndon," This truly is 'the forgotten masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick'.
","This really is as people often refer to it, 'the forgotten masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick'. It surprises me that this film has been forgotten and overshadowed by his other films, as it is almost as breathtaking as 2001, and as well crafted as all of his later films. This should, and hopefully is ranking among cinema history's greatest epic films. The only other film of the same genre (and length for that sake), that captivated me as much as this film did, was Coppolas 'The Godfather'. This film deserves to be as revered and commonly know as that film is. It is of course not Kubricks all time greatest motion picture,but should still rank as on of histories greatest motion pictures, as should all of his films be. I cannot recommend this film enough, every frame of this film is like a beautiful 18th century painting, and it's use of music is nothing but stunning.It is a long film indeed, but that only allows us to enjoy more of the film, longer. I would recommend this to any film buff, but I warn you of it's complexity. This is not a film for everyone, definitely not todays film fans who seem more impressed by short, low-brow, action films, will not appreciate this film in a way it deserves. (Ironically this was the reason for it's box-office). However if you don't fall under this category, you will have missed out on a great deal if you have not seen this magnificent film. I give this film nothing less than a full 10/10.",10,2,5,15 August 2010
Watchmen," The story was great, but the filmatisation was not very good.
","I've decided not to rate this film at all. I would personally call it a film that can neither be seen as a success or a failure. The story was great, but the filmatisation was not very good.The story really captivated me, each character represented one of the many sides of the human race, and they all handled the world in they're own way. No ones way was neither the right or the wrong way to do it. And in the end, although you can question they're means of accomplishing it, they succeeded in world peace.The characters were both dark and deep, and they were all different form each other, they were both friends and enemies. The comedian was the dark side of humanity, he realized its true face, and took it with a smile and humour. Rorschack was the bad cop character, he had no mercy for evil, and punished it with they're own brutality. NiteOwl was the good cop, a mixture of Clark Kent and Batman, he was the boy scout, and followed the rules. Dr. Manhattan, was the godlike character, he perceives existence in a different way and he struggles to understand humanity in his new form. And he fails to see if a brutal and corrupt world is worth saving. Silk Spectre, I didn't quite catch, She just seemed to be the person that kept lurking into past events, which eventually led to convincing the Watchmen to reunite. Perhaps she was the consciousness and heart of the story, eventually bringing them all together. Despite good characters and philosophy, I personally didn't think the 'film' itself was any good. I liked '300' but this film was slaughtered by Zack Snyders unique directing. The movie was to focused around violence, gore, sex, and slow motion effects. Not only were several scenes uncomfortable to watch, but all in all it took away the attention from the main story. It had its good moments but I felt it was watered out in an exaggerated attempt to make the film 'cool' and action packed. Maybe a re-cut and a slightly censored version had been better, but the film we have now doesn't give credit to the real story.So I have no rating and I can simply say I liked the Watchmen, but I didn't like the film itself..",Null,1,3,27 August 2009
The Thing," My heart was beating wildly during the whole film. John Carpenter at his best!
","What can I say my heart was beating wildly, this is Sci-Fi horror/thriller at its best. Now I'm usually not to fond of movies in the horror genre, but this was excellent! It's a movie based on Paranoia, the fear for the unknown, and the ultimate fight for survival.The basic plot is that a team of scientist stationed on Antarctica comes across a helicopter with two frantic Norwgians trying for some reason to kill a dog. The team saves the dog and kills the two Norwgians in self defence. Meanwhile they discover that everyone at the Norwegians base, has either died of unknown reasons or killed each other. They had also found a hundred-thousand year old spacecraft in the snow, and apparently dug something up, which was now gone. Later during the night the dog changes into something hideous and grotesque, they kill it, but that's not the end of it. They soon realize that there's an alien that can infest they're bodies and slowly grow inside them, and any one of the the team that has been in contact with the dog, could be the Thing.Im not going to spoil anymore, and i advise you to see this movie, but I warn you this is not for the weak of heart.The effects were excellent, and prove that you don't need CGI to make a good movie monster. The Thing looked so real, and I tell you, CGI would just have made it look fake. And I'll give the man behind the special effects, Rob Bottin ten points just for the Thing. The acting in the movie must not be forgotten either, Kurt Russel as McReady was excellent and couldn't been done better. The fear he and the rest of the crew projected just helped make the film even more horrifying. And lets not forget, this movie proves John Carpenters great skills as a movie maker.So two thumbs up, and I recommend this film for everyone that is a Horror, Sci-fi, or simply a John Carpenter or Kurt Russel fan. This is a must the See film for everyone with the heart for it.",10,0,1,18 August 2009
American Psycho," 'No Introduction Necessary'
","Well I'll do it anyway: Patrick Bateman is an average businessman. He has his suck-up friends, his so-called fianc√©, and an expensive apartment. He is in good shape, he's healthy except for the use of cocaine, and is on a diet. He hates it when somebody has an more expensive or more exclusive version of whatever it is that he has. He loves Phil Collins music. He brings prostitutes to his home. He kills homeless people. He kills the people he hates. He performs violent experiments with women. He IS the American Psycho.This movie went way beyond my expectations. This not a slasher film, although it has the same characteristics. It's about a man living in a shallow life. A life where a man is only worth the sum of his possessions. A life where the exterior and the suit is more important than your personality. And Patrick Bateman handles it in an unusual way. If you have seen the trailer you've seen him with knifes and chainsaws, etc. but this is not all that is to this movie. yes, it is violent and not for the faint of hearth, but it was a lot less gory than I thought. Then again this is a psychological thriller and in many ways that can be almost as scary.Patrick Bateman: 'I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip'. If you're a person who understands complicated films, and you've just read this quote, don't tell me you're not intrigued. Believe me this movie will blow your mind. And just wait 'till the ending, it's amazing.This movie is a 10/10 in my book. If you can handle it, watch it, this is a must see film. And a severely underrated film.",10,0,1,8 January 2010
The Shining," I dare today's directors to do better than this one.
","Seriously, I don't think anyone will ever top this film. I am no longer the slightest surprised over the title of scariest film ever. This is true psychological horror masterpiece. It doesn't go in for cheap scares, overuse of gore and violence, it is just plain scary. Kubrick is a master of symbolics, and in a horror film it is very effective. This films surreal imagery has been copied hundreds of times since this film was released. And you know what they say; imitation is the greatest flatter. I for one love Kubrick's films, and from the looks of it several other directors in the world do too. Also I think it's nice to see that Kubrick can handle the horror genre too, very well I must say.Now before I finish I must say there are some potential disappointments for you. Kubrick and author Stephen King, didn't exactly get very well along. And Kubrick has a tendency to make films his way, even though the story itself isn't his. So for you out there who has read the book, or simply admire Kings work, you might have the same mixed feelings about this film as he did. Sure I think King is proud of being the author of the scariest film of all time, and he certainly earned some on this film, but it wasn't exactly what he had in mind. many of the same elements are in it, but Kubrick has taken many liberties. I for one think it is a great film, and I admire both men's work, and I would recommend this film to Kubrick and King fans alike. I'm just saying, it might not be quite sure what you expected. And if you're a hard ass King fan, you might wan't to check out the 1997 mini TV series. King produces it, and made sure everything went his way.I'm don't think the acting is necessary to mention, it's simply great. Jack Nicholsen is as scary as he'll ever get, and Shelly Duvall really impressed me, despite the fact that Kubrick has some scuffles with her. I think, that in the end, she did great. And of course, let's not forget Danny Lloyd, his only film performance, is nonetheless great.So what is my verdict? 10/10 Of course.",10,0,1,15 March 2010
The Exorcist," A dangerous mix of religion, superstition and movie monsters.
","A dangerous mix of religion, superstition and movie monsters. If you're just in for a good scare this movie is perfect. But all I'm saying is don't take this movie to serious. I admit I'm not a religious guy, I don't mind religions, but this one brings it out in a very confusing way. For the first Exorcism is of course only superstition and movie fantasy, but the religious tie-ins in this movie may confuse you. Also you may have heard from people that this is based on a true story, now of course that is just to scare you a little extra. This movie is nothing but a pure horror movie which uses religious symbols and special effects to scare you. So take my advice when I tell you, don't take this to serious.Now as a horror film, this is brilliant. I'm pretty used to horror movies, and when it surrounds the supernatural it normally don't freak me out. This one did. If you're not used to horror films, don't watch this, you'll not be able to sleep for days. If you already is a fan of horror, I highly recommend it. Don't forget, it was this movie which for the first time presented the monster as a child. It was as creepy then as it is today, and it has became a horror phenomenon.The special effects in this movie is damned good for it's time. Honestly there are sequences I don't think we could have done better today.So if your squeamish stay away from this. But if you like horror, you've missed out if you haven't seen this.",Null,4,6,4 January 2010
District 9," Magnificent! The greatest standout Sci-Fi film of the decade.
","I will start by saying, if you haven't seen this film yet, do so immediately. I won't spoil any of the storyline, I just advice you to see it.Now this movie is set in the present or at least the not to distant future. A alien mother ship hovered over the city of Johannesburg in south Africa and the crew was brought down to the city. the ship was malfunctioning and the aliens who knew how to drive it was either killed or refused to reveal their identity. Soon of course the 'temporary' living areas for the aliens becomes a slum, and can literally be called a ghetto. The movie is shot like it's a documentary and is centered around Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley. now I'm gonna stop here because i don't want to spoil any more.The acting is great, the CGI is amazing. The movie is incredibly realistic and believable. I really don't know what more to say, it just looks amazing. Only warning is that it's a very adult film. it's not your typical action space adventure. it's a bit gritty and dark but that is what makes it so believable. it will evoke emotions but it's no action adventure, but I'm pretty sure you're aware of that.All I can say this movie gets a 10/10 from me.And it is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the decade.",10,1,3,21 November 2009
Ghostbusters," The best Sci-Fi comedy ever made!
","When there's something strange in the neighborhood, who ya gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS! How can you not love this movie? For starters it's written by none other than Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd. Dan Akroyd stars as Ray Stanz the enthusiastic character known as the heart of the Ghostbusters. Bill Murray plays Peter Venkman the parapsychologist with a dry humor and laid back attitude. Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler the brain of the gang. And Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore the voice of reason, and the last person to join the team. The movie is basically about four rather unusual scientist that gets kicked out of the university, and decides to start a business involving ghost catching. Meanwhile they're first customer Dana Berrett gets haunted be a creature called Zuul and the team find themselves in the midst of the return of the demigod Gozer and the awakening of the dead in the city of New York.The characters amateur approach, slime spitting ghosts and a 112 ft. tall Marshmallow man, makes this movie hilarious and a true classic and is a must see for everyone.

Kelly's Heroes," I honestly consider this one of the best films ever made!
","I honestly consider this one of the best films ever made! It's an hilarious and light-hearted movie, which at the same time has a sense of seriousness in it. It has spot on casting and very realistic characters. It is also extremely authentic. In many WW2 movies everything looks to modern or uniforms and vehicles are all wrong, not in this movie! Everything looks the way its supposed to, and we finally have a film very the Germans actually speak German.The story is simple, a bunch of battered out and pi**ed of US soldiers in France, learns that there are 14,000 gold bars in a bank behind enemy lines. When they get three days of leave, and all they're commanding officers are gone. they decide to steal the gold, 'It's the perfect crime'. Kelly (Clint Eastwood)cooks up an ingenious plan how to get were the army hasn't managed to get, and with the help of Oddball (Donald Sutherland) and his three tanks driven by an early age hippies, the race for the gold begins.It's is a funny, realistic and charming piece of film, and it also manage to show the serious side of the war from time to time, without it being to grim. This film is on my top 10 film list, and I advice you all to see this wonderful MUST SEE movie.",10,1,3,5 September 2009

","I'm a very squeamish person, and the irony is that I like horror films. But man, this film is by far the scariest I've ever seen. It's not just creepy or eerie, it's damn right horrifying. So two thumbs up for Sam Raimis horror master piece.Bruce Campbell as Ash is just awesome, and he's kinda the main source behind the appeal to these three films. After having seen some scenes from the third film, Amy of Darkness, I thought Ash would be some kind of handy action hero who isn't particularly scared by anything. Nope, he was pretty scared during the whole movie, and almost survived by pure luck, and some quick thinking. I guess he get's used to the demons in the sequels. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to the sequel.Now this movie was shot on an shockingly low budget, it's shows a little, but it still amazes you what these guys managed to do with almost nothing. The camera work is great, the make up is pretty good, and the effects are pretty decent. I don't know why, but sometimes low budget films are the scariest.Now if you're easily scared, I wouldn't recommend this film for you. if your squeamish, watch it with friends on a bright summer day, turn the volume slightly down, and turn on the subtitles (just in case). Then it shouldn't be so scary. I saw it alone, and it still freaks me out as I am writing this review. PS. it is not directly scary because of gore and such, there are some for sure, but it's the atmosphere that's scary. So for one of the scariest film ever, with few flaws and some bad acting, but still a great original idea, I give this film a 8/10.",8,1,3,22 December 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's 4th film. It's different, but still impressive.
","When I first heard of Kill Bill in 2003, saw the trailer, etc. I though this has to be crap. Just violence, and violence and no structure. then I forgot about it. The a few years later I started looking into Tarantino films. I saw his newest one, Inglorious Basterds, and I though; 'wow, this is pretty good'. It was refreshing to see someone with a unique and classical directing style. Then I saw Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and already I considered him one of the greatest directors ever. Then after having seen Death Proof (not his best by the way) I figured; ' you know what? it's about time I sit down and watch Kill Bill volume 1'. So i sat down and saw it, and these are my thoughts on it.Despite not being the kind of movie I like, I really liked this movie. Okay that sounds weird, but it's how it is. Revenge movies, and Japanese movies, and especially anime is on the bottom of my like list, hate me if you wan't but I fail to see the attraction to it. However, this movie is so well made, I put all of that aside. The tag line 'Tarantino's 4th film' as if it is very relevant, is well placed in it's context. When I saw Reservoir Dogs I though; 'no way this is his first film! It's too good'. He made two more films, and didn't disappoint, so his fourth movie surely had to be a cinematic masterpiece, and I personally think it should qualify as such. It has a visual style both corny and artistic at the same time. He really taps into the heart of a good exploitation film. It is a surprisingly profound movie.But now that I've praised this movie, I guess the complaint should be written down as well. I only have one complaint about this movie, which isn't actually much of a complaint. The violence. And don't get me wrong, I am not against violence in films in any way. inf act I often think it's very important to make a good and shocking film. However I think that there is only one thing that stands int he way of Quentin Tarantino's artistic abilities; he's need for violence. His Grindhouse feature following Kill Bill; Death Proof proved this point. The violence got in the way of the story,a nd the story got less impressive. I understand Tarantino's need to channel his violence ideas through films, but I'm afraid he might go too far one day. this film an example of how that might one day ruing his films.Having set that aside, I give this movie a 9/10, and finish by saying, I really look forward to Kil Bill volume 2.",9,2,5,8 July 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Astounding, disturbing and mind boggling at the same time.
","I must admit Stanley Kubrick films are very hard to write reviews too, because they have so many variables to them. In a Kubrick film there's always more than meets the eye, and I Will admit hat even though I just finished seeing it, I probably missed half the point of the movie. Nevertheless I recommend this film for anyone who like deep and meaning full films. Although it's a little graphic I wouldn't recommend it for the weak at heart. Also if your a Stanley Kubrick fan and you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Go buy it or rent it immediately.What's the movie about? A teenage gang leader who likes rape, ultra violence and Beethoven. Eventually he is caught and put in a prison. he then agrees to a new treatment who supposedly removes everything 'evil' from a person. After a series of torture like and brain washing treatments, every time he tries to commit and act of violence or sexuality, he feels sick. he's released out into the world 'cured', but will he be accepted? And let's just say, few people are fond of him.I really don't know what else to say than that this is a true cinematic masterpiece. It's one of Stanley Kubricks best. I can't think of anything to give it, but a 10/10.",10,1,3,4 December 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Hard to swallow, but a great start for Tarantinos directing career.
","I'm kinda shaky as I'm writing this, seriously the end titles are playing as I'm writing this. And this movie has what is such a rare find these day, a shocking ending. Unless you're used to this kind of films, it's gonna stick to you for a short while. Another thing this film has is a very unique structure. The events are kinda thrown around randomly, they they still feel natural to watch.What more can I say, I'm almost in denial that this was Quentin Tarantinos first film, todays professionals couldn't have made something as professional as this film. I must say, Tarantino never stops surprising me, and he never lets me down like many other directors do. It's a hard to swallow film, but it's necessary to tell such a story.I don't really care, but you might. It's rated R for a reason. Minor SPOILERS if you can't handle people dying from gunshot, I mean real messy, blood and all, and seeing a man who's gotten his ear cut of (it's removed off-screen) then you might wan't to skip this one SPOILER ENDS. It's tough, that's all I'm saying.I'm not sure how to conclude this, I give it a 10/10, that's it, it deserves it.",10,0,0,10 May 2010
Total Recall," Best 90's action based Sci-Fi film I've seen.
","Normally I've never been a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, not that I mind the actor, I've just never liked the type of films he's in. But this is definitely one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger films I've ever seen, he really should stick to Sci-Fi. Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox are always great, but they both always seem to play the bad guys, but they're good at it so why not.I was a little sceptical about this movie although I had decided to see it, but when I say the name Rob Bottin the genius behind the special affects for John Carpenters 'the Thing' (one of my favourite movies by the way)I couldn't wait to see what this movie had in store. And it delivered. For a movie from 1990, the special effects are amazing, maybe slightly dated, but who cares. Also Jerry Goldsmith also known for the Star Trek movies musical scores, just makes this movie even better.The story itself, has so many twists and turns, but is still understandable and it is always filled with action. It keeps you exited and intrigued all the way to the end. Except for having the typical 90's action movie feel to it, with a lot of shooting and explosions much of the time, this movie will please both action and Sci-Fi fans.I give this movie a 10/10.",10,3,7,22 November 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," Well it's Kubrick film, that's for sure.
","This must be THE weirdest film I've ever (or at least American film). In my opinion Kubricks 2001, is understandable in comparison. Now I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because it's a Kubrick film, and I admit that I probably missed the point. Nverteless the acting was great and I liked the character development in the film. The exact meaning of the characters experiences I did NOT get at all. But I'm sure one day I'll see the film again and say: 'aha, now I get it'. that's how 2001 was for me, and I doubt this will be an exception.A little warning for you who are afraid of graphic films. There is a LOT of nudity in this film. Almost to the point of being humorously weird I thought. The main subject of this film is SEX. And for some scenes that's about it. Never before have I seen a film with so much sex, orgy's, full and partial nudity. Why this is in the film I don't know, I'll probably figure that out one day as well.I must say this is not a bad final movie for Kubricks great career. It is as stunning and mysterious and symbolic as all of his movies. And he probably took the answer to this secret to his grave as well, so we may never fully know.",10,2,3,18 December 2009
Pulp Fiction," A powerful and intriguing movie.
","What can I say, Quentin Tarantino changed something in movies. And this and Resoirvor Dogs was the one's that put him on the map. Now I must say this is a harsh movie, it shows stuff that's rarely shown in films, it is also realistic, and heck even funny at times. This is a good definition of a good film. It's well made, it's well written, and it's provocative. It's not the kind of film you turn on on a Saturday night for some fun, but if you like film, you must watch this. But I warn you, it's R rated for a reason. I guess the expression 'can you handle the real world?' really makes sense in this movie. So if your a film buff and you haven't seen this, what are you waiting for? I give this film a 10/10.",10,1,2,10 February 2010
Psycho," Still chilling after all these years.
","This is the mother of all slasher films and that chilling feel that some horror movies have. Instead of straight horror like monsters and ghosts, Psycho makes a physically normal human being more terrifying than any movie monster you've ever seen. What's so scary is that it could have happened, and if I'm not wrong Psycho is based on a true story. This movie is still chilling after all these years.I really wish modern day movie makers would go back to the feel of Hitchcock's movies. There's just something really scary about them. The realism, the acting, the cinematography and the music are just unique. There are few, but still some people who managed to continue the feel of Psycho. Take John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) a knife wielding maniac attacking babysitter at Halloween night. he wears a mask to hide his face and has no human emotions left whatsoever. And take the 2000 film American Psycho, a normally looking businessman who's well liked for his success, performs random violence and gruesome fetish killings at night. I Alfred Hitchcock had still lived i think he would have been very proud of the Psycho legacy.I must admit after years with seeing parodies and hearing references certain scenes of the movie isn't particularly scary anymore. Like the shower scene which has became a bit of a clich√© by now. Nonetheless it's still a unique moment that shocked the audiences in 1960. But I warn you, even though some scenes are a bit outdated, it will still give you a scare. I'm serious I saw 'the Exorcist' with no problem, but this movie freaked me out.This movie deserves attention for it's legacy and it's great actors and of course Hitchcock himself. I give it a 9/10.",9,0,1,7 January 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," You'd be nuts to not consider this one of the best films ever made.
","What can I say it's a masterpiece. It's both funny and it strikes a vital point. As a matter of fact I don't really know how to explain the greatness of this film. i guess the main question is; how do you define insanity? And do we have the right to pretend we're any better? Or for that sake how can we claim to be able to cure mental disease when we have no clue how the brain works. The movie starts with a minor criminal McMurphy (Jack Nicholsen) who pretends to be insane to avoid prison. But as he observes the patients, who by the way becomes his friends, he starts feeling sorry for them, and questioning the doctors means for 'healing' them. Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher), the woman who is supposed to help them, seem to stir up more problems than she fixes them. So he decides to rebel against the doctors and learn the patient how it is to live again and have some fun. Now to prevent myself from spoiling any of this movie I'll stop here.Now of course Jack Nicholsen is not the only who should get credit for this movie, although he's performance is great. Christopher Lloyd as Taber and this film also introduces Brad Dourif in his first film role as Billy Bibbit. And the one character that holds this film together is Will Sampson as Chief the mute and deaf native American who is more than everyone suspects. i must say he was my favourite in this film.So what is my verdict from this film, 10/10 of course. This film is brilliant, I can't recommend this film enough, go out and rent it, buy it or whatever, this movie is a must see for everyone.",10,1,2,11 October 2009
Army of Darkness," I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but I like it!
","I must say this film surprised me. The Evil Dead was one of the creepiest and scariest fantasy horror movies I've ever seen. Evil Dead 2 was also scary but had a little dark humour in it. Army of darkness however, is just pure fun. I don't know why Sam Raimi made it this way, I guess he was tired of making scary movies, but liked the character to much. And let's be honest, Bruce Campbell is awesome, who would want to watch him tackle demons and monsters over and over again.I guess the only thing I didn't like about this movie, was it's lack of continuity. Weapons kinda appeared out of nowhere and Ash never seemed to run out of bullets. but then again it's not exactly a serious movie so maybe they didn't really care. I'm not really complaining, I loved this movie.Although Army of Darkness kinda focuses on slapstick humour, it still fits well into the trilogy. There are still deadits and the Necrocromicon is as annoying as always. They've just tuned down the blood and gore. And since Ash after being beaten up in the two prequels, is mow worthy of the title action here. He knows all their tricks, he's not scared anymore, and let's face it, he's not very afraid of pain anymore. I mean he did cut off his own hand in Evil Dead 2.So Ash is tougher than ever, and the deadits are quite that scary when your not trapped in an small cabin anymore. For it's minor flaws and hilarious story, I give this movie an 8/10.",8,2,3,24 December 2009
Halloween," A babysitter killer with a William Shatner mask, sure why not.
","before I saw this film I had seen almost all of john Carpenter's films and heard a lot of great reviews about his film. And I must admit it was a good Halloween type film, but not as magnificent as everyone made it sound like. Sure it is a scary film with an incredible eerie atmosphere, but I felt very little happened at the same time. Many say it's Carpenters best, I disagree, yet it's far from his worst in my opinion. Also I remembered that it was among his first, so I took that in consideration too.The movie starts with a young boy called Michael Meyers who murders his babysitter with a kitchen knife at Halloween. About 15 years later he escapes from the mental asylum and the doctor (Donald Pleasance) who had been in charge for him ever since the murder sets out to find him and kill him. He considers the boy pure evil, and won't let him live to commit any more murders. And of course the night Meyers return to his home town, it's no other night than Halloween. he takes an interest in three babysitters (Jamie lee Curtis as one of them) and sets out to kill them one by on at Halloween night. now I'll stop here and let you figure out the rest.I liked Michael Meyers costume, a William Shatner Halloween mask painted white looked surprisingly soulless and evil. And Jamie Lee Curtis was truly amazing considering that this was her debut film. What I didn't like about the film was the cheesiness of it, I mean how hard can it be too stab a frightened college student. one time he jumps up behind her with his knife held up, and he misses her with like a whole meter while she sits perfectly still in the couch. not to mention the time when he comes up behind her , aims at her back, and only manages cut her blouse and give her a little cut in her arm. but then again, they needed to build up the suspense and let her escape all of his attacks. oh, and before I sum this up, the music score was very cool.Now if your a horror fan this is a must see for all of you who likes suspense and fright (70's style of course)but if you you're a gore fan you won't find any in this movie. And if you're a john Carpenter fan this is definitely a must see film. I personally give this film a 7/10.",7,0,1,10 October 2009
Paths of Glory," To make something so blunt in 1957 is an achievement in itself.
","This movie could be summarised in three words: 'Kubricks first masterpiece'. this movie deserve 10 stars just for having been made in 1957. this movie is an blunt depicting of war and a direct attack at the potential fascism in a government. The war scenes are extremely authentic, and really shows us the horror of the so called 'trench war'. the movie is both moving and provocative. Trust me you will be moved by the last scene, I sure did. if you're a Kubrick fan you must see this film. this is the one that literally put him on the map. Then again I advice any one to see this film. You just cannot miss this one. It would be a crime to give this any less than a 10/10.",10,0,1,3 March 2010
Blade Runner," A deep, and intriguing Sci-Fi film. Still stunning after all these years.
","Due to the complexity of this film, and it's many different versions, I've .... watching this film for a long time. Now that director Ridley Scott have released the final cut and I felt I had a better understanding of films, I decided to see it. Well it's well worth the wait, and If you haven't seen it, well what are you waiting for? This movie has earned a place among the top 10 Sci-Fi films of all time, and I understand why. Like most movies from the 80's based on earth future, it has a very unique and of course wrong impression of the coming future. Some of the technology is too good, and some still looks like the 80's. But that doesn't matter, it the story that important in Blade Runner. I'm not really gonna spoil anything, but it's very deep story with many interesting parallels. Since the movie is about artificial humans it's no wonder people have said that there are religious analogy's in this film. It I would at least say that it's not impossible. There are many hidden symbols in this film, and much that I still don't understand. And this is definitely a film that must be viewed many times, before you fully understands it.I must say I was impressed by seeing Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard. Since this movie is from 1982, Harrison Ford made this between the shooting of Star Wars the empire strikes back and return of the Jedi. And still Ford brings us one of his strongest performances ever. Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty is definitely a scene stealer, as he brings us a chilling performance, as well as a character we emphasize with. Daryl Hannah & Edward James Olmos as Pris and Gaff are two of the most enigmatic characters I've ever seen in film.A lot of the credit should go to Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples for this brilliant screenplay. And Ridely Scott made sure it was handled the right way. If you're a Sci-Fi fan or like deep and meaningful films, you have missed a lot if you haven't seen this film.I give this film no other rating than a 10/10.",10,0,3,31 December 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Nancy kick ass! Finally a character who fights back.
","Nancy kick ass! Finally a character who fights back! I am so tired of horror film where everyone dies at the end and all that really happens is that they get massacred. The main character in this movie: Nancy Thompson deserves the title heroine in my opinion. There are few good horror movies where people fight back and this is one of them.Being a big fan of John Carpenter I felt Wes Cravens film where worth checking out, and so far I'm not disappointed. i think most of you 70's and 80's horror fans noticed the same thing like me; this kinda reminds me of John Carpenters 'Halloween'. The lead role is a few years younger and Michael Meyers is replaced with Freddy Krueger an equally creepy bogeyman-ish character.Of course like all horror movies is write reviews about I note that these are not for the faint of heart. It scared the hell out of me, that's for sure. And it may freak you out even more, I just wan't to make clear it's R rated for a reason, so don't show to anyone under 13 or 14 (it's not that bad, just don't show it to a child).PS.MINOR SPOILERS: You may be a little confused at the end, but remember, it's just a dream. (And Nancy is in the 3 movie so she's fine) SPOILER ENDS.So for a great horror film, with a heroine that kicks ass, I give this movie a 10/10.",10,9,11,21 December 2009
Jackie Brown," Simple but very good.
","Compared to Tarantinos other movies (and yes I've seen all of them) this is not the best one, in fact I would consider it his second least good. However, that doesn't mean that it's a bad film in any way. On the contrary, it's a damn good movie. Sure the story is very simple, it's a heist movie on a very realistic and small level. yet the directing is still better than that of most films. It's a surprisingly long film, two and a half hours, but never a dull moment. So I really don't have more to say, I recommend it. heck, if you're afraid of Tarantino films because of his reputation for violence, relax you can watch this one, except for quite an amount of swearing (which you'll hardly notice) there nothing nasty in it. Pluss if you like this film, which I bet you will, hopefully it will make you wanna see more Tarantino films.I give Jackie Brown a 8/10.",8,0,2,10 July 2010
Moon," A rare Jewel in modern Sci-Fi drama. One of the best film of the decade.
","This movie is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen the last decade. I can't help but feel that the movies in the genre hasn't been to good this decade. Honestly there has been so few good Sci-Fi films lately I have only been able to enjoy the classics. But 'Moon' proves that the genre isn't dead at all. This movie will definitely be considered a Sci-Fi classic in the future and won't be forgotten.Also this movie had a very low budget, but it doesn't show at all. Also you'll eventually realize there are very few actor in it. Which also makes the movie impressive if you think about it. i was also very impressed when I realized that this movie has very little CGI. All the scenes with the moon base or the lunar rovers, are in fact models. It's great to see the good old ways in a modern film. it also proves that models can be better than CGI if handled properly.And of course Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey as Gerdy is just amazing. And what a great start for Duncan Jones who apparently is new in the director business.I won't spoil the story, the IMDb synopsis speak for itself. But honestly don't read it, just watch the movie, its great.This is among the best movies of the decade, it has a classic feel to it, and is still modern. I can't think of anything to give this movie but a 10/10.",10,3,6,30 October 2009
Back to the Future," Movies don't get much better than this.
","Of course it's not the most serious or deep movie in the world, but it's 1 hour and 48 minutes of pure fun and excitement. This movie was a a classic when it was new, and it has dated well. Even people who don't like old films have both seen and loves this movie. The acting and casting is spot on, the effects are revolutionizing for it's time and the story is brilliant, not very logical but who cares.Michael J. Fox is great as Mary McFly and Christopher Lloyd is at his best in the role as the quirky but genius Doc Brown. And the rest of the cast is just great especially Thomas F. Wilson as Biff who we get to see more of in the two sequels.I really don't think I need to give you a synopsis, if you're one of those who haven't seen this film, just read the IMDb synopsis. but don't bother just watch the film.This movie is exiting and hilariously funny, this is a movie perfect for anyone. It doesn't matter what kind of movie genre you like it's hard not to like this film. I'm not quite sure what more I can say but; if you haven't seen it, Watch it now! Buy it, rent it, download it, whatever just see it. And don't forget it's a trilogy. I can't recommend this film enough. I give it a 10/10.",10,1,1,15 November 2009
The Birds," You'll never see another film were simple birds will be so scary.
","Once again a true masterpiece by Hitchcock, it starts of very simple and easy and becomes non-stopping chills and thrills towards the end. Seriously you'll never see another film were something as simple as birds will be so scary.It's not much to say about why the birds attack, they simply do. And a small fishing town has to pay for it. I liked how birds were always in the picture, but they gradually became more and more violent, until the end were the horizon is literally covered with them. To a very, very minor degree it reminded me of the classic Living Dead films, except they're trapped by birds not zombies. but believe me, it's still very scary. Well maybe more chilling by todays standard, but it will keep you locked in your chairs to the end.The main cast is great, including Tippie Hedren in her first movie role. Also i was surprised to see a very young Veronica Cartwright also known for Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. i bet this is the film who set her on the horror movie 'map', even though Birds is technically a thriller.What can I say, Hitchcock does it again. it almost stands up to Psycho. I never thought birds in general could the 'villain' of a film, but Hitchcock did it. I give this movie a 9/10.",9,3,5,4 February 2010
Evil Dead II," A weird sequel, but nonetheless awesome to watch. Kiss your nerves goodbye.
","I will start with a common question regarding this movie; is it a sequel or remake? Well it's sort of both. Having seen the previous film helps, but isn't really necessary. The director Sam Raimi claims that is is a sequel, and that the differences between the first movie and Evil Dead 2 'flashbacks' is because of ownership rights to the scenes from the prequel which lead to them having to re-shoot them. In my opinion the differences is so extreme that it should qualify as a remake. But nonetheless Evil Dead 2 continues the story of the first movie.Now this movie is definitely a bit of a clich√©, but that's what makes it so great. Imitating it's predecessor in so many ways, evil dead, living trees, demons, chainsaws, it's simply a very enjoyable horror film. Alos where the first one may have left you feel a little uncomfortable, this movie makes you feel better with it's more humorous tone. I actually think they made a little fun of themselves making this movie. And what more can I say about Bruce Campbell, than that he's awesome. In the first movie he spent most of the time freaking out and surviving almost on pure luck. In this one however, he's merciless. He grabs a chainsaw, a shotgun, says 'Groovy' for some reason, and kicks ass. The thing that makes the Evil dead trilogy some memorable is definitely Bruce Campbell himself.Once again I feel I've got to mention, this movie is R rated for a reason. It's not as gory as the first one, and as I mentioned it a little funnier than the first one. So just don't show it to any kids, I would say anyone over 13 or 14 could get through it as long as they got the nerves for it. The movies tag-line was 'kiss your nerves goodbye', and their not holding back.So for this hilarious and nerve wrecking horror masterpiece I give a 10/10.",10,2,3,24 December 2009
The Godfather," Why don't they make films like this anymore?
","Why don't they make films like this anymore? This is what movies should be. Sure, they don't have to be this long, but 99% of todays movies are pretty weak compared to this. It's funny actually, I knew this was one of the most famous classics before I saw it. I knew it is considered among the top 10 films almost everywhere. Yet everyone I know has either referred to it as the most boring film in history or never even bothered to finish it. Now that I've seen it I can't help but think, what a pity. Today we are given so much garbage, that when a real film comes along, we are suddenly confused. We don't understand it, we miss the points, and we fail to see the subtext in it. It saddens me that that is what the film business has become, when we fail to see a masterpiece when it comes along. Francis Ford Coppola made a timeless film with the godfather, and he should rank among the top ten, no the top five directors of all time. Stanley Kubrick once said: 'Coppola sure got it right with The Godfather'. And I dare todays director to 'get it right' in the future.I give this film a 10/10.",10,1,4,8 June 2010
