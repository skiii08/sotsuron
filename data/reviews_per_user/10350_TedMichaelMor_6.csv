Vertigo," Revealing Nightmare
","Hitchcock's nightmare vision of the deadening influence of male desire on women's lives haunts imagination. Wendy Lesser wrote one of several insightful feminist evaluations of this masterwork that stress the immense power and honesty of the director's work here. Hitchcock commented precisely on the nature of the narrative.For many years, I listed this on my top ten list of films. It belongs there at least as much as any one of seven of the films I presently note belongs there.Taking the plot too literally and demanding much sense from it undermine the nightmare quality—this is a dream experience, a bad dream experience, an awful dream, but one that is true. I first saw it when I was 15-years-old. Now, I am 67-years-old. The film still informs my sense of romance and sexuality.I have opinions about the restoration but they do not concern me profoundly. I do tend to embrace the restoration, but the questions are valid.",10,1,4,19 June 2010
No Country for Old Men," 'If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?'
","Sometimes a movie just works. It is tensive and multiple dimensional. It appeals on many levels. Whether it edifies seems not to matter. Whether it improves my character seems not to matter. In some ways, I doubt that I even like the films of Joel and Ethan Coen. I do not go out of my way to watch their movies. When I do watch them, the films captivate me, at least for the time I watch them, but also they linger on the mental palate with vivid images and verbal memories.'No Country for Old Men' has a script that almost seems too good, too literate, and too clever for my good, if not for the sake of the movie itself. I suppose that this is a cynical and brutal story, but somehow it just does not seem, in the end, sarcastic and scornful.For whatever reason, this flick recalls 'Pulp Fiction', another enjoyable iconoclastic movie that it seems to resemble. Notice that I use the qualifier 'seems' often in this summary. I do because 'No Country for Old Men' has an indefinite, almost indeterminate tone.The minimalist Carter Burwell score has an indefinite, indeterminate quality. Cinematographer Roger Deakins modulates his styles as a jazz artist might with a score. Here he transposes Western icons from one range to another. The brothers themselves edited the film. They are simply geniuses. This is a well narrated movie—like 'Pulp Fiction'. Talking about any aspect of this movie necessarily involves dealing with other aspects. For example, the iconic use Javier Bardem involves plotting, cinematography (for example, framing and lens choice), editing, and dialogue.The Coen brothers do not seem as serious as Antonioni, but their work reminds me of the classic body of work the Italian director created. I tend to undervalue Tarantino's body of work (I admit that) and the Coen brothers might seem too much like him in their creative effort, but somehow their work haunts me a tad more than Mr. Tarantino's work does. This is just an opinion, a highly personal one that I cannot defend.",10,4,7,24 July 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Haunting
","Visually, '2001' haunts imagination. The special effects and scientific realism ground the unique iconography of this singular film.Nevertheless, either '2001' is one of the greatest films I have seen or a trivial failure. My prejudice is for the first option. The one element that counters this judgement is the notion that the monolith somehow shaped evolutionary emergence. That distracts from an otherwise flawless film narrative. If one puts the monolith aside, the film narrative and iconography are highly tensive open to polyvalent interpretations and experiences.Director Kubrick reveals how we hypnotize ourselves with technics that are in essence projections of our evolved nature. One manifestation of such technics is artificial intelligence and the nature of what is human. By some sort of legerdemain, Mr. Kubrick makes us feel pity for 'the death' or shutting down of a computer more than we felt for the death of human beings. Realising this is chilling. My favourite moment in the movie is a slight facial movement of a pilot of the space station to moon space ship as it is about to land. I do think that this film is sexist. Layers of symbol and surrealistic play enrich multiple viewings. Members of the department of philosophy at my old school, I have heard, dismissed classes to discuss meanings of this film. I think it unfair to compare too closely this film with the equally haunting 'Blade Runner'. They are parallel tracks. With the exception I made, '2001' remains a coherent work--a masterwork.",10,2,5,11 June 2010
Pulp Fiction," Wonderful Film
","'Pulp Fiction' is a remarkable movie. Watching it multiple times, I take pleasure in its mischievous exploitation of tropes as well as many other playful traits. I enjoyed calling it a great Lutheran movie—as I did for many years. There is a theological core to the narrative.The sister of a former friend deeply disparaged this movie to me. She felt it is pretentious with a celebration of decadence. I think she overreacted.The grace of the film emerges in expression of the clear love of cinema embodied here. I feel indebted to Quentin Tarantino for writing, directing, and acting. I deeply admire the superb and enchanting cinematography by Andrzej Sekuła. The work of co-writer Robert Avary is clearly vital. Sally Menke's insightful and gracious editing might be the most important component though here everything works.This film deserved careful viewing and critical analysis. The cast is one of the best ever assembled for any film. There is no false note anywhere in casting. I particularly enjoy watching 'Ving' Rhames though pointing out any actor over another here seem unfair. The same goes for favoring any sequence in the movie, but I do love 'the Bonnie situation'.Those who finally financed this masterwork showed great artistic sense. We are in their debt. In particular, one somehow knows that Quentin Tarantino is the single most important genius behind this work. His touch is everywhere. The dialogue stays with one long after initial viewing.",9,2,5,1 July 2010
Jaws," A Summer Outing
","To see how gifted Steven Spielberg is simply watch the second film in the 'Jaws' franchise, a fairly entertaining movie. I do not know how he maintain such faultless narratives; I have never analysed his film closely, but watching them I have a sense that nothing too much is ever there andnothing too little is left out. In a sense, I do not want to learn too much. I simply enjoy his work.I appreciate that, though his kind of film making might have undermined the making of small films, Mr. Spielberg has always been conscientious about celebrating good movies. The interplay of simply effects (or simply looking effects) such as the classic line, 'You're going to need a bigger boat.' I am not profoundly impressed with some reviews and analysis of this film, though some ideological criticism amuses me. Again, I avoid too much analysis here. The finale of the movie with two protagonists swimming in from the sea has a lightness of tone and humour that crowns a splendid summer outing. I had not seen the film until now (2012).",10,1,4,1 March 2012
Windtalkers," Almost Awful: Not Really Worth Viewing
","Nicholas Cage like Ruth Gordon plays one role repetitively. He is no Sean Penn. Ostensively about Native Americans using their native languages as code during the battle for the Pacific during the Second World War, this John Woo film instead fruitlessly exploits exhausted war film clichés. Writers John Rice and John Batteer seem not to have taken interest in the Navaho code-talkers. Too bad that they did not because that theme intrigues me.As usual, John Woo choreographs elaborate action sequences. No one does that better than he does, even Spielberg—I suppose, but the battle scenes seem unremittingly implausible.Editing by Jeff Gullo, Steven Kemper, and Tom Rolf is professional but unable to undo the essential phoniness of the script and direction. Photography by Jeffrey Kimball is similarly wasted effort. James Horner's musical score is lovely but again wasted on a bad movie.",2,0,1,11 July 2010
