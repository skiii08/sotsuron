Alien 3," A turning point in my life
","I hate this movie. I really liked the Alien franchise until I saw this and now I'll always be a little sad and disappointed thinking about anything having to do with it. This movie was the first time (age 22) it really occurred to me that Hollywood could just suck, that big-time filmmakers could just be clueless nobodies.They killed Newt! All of the characters are depressing losers! How could you think of making a movie where not one character experiences a single moment the audience can identify with? Why would anyone want to spend that much time watching scenes of brutal violence that lead to no happiness whatsoever? These are questions I will never bother to seek answers for.The only positive thing about this move is that it gives me the opportunity to write the easiest review I could ever write.",1,2,3,16 August 2019
