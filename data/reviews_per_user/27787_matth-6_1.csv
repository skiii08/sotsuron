Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but not what it could have been!
","As much as I hate to admit it, I fall under the column of a 'Star Wars geek'. Not the kind that brings a light saber to the movie, or has his wife do her hair up in the princess Leia cinnamon buns, but more of a collector of books and toys. But being and having 'Star Wars geeks' for friends, does have it's advantages, like there will always be someone willing enough to stand in line all day for opening night (12:01 a.m.) tickets.Liam Neeson could have at least looked at the area where the computer generated characters were supposed to be. 'At a boy, Liam!!!  And way too much is put in to the character of Jar Jar Binks.  The first half of the film you can't understand what he is saying, and the second half you just don't care!  Once again, like in ROJ, (Lando), a useless character is put in charge of the rebellion's military??? Jar Jar, who was banished from his underwater city for being clumsy, is made in to a General and put in charge of the Gungan ground forces, during the climatic battle scene.And what's the deal with the 'Immaculate Conception' of Anakin Skywalker??? People actually cheered, when Anakin wins the pod race???  PEOPLE, of course he wins, he ends up being Darth Vader in volumes 4, 5, & 6!!! If he lost, there goes 22 years wasted!!! I'll be honest, as sci-fi movies go, it is above the norm. Even though the story drags in spots, you have to give it a chance. Just sit back and appreciate the special effects. Remember twenty years ago, Star Wars got panned by all the critics and look what happened.  In closing, every Star Wars fan or 'geek' if you will, is obligated to see this movie.  But when you do see it, try to view it with a fresh mind, and definitely not through your Hasbro Jedi goggles MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!",Null,0,1,19 May 1999
