Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant, deep and provocative.
","This movie works on so many levels. I must first say that I am proud of Jared Leto for taking after Brad Pitt and NOT using his looks to go in stupid teeny boppy movies. The cast was brilliant in this movie, I hope Ellen Burstyn gets an Oscar because she was fantastic. Now as for the directing, what can I say but magical. He set tones very effectively, he built us up then watched us fall. The camera work is so entertaining as well, all the little drug taking sequences are quite nice. What I loved most was, when I the movie was over and the lights came on, I turned and looked at the audience and saw that all these people's jaw's were dropped. They were stunned! Please watch this movie, show your kids as well, they won't want to touch drugs after they see it. 10!",10,0,0,2 February 2001
Fight Club," WOW
","there is a lot to learn from this movie, at face value it seems like a silly movie about guys who fight, HELL NO. It is very philosophical! I love everything about this movie! Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are two of the best actors today, and Fincher has proven his directing magic once again. If you were a little confused after you watched it, watch it again, its more entertaining every time you see it! Also, notice how Brad Pitt's character Tyler fights like Bruce Lee at the end fight with Ed Norton's character. 10!",10,0,1,12 July 2000
X-Men," DON'T BOTHER, just read the comics or watch the cartoon
","Read the summary, it is true. When I first saw glimpses of this movie, my anticipation turned into concern. A lot of the things that made Xmen what they are were disregarded. I liked their yellow uniforms, and they had to make fun of them? So now superman can't wear his get up? Wolverine isn't that tall either, and his claws don't come out from there. Now the movie was somewhat entertaining, nice special effects, but the story was quite mediocre. And there wasn't a good use of bad guys. Sabretooth has nothing to do with magneto either, I can go on and on, my conclusion is, you'll get more entertainment out of one comic/cartoon episode, at least they are more frequently available, look how long you have to wait for the X men sequels. WASTE!!",4,0,0,7 August 2000
Snatch," BRILLIANT!!!!!
","Who on earth gave this a '1' rating, they're insane! This movie was funny, clever, magically shot, dark, sad... It was just excellent. Guy Ritchie is so original in how he tells his stories. What I really loved is that there is climax literally all through the movie will plenty of twists and turns. Even up until the last minute there is something still up in the air for you to guess, and you will more than likely guess wrong. All the cast was great, there were so many characters that could've done so much but it was just right. Brad Pitt, well all I can say that he is very under rated, perhaps his looks are a curse, like me. Please watch this movie.",10,0,1,3 November 2000
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best movies? Pfft!
","Everyone tells me how good this movie is, I was so excited when I went to watch it. Hmm, it was so sub par! I mean, everyone says, 'oh my god, that beach battle scene is so good, it's so realistic!' First of all, how do you know it's realistic? Oh that's right, everyone has been to war! And since when do you judge a movie in accordance with its special effects? Does that mean Matrix is the best movie ever? (I love the matrix, I am just making a point). In actuality, this movie was VERY boring. Also, the way in which the beach scene was shot was no clever, it was stupid and annoying. If they're going to show the scene, I don't care to be in the shoes of the soldier if I'm not going to be able to see what was going on. If the camera needs to be in 1st person, keep it there. To change around was so unprofessional. That scene was a little entertaining when it wasn't annoying, the gore was cool. But I am a gore enthusiast so it doesn't make sense. The rest of the movie was anti climatic and boring.",3,1,2,29 October 2000
Saving Private Ryan," the most over rated movie of all time
","OK, I sat down to watch this movie and I was quite pleased with that battle scene. I mean, great special effects, original camera work, lots of gore... BUT THAT'S IT! After that, the movie got soooo boring, not to mention cheesy (typical of the 'director'). Mr Speilberg, if that is your real name, please give us another 'goonies' and do what you did the first time and DON'T direct it! SO SO SO BORING! All this movie needed was to be shot in black and white. Hang on a minute...",3,1,3,8 March 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," EXCELLENT!
","Hello. I would like to tell you about a very good film. It is called crouching tiger, hidden dragon. Even though I don't know why it is titled that, I know that it is a masterpiece! Round of applause to the director and cast. The fighting scenes are spectacular. All I can really say is, go and watch this amazingly amazing movie. The chick who plays Jen is a babe!",10,0,0,24 January 2001
Good Will Hunting," Titanic got best picture?!
","It is ever so apparent that James Cameron bought his oscar, but had he not had paid out the academy, this film would've surely recieved the so called greatest accolade. This film is so moving, Ben and Mat have put together a magnificient story which can only be described as genius (no pun intended). I don't know what else to say but watch this movie. It is more of an experience than just a 'movie'. It is absolutely brilliant!",10,1,4,23 October 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," DON'T ASK ABOUT MOVIE, JUST WATCH IT
","if anyone talks about this movie, RUN! Just rent/buy this movie and watch it. If anyone tells you about this movie that may very easily spoil it for you. Just think of it this way, Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay, and he doesn't disappoint! This movie will freak the hell out of you!",10,0,0,3 October 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Genius
","I love that crazy Kubrick! This movie is so well made, it is brought to the screen so magically! What do you expect from good ole Stan? He, along with Anthony Burgess the writer of the novel, are SOOOO ahead of their time, I face in their direction and clap wildly! Could anyone have made Alex more sinister yet jolly? And the music, well I needn't comment on how brilliantly Kubrick utilises sound in his films.",10,0,0,17 July 2000
Pulp Fiction," ahh the dialogue
","This is my favourite movie, well one of them anyway. This movie was not given any glory by hollywood, who cares, he won cannes!! I really love the dialogue in this movie, well, moreso I'd say the script, how everyone moves, reacts and the things they all say will keep you laughing through the whole film, this movie, even though its nearly 3 hours, FLIES by so gracefully, a true cinematic masterpiece!! I LOVE QT",10,1,2,17 July 2000
Titanic," PFFT!! OVER RATED!!!
","Seriously, this could not have made that much money, it is one of the worst movies I have seen, not the worst though. It is VERY over rated though. There isn't much to this movie, and story line is sooooo corny. Rose DeWitt Bukater, Kate Winslet's character is to me, a floozy! The only good part was when they were all dying, that was funny. Otherwise, this isn't a romantic movie, Romeo and Juliet, even though they both die is romantic, but this is not. It is an exploitation of the titanic disaster, and that is it. Want to watch a real movie, watch American Beauty, or Pulp Fiction, or Eyes Wide Shut, or The Good The Bad and The Ugly.",1,5,10,6 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," deary me
","it is not often that a movie has a physical effect on me, I watch this movie 3 times at the cinema and each time the plot unfolded, I got a wrenching twist in my gut!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Haley acted really well, Bruce did better than usual and oh my, Toni Collette, give that women a clap, did you know she is an aussie? (Murial's Wedding) Well, I won't spoil the ending by telling you that Bruce's Willis' character is a ghost, just watch and see for yourself. My fave movie of 1999 (along with eyes wide shut)",10,0,0,17 July 2000
