The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Redefine the new standard of a ripoff movie
","The movie goes so slow you can pretty much skip this one and go straight to Part 2. The whole movie can easily finish in 20 minutes. 15 minutes into the movie you can tell there is something fishy about the pace. I like Jennifer Lawrence but this movie warns me from jumping into watching her movie next time. Pretty much all the reviews about the slow pace, set up for pt 2, boring, poor acting are true.you can easily tell a few screens repeat for no particular reasons. The number of exciting screens are very limited. I give 6 stars for the movie and minus one star for grossly deferring content to Part 2.",5,16,22,14 March 2015
