Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Truly brilliant
","Kill Bill Volume 1: **** Kill Bill Vol. 2: **** Kill Bill as a whole: One of the top 20 movies of all timeBoth movies are easily four star movies.  They are brilliant.  However, what each one lacks, the other makes up for.  Examples: In volume 1, there was no character development.   That was made up for in volume 2.  In volume 2 there wasn't non-stop action sequences.  In volume 1, there was.  In volume 1, however, there was hardly any of that brilliant dialogue.  That is made up for entirely in volume 2.When you combined the 2 movies together and make them one (which by the way they were originally intended to be) then you have an amazing movie. People say that the styles are way too different to be one movie.  I don't think so.  Tarantino has done something truly original here.  In his last movie before the Kill Bill saga, Jackie Brown, he spent the first half of the movie developing characters and just letting them talk.  In result, it was much slower in the first half of the movie.  With Kill Bill, Vol. 2 he develops the charactes in the *second* half of the movie.
Standing alone, Vol. 2 works as it's own movie.  It is probably the best movie you'll see this year.  It has everything: dialogue, action, great characters (Budd, Bill, and the Bride come to mind) and a great ending. With Vol. 1, it is not only the best movie of the year, it just may be the best movie of the decade.",10,1,2,23 April 2004
