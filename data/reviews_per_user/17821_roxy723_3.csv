The Ring," Ugh, I want my two hours back.
","I am honestly confused when I read these other comments.  I did not find the movie scary, nor did I find it remotely interesting.  I went into the theater thinking I was going to be scared, and to be honest, was almost too afraid to go see it.  Every review I read comments on how scary and disturbing this movie was.  I wasn't scared ONCE throughout the movie's entirety.  I didn't find the plot to be intriguing, and I felt it left a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Certain potentially scary elements were thrown at the audience and never returned to.  The Sixth Sense was far scarier.  I don't know though, because everyone in the theater and everyone else who saw it aside from my friend and I thought it was extremely scary. Maybe we fell asleep in the middle of it or something...",3,0,0,27 October 2002
Fight Club," Wow.
","This was one of the most disturbing movies I have seen...and I loved it! The plot was twisted, the acting wonderful, and the film as a whole is one of my favorites.  Perhaps the best thing about the movie is you don't stop thinking about it when it's over.  The movie ends and you're just like, 'Wow.'",10,0,1,30 November 2002
Memento," One word...wow.
","Never in my life have I been so drawn into a movie.  I started watching this film at about 2am, planning on falling asleep, but at 3am I sat on the edge of my couch, waiting excitedly to see what would happen next.  This movie is filled with shock, and many times during the film I found myself saying, 'whoa!'.  It was beautifully acted and filled with suspense.  I didn't find it very confusing, but a lot of other people say that is their big complain about the movie.  It definitely is worthy of its spot on your top ten list.",10,0,2,27 October 2002
