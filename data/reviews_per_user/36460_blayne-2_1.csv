The Blair Witch Project," Weak.
","One word sums up this movie: WEAK.If you are anticipating a scary movie, you will be vastly disappointed. Except for the last 5 seconds, the movie was totally without anything scary. The movie spent a boring hour and a half building up for this final moment. Through this, some audience members were rewarded with motion sickness due to the actors inability to hold a camera without having violent shaking fits.  These audience members did not only go home disappointed, but they had a whopping headache as well.  Those of us who were lucky enough not to be affected by the shaking actors, got to enjoy watching 3 idiots wander around the woods because nary a one could read a compass or a map.  The only remotely entertaining part of the movie was watching the actors argue over who is to blame for their situation.",1,2,3,6 August 1999
