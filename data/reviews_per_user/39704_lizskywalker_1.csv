Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great
","This movie was absolutly terrific. It doesn't measure up to Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back, but it gives them a run for their money. This movie takes place approx. 35 years before A New Hope and tells how Anakin came to become a Jedi.",2,0,1,15 February 2000
