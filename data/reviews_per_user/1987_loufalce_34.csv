The Blair Witch Project," In Plain English, This Movie Is Garbage
","Zero stars. An amateurishly shot cheaper than shoestring budget non-movie about three ultra obnoxious film students looking in the woods for a witch that may-or may not exist. That whiney girl with the group is possibly the worst no-talent 'actress' to grace the screen since Pia Zadora. No thrills, no suspense, no real story, just a terrible idea for a film that dies in its own pretensions. These characters are so unlikable that you will be rooting for the witch! Avoid it like the Black Death- unless you can stomach these spoiled, obnoxious and vapid characters.This drivel inspired a sequel-Blair Witch 2- Book of Shadows. This review applies. These films are so rotten, they aren't even good for laughs. You just got 2 reviews for the price of one. Ding dong, the witch is dead!",1,2,6,11 February 2008
Scarface," A thoroughly repellent piece of cinematic garbage
","Zero stars. Ultra violent violence for the sake of violence semi remake of a great classic. This film stigmatizes Cuban- Americans so much that left wing Castro loving screenwritter Oliver Stone owes them an apology. Pacino is good in the title role- but his performance is too difficult to take. Bloodshed, murders,killings, cocaine in a three hour gore fest. This one is bloodier than average 'splatter' film. I guess there is a certain audience for this swill- prehaps a sociopath who cheered for 'Columbine' who would want to see it over and over again. Has absolutely no redeeming social values whatsoever. It only glorifies the thugs who will stop at nothing-and kill anybody to pollute the streets of our country with these vile drugs. To call this a waste of time is to glorify it. To call it a piece of -hit is to call it exactly what it is. This will make you feel so dirty and repulsed after you see it you will need vomit to purge it from your system.It truly is that repellent.Sickening swill.",1,16,39,21 April 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jaw Droppingly Bad
","The long awaited 'prequel' to the Star Wars trilogy is a major disappointment on all levels.The whole new cast characters are merely cardboard figures who show no real dept or emotion.It's hard to believe that innocent young Annakin Skywalker will grow up to be the evil Darth Vader. Too many special effects bombard the viewer from beginning ro end. Most of them are so over designed that they create not one sense of awe or wonder. The underwater city looks like a fish bowl ornament, the planet Coruscant looks too much like Fritz Lang's Metropolis and the spacecraft are just too uninspiring, especially when compared to the futuristic ones from the previous three episodes.The only good sequence in this mess is the podrace- a sort of rocket powered hot rod race. Taking place in and around a Roman style arena, this sequence obviously owes its debt to the chariot race from Ben Hur- yet even this lacks the excitement or majesty of the sequence it rips off. In all fairness to George Lucas, the Italian Reniassance inspired design of the planet Naboo ain't too bad. Other than that, this film is just a total waste of time. You just sit there waiting for something to happen and it doesn't. PS- 'ET' side, has there EVER been a more annoying character than the computer generated Jar Jar Binks?The FORCE ain't with this one!",1,1,4,26 February 2007
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Twilight Saga Pt 1--Breaking Wind
","Where do I even begin? Yet another installment in this never ending franchise. If you are a fan, you pretty much know the deal. They have sex, there's a wedding, an offspring is born ad they wait for the apocalypse between the bloodsuckers and the wolves. Embarrassingly bad and ultra cheesy on all levels. Pitiful non acting by Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and the rest of the cast. Obviously designed for tween and teenage girls, even they were bored during the preview that I got to see for free. As you probably have guessed by now, I'm not a fan of this series. Like the last 'Harry Potter', this ender will be done in two separate parts. Why bother? Everything in this film is overacted, the atmosphere looks like a trailer park, the music is probably the most mawkish ever committed to celluloid , and the whole production in general looks like one of those Mexican made velvet paintings with a wolf sitting in frot of a full moon. Does absolutely nothing to advance series that should have ended at part one, it was designed to lure the target audience girls into the multiplexes to spend the hard earned money that mommy and daddy have to work two jobs to give them. Before my review gets pulled for 'abuse', heed my warning. Do NOT pay money to see this film. It literally stinks. You can almost see the cloud of its foul stench rising from the screen. I want a refund! Give me back the two hours plus of my life that I wasted watching this rubbish. Another P U movie review from Lou!",1,21,40,18 November 2011
The Sound of Music," It's Perfect!
","The Sound of Music is a film that I find to be cloying, too cute, sugary and overlong. Miss Andrews seems to be doing another Mary Poppinesque role here, yet for some reason, I absolutely LOVE this film. I don't know if its the story, the magnificent photography, the high quality of the acting, the first class production values, or the songs{all of them are excellent}that do it for me. Prehaps I'm just a sucker for it, or prehaps it contains something that is lacking from today's hard sell high concept films. It takes me back to a more innocent age when the so-called family films were made with heart, class and intelligence. This one can make me feel good when I'm down and no matter how many times I've seen it, it always works.After all, isn't that what movie-going is supposed to be about? Highly recommended on all levels, they will never make 'em like this anymore. Thats a shame, but thats a fact of life in contemporary Hollywood these days.A genuine classic that seems to get better every time you watch it. Grand entertainment and the best musical film ever made, it is truly one of my favorite things!",10,3,11,24 November 2006
United 93," Exploiting a Tragedy for Profit 101
","The first film to exploit the 9-11 tragedy. This is an underplayed and restrained production that shows what MIGHT have happened on this eventful day. The fact is that this movie hearkens back to the days of the 'disaster' epics of the 70s. Essentially it is any one of those airborne disaster films with the exception being it was a real and not imagined disaster. The no-name cast is pretty unremarkable and the shoe string production values really show on the screen. The hand held camera work creates the proper sense of claustrophobia, but it is overused. We all know what the outcome was so its no use repeating it again . The producers of this dull and exploitative film claimed it was done to honor the memories of the 3,000 people who died on that day. The real fact was that they thought they were onto something good by being the first ones to exploit this tragedy for personal gain. Mercifully, it died at the box office, but it did go on to spawn Oliver Stone's equally abortive 'World Trade Center' a few months later. Have we become so desentisized to the violence of the real world that we need to make movies to exploit them for profit? Like WTC, this is a slap in the face and an insult to anyone who either died or survived 911. I guess that anybody will do anything in the name of the almighty dollar, but when it comes down to an exploitation film like this, it is just plain despicable. Adding to the overall tedium are the pointless conversations from the control tower and the passengers on the doomed flight chattering away on their cell phones.- God forbid that somebody should be without one. The overall quality of this film resembles a hastily contrived 'tv movie'. Poor propaganda does not an engrossing film make. Absolute rubbish, this is not worth your time. So 'let's roll' straight out of this movie.To say liberties were taken with the story is an understatement. How did the terrorists smuggle that bomb making equipment on board after the baggage search? Also, to call this film boring is to praise it to high heaven. It defines dull. It is about as exciting as watching paint dry or grass grow. Unfortunately, I had to endure it again as a class project. This time out the jerky motion of the hand held camera gave me a headache.I also tried to stay awake for it, but I did doze off. They were still in the control room when I awoke. I really don't want to get off on a tangent here, but, dear reader, I think you get the picture.Zero Stars.",1,12,30,24 March 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Cruel and Unusual Punishment For Intelligent Filmgoers.
","OK, admit it now. You HATE this film, but you were afraid to say it.Insipid and idiotic, not to mention intelligence insulting, this is one of the worst movies I ever saw. The corny old children's film of a boy and his dog{or horse} has been updated to a boy and his alien.Typical 80s style family where boy finds shipwrecked alien and his attempts to get him home. No real emotion or drama {or science fiction}just a 'Hallmark' greeting card turned into plasticised 'touchy feely' film. The alien ET is just an animatronic figure like you see at Disneyland and was not too convincing. Once a fine director, Spielberg sold it out for money and all those ET products like pajamas, talking dolls, costumes, Reeses Pieces, bikes and other tie-ins just left a bitter taste in my mouth. Shamelessly manipulative to say the lease. As is, just OK for kids, but even todays children will be able to see through it. They say the movies have become 'dumbed downed' these days. ET is the one that started the trend. I quess that Mencken was right when he said 'nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of America.' ET is proof positive. The film that started Speilbergs descent into mediocrity, a place he still occupies today.If this is the kind of film that brings tears to your eyes, get a life! I know that I am going to get a lot of heat for this review, but I give this saccharine film a Zero Star rating.Yeah, it really is that bad. E.T.go away!",1,67,163,6 November 2006
Memento," I'm still trying to figure it out- but wow!
","Brilliant modern 'film noir' of a man suffering from a rare form of memory loss trying to figure out a murder. The unusual structure of this film still has me puzzled, but in a most posititive way. The acting is excellent in a low key way, and the atmosphere- mostly set in a cheap motel and restaurant all contribute something to the story. In fact they almost seem like players themselves.The shoestring budget only adds to the realism. Brilliant use and distortion of time seem to capture the thoughts going through the mind of the hero as he tries to figure out exactly what has happened.Also excellent and noteworthy are the transitions from black and white to color.This is not a movie for the short attention span crowd. You will have to see it at least twice to figure it out, but the resulting experience will be one that is hard to forget.Compare that to the hard sell, high concept films currently littering the multiplexes. A rare treat, especially for film buffs.",8,1,4,26 April 2007
Captain Marvel," If You've Seen One........................
","Another entry in this overcrowded genre. Bree Larson is just plain awful as is the rest of the politically correct white hating cast.Absolutely standard issue on all counts, with cheap looking and uninspired CGI effects and mind-numbing music thrown in to pad out what is just a three minute trailer.No use in describing the scenario which looks like ANY other superhero movie you can think of. A total embarassment, and a slap in the face to the 'empowerment' crowd that can be better served with a movie that can have some socially redeeming qualities to it.Even though I hate superhero movies, I probably could have awarded this a few more stars if it were better made and tried to tell a real story instead of just rubbing it's hateful propaganda in our faces.I'm sure it will please undemanding viewers,but the rest of us who wondered what happened to the movies will ave to look elsewhere. The best part of this fiasco is the pet cat. Don't bee too surprised if she gets her own 'standalone' movie in the near future. Another P.U.movie review from Lou.",1,24,38,8 March 2019
The Hunger Games," The Running Girl
","Yet another epic set in a very dystopian not too distant future. A bankrupt,hungry, dysfunctional and soulless North American country called Panem stages a fight to the death epic featuring teenagers from ages 12 to 18 from the 12 Districts to compete. They train all their lives-sort of like former East German Olympians -for this event where they have to face explosions, fires, being shot at and attacks from rabid wild dogs among other things all filmed on a jerky nausea inducing hand held camera. A backwoods teen with the unlikely name of Katniss Everdeen replaces her sister who was 'chosen' to compete, and therefore she must train to prepare for the games. Highly deriverative film 'borrows' elements from 'The Most Dangerous Game', 'Lord of the Flies', 'Rollerball' ', 'Battle Royal' and last but not least 'The Runing Man The games themself are a cross between 'Gladiator' , 'Fear Factor'and 'Survivor', and are quite graphc as teen after teen is eliminated while a zombie like population is forced to watch. The set up takes about half the film's lenght to get there, and once the games begin, the violence starts. Film totally misses the mark because it takes itself way, way to seriously. It would have worked a lot better if it was made as a black comedy or a satire on the so called 'reality shows' the author Suzanne Collins obviously based these books on, but no attempt is made to correlate the two. Jennifer Lawrence and the mostly no name cast is good, but they don't do very much other than act grim and self determined to succeed at their tasks. As I have already said ,what this film desperately needs is a tongue in cheek sense of humor to help the story move and lighten things up a bit, but the fimmakers totally blew it. I'm sure the 'tween age girl target audience this film is aimed at probably doesn't remember 'The Running Man' with Schwarzenneger where condemned criminals had to compete on a game show to fight for their lives. What made that film work was the dead -on satire , a keen sense of humor, the brilliant and hilarious one liners and the utterly improbable scenario that the audience 'got' not too long after the film started. This one uses the same premise, but makes very poor use of it. I'm sure it will do good at the box office with all the hype its been getting, but you will definitely leave the multiplex feeling 'hungry' for something more satisfying Also, don't be too surprised if you soon start hearing names like Katniss and Peta becoming popular after the drones who watch this overrated piece of drek deciede to name their offsprings as such .Another P-U movie review from Lou!",1,61,122,21 March 2012
Terminator Salvation," Terminate{this movie} with Extreme Prejudice
","Mind numbing continuation of a once fine series. Chistian Bale does nothing other than try to look cool, the story is non existent, and the premise is so trite that it makes 'X Men Origins' look like Shakespeare. Ah-nold makes a brief CGI nappearence, possibly to remind viewers of just what is missing-and wrong with this movie.While T3 was not exactly a great film, at least it had a kinetic energy that carried the film to its conclusion. It was pretty certain that he would not be back, but thanks to the trite screenplay in this one, it was not so. The CGI action scenes look cheesy and seem to remind you of every action film ever made since the miserable Matrix. Like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this one has 'made for the money' written all over it. No originality, no creativity, just a weak story with too many special effects.There is not even a good one liner like 'I'll be back' or 'Hasta la vista baby'. Whatever happened to the premise that good sci-fi should be written and based around the characters? The shame of it all is that today's audiences just don't seem to care. Possibly the ultimate junk movie, it will please today's multiplex bred filmgoers. If you know and love the Arnold versions, do yourself a favor and avoid this add-on like the Swine Flu! And yes, as long as trash movies like this keep littering the multiplexes, I'll continue to trash 'em here. It's your money-demand better! Zero stars.",1,68,211,22 May 2009
My Neighbor Totoro," Tripe
","Bland, boring, predictable animated pseudo fairytale of two Japanese girls and their father who move to the country to be nearer to their ailing mother's hospital.One day, they meet a forest spirit whom they call Totoro.Looking like an overweight rabbit with short prick erect ears, this non-threatening harmless character leads them through a series of bland, Disney like adventures that makes even 'Dora the Explorer' look like Shakespeare's ' Mac Beth'-and we don't even get to see Totoro until a half hour into the movie! Thats about it. This is probably the most over rated film from Miyazaki, the uber over rated Japanese anime director.Its all done in a pastel tone animated style that looks like an a painting by a first grader, yet some of the backgrounds do have a certain charm to them.There is no edge, conflict, sense of menace or real emotion or drama in this pablum coated film to engage the audience. Even a 3 year old would become bored-fast. Done by Studio Ghibli-a sort of Japanese Disney studio, this turkey has earned much yen since its release. Not to mention the merchandising it has inspired that, fortunately is not too readily available in the United States. And can anybody please tell me what is so great about Miyazaki? He's just another 'in it for the money' artist like Tim Burton, Spielberg, and Murakami. As a matter of fact, I have a hard time distinguishing Miyazaki from Murakami.. Even Spielberg's 'ET', a film that I thoroughly hated seems enjoyable and well made when compared to this. Do yourself a favor-watch it only if you have to. Not worth your precious time.For some reason, this was one of the the highest grossing film of all time in Japan until Titanic came along. I can't see why.",1,20,71,2 November 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Weeney Todd-the Wimpy Barber of Fleet St.
","Awful, just plain awful. A typical Tim Burton movie with bizarrely unimaginative computer generated sets,and singing that makes 'High School Musical'seem like high art. Depp comes off as a rather effeminate Sweeny and that gray streak in his hair makes him look all the worse. Bonham-Carter is wasted again in a part that she is obviously too young for. The songs are OK-they are by Sondheim right? but for some reason they seem like an afterthought. It seems Burton could not make up his mind on whether this was a musical or another one of his self-indulgent and quite tiresome journeys into cinematic 'art'. Also on hand is Sasha Baron Cohen playing an Italian in a Borat like style that is totally devoid of any substance. The rest of the cast consists of no-name actors. This drivel can't hold a candle to the Broadway original or the filmed Hearn-Landsbury version of the late 1980s.You've seen it all before-just rent ANY Tim Burton movie, add some songs and a wimpy Johnny Depp and viola-you got it! Avoid it like the plague!",1,21,51,23 December 2007
Horrible Bosses," Horrible Movie-Can't Say Anything Else!
","What could have been a superior black comedy about every white collar workers dream disintegrates into a standard TV style movie thats long on raunch and foul language, and short on laughs. Before my review gets pulled for 'abuse',heres the basic premise. In a nutshell, some office workers deceide to murder their bosses cuz they feel that their lives would be a lot better with them gone, then when things take a wrong turn, the desperation of the workers-and the screenwriter begin to show. 'Borrowing' elements of some of Hitchcocks best work, the story quickly fizzles out as film takes the shortcut to predictability and mediocrity. . Cast is only so-so, but Kevin Spacey seems to be chanelling his 'American Beauty' role. Bateman and others are quite forgettable and Jennifer Aniston-possibly the worst non actress of this decade goes against type and plays a slutty skanky role that the director hoped would give this film some 'balls', but all she seems to do is alienate and repel the audience even further. The only way I could recommend this movie to you is to try to sneak into it at some multiplex and wait until the film you really want to see starts, that is, of course if you can find one that is actually worth seeing. If you remember the early 80s 'Nine to Five' that movie pretty much had the same premise as this with some funny fantasy sequences too. I'll leave you, dear readers to deceide which is the better one-think Dolly Parton. Thank God that I get to see these movies for free. Being a critic does have its rewards, but unfortunately I have not been rewarded with any decent movies lately. If you must pay good money to see this turkey- especially in this Obama economy -demand a refund!Another PU movie review from Lou!",1,16,39,8 July 2011
The Polar Express," Worth a Look At
","Somewhat predictable modern Chrismas fantasy with forgettable songs and rather pat characterizations, but the CGI effects really shine.A good understanding about railroads and train travel is clearly demonstrated. . The Polar Express itself is a fantastically detailed(and completely believable}example of late 1920s-early 1930s American railroading. The steam locomotive is absolutely majestic as are the pre streamline era'heavyweight' coaches in its consist.It even has the open platform rear observation car. No wonder toy train manufactures went gaga over it. The journey is fun, even though the design of the North Pole resembles downtown Lancaster Pennsylvania-really. A somewhat predictable wrong turn is taken by the kids, but you know it will be OK at the end. Also, the use of non CGI shots in black and white in the monitoring center of the station is unique in its own right. Film does manage to capture the wonder of what this holiday is supposed to be about. On this level alone, it cannot be faulted.Good wholesome entertainment, especially when compared to all the negative 'entertainment' of todays movies that we are too often 'treated' to. Tom Hanks as the {cgi} conductor gives one of his best performances, and the multi-racial kids are cute too.Fine family entertainment-especially for model railroad and train buffs.",7,2,5,8 December 2007
Malcolm X," powerful portrait
","Spike lee's best film. A powerful and insightful screen biography of the controversial-and often misunderstood black Muslim leader of the 60s.Washington is absolutely brilliant in the title role. Bassett, another fine actress is good as his wife, but she really doesn't do too much in a role that was underwritten.Al Freeman makes a fine Elijah Muhammad, first as Malcom's tutor and mentor until his break with him after he finds out he fas fathered illegitimate children.The film deals honestly and intelligently with the aspects and times of the civil rights struggle of the era. It really does not gloss over anything to present the facts they occurred during this recent-and shameful period of our history.Washingington, one of Americas best actor is thoroughly convincing and believable in the role.We get to see how-and why he went from a small time criminal, through prison and his rebirth as the controversial leader.Rest of cast is uniformly fine with several activists -like Al Sharpton and William Kuntsler in 'cameo' roles. In its broadest sense, it also can be viewed as an American success story. The only things that work against the film are the opening scenes of an American flag burning and the Rodney King beating. The closing scenes features school children saying 'I am Malcolm X' al la the ending of 'Spartacus'. Maybe Lee is just rubbibg our faces in these scenes, but they are unnecessary. They also tend to add an amateurish touch to what essentially is a fine film.My 9 star rating is based upon this. A film EVERYONE should see- and discuss.",9,4,11,28 October 2007
Empire of the Sun," What is this Movie About?
","Sheer torture to watch. Chock full of anachronisms, bad history, excruciating dull stretches,miserable acting and not even a sense of impending doom or agony. Plays like an Oliver Twist in a prison camp for Anglo foreigners in China.The Chinese are made out to be ignorant and stupid-reduced to bad 'Charlie Chan' stereotypes while the Japanese are glorified. Why would a Brit kid worship the Japanese flyers when his own country produced the more that capable English flyers with their great Spitfires and Hurricanes who whipped the crap out of the Germans in the Battle of Britian?Also, all those people in their finest clothes wandering about the camp among their possessions and cars? What does THAT signify? Spielberg tried to prove that he was Academy Award material with this one> Truth of the matter is this film is the cinematic version of a Mc Donalds hamburger- no substinance in it anywhere. True, Spielberg did produce Shindlers List a few years after this abortion, but aside from that the body of his work is truly designed for mass appeal-his name will guarantee big bucks at the box office. There really is no reason to give up three hours of your life to watch this. Read a good book on the subject instead.A waste of celluloid. Zero stars.",1,33,65,27 March 2007
Disturbia," Rear Window it Ain't
","Thoroughly predictable Generation Y 'thriller' directly rips off the great Hitchcock masterpiece and sets it in a faceless, sterile suburban American environment. Shia Le Beouf{what a macho sounding name} is the lead character who entertains himself by watching the comings and goings of his neighbors. Could it be that one of them committed a murder? Another 'no name' actors movie that seem to be dumped at the multiplexes on a weekly basis. A complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor-rent 'Rear Window', THEN watch this. What did you see? If your answer is that Hollywood has finally run out of ideas, you're right.A movie so bereft of creativity and originality, it's a crime. Zero stars.",1,14,29,12 February 2008
Pearl Harbor," Boring! Boring! Boring!
","I'd give this comic book level history lesson a 'zero'{ not the plane} if I could. This film was obviously made for an audience that has no conception on what 'Pearl' was all about, and will probably never know the real facts due to the politically correct blame America first attitude in contemporary left-wing dominated Hollywood.Basically it's a love story set against the events. None of the actors show a real sense or clue on what lifestyle was all about at that time.They seem way, way too modern. Their characters have contemporery feel that is totally out of place for the era.Not really too much you can say about them, except that they are very shallow and very, very boring.. Then there are the events themself, which almost seem like an afterthought. The planes fly in, bomb their targets and escape while we are caught with our pants down. The much ballyhooed air raid sequence looks more like a video gamoe or a sequence from 'Star Wars' with all the CGI effects looking exactly like what they are. And how 'bout the part where FDR miraculously rises out of his wheelchair on his own? I'm surprised there wasn't a haleullah chorus and 'praise the Lord' after that!There are so many anachronisms in this film that you can drive the proverbial Mack truck through them. Especially offesive are the US navy ships that were not launched until at least 30 years after the facts! Since the producers went CGI with it, why couldn't they do it right? I can go on and on ,but you get the picture. If you want the real facts, see 'Tora! Tora! Tora!', There may be a few errrors there, but at least they got it right. This movie is so rotten, it's only good for laughs!Zero stars.",1,28,53,26 February 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Simplistic and Unrealistic
","A WWII movie for people who have never seen a real WW 11 movie. Gross oversimplification of the facts, highly unrealistic portrayal of the D Day landing, graphic violence to the nines{all in excruciating close-up shots} and the most stereotyped Nazis since Mel Brooks 'The Producers'. Film is good looking, but like Clint Eastwoods 'Flags of our Fathers', it just doesn't ring true. But unlike FOOF which does have some truth behind it, this one looks like it was made up as they went along. Tom Hanks is OK in what basically is a no-name actors movie. Spielberg spoon feeds everything to us like we have no brains of our own. Many WW11 vets criticized the events as portrayed. While I was not there, I tend to believe them. Saving Pvt Ryan? Save your money instead!Zero Stars.",1,19,45,13 December 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Huh?
","I am not a martial arts film fan. I never would have gone to see it, but a friend{some friend} coerced me into going. Approaching it with an open mind, it seemed just alright at first, but as soon as I saw the first gravity defying lighter than air fight scene, I crouched-no pun intended- in my seat. This gimmick was used in several films, including that miserable abortion called 'The Matrix' of about the same time as this.This unfortunate gimmick was dropped after a few films, and its easy to see why. If you must know, its yet another rehash of 'Star Wars' but its set in 19th. century China instead of a galaxy far away and minus the futuristic hardware and space ships. Its sole novelty beside the fight gimmick is that the warrior is female. Period. It does feature beautiful color photography, but so what? The critics fawned all over this one. Are they brain dead or something? Zero stars.",1,1,7,12 June 2007
JFK," Help! The Paranoids are After Me!
","Bogus, ultra pretentious semi 'Mocumentary' drama -purporting to give the real facts on the JFK assassination. Leftist Castro loving kook Oliver Stone tries to pass this garbage off as the real fact behind the Conspiracy Of Conspiracies.Cast is decent, but Cosner {as always} shows not one single wit of emotion.Sitting through this abortion is akin to sitting through root canal.It is so preposterous, dull,pretentious and boring, boring- did I forget to say boring that just staying awake for it is a chore.America is a great country- right Ollie? Where else can a crackpot director like this ridicule everything that makes America great- and get paid big bucks to do it ? in Cuba? prehaps not. There is no valid reason to waste over three hours of your life on this tripe. Read a good book- an UNBIASED book on the subject. Better still, try to catch the 'Seinfeld' episode with Keith Hernandez that features a take-off on this ridiculous film. Done in a slow-motion style that resembles the assassination in this film, it is far more entertaining than trying to sit through-and comprehending this!ZERO stars.",1,17,50,19 June 2007
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Garbage
","Just another piece of raw sewage from the most over-rated 'director' of all time.If you've ever seen any of his films, you know exactly what to expect.A boredom inducing snoozefest with no real story as a has been TV Western star and his stuntman double drive around in a '66 Cadillac through a changing, decaying Hollywood, ca. 1969. This is the result of a former video store clerk turned director given a free reign to do whatever he wants., and the powers that be who allowed him to indulge himself in his sick, demented fantasies.About the ONLY good thing I can say about is that it's not another brain-dead superhero movie, or part of another never ending franchise.Naturally, the critics are fawning all over it. Don't you make the same mistake! Another P.U. movie review from Lou. Stay tuned........",1,31,73,27 July 2019
The Longest Day," Almost Like Being There
","Quite simply the best film ever attempted on this subject. The events leading up to the D Day invasion in France are meticiously viewed from the French, British, German and American sides. The dialogue is spoken in the national languages of the countries taking part in the invasion and this aspect alone elevates it high above most other films. The superb black and white photography adds yet another layer or realism . Cast features many international stars, but never stoops to a 'spot the stars' formula like too many of these films tend to do.Clichés are avoided and the people portrayed are realistically drawn. Even the Germans are presented as actual military leaders and not the stereotypical Nazi villains . There are massive invasion scenes, quieter scenes at the villages before the raid, and a commando raid on a German howitzer emplacement in the basement of a casino, a scene that follows the attacking Allied group from an ariel perspective while they move through town past the docked fishing boats and destroyed buildings. The overhead shots of the beaches with hundreds of troops, tanks and landing craft gives the viewer a very accurate picture of the massive scale of the invasion, something that Spielberg just could not pull off in 'Pvt Ryan'.A three hour film that is up for repeat viewings. You will discover something new each time you view it. The screenplay was by the author Cornelius Ryan from his own book.No silly romantic subplots, just the facts. I remember seeing this film after it opened with my father and uncle. It was impressive then, and it holds up beautifully today. In my humble opinion, this is the best WW11 film ever made.

World Trade Center," A Pile of Rubble
","Awful 'docudrama' concerning 2 cops who get buried under tons of rubble on 9-11. How dare Oliver Stone- who was quoted as saying America had it coming- make a movie to exploit this tragedy. Has America become so desensitized to the violence of the real world that we make films to exploit tragedies for the sake of entertainment? This and the earlier Flight 93 were the first- and hopefully the last films to capitalize on this tragedy. They died early deaths at the box office and it is easy to see why. As far as WTC is concerned, it does feature an average performance from Cage, and the rest of the no-name cast simply functions as a prop to support the paper thin screenplay. Needless to say, it is chock full of errors and anachronisms, but it is an Oliver Stone film, right? Beyond bad, this film is a slap in the face and an insult to anyone who either survived or died on 9-11. Exploitative garbage, pure and simple.Zero stars.",1,18,29,24 March 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," In a Class By Itself
","The film that singlehandedly took sci-fi out of the Saturday afternoon matinÃ©e genre and elevated it to an art form. Absolutely brilliant on all counts. The history of man is traced from the dawn of time, to the space age, and to where?. Even the best of them pale when compared to this masterpiece. Like a work of art by Da Vinci or Michaelangelo, it just gets better with age and will stand the test of time. And, yes. When I first saw it way back in '68, I absolutely hated it. Approaching it with an open mind , I was totally blown away by it when I saw it from a new point of view in 1981. It has become one of my favorites and I watch it religiously twice a year. I can't possibly add anything new to the reviews, but believe all the good ones that you read. A landmark film, and likely to remain so for many decades to come.The best 'G' rated film ever made, it still remains the ultimate trip.",10,5,12,10 December 2007
Avatar," A Time Waster that Ain't Worth Your Time
","An 85 minute movie expanded to 2 and a half hours. James 'Titanic' Cameron's less than titanic effort has a paralyzed marine being sent to the Planet Pandora to fetch a substance that can be used as an energy source on a fuel hungry Earth in the future. The CGI effects are OK-but they wear their welcome out fast. The trite and very hackneyed story seems to have been lifted from Dances With Wolves,Pocohontas, Alien, Cameron's own Aliens,The Lost World, Atlantis-The Lost Empire , Journey to the Center of the Earth,and the Wizard Of Oz-especially for the first 20 or so minutes that are filmed in standard format before the film goes CGI,kind of like the black and white opening of Oz before Dorothy arrives there and it goes to color. The planet Pandora itself features flying dragons and blue indigenous natives that are a poor parody of American Indians. It seems as if Cameron is saying that only the white race of people can be the saviors of this world, and that even though the indigenous peoples are very smart, they just don't have the intelligence to fend or themselves.All the clichés are there, the love interest, the greedy industrialist, the strong , liberated woman, etc, etc. For a short time it is eye popping, even dazzling, but from then on it slowly sinks{get it?} into its own pretensions.Worse still, there really is no sense of humor or comedy relief to lighten things up a bit. Its as if Cameron is saying 'wow, just look at it. It's awesome, isn't it?'. Well, the real fact of the matter is that it is not. Cameron has always been a props and FX director and still has a lot to learn about the human element and character development . Since this ass-buster runs for what seems to be an eternity, why didn't he attempt to make the characters interesting? He knows that today's multiplex bred filmgoers just don't seem to care so he takes the easy way out and gives us an FX movie that is just overkill.It is all style, no substance and leaves you with a cold and empty feeling. I'm sure this movie will probably do good in the awards department, but that does not justify you giving up two and a half hours of your life to see it.You've seen it all before-and much better too.Even the current Planet 51-a not too good sci-fi parody -comedy of an astronaut landing on a planet where the aliens are based on 1950s American pop culture offers some fun and laughs manages to outshine this. This film is just so ordinary that it is a crime.See it if you like-just don't expect too much. Cameron thinks that the CGI effects of this film will be 'the next big thing in film-making' Guess again James.If you can wait 9 or so weeks, you'll be able to rent this at Blockbuster.WARNING! Do NOT take little children to see this movie. They will become just as bored as you-only faster.My rating-one star.",1,124,429,14 December 2009
Super 8," Pooper 8
","Something strange is happening in a small town after a train derails . What was supposed to be a nostalgic look at the lives of a few middle schoolers in 1979 turns out to be the biggest movie non event of the year. Something is not right in this movie that fails for three reasons. First, it is entirely too much like the old 'Twilight Zone' and 'Outer Limits' TV shows. Secondly, the predictability factor manifests itself from the beginning. You know exactly what is going to happen before it even does. You just sit there and viola! It happens. Third is the 'Lets use every cliché from every sci-fi movie ever made' factor.Self explanatory. The no name cast doesn't have one character you even care about. They look too clean, too polished,and too plastic just like animatronics at a Disney World attraction.And yes, they all have what I like to call the 'Spielberg Look'- you know, that dazed, glazed facial expression that was so prominent in 'ET'. If this turkey bears a resemblance to 'Close Encounters', 'War of the Worlds', 'ET', 'Cloverfield', and 'The Goonies', thats the idea. There isn't an original idea anywhere in this mess. Its as if director Abrams was told to make a homage to early Spielberg films by Spielberg himself, and thats exactly what he did. Film does have its moments, but they are few and very far between. Film tries to be nostalgic, but 70s nostalgia? A great decade! Disco, Jimmy Carter, the looming Iran hostage crisis, inflation, oil crisses, unemployment, polyester, etc, etc. Kinda of sounds like today, doesn't it? I can go on and on but, dear reader, I think you get the point. This film has the cheesiest ending since 'Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull',and the schmaltz in the last two minutes or so seems to have been applied with a trowel.As is, just alright for eight year old kids or undemanding viewers. However, adults who are looking for something with some brains and intelligence should go to another multiplex. However, you gotta admit that Spielberg is pretty smart. He just bought himself a 300 foot long yacht that cost over 200 million dollars.Mediocrity is its own reward,but to call this film mediocre is to praise it to high heaven. This film represents everything that is wrong with today's filmmaking and movies. Save your 11 bucks and the trip to the multiplex. It will be available on DVD before the summers over.Mark my words, you'll see. PS- 'Super 8' refers to a type of 8mm film that was used for making home movies in the pre digital film age.",1,28,58,8 June 2011
Titanic," It Sinks
","James Camerons Titanic has everything money can buy. This is a a big slick glossy ultra Hollywood take on the tragedy.We all know the outcome,so its no use repeating it here.This is essentially a shipboard romancer,not unlike 1997s far superior Out to Sea.only it is not supposed to be a comedy. The trite and hackneyed plot line involves an impossible romance between poor boy Di Caprio and socialite Kate Winslet and it its not totally convincing.One high spot is the always fine Cathy Bates as Molly Brown and shes good almost too good for this movie. Scant little detail is provided for the events that lead up to the tragedy.Unfortunately,the real star of this film is the Titanic itself.It is wonderfully recreated in all its glory. Even though it is only mostly sets with plenty of CGI details it is incredible. You almost feel like you are on a real ship.That being said, you probably enjoy this film if a good cry is your thing. This film won many Academy Awards, as many as Ben Hur but it did not deserve that many. It is also the highest grossing film of all time(so far} There is also a rather insipid title song by Celene Dion. Yet in spite of all its technical excellence,1958sA Night To Remember remains the definitive version of the story and stands head and shoulders above this. Nearer thy god to thee, indeed!",4,1,5,26 March 2005
The Untouchables," Unwatchable!
","This is director Di Palma's big budgeted highly fictionalized account of Eliot Ness and his team going after Al Capone to get him convicted and sent to prison.Future bad movie king Kevin Costner is a bland and unconvincing Ness who shows not one wit of charisma in the role.Sean Connery is good-but not too convincing as the Irish American cop,and Andy Garcia-as the Italian American cop is probably the best thing this mess can give us. Di Niro as Capone seems to be doing a 'Saturday Night Live' skit in a role that he was probably paid big bucks to do.The scene at the dinner when he makes those corny baseball analogies before caving in the skull of a fellow gangster with a baseball bat is thoroughly predictable and seems to be a leftover that never made its way into the equally bad 'Scarface' a few years before this.This is not really a movie in the conventional sense. It plays more like a series of unrelated episodes strung together. It looks too clean, too perfect, kind of like a Hallmark greeting card.Di Palma-who practically made a career by ripping off Alfred Hitchcock eschews the Master this time and directly rips off the Odessa Steps sequence in Eisenstein's Potemkin when the baby carriage with its over age passenger rolls down the steps of the railroad station in the highly stylized gun fight, a sequence that you see coming before it actually happens. There are corrupt juries, gun duels, knife fights and more classic cars than you can shake a stick at, but these elements do not an engrossing film make. The overall amateurish quality of this film sabotages it from the outset. All you can do is stare at-and hope to get something meaningful from it. Shame on you David Mamet for this screenplay! A total waste of time. As they say in Brooklyn.. Forgeddaboutit!",1,45,88,2 February 2007
Sherlock Holmes," Has 'Busted Franchise' Written All Over It
","As a long time Sherlock Holmes fan,I really wanted to say something good about this one, but I really can't. Guy {Madonna's ex} Ritchie modern take on the classic Conan-Doyle stories seems to have been made for a contemporary audience who has no clue {get it?}-on who Holmes is. Downey totally fails as Holmes in a character who is too modern-and possibly too ambigiously gay for the role-not that there's anything wrong with that. He is all nervous tics and always seems to have something else on his mind. Hell, he doesn't even wear the famous deerstalker hat!Law is just alright as Watson and he does try to bring some comic relief to the character. The story has Holmes trying to stop a plot to destroy London. There are the usual CGI scenes, but for some reason most of them are pretty well done and do manage to capture the essence of what London probably looked like at that time. Also there is a very good Irish bar song that is featured throughout the movie. Even though it is a good looking and well produced movie, it is somewhat hard to follow at times and fairly predictable from start to finish., even though some interesting diversions with some steampunk items placed in try to add some momentum to the story line. Obviously looking for a new franchise, the producers of this should hope that the Baker St.boys are a hit at the box office. Movie itself is fairly likable, but it just falls flat on what it has to deliver. That's the trouble with Holmes when new stories are written to cater to contemporary tastes. Prehaps if an original Conan-Doyle story was used, this would have turned out better. Where are Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce when you need them?",6,94,331,15 December 2009
Ben-Hur," Epic of epic proportions
","The epic by which all others are judged,it remains one of the best films of all time.After having a falling out over Roman rule about to be imposed in ancient Judea,ex friends Roman Messala and Jewish Ben hur become bitter enemies.Set during the time of Christ, it concerns one mans encounter with Him and the impact it will have on the rest of. his life.The acting is first rate with Heston at his best. Steven Boyd is also fine as his nemesis,and Jack Hawkins shines as naval commander Quintus Arias the cynical yet likable Roman who has an offer for Ben Hur while he is imprisoned as a galley slave.The movie has a pro religious and positive Christian point of view that may be considered controversial in todays ultra liberal Hollywood where sex and graphic violence are the norm. Also its three and a half hour running time may put off short attention span viewers.Made for a record 15 million dollars-in 1959 money the colossal scope of this movie looks like twenty times that much. The musical score is so good it can stand on its own.For sheer screen majesty,what can top the chariot parade in the arena before the big race-especially the Ariel shots of the racers with the titanic head of the statue of Jupiter in the foreground. Then there's the race itself.Arguably the most famous sequence in movie history it has been imitated often -Star Wars The Phantom Menace as the pod race but never equaled. All the more impressive because what you are seeing is real. No CGI or green screen FX here.To give any more of it away will not be fair to you. I have seen it many times on TV and video, but I really saw it for the first time when I saw it on the big screen at the Loews Jersey theater ,a restored movie palace in Jersey City NJ. It was a film that I never will forget. Try to see it on a big screenDefines the term 'epic'. Monmunental entertainment.",10,0,3,25 March 2005
Born on the Fourth of July," Ollie does it again!
","War is hell, but this movie is torture. Non actor Cruise whines, bellyaches and bitches and moans about Vietnam AFTER he enlists!Sure, he winds up paralyzed, but so did thousands of other vets. Another 'agenda driven' piece of leftist, anti American drivel by Oliver Stone. Lets face it, this guy just hates America, period.A major slap in the face to every veteran who served in any war. This is the kind of propaganda that captured GIs were forced to watch while they were 'guests' at the 'Hanoi Hilton'. The only thing missing from this so-called film is Jane Fonda. Maybe someone should make a real movie about paralyzed veterans and how they were proud to serve their country, and show us the REAL way the left wingers treated them when they got home.I also object to the word 'liberal' being used to describe Stone.A liberal is traditionally a person who looks t all the issues wit\th an open mind before he {or she} forms a conclusion.Stone is just a far left winger. Did he ever make an objective -or open minded film? it's all just propaganda. PS-Ron kovic was born on the 5th. of July.My rating-zero stars.",1,10,29,11 October 2007
The Soloist," Most Predictable Movie of the Year
","What could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row. Looking for a good story to boost his flagging career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert 'rehab' Downey } gets to know him and tells his story. Taking every element of the classic 'how we hit the skids' movies, borrowing very liberally from 'A Beautiful Mind', taking the bogus 'feel good' attitude of films like 'Rocky'-you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie. It is corny, trite, utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will give you bad looks. I really wish I could say something positive about this film, but I really can't. The acting redeems it somewhat, but not enough for me to give it more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie stuff. Not worth your time.",1,15,37,3 May 2009
