United 93," Realistic and emotional
","Yes, we don't know exactly what happened on United 93... that is true. What we do have is the accounts of the loved ones of those on the plane. They relayed their stories of the contacts they made with those on board. We also know of the last minute transitions made aboard the plane indicating that those aboard did fight back... with that in mind, the events displayed in this film are as close to factual as we will ever come.With that put of the way, the execution, pacing, and pure intensity of the film brings true honor to those aboard this flight. Even though it's been 18 years since the events in of 9/11, and well over a decade since this film came out, it still hold incredible power. In fact, rarely have I seen a film which grows in its quality like United 93 does. As we grow more and more separate from the horrible events of that day, this film's quality grows, too. Though not entirely accurate, as we will never truly know of the events which took place aboard the plane from minute to minute, this film will grow in importance as time wears on. In 100 years, I truly hope this film deserves the accolades of deserves. It tastefully brings honor to those aboard flight 93 while also bringing is right into the flight control centers. It shows the best of humanity in the worst of circumstances. And it does so in a tasteful, respectful, and honorable way. Everyone needs to see this film once. Even if they dont like it, everyone needs to see this film.",10,2,4,12 September 2019
