Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," make your own judgment
","First, TAKE ALL REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT!If you're a fan of the Star Wars series you will not be disappointed with this first?? of the series.  As many have said, it does seem to play out as a video game.  One thing that could have helped, as far as visually is concerned, hold some of the scenery shots longer than just a split second or so.. I think approx. 120million dollars went into making this movie, THE LEAST THE MOVIE MAKERS COULD HAVE DONE IS LET US BASK IN IT'S DIGITAL GLORY.  There was scene after scene of beautiful landscape that really would have benefited with just a little breather to let the audience take in the vastness of these worlds.  While I do not support others who've said getting rid of much of the cgi would have made the movie better, I support the opinion of MORE STORY, BETTER WRITING, ....hence you don't have to dazzle us with the million dollar equipment used to create many of the scenes.  While my final review is favorable, make your own opinion.  It'd be a shame if you don't see this movie purely based on some lackluster reviews.  Please movie makers...write a good script, have some good acting, and I'll go see any movie you make.",Null,0,1,30 May 1999
Little Miss Sunshine," Best comedy of 2006
","The theater I went to in Pasadena, CA tonight was laughing uncontrollably. I have very few criticism's of this movie and the cast is overall sensational. It's hard to find one weak character. Possibly the grandfather was the most one dimensional, but this was a very intelligent script, well directed, well paced, and very well acted.From the beginning of this piece the characters all have there own issues. We are introduced to one after another, each with their own problems or dilemmas. As the film progresses, the filmmakers have done a very good job expanding on each individual, without any one character taking over the movie, nor any one character being left out. The dialog, for the most part is very real, and you can see this family actually functioning this way. While this movie can easily be described as quirky, hopefully it finds a larger audience with a wider release. This is when independents (fox searchlight) really show they're worth doing. Enough summer blockbusters already, time for some fun, exploratory film-making. This is by far the best comedy (dark or otherwise) that I've seen in a while, and easily the best one of 2006.",10,3,7,7 August 2006
Life Is Beautiful," people, get it together!
","let me first of all say, i don't see how anyone could possiblythink this movie makes light of the horrible tragedy of thethe holocaust.  ie. benigni (guido) going through the fog atthe concentration camp & stumbling upon a heap of bodies,thrown into a pile like rags.  the expression on his face, areminder to himself of where he is, & EXACTLY WHY HE MUST SHIELDHIS SON FROM THIS!  ie. 'the game' there are too many scenes where you don't know which reaction touse, tears or laughter.  benigni really has helped makesomething very special. not a lot of money was put into this picture, yet many of thescenes are from a cinematographers viewpoint, stunning to say theleast. i don't want to give anything away from the movie, but there isscene after scene where you cannot but appreciate the time spentand freshness benigni brings to the silver screen.10/10by the way, if you throw enough money and talent at a picture,it doesn't seem too hard to get the academy's nod when it comesto oscar time.  TAKE A GUESS WHICH MOVIE(S) I'M TALING ABOUT.",10,0,1,21 February 1999
The Wrestler," How Can Everyone have Missed the Real Christian Script??
","First off let me say that I loved this movie and I'm a Christian.I have searched Google and haven't found any mention to the tons of facts that support that Mickey Rourke is basically Jesus, his followers are all Christians (and not too bright at that), that Marisa Tomei is Mary Magdalene, and that Jesus is a false prophet.I know what one might be thinking after something so blasphemous/slanderous but here's my support for this theory.Mickey Rourke IS Jesus: 1. Long flowing hair 2. perfect tanned body 3. followers 4. sacrifices oneself for his followers 5. sacrificial lamb/ sacrificial Ram 6. Never a single mention of his parents 7. Not a father either (his only daughter denounces him) 8. Bleeds from crown of thorns (razor blade) 9. Girlfriend (Tomei) is a stripper/ Mary Magdalene is a prostitute 10. Prays to God 11.Martyr (staples as nails/bleeds for fans pleasure) 12. Very poor, lives paycheck to paycheck 13. People come to him for healing (signature/spiritual uplifting)Why Jesus is false: 1. Hair is fake! 2. Tan is fake! 3. Muscles are fake (steroids) 4. Life is fake- (on stage one day, next day deli counter)I thought the movie was excellent without looking at it with a religious agenda, and simply as a character study of a broken individual, but am I wrong about the analogy?",9,0,1,21 February 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE DECADE
","When I first saw this movie i was 16 and wasn't allowed in the theatre since it was rated R.  I asked some of the people standing in line if they would let me come in with them.  I don't know why I wanted to see it so much(the trailer wasn't that great).  But when I sat down and watched that opening sequence where the judge slams down that gavel for the poor Mr Dufresne and Red comes walkin in to the parol board i knew i was in for something special.  The cinematography  of that old prison was amazing.  As we hear more dialog coming from the two main characters our hearts go out to these 'brave souls'.  The character development is better than in any movie i've seen for a while.  You really start to care and feel for these imaginary people as if you knew them.  The more times i watch it on my laserdisc player, the more I can't believe how anyone could not at least 'like' this masterpiece of filmmaking.  It really got the shaft at the oscars.  Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated.  I still don't think forrest gump had as much to offer about the human experience as 'THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION'.  It really is a fantastic piece of work. Writing, acting, direction, and cinematography come together in this masterpiece.",10,2,4,29 January 1999
The Wizard of Oz," absolute classic but, Where's the widescreen?
","as time passes and we forget our movies like independence dayand godzilla ('98remake) we will never forget the vivid imagesof the emerald city and dorothy in the wizard of oz.  quiteobviously one of the timeless classics.  Although, i have aquestion, WHERE IS THE WIDESCREEN VERSION OF THIS MOVIE, WHYHASN'T IT BEEN MADE?  If there was a reason for widescreen inany movie it would be this one.",Null,0,1,7 February 1999
