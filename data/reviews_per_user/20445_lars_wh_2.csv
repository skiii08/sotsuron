Blade Runner 2049," Perhaps the best movie made in 15-20 years
","Do yourself a favor and ignore people who did not like this movie - since they might have expected an complete action sci-fi with lasers blasting galore :D With the new Blade Runner Ridley Scott has made more than a movie, he has made something truly deserving the label of: ART! I was quite the skeptic when i heard of the new Blade Runner, but after a trip to the big screen, i must admit it is the work of a grand master - the sound, the music, the colors, the acting, the darkness and the sense of the movie - it is bound to be a classic and an Oscar Winner for sure.",10,5,14,13 October 2017
Alexander," A movie that deserves much more attention.....
","I have watched Alexander perhaps 5-6 times - and i still feel quite enchanted by the complex figure of Alexander The Great portrait really well and in inner conflict by Colin Farrell. Oliver Stone made a ancient grand epic that deserves to been seen as an interpretation of the great ancient conqueror and almost mythic King of the Greeks. Soundtrack is so well done by Vangelis, that alone is enough reason to watch the movie, but the film is far better than what many would admit :DThe battle scenes are very well performed, and you get the true feeling of seeing ancient Persians and Greek in direct battle!",10,1,3,9 November 2016
