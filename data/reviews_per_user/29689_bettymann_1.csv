Howl's Moving Castle," 'Howl's Moving Castle' is a wonderful work of art which utilizes Sophy's goodness and chastity and Howl's magic and heartlessness as its organizing ideas.
","Miyazaki's version of Jones' story concentrates upon Sophy's humility, goodness, and sturdy common sense. These qualities cause the Scarecrow, Markl, Heen (Sulliman's messenger dog), Howl, and even the Witch of the Waste to respond to her loving kindness by loving her. Howl, who has traded his heart to Calcifer in exchange for power, strives to resist the demands of his King and Madame Sulliman that he fight in their senseless war. Howl dodges their summons by surrounding himself with toys and baubles and swanning around like a rock-star. His salvation occurs when he discovers something worth protecting and fighting for, Sophie and the small family she has gathered about the two of them: Markl,the Scarecrow, Heen, and, yes! even the Witch of the Waste, who, at the climatic moment, resigns Howl's stolen heart into Sophie's hands. In the end even the fire demon Calcifer cannot resist Sophie's love. And so Miyazaki, following his heart, draws good out of evil. What a wonderful story with a truly glorious ending! I love it!",10,2,4,11 December 2006
