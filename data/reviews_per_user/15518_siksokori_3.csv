Iron Man 3," An Amazing Action-Comedy only Mandarin?!
","this movie is a beast. but mandarin is fake? an actor that is what doesn't make this movie 10/10. still though amazing performance by James badge dale,don Cheadle,guy Pearce and one and only ROBERT DOWNEY JR. lets see if there will be a better summer movie this year, i also think this way better than IM2 and so so with IM1, what a way to kick of 2013 summer also hoping that this might equal avengers and mandarin bulls::::::t but maybe guy Pearce was really the mandarin try being positive extremis was not that bad and the kid was cool, don't forget about the humor brilliant. i know why you guys are disappointed but come on this was good it should settle around 7.8 or 7.9 i my opinion",8,2,8,3 May 2013
Pacific Rim," Fun but not what I expected.
","Entering this movie after seeing how people really liked it, I thought it would be top notch. No, it wasn't. It was just an okay summer movie with cool action scenes that are very hard to see because they're in the dark plus in the frigging sea. Acting was just okay. Idris Elba was amazing though. Plus Box Office fail really sad thing to say but this failed hard in the box office. Not one of the 10 best summer movies sadly. I would definitely put Iron Man 3, Man Of Steel in front of this , as I said not what I hoped for. Also my friend really hated the first 1,5 hours of the movie. But as the ending was great I would give it 7/10(Hoping there will be no Pacific Rim 2 because that would be just plain stupid)",7,1,5,6 August 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is a beautiful mess.
","As a huge fan of Batman and DC, I desperately wanted this movie to be amazing. Even with my low expectations, I was disappointed by this movie. What disappointed me the most was the potential that I saw in this movie that was wasted thanks to Warner Bros. and the director Zack Snyder, who I believe is the man to blame for the failure of this movie.I may have been disappointed by the movie but I have to say that it still has some positive factors in it. First of all, the movie did a great job with showing the consequences of the events of Man of Steel and the destruction it created. This also meant that it did a great job with explaining the Batman and Superman conflict. Everything about Batman vs Superman was so awesome that its awesomeness only made my disappointment bigger. If these two conflicts were all this movie was about, I can assure you that it would have been a spectacular film. We also got to see a new Batman with his new suit and a slightly different personality. This new Batman is played by Ben Affleck, who I thought was the best part of the movie. I would say that he is the best Bruce Wayne we had so far in cinema and also a pretty good Batman. Jeremy Irons was very suitable casting for Alfred and he showed it with his performance in the movie, I loved him. This new Batman has a lot of promise and I love it already. Another casting choice that proved the doubters wrong was Gal Gadot, as I thought she did a really good job as Wonder Woman and her character looks very promising. The only problem with Wonder Woman was that her role was too unnecessarily big in Batman V Superman. The action and cinematography in this film was mind-blowing, hence why it gets the adjective beautiful. Zack Snyder might not be the best storyteller but it has to be said that he knows how to make a fantastic looking movie. The last positive of this movie is the way Justice League was set up in the very end of the film, but only the very end!After I took the pros off my chest, I can finally talk about the cons. To pick off where I left off, Warner Bros. trying to set- up the Justice League movie degraded this movie as a whole. This made the movie only a set-up for Justice League. The fundamental issue of this film was how overcrowded it was. It had too many stories in it: a Batman vs Superman fight, the consequences of Man of Steel, a Justice League set-up and Lex Luthor's huge evil plan. Because it had too many story lines, none of them could be given adequate time and all of them fell flat other than the Justice League set-up, which didn't need to be there at all. Lex Luthor's evil plan should have been saved for the Justice League movie, so should have been Doomsday who was totally wasted in this story. A movie like this shouldn't have had a real villain. Speaking of a villain, Lex Luthor was by far the worst character in the movie. In hindsight, his presence should have been kept to a minimum and only as a setup for the future. What really happened was that they made him a character as important as both Batman and Superman, and it was extremely annoying. Luthor was totally out of character and it seemed as though Jesse Eisenberg was playing the super-villain version of Mark Zuckerberg. Everything about Lex Luthor in this movie was the true description of disappointing. Another extremely annoying character was Lois Lane. Her contributions to this movie were far exceeded by the annoyance she created. It is obvious that Superman needs Lois Lane, however this movie made her the girl that constantly created unnecessary drama and got herself in peril every single second. She shouldn't have had so much screen time if she wasn't going to have any real contribution to the story. Superman in Batman vs Superman was not so interesting at all. The biggest problem with Superman was that the controversy regarding him and the catastrophic resolution of Man of Steel made me want Batman to put him in his place. Even though I generally loved this new Batman, I still had a few problems with it. His dream sequences felt weird, his past was pretty blank and most importantly Batman kills! The fact that Batman kills does no favors to his character. The film also had a tough time reaching the realism levels set by The Dark Knight trilogy. After seeing how real Batman could be in those movies, this one didn't feel realistic at all. The only technical error in this technically superb film was the interruptions of the soundtrack from time to time. Even though I liked the score a lot, I thought it was a bit overused and too loud at times. The last big problem I had with this movie was the ending. The ending dragged so long that I ended up begging for it to end. The concluding action scene was somewhat uninteresting, had a hard time following the Batman vs Superman fight scene and couldn't learn from the mistakes Man of Steel made. We would have thought that they understood, but this movie ended in a very similar way to that movie; the only difference was that it was in the dark, thanks to Batman. All in all, this movie was a false advertisement that took Batman vs Superman and changed it to 'Dawn of Justice' with a little bit of Batman and Superman fighting peppered into it. In the end, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice was a movie that had a huge chance at greatness, but ended up disappointing thanks to Warner Brothers' greed and Zack Snyder's fantasies.",6,0,4,27 March 2016
