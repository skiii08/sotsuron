Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Semi decent film
","Before I start, I want to point out I have not seen the first of the two movies.  So i may kick myself in the butt after posting this.  I want to say kill Bill 2 was decent.  I am not a Tarantino fan so I don't expect much out of him.  But I am a film student, so what I am about to say is coming from a film student point of view.  The movie had a lot of dialogue, most interesting but some seemed to ramble on & on.  Also what irritated me was that he doesn't use a lot of a shot variation.  He sticks with a constant shot for every scene and it gets boring, there is nothing there to hold you attention.  If he changed the shots up from time to time and not go back  & forth between two different shots, the movie would have been more interesting.  He does well with the action sequences but the other parts the shots are just boring.  I thought the black & white to color style was effective, relating to past & present.  That worked well.  I will say I am gonna try to rent the first film and watch it but so far i am impressed with the story but not with the filming style.  Tarantino needs to get with the damn program.",7,0,1,30 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Not big on Pirates but loved this movie
","Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent movie.  I am not big on the whole pirate issue so I was unsure if I wanted to sit 2 and a half hours to watch this but time was well spent seeing this movie.  For it being a PG-13 Disney movie it was spectacular with it's action sequences and the story line all together.  Though the ride at Magic Kingdom is totally different but idea was somewhat the same, the movie turned out great.  I am going to go and see it again.  Let me tell you it's worth seeing.",10,0,1,17 July 2003
Spider-Man 2," Way better than # 1
","I went and saw the midnight showing of spider-man 2 last night. It was worth being up late. I loved it. The story was good, it made you laugh and the action was just astounding. They definitely left it open for a third movie. When you see it you'll know what I am talking about. It was only 2 hours but it fit the movie just right. It explains a whole lot and the CGI it just cool. I am amazed at how well the movie was done. I plan on seeing it at least 6 more times before it leaves theaters. I have to match it up with my record for the first movie and maybe then some. I would highly recommend everyone and anyone to go see this film. It will blow your mind.",10,0,0,30 June 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," A great conclusion to an awesome Trilogy
",I just wanted to say the The Matrix Revolutions was a great movie.  It's an awesome end to one of the greatest trilogies of all times.  The story line was great.  I had heard or read somewhere that at the end of Reloaded they were suppose to be in the Matrix but I new that wasn't right.  It had some of the most intense scenes I have ever seen.  I absolutely loved this movie and I can't wait until it comes out to own on DVD.  I don't know who wouldn't like this movie.  If you haven't seen any of the Matrix movies I would recommend watching them.  Go and see this movie you will love it!!!!!!!!,10,0,0,7 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," T3 - an awesome sequel
","I have seen this movie 3 times.  It helps that I work at a movie theater. Anyways...I just love this movie.  I would say just a little better than Judgement Day.  It was great especially with the special effects.  I am not fond of the original terminator though, don't ask me why but I am not.  But T3 is a must see, even if it's one of the only movies you see, and let e tell you the T-X (Kristanna Loken)  is hot!!!! She does very good especially with her expressions though she doesn't have a lot.  I can't wait for the sequels there's going to be at least 2 more.  But definately see this movie, see it for the awesome effect and they coolest action sequences I have seen in a while.",10,1,2,16 July 2003
Spider-Man," Awesome
","I loved this movie.  I was never a bit fan of the comics but I always watch the Cartoon TV show.  I thought this was the best movie I seen in 2002.  I seen it in theaters 7 times, and I have it on DVD.  I recommend any to what it even if they know nothing about Spider-man, watch it and you'll love it.",10,0,1,11 July 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Awesome movie...maybe better the the first 2.
","I thought the movie was spectacular.  I love how the director make it dark to sort of match the theme of this part of the series.  On that note of the director I would like to point of other than the way he shot the movie, I thought he sucked a a director.  For one I hated how he opted to have the movie short, and in the finished product he didn't put  little parts of the story in the correct sequence from the book, making it obvious.  I for one I wonder if the guy read the book and second cared if he was getting it right. I did love the movie but the way it was put together in some areas and especially the ending sucked.  Adding 10 to 15 more minutes would have done the movie a lot more good than harm.  What also bugged me were the fade ins and outs wit the hole circle to cut to another scene.  It worked for one part of the movie but then the others were just thrown in.  I am glad this guys is not directing the fourth film.  But  I thought the movie overall not looking at those aspects was brilliant.  I thought the character have improved a lot and found it nice to be more grown up, though I do still wish they would shoot back to back.  But I hope they keep one with the films so the main characters never become new actors.  These films kick butt!!!!!!",10,0,0,9 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Very good though Ashton Kutcher is in it.
","I thought the movie was excellent.  They did a great job making it.  Though I am not thrilled about Ashton Kutcher, but he did really well himself. It wasn't one of his stupid goofy characters like he normally plays.  I liked him in this movie.  I thought the movie played out very well.  The theater i was at had some difficulty with focus on the picture for about 10 minutes, I got the point.  I really liked it and I would recommend it to others, but I think you have to be into the whole time displacement type of thing, which i am but i am sure you don't have to at the same time.",10,1,2,25 January 2004
28 Days Later...," would have been better if....
","This movie sucked big time.  It was so retarded, it reminded me of Resident Evil but worse.  I loved Resident Evil.  For those that have seen it or for those who haven't I am not giving anything away cause you see it in the beginning, but the whole deal with the monkeys and how they are full with rage was a bit on the retarded side.  The movie would have been a whole lot better if they had left the beginning portion out, leaving it sort of a mystery for some of the film.  It's a big waste of money, every one that comes to the theater to see it doesn't like it and if they do they are the people that dress like freaks.  Nobody I work with liked it either.  I am just saying if they cut out the beginning it would have been a whole lot better of a film.  Wait to rent it if you want to see it then you won't have blown a whole load of  money at the theater.",1,3,6,17 July 2003
8 Mile," Not very good at all.
","I didn't think about it until now, but I saw this movie in theaters and I thought it was a waste of film.  Eminem is gay anyways.  This movie was aweful, though it was a remake I didn't like it.  I never liked Eminem anyway.  He is not a good actor at all and what made it worse was they put in Kim Basinger (who is a good actress) and I don't have as much respect towards her anymore.  They shouldn't have made this film.  All it did was give Marshall Mathers a bigger head to make his think he is all big and bad and which he is just a plain loser and once he's dead nobody will remember him anyway.",1,7,22,15 August 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A lame film all together
","I want to start out and say that this film was good in a way but sucked. The film was over the top of violence.  I love violence but what bugged me is how they cut to black and white for no reason.  I stated in my review for vol. 2 that I thought the black & white worked to represent past & present. Here I figured I would have expected the same thing but out of now where in the last fight with crazy 88's it jumps to black and white which made me mad.  there was no reason for it. If he had cut down on the blood he wouldn't have had to do that.  Tarantino is a bad filmmaker.  He has blood gush out like a constant spray, yeah that's wrong blood doesn't do that. Those parts were over the top.  He probably figured he had money why not blow it all on crap effects.  The other thing the irritated me was the stupid animation to tell the story of that one chick, I forgot her name. That was a waste of money.  It would have been more affective if it was like action with real people.  The story was good but how he slapped it together sucked.  People talk about it getting nominated for an oscar, I don't think it should have made it to DVD.  I liked the second one a whole lot better than this.  I watched this to gt a little more feedback on what's happening in 2.  This film should make Tarantino got down as the work filmmaker of all times.",5,0,1,1 May 2004
Signs," The coolest alien movie I have seen
","I just wanted to say this is by far the best alienish movie I have seen in a very long time.  I own it on DVD but when it was in theaters I saw it about 4 times.  Two of the times I saw it in Digital Projection.  It was really cool.  It's a basic M. Night movie except for Unbreakable.  It made you jump a few times, but made you wonder as well.  Of course he threw in a little comedy for some relief.  It didn't have to much in CGI or really good special effects but when you see the end it's really cool to see the Alien. I would say if you haven't seen this movie yet, it should be high on you list.  I think everyone just about enjoys this movie.  It's spectacular in the writing, directing, and camera movements.",10,0,2,18 July 2003
The Sixth Sense," Very Good
","When the movie cam out in the Summer of 1999 before I had seen it one of my friends told me the ending probably assuming I had seen it.  Well while watching the movie that's all that was in my mind but I tried to put it off and I did and when it came I was still shocked cause you didn't expect it the way it happened. The 6th Sense was a great movie.  It was a little scary, but had some funny parts.  Most of all it didn't drag on but kept moving at a steady pace.  No CGI effects were used, none I noticed anyway, but it didn't need them.  This was a blockbuster hit and was an instant classic.  I love this movie yet you can't watch it to much but I'd recommend it to anyone to watch if they haven't seen it already.  ***Spoiler***  I also liked how M. Night used the color red to indicate all of what was happening with the red door handle, sweater, tent in the little boys room, etc.  It was great to connect the color red with the ghosts. This movie deserves everyones attention",10,0,0,18 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," best of the 3
","I just want to say that this movie kicked major butt.  I loved it, it was action packed.  I believe it's better than the other 2.  The others were good but not like this.  This is a must on when it comes out on DVD.  This is one of the greatest trilogys of all time, the other being the Back to the Future trilogy. This movie made my dad shed a few tears cause he was overwhelmed at how well they keep the movie so much like the book, they did a great job and I hope it's true that this guys makes The Hobbit.  Go see it if you haven't you'll be glad you did.  **********/**** stars (10/4).",10,0,0,24 December 2003
