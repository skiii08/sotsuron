Skyfall," The Best Bond?
","Though I found Silva's plan working-out like it did in London with the train and shooting-up scene at M's hearing as complete nonsense- totally unrealistic that such planning could come together like it did...And their going to Skyfall as unarmed as they did, though Bond assumed the guns would still be there...And why drive the bike into the side of the bridge, instead of just jumping?...This may be what Roger Moore said- the best of all Bond films? Musically, the background which ran thru the movie was maybe the best. And those scenes with the Aston Martin- awesome. In fact, except for the criticisms already mentioned, I would say this was a totally awesome Bond film. I would, however, argue that Casino Royale was better, and this latest Bond was no better than Thunderball or Goldfinger, which put it in the upper-echelon, but maybe not the best.",8,2,7,17 April 2013
Dear John," Excellent
","Only criticism I could find is that the ending could have been better- that brief ending scene when they get back together didn't quite cut it.A 9/11-type love story, it was one that tugged at the heartstrings from start to finish. Channing and Amanda were great together; and, just as he was perfect for a Special Ops soldier, she was perfect in just about everything she did in the film. Thought every character in the film did a great job with their roles.Wanna see a great love story of the modern era- this one is on the list. And, yes, it does go deeper than a tough-guy soldier falling for a blond bombshell.",9,1,2,31 March 2013
Quantum of Solace," Has the best single Bond scene of all time
","For the most part, thought this was a good Bond film by recent standards, but numerous mistakes by the Director/Editor hurt the film.For instance- what was M doing in the last scene? The fact she should not have been there in the first place made it unreal. And Mr. White escapes? And where do they land in the parachute jump- the place that is the key to much of his enemy's plans? And what Bond does to Mr. Greene in the end doesn't leave margin for error? That said- this movie does have the best start to any Bond film, AND that short elevator scene with the MI6 Agents- that is the best of the best for Bond scenes ever- it shows just how good Bond is compared to even M's trusted other Agents- best of the best by a long shot.Music was good, as was the supporting cast- but could've been a much better effort by those behind the controls.",7,0,2,16 March 2013
Man on Fire," Great, but coulda been...
","An action movie with numerous character studies, I enjoyed the original film a great deal. Tugs at the heartstrings with the relationship between little Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington, who see life, in general, completely opposite, yet are brought together and form a bond of caring that is beautifully innocent, and parental.The matter that shocked me was when I came across the 'deleted' scenes, which explain numerous things left untold in the movie- and includes an ending that is very different than the one used (and in my opinion is better, and should have been used). Also, two key scenes with Mickey Rourke were not used that would have added much to the film- especially the one where he gets killed. All told, even with the added time used by including the deleted scenes, which would have made it a long movie- would have been worth it to the viewing public.",9,0,0,28 March 2013
The Bourne Supremacy," The Best Bourne
","Only criticism I can find is how he knew his enemy in the start of the film amongst a crowd. Then again, he's Jason Bourne.This was as good a sequel as the Godfather II or Superman II, and that's mighty praise. And I would venture to say this is better than any Bond film, or any other of the genre. Grabs you from start to finish in a way no Bond film has even tried to, and the action is better. And when you compare the ability of any Bond compared to Bourne- my money would be on Jason. Especially if one takes the gun out of the fight. And, oh, the music...If the Acadamy would ever do what it should and give an Oscar to the best Action/Adventure film of the year- this Bourne would have won it, easily. One of the best Actions ever.",10,1,2,16 March 2013
