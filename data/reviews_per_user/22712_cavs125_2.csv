The Monuments Men," A Good WWII Movie For Everyone
","The Monuments Men features an all-star cast and is directed by George Cloony. I felt as if the movie portrayed a great World War II story, but I think there was too much comedy for this type of movie. I enjoy good comedy movies, but I like a good serious war movie also. On a historical basis, it is basically spot on according to things I have read on the internet regarding the true story of the Monuments Men in World War II. I would not say it is an all-time great, but it is a good movie. It would be a good movie to see if you were taking your history class on a field trip because of the historical story and the is not a lot of language throughout the movie. I would not see the movie again, but I enjoyed it in theaters and suggest it for you.",Null,0,2,24 February 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Great Movie
","The Wolf of Wall Street wowed me when I saw the movie. I was thinking this movie was going to be all about sex, drugs, and alcohol like all the hype leading up to the premiere exclaimed. Even though it does have all of those things in it, it tells the story of the wall street genius, Jordan Belfort, quite well. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Belfort in this film well, and I believe this is one of DiCaprio's best performances since Titanic. Jonah Hill, another all-star actor, also performs a stellar role in this movie as Jordan Belfort's best friend Donnie Azoff. I would see this movie a second time because the overall story was great. I highly recommend seeing it, just don't take your children.",8,1,3,24 February 2014
