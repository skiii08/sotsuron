Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Is it worth the wait? Not quite. Is it a bad movie? Certainly not. Could it have been better? Yes. Is it fun? Absolutely.
","It's been 16 years since Luke, Han, Leia and the gang boogied down in the woods with the Ewoks at the end of 'Return of the Jedi'.  Now, finally, George Lucas has given us the first of his long awaited prequels. Unfortunately, those of us who loved Star Wars as kids have grown-up. After 16 years, is it worth the wait?  Not quite.  Is it a bad movie?  Certainly not.  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Is it fun?  Absolutely.The plot doesn't come together quite as easily as it should.  Things are a little confusing and the editing is very choppy.  At times it feels like the beginning and end of every scene was lopped off.  The final battle sequence is also where the movie's inherent flaw rears its ugly head.  The victory can't be cherished because we know, before long the bad guys will win out. Anakin is an adorable kid, but we know he's going to turn out to be Darth Vader.There is some new information: the nature and mechanics of the Force is elaborated upon, but the details we're given only raise more questions. We also learn some things that seem to contradict what we know from episodes IV, V & VI, as if Lucas is changing the rules of the universe his fans know so well, or maybe he's just making it up as he goes along.  The final scenes only hint at the developments to come in the next two installments.  When he gets around to making those, let's hope Lucas brings in someone to help with the script the way Lawrence Kasden did for Episodes V & VI.The special effects are a marvel to look at.  The film is a stunning visual layer cake that will need several repeat viewings to truly appreciate. But the chemistry between the human elements is lacking.  Not that the cast could not provide it, but Lucas' script doesn't give them a chance.  No one in this film can manage to do what Harrison Ford did in the original -- rise above the material.  All the actors here seem lost, as if they were given no direction at all.  Neeson does the best job.  McGregor isn't given much to do besides perfect his Alec Guinness impersonation; his talent is wasted. Portman is very gifted, but her performance here is erratic.  I'll blame Lucas for that.  (I also wondered why with all the impressive special effects, they couldn't give Neeson a better looking hairpiece.)Without the human magic, 'The Phantom Menace' can't come close to any of the original films.  You'll leave the theater pleased, but die hard Star Wars fans who've been waiting for more than a decade and a half for this may feel less than fulfilled.  Kids on the other hand will love it.  The movie is aimed squarely at them, and they will enjoy it the most.  And after all, isn't that how it should be?",Null,0,0,31 May 1999
Skyfall," Familiar, yet original
","For a film that happens to be the 23rd installment in a movie franchise, the latest James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is surprisingly original. Though it marks the series' 50th anniversary by paying homage to many of the previous movies, Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 is unlike any Bond movie we've seen before.The surprises start early. At the end of an opening action sequence that may be the most elaborate ever (it's actually three or four action sequences rolled into one), we are hit with an unexpected twist that puts Her Majesty's top secret agent out of action. While he's sidelined, a terrorist begins targeting MI6 and its covert agents. Bond must struggle to get back in the game so he can set out to uncover who's behind the plot.What follows is a movie that turns the Bond formula inside-out. While there is an element of globetrotting, and exotic locales are definitely featured, much of the movie actually takes place in the U.K. That's just one of the ways this Bond movie zigs where most others have zagged. And, without giving too much away, the movie's finale is set-up as an almost mirror image of all those we've seen before.This is also a film that takes place in the real world. Buildings still blow up (it is a Bond movie after all). But when they do, we quickly see Wolf Blitzer reporting the explosion on CNN as breaking news. In this version of the Bond Universe, when things go wrong, M is called to testify before a committee hearing.The more plausible setting fits with Craig's take on the classic character. In his first two Bond films, he presented the secret agent as a real flesh and blood human being. You can believe this guy really exists. This time out, he takes that characterization even further. Not only do we get to see him made weakened and addled by the physical rigors of his job, but we also dig deeper into his back-story than ever before. If Casino Royale began a reboot of the series, then Skyfall completes the Bond 'origin story'. In this movie, we learn more about who Bond is and how he came to be the man he is today, than we did in all the previous 50 years of 007 flicks.Of course, most Bond movies are only as good as their villain, and Javier Bardem's Silva may not be simply the best Bond villain ever, he may rank pretty high on the all-time movie bad guy list, too. Bardem simply outdoes himself as an evil mastermind bent not on world domination, but rather, revenge. With Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes as a guide, the scenes between Craig and Bardem are engrossing to watch. It gives us something else we haven't really seen before in a Bond movie: two great actors going head-to-head.There are also Bond girls, naturally. Naomi Harris livens things up as a spunky field agent. And the gorgeous Berenice Marlohe plays the obligatory woman-with-a-tragic-past. But the real female lead this time is Judi Dench's M. She is in many ways front and center in a story that deals with loyalty, principles and the moral ambiguities of national defense in the terrorist age. In a non-romantic way, she is also Bond's true love interest this time around.Skyfall looks back on the first 50 years of Bond, then shows him to us again in a new light and sets him up nicely for his next 50 years. As they always say in the closing credits, 'James Bond Will Return'.",9,253,432,10 November 2012
Iron Man 3," The logical conclusion of the Tony Stark Transformation
","The 'Iron Man' trilogy has always been, at its core, a story of redemption: Tony Stark, the billionaire weapons dealer who earns a fortune by exploiting armed conflict, takes up arms himself to end conflict. (It turns out Tony has a heart of gold, or rather, palladium.) 'Iron Man 3' completes the story by seeing Stark fully redeemed, while at the same time delving further into the nature and consequences of man's inhumanity to man. Oh, and it's also a rocking ton of popcorn-munching fun.Robert Downey Jr.'s main character began as a man who made weapons of mass destruction for profit while ignoring the human costs. Now, three films later, with his rocket-powered Iron Man suits honed to perfection, he's a weapon of mass destruction himself – one who experiences the human toll of combat first-hand. The film begins sometime after the events of last year's 'The Avengers,' which saw Stark teaming up with several other super heroes to fight alien invaders. It turns out the experience has left Tony with a bout of post-traumatic stress disorder.In this troubled state, he finds himself compelled to take on a sadistic terrorist threat known as The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. But The Mandarin is not all that he seems. There's a twist involving the villain that is as audacious as it is entertaining – one that forces us to question what we think we know about terrorist bogeymen. At the same time, people from Tony's past (namely a scientist with dubious motives played by Guy Pearce) emerge to cause him personal trouble – just as his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) hits a rocky patch. Inevitably, all these internal and external battles converge to create Stark's biggest challenge to date.The 'Iron Man' movies work because we like and care about Tony Stark -- because a great actor brings him to life. The best scenes in the Iron Man films have always involved Downey out of the suit -- watching a CGI robotic suit fly around can only be entertaining for so long. His witty one-liners and his improvised banter with Paltrow have made for some of the trilogy's best scenes. The filmmakers seem to have picked up on this fact – since the latest installment finds Tony forced to make due without the suit more than ever before. This movie resembles more of a James Bond flick – with a dash of buddy cop camaraderie thrown in for good measure (thanks to Tony's sidekick, Don Cheadle, as Iron Patriot a.k.a War Machine). New director Shane Black keeps the improvisational feel of the first two movies and doesn't allow the Academy honored cast members to get lost among all the explosions and effects. Most viewers won't notice much of a difference in tone. Maybe that's because the former director, Jon Favreau, was still on set, reprising his role as Tony's loyal employee, Happy Hogan. The most notable and unfortunate omission: AC/DC blaring on the soundtrack.Beneath the top-notch action set pieces and comic dialog, the movie does explore some serious themes. Tony's aforementioned PTSD isn't the only side effect of war that the movie delves into. The epidemic of suicides among war veterans is strongly hinted at in a subplot that sees returning soldiers literally turned into ticking time bombs. Another subplot also seems to examine the slippery slope of drone technology. This time around, Tony uses several remote controlled versions of his suit to defeat his enemies. This is not a movie that challenges us to stop and ponder complex issues, but if you do take the time to do so, the symbolism of unmanned killer flying robots shows what could happen if our advanced modern weaponry fell into the wrong hands. There are also references to the Deep Water Horizon disaster and the downside of our consumption of fossil fuels. However, these thought-provoking topics are merely hidden nutrients that sit below the surface of what is explicitly fun, feel-good summer entertainment.In the last act, Tony's transformation from war profiteer to war/super hero is brought to its logical conclusion. The ending certainly closes the loop and leaves us wondering if we'll ever see Downey's Iron Man in another stand-alone movie. If we don't, he'll be sorely missed – but we can say he went out on top.",8,0,2,18 May 2013
Gravity," A jaw-dropping story about the human spirit and the will to survive
","Gravity is a movie about trying to survive an impossible situation, and its filmmakers do something almost as difficult: Create a Hollywood blockbuster that's so original and eye-popping, it causes the collective jaw of jaded moviegoers to drop.This thriller about two astronauts stranded after a disaster in space is so harrowing, because its visuals are so believable. It's the rare movie where the effects are so convincing; you forget they are effects at all.In this day and age when every DVD seems to come with a whole batch of behind-the-scenes documentaries, most savvy moviegoers can spot the tricks of the trade and know how most cinematic illusions are achieved. So, it's enormously refreshing to watch a movie that is wall-to-wall special effects and not be able to discern any of its secrets. Director Alfonso Cuaron is known as an innovative filmmaker (any movie buff who has not seen Children of Men needs to stop what they're doing this instant and go see it). With this film, he devised a whole new bag of tricks to get the movie from script to screen. (One hint: Cuaron reportedly dangled the actors from wires inside a cube of LED lights. I can't begin to fathom how that translated into what you see on film – and I'm not sure if I want to know.) The result is a movie that demands to be seen not only in a theater, but in IMAX 3D. Splurge for the more expensive ticket – it's worth it.As it has often been said, the most spectacular effects are worthless if they're not used to tell a compelling story. Cuaron knows the audience must be invested in the characters. Having two likable stars -- Sandra Bullock and George Clooney -- helps accomplish that aim, as does a script that fleshes out their personae, albeit through some clumsy exposition. Clooney and Bullock are the only actors with speaking parts whose faces appear on screen, but they both have such natural charisma, they are all we really need to see. One other key character is heard but not seen: Ed Harris, in a clever bit of casting, reprises his Apollo 13 role as the voice of mission control. (Apparently, it's a law in Hollywood that you can't make a realistic movie about the space program without the star of The Right Stuff being involved in some way.) The character moments are sprinkled into a story that unfolds at breakneck pace in near real time. At a concise 91 minutes, the movie is perfectly structured and a model of narrative efficiency. Bullock's character barely gets a chance to catch her breath, and neither does the audience.Gravity is not without it flaws, however. Despite the movie's extremely realistic look, it contains a payload bay's worth of scientific inaccuracies. (Allow me to go all Space Geek on you for a moment.) Beyond the obvious fact the space shuttles are all currently residing in museums and that one of the other spacecraft depicted in the movie does not yet exist – there are other glaring problems. According to this movie, every man made object orbiting the earth is at the same altitude and latitude. (Fact: They're not.) Some basic laws of physics also apparently don't apply in this film's universe. (I could go on, but I won't.) The movie's accurate depiction of spaceflight, though, is less important than its emotional genuineness. It's a story about the human spirit and the will to survive. Bullock's character, a space rookie, was a doctor in her earthbound life and her backstory is a tragic one. For her, venturing to space is a way of escaping her pain. But in facing death, she discovers a newfound desire to live. It's an inspiring portrayal in a movie that is itself an inspiring artistic achievement.",8,8,13,19 October 2013
Unbreakable," Landing flat on the thin line between being incredibly cool and incredibly silly.
","'Unbreakable' shares many positive attributes with its predecessor, 'The Sixth Sense', not including the creepy, Philadelphia setting.  It too, is excitingly original, deftly mixes moments of genuine humor with episodes of human tragedy, features an excellent performance by a child actor, and above all, expertly inflicts on us chilling moments that will make you jump out of your seat while at the same time avoiding the distinction of actually being a horror film.Also like 'The Sixth Sense', Willis makes a remarkable discovery about himself.  What that discovery is lands flat on the thin line between being incredibly cool and incredibly silly.  I'll side marginally with incredibly cool since Shyamalan's concept and execution is so original, and it's hard not to like a filmmaker who's production office is in Conshohocken, PA.That said, the movie's primary flaw is its slack pace.  Bruce makes the discovery early on (there's another surprise at the end) and you'll wish his revelation had been explored more during the film's second act.  Then, when things finally get going in Act Three, we're hit with an ending that feels too abrupt -- you'll yearn for a more thorough confrontation (you'll also feel like this was all a set-up for a sequel).If 'Unbreakable' and 'The Sixth Sense' belong to the same family tree, then the newer branch is one that goes off in a much wilder direction.  Both films deal with the isolation of being 'different' as viewed through the prism of an everyman.  But where the first film also deals essentially with loss, this time the focus is more on the evolution of myths and the reflective nature of reality and fantasy in a manner that pays the ultimate tribute to comic book geeks everywhere.  Wait, maybe I've said too much!...",Null,1,1,4 December 2000
This Is the End," Doomsday has never been this funny
","The new comedy, 'This Is The End,' is a brilliant parody that shows us how a small group of privileged, self-absorbed Hollywood celebrities would react if they had to try and survive an apocalyptic nightmare.The movie's most brilliant conceit is having the actors all play themselves. It centers on a group of friends who've all co-starred together in various Judd Apatow projects. (Oddly enough, Apatow does not get a producer's credit on the movie.) They're gathered at James Franco's house for a party when all hell – literally – breaks loose. Several recognizable stars perish in the first act, and the survivors – Seth Rogen, Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel – barricade themselves inside Franco's ultra-modern Hollywood Hills mansion as the Book of Revelations unfolds outside the front door.These guys aren't used to being even slightly uncomfortable, let alone forced to live without basic necessities like food and water. Seeing these coddled creatures suddenly thrown into survivor mode is fodder for lots of comedy. The bickering over who gets to eat the house's lone Three Musketeers bar is classic. But mostly, the dilemma serves as a jumping off point for lots of wild, raunchy, sometimes surreal laugh-until-you're-gasping-for-air humor. It's a genuinely hilarious film, one helped by the fact he actors aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves and send-up their public personas and previous big-screen performances. After a while, though, even jokes at their own expense get old. Comedies work best 90-minutes at a time. At 107-minutes, the premise does start to wear a little thin.While the movie is about celebrities, at its core 'This Is The End,' is a relatable story about friendship. The central relationship is between Rogen and Baruchel as they struggle to keep their (on-screen) bromance strong as they grow apart and their careers go in different directions. Rogen co-wrote and co-directed the movie with his childhood friend, Evan Goldberg and their portrayal of friendship feels honest and real, despite the unreal circumstances in which the characters find themselves. (Watching the movie, I couldn't help but wonder if the pair drew on their own friendship for inspiration and if Baruchel – the least known of the actors – is merely a surrogate for Goldberg.) Your friendships say a lot about who you are, and a person's innate goodness and worthiness becomes a major theme. But it's unlikely you'll walk out of the theater reflecting upon any of that. What will probably stay with you are the dick jokes. And I get the feeling that's just fine with Rogen and the gang.",8,5,22,15 June 2013
42," An Important History Lesson
","The historical sports drama, 42, transports the viewer back in time to a different America: An America where discrimination is an accepted fact of life; an America where blacks and whites in the South are forced to use separate bathrooms; an America where a baseball manager could be suspended for sleeping with a Hollywood starlet; an America where 96 wins isn't enough to get a team into the MLB postseason (!). It's the age of Jackie Robinson – the man who changed America's Pastime and changed American attitudes about race.Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers' General Manager who made the bold decision to bring an African American into the Major Leagues in 1947. Ford is tremendous. It's a rare treat to watch one of Hollywood's most famous leading men disappear into a character. At first, it seems odd to see Ford playing an old curmudgeon. But then one comes to the astonishing realization that Ford (at age 70) is actually a few years older than Rickey was when he brought Robinson to Brooklyn. In the movie, Rickey professes that his motives are financial – the Dodgers have lots of African American fans that would pay to see Robinson play. He claims the only color he cares about is green. Ford's commanding and ultimately moving portrayal, however, hints at more decent and high-minded desires driving Rickey's decision. The Academy might as well start engraving Ford's name onto the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. This is his finest performance since The Mosquito Coast.Little-known actor Chadwick Boseman brings all the necessary elements to the role of Robinson. He looks like a ballplayer and is totally convincing in the baseball scenes. But he also effectively conveys the emotional turmoil inside a man forced to endure racially charged taunts and other various indignities due to the color of his skin. He shows the grace and class with which Robinson handled the onslaught. It took true courage to not fight back. It showed true character to turn the other cheek. One wonders what would have happened had Robinson not taken the high road – or hadn't been such a remarkable ballplayer. Jackie Robinson's success was an important step toward racial equality in the U.S. How much slower would progress have been if he hadn't come along? The rest of the cast consists mainly of TV actors, most notably Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher, the fiery manager who quashes his players' objections to Robinson's inclusion on the team. The actors mostly look like athletes (1940s athletes anyway) and baseball action has a more realistic look and feel than most baseball films. Computer graphics are also effectively used to recreate long-since-demolished ballparks like Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds in exact detail.The script by writer/director Brian Helgeland is straightforward, but unlike most sports movies, there's no 'big game' at the end. Real life provided no such drama (the 1947 Dodgers lost the Fall Classic to the Yankees). So, Helgeland manufactures a climax by staging a fourth inning at-bat in a mid-September game as if it's the seventh game of the World Series. It's a bit of a cheat, but it works.Helgeland avoids sanitizing the racial vitriol hurled at Robinson. He plainly shows the ignorance and prejudice that was openly expressed – most infamously by Phillies' manager Ben Chapman. (Philadelphia fans won't find much to be proud of in the movie. Going in, I knew the ugly part the City of Brotherly Love played in Robinson's story, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch. The Phillies were the last National League team to integrate – this movie shows why that was likely the case.) At the same time, the filmmakers present a movie that most families will still find acceptable for young fans that don't know Robinson's story or his significance in American history. You hear lots of n-words, but not nearly as many as your average Tarantino film. And each character that uses them is sternly chastised on screen. (Aside from those scattered slurs, there isn't much that most parents would find objectionable.)",9,2,3,18 April 2013
Argo," A gripping and suspense-filled drama
","Movies are entertainment. Normally, even the best ones can't change the world. But in 1980, a sci-fi B-movie -- one that didn't even get made -- actually saved some American lives. Argo is the true-life tale of how an un-produced Star Wars knock-off was used to rescue hostages in Iran.Ben Affleck stars in and directs the story of an astonishing covert CIA operation that remained classified for decades. He plays Tony Mendez, the operative assigned to infiltrate Iran and sneak out with six U.S. diplomats who managed to escape from the American Embassy while it was being taken over by revolutionaries. He devises a cover story -- he'll pose as a Canadian film producer scouting locations for a space opera.To convince the Iranian authorities – he has to set-up a real production company, and find a real script. But navigating the cutthroat world of Hollywood agents and studios proves almost as formidable as dealing with hostile Middle Eastern regimes.The action later shifts to Iran, as Mendez carries out his mission. One false move along the way, and the operation fails. The result is a gripping and suspense-filled drama that won't let you breathe easy.Affleck gives a nice, subtle performance as Mendez (he's also so lacking in vanity that he allows himself to be shown with a ridiculous shag haircut). The rest of the cast is terrific as well – especially Alan Arkin and John Goodman, who play the real filmmakers Mendez teams up with to help carry-out the plan. Production Designer Sharon Seymour does an outstanding job of recreating the look and feel of the late '70s and early 80s.People in show business seem to love honoring movies about show business. So, I wouldn't be surprised if Argo scores big on Oscar night.",9,0,0,17 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Enjoyable but ultimately misguided
","Star Trek Into Darkness The second installment of J.J. Abrams' alternate universe Star Trek series is the most action-packed in the history of the franchise but it may also turn out to be one of the most divisive. While 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is well made, well acted, well written and enjoyable, it is also ultimately misguided.As the film opens, the young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is still experiencing growing pains when it comes to commanding a starship. Kirk will do anything to protect his space-faring family, even if it means sometimes violating sacred Starfleet rules and lying on official reports. He's proud of the fact he hasn't lost a single member of his crew. But what Kirk doesn't understand is, he can't truly become the leader he needs to be until he's ready to face death.The plot kicks into motion when a terrorist (the terrific Benedict Cumberbatch) attacks Starfleet installations in London and San Francisco (this episode spends so much time on the home planet that it could almost be called 'Earth Trek'). Kirk and the rest of the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise are sent to track down the terrorist and take him out with long range, unmanned weapons. (Sound familiar?) But these drones, uh, I mean torpedoes, are not what they seem – nor is the terrorist they are aimed at. It is difficult to say much more about the plot without giving too much away, but the story leads to a showdown with one of the greatest enemies the Enterprise ever faced. While the events of Abrams' Trek movies occur in an alternate time-line, it seems certain events are predetermined to occur – certain foes are destined to be faced – though not in the same way, and not with the same outcomes.The movie is visually dazzling and has many fun moments. A sequence involving a high-speed spacewalk through a debris field looks amazing in IMAX 3D. But in the end, the movie is too derivative. The last film satisfied a thirst by returning the characters we loved, but at the same time, sent them on a new adventure. This movie takes the characters we are very familiar with and runs them through a plot we've mostly seen before, albeit with some clever twists. If we want to see the old characters in an old story – we can pop in an old DVD and watch the original cast do it better. Next time, I hope the new versions of old crew boldly go somewhere their characters haven't been before.",6,0,9,18 May 2013
The Mummy," If you're looking for a good (pre-Star Wars) Saturday matinee Summer movie, this is it.
","A B-Movie that's a send-up of B-Movies, The Mummy follows in the tounge-in-cheek tradition of the Evil Dead films.  There's plenty of action and horror, but the movie doesn't take any of it seriously for even a minute.  You're laughing too hard to be scared; writer/director Stephen Sommers knows his subject matter is silly, and he gives the film the perfect tone.Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster have been revived in recent years, so it seems only natural that The Mummy would have enjoy a big-budget remake as well.   But this revival is enjoyable because it captures the fun of monster movies.",8,0,0,9 May 1999
Interstellar," Love Transcends All Space & Time
","The Nolans (director Chris and co-writer Jonathan), treat us to one of the grandest space adventures we've seen in awhile. It's the kind of adventure you go to the movies to see, an adventure filled with some truly heart-pounding sequences which further cement Chris Nolan's reputation as a great action director. He makes full use of the IMAX format, not only visually but audibly, too. The supersized frame and booming sound mix create an immersive experience.Nolan also deftly navigates his actors through several exposition-heavy scenes that would have otherwise threatened to drag down the film. In addition, he and his brother came up with some very clever ways to visualize some very complicated theories of physics, theories that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Some may complain about the movie's pacing. It weighs in with a robust running time of 169 minutes. But as I was watching it, I was in no rush for the movie to end. While Interstellar may be too derivative to be truly great, it's still quite a ride.The film takes its inspiration from many sources. There are doses of everything from The Right Stuff to both Star Trek (exploring strange new worlds) and Star Wars (helpful droids, icy planets). But there is no doubt that 2001 is the model. Its influences are seen in everything from the slow, majestic shots of heavenly bodies, to Hans Zimmer's haunting music cues. At times, it almost seems like the Nolans decided to have their characters drop in to visit each of the worlds glimpsed in Odyssey's famously trippy 'star gate' sequence. The aspect where the movie most resembles Kubrick's is its insistence on respecting the laws of physics and treating space travel realistically. This is the rare space-based story that not only acknowledges the Theory of Relativity, but also uses it as a serious obstacle. As the crew of Cooper's ship speeds away from Earth, time starts moving more slowly for them. As they approach a black hole, the time dilation becomes even greater. Over the course of what seems like just hours to the astronauts, decades pass back on Earth. (That is not to say there are no nits to pick in the plausibility department. A healthy suspension of disbelief is still required.)Where 2001 and Interstellar depart are their themes and points of view. Kubrick takes a cynical, detached view of humanity. He observes the characters in his space odyssey as if they were rats in a maze. The Nolans' film is far more empathetic and emotionally driven. While 2001 was about a big idea – the search for our creator and an understanding of our place in the universe – Interstellar is about something much smaller and more basic: The love between a parent and a child.The movie's central relationship is between Cooper and his daughter, Murphy (she's played by Mackenzie Foy as a child and by Jessica Chastain as an adult - and the two actresses bear a remarkable resemblance to each other). She is the reason Cooper embarks on the journey and she is the reason he is determined to find his way home. The movie postulates that love is a force as powerful as gravity, a force that can endure unimaginable distances and infinite stretches of time, and a force that can't be defined by a simple equation.There won't be many dry eyes in the house as the movie comes to its conclusion. That's thanks to an excellent stable of actors who allow the movie's emotions to resonate and the audience to become invested. McConaughey's everyman persona is exactly what his character required. And he's not the only Oscar winner in the cast. In fact, a past Academy Award winner (including one you won't see in the trailers) fills out just about every other major role in the film.The only thing Interstellar reveres more than science and exploration -- is humanity. Like all great art, it is a commentary on life. It shows us that when it comes to saving our species, the only superior beings we need to look to are ourselves. And when it comes to unraveling the mysteries of our place in the universe, we need only to look inside the human heart.",8,0,4,14 November 2014
American Hustle," A love triangle examining the lies we tell others and ourselves
","American Hustle opens with the sight of Christian Bale as we've never seen him before: It's Batman with a beer belly and a bad comb-over, one which we see him meticulously craft – strand by strand -- in front of a mirror. It's a metaphor for -- and a foreshadowing of -- the elaborate deceptions we're about to witness.As the opening disclaimer exuberantly states: 'Some of this actually happened.' Director David O. Russell's seriocomedy is loosely based on the Abscam scandal/sting operation of the late 1970s. Bale and Amy Adams play a pair of con artists who are nabbed by an ambitious – and often unscrupulous -- FBI agent, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper's character promises to let them walk in exchange for their help in taking down other corrupt characters. But as we soon see, nearly everyone in this movie is scamming someone else.All the major characters are pretending to be something that they are not in order to manipulate others and get what they want. The main theme is the struggle of these characters to maintain their facades while suppressing their true selves. They may be able to fool others, but can only fool themselves for so long.The film is, at its core, a love triangle involving the characters played by Bale, Cooper and Adams. It examines how true love can give someone the courage and desire to be truly honest with another person. The leading trio gives impressive and dynamic performances, disappearing into their roles. All three leading cast members have previously appeared in one of Russell's films, as have supporting players Jennifer Lawrence (who maximizes her limited screen time, stealing ever scene she's in) and Shea Whigham. Russell (Three Kings, Silver Linings Playbook) reuses so many actors; he seems to be in the process of starting his own repertory company. Comedian Louis C.K. also adds to his burgeoning film resume with his second terrific supporting role of 2013 (his part in Blue Jasmine being the other). The weak link is Jeremy Renner, who is badly miscast as a New Jersey Mayor.The movie captures the period perfectly, from the fashions and hairdos -- right down to the tin lids on jars of Skippy peanut butter. Russell propels the action with a superlative musical score of wall-to-wall (mostly)'70s hits. He even uses the old school Columbia Pictures logo from that era.With American Hustle's Me Decade time period, its criminal underworld setting, heavy use of voice-over narration, numerous wide-angle tracking shots, freeze-frames and aforementioned generous use of pop hits on the soundtrack, it would be understandable if someone mistakenly believed that The Wolf of Wall Street wasn't the only movie Martin Scorsese directed this past year. I'll simply assume that this movie is Russell homage to Scorsese. (He even includes one of Scorsese's frequent collaborators in a surprise cameo.) The movie's primary flaw is the fact it's a little lacking in the pathos department. Because nearly every character in the movie lies, deceives or manipulates in some way, it's hard to root for anyone. So, the resolution, when it arrives, is rather joyless.",7,0,2,9 January 2014
Rush," Rocky vs. Rocky. The audience wins.
","Most sports movies involve an underdog trying to defeat an established champion. We've seen a million variations of Rocky Balboa taking on Apollo Creed. But what if someone made a film about Rocky fighting another Rocky? That's what director Ron Howard has done with his excellent new racing movie, 'Rush.' The most compelling aspect of this tale of two long shots is that it's not the invention of a screenwriter. It actually happened. The drama centers on the rivalry between two drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and the movie follows each man's unlikely rise to the top ranks of the Formula One circuit. The heart of the action takes place during the dramatic 1976-racing season during which the British Hunt and the Austrian Lauda vied for the world championship. They both overcame enormous adversity and risked their lives for the chance to win it all. Danger is a major theme hovering over the story, as the potential for death lurks around every turn of track. In this era of racing, an average of two drivers were killed each year.Howard seems to be at his best when he's telling true stories ('Apollo 13,' 'A Beautiful Mind'). The Academy Award winner here re-teams with his 'Frost/Nixon' collaborator Peter Morgan, a screenwriter who also specializes in films based on real events ('The Queen, ' 'The Deal'). Howard and Morgan resist the urge to embellish the story for dramatic effect, unlike some other filmmakers (I'm talking to you, Ben Affleck). The great script is paired with stunning visuals. Howard immerses us in the racing scenes. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle's cameras put us on the course, on the cars, behind the wheel and even inside the engines. The track sequences demand to be seen -- and just as importantly, heard – in the theater.But the drivers themselves are the reason we want to go along for the ride. The two competitors could not be more different. Hunt, the charismatic, womanizing playboy, is played by Chris Hemsworth (Thor), while Daniel Bruhl plays Lauda, the quirky mechanical savant who has a way with machines, but not with people. Both actors create engaging portraits of the respective drivers, but Bruhl's performance is the one that will no doubt generate awards buzz.Audiences, however will root for both men. Neither is the villain. The intense competition pushes each man to excel beyond what they would have otherwise achieved. They make each other better. It's Sosa vs. McGwire, only with spark plugs instead of steroids. The only shame is that one of the men had to lose.",8,6,9,26 September 2013
Man of Steel," Not As Great As The Sum Of Its Parts
","Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel,' is a film that has many pluses. In fact, there's a lot to like about this movie. But the whole is not as great as the sum of its parts. Elements of the movie work very well. Others do not.The scenes of young Clark Kent growing up in Kansas are surprisingly poignant and original. Little Clark is overwhelmed by his super-sensitive hearing and x-ray vision. It seems that when you can hear everything, it's hard to hear anything. And he's freaked out by the fact he can see through everyone's skin. You really feel for the kid. The scene where Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) reveals to Clark that he's adopted is genuinely touching.I did enjoy the movie's main enhancement of the origin story: the idea that Clark spends years in the wind, wandering from one odd job to another, helping save people through feats of strength, then vanishing. Lois Lane (the perfectly cast Amy Adams) is the intrepid reporter who learns of the mystery man's existence and tries to track him down. I never bought the idea -- put forth in previous versions -- that a smart journalist wouldn't be able to figure out Superman's true identity, especially when he works in her office. This time, she figures out Clark Kent is Superman before anyone even calls him by that name – a radical but welcome change. As for Superman himself, the latest actor to wear the cape does a fine job. In fact, Henry Cavill is probably the best thing about the movie. He absolutely looks and sounds the part. The British thespian has no problem projecting an all-American wholesomeness and earnestness. He has great chemistry with Adams. And his costume doesn't need any padding in the muscle department. A shirtless scene early in the movie makes it clear: The dude's been working out.The visual effects are fantastic. The contrails that follow Superman in flight are an especially nice touch. Unfortunately, director Snyder seems to have gone to the Michael Bay School of Action Directing. There's lots of shaking of the camera and quick cutting – all of which make the mayhem – and there's lots of it -- more difficult to follow. As Superman and Zod do battle, instead of injuring each other, they trash everything around them. And by everything, I mean skyscrapers. When it comes to comic book-style city smashing, 'Man of Steel' makes 'The Avengers' look like a school play. I'm not sure why Hollywood thinks mass property destruction is entertaining. At one point, I wanted to shout, 'Guys, take your fight to some other planet and leave our buildings alone!' None of this brawling is as fun as it should be. And the onslaught of action in the overly long third act almost becomes too much.'Man of Steel' has plenty of spectacle. But the action and effects are all for naught if you don't care about the people on screen. As good as Cavill's performance is, the script doesn't give us an opportunity to become invested in him emotionally. The story turns him into a loner for most of the movie. The other characters don't get to know him – and neither does the audience. It's hard to love a character who's kept at arm's length. It's also hard to understand why this alien has any desire to protect the people of Earth since – in his early years -- they are constantly shown bullying him and treating him like crap, because they know he won't fight back. You wonder why the experience didn't make him hate the entire human race. The movie never tells you.So, where does Superman go from here? For me, Cavill is a keeper. Next time, they just need a script that helps us identify with him more. This movie spends a lot of time reminding us that Superman is an alien. Maybe next time they can remind us that he's a living breathing being, too.",5,1,3,15 June 2013
Cast Away," An involving story of survival.
","For FedEx manager Chuck Noland, played by Tom Hanks, time is everything. It's the unforgiving taskmaster that enforces order in his life, and adhering to that order, making sure packages get where they have to be when they have to be there, gives Chuck a sense of control -- a false sense, it turns out. It's not until his FedEx plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific, stranding him alone on a deserted island, that Chuck is forced to confront the difficult truth that we all are merely at the mercy of the ebb and flow of fate. This involving examination of how a modern man, stripped of his pager and cell phone, might react if left to survive on his own in the wild comprises the premise of 'Cast Away'.Being alone on screen for nearly an entire film would be an immense challenge for any actor, but Hanks proves he's more than up to the task. The actor also deserves extra kudos for his dedication. Production on the movie halted for a year while Hanks shed 55 pounds and grew a long beard for the movie's second half which takes place four years after he was originally stranded. Guys with two Academy Awards who make $25 million a picture don't have to do that sort of thing. Helen Hunt is also very good as the girlfriend Chuck leaves behind. As bleak as Cast Away can be in its darker moments, the film does leave us with an uplifting message -- it's the philosophy that ultimately motivates Chuck to survive: One tide of fate may land you on a deserted island, but the next tide might just deliver you home.",Null,0,0,31 December 2000
Silver Linings Playbook," A raw, honest and funny comedic drama about two broken people who help fix each other.
","If you watch a game with a die-hard Philadelphia sports fan, you may think they're bipolar. One minute they're on cloud nine. One bad play later -- they're in the depths of despair. Most Philadelphians who are crazy about sports aren't really crazy. But Silver Linings Playbook is about one Philly sports fan who does in fact happen to have a serious personality disorder.This isn't a movie about sports, though. Sports are merely the motif for a raw, honest and funny comedic drama about two broken people who help fix each other.The movie set in 2008. We know this because of several real-life sporting events referenced throughout the movie event that myself -- and many other Philly sports fans -- remember well. (I loved that there's an entire scene built around a discussion of DeSean Jackson's infamous goal line blooper.) Bradley Cooper, himself a native of the Philadelphia suburbs, plays Pat Solitano, a substitute teacher who returns to live with his parents after spending eight months in a mental hospital. He's desperate to reconcile with his wife, who has gotten a restraining order against him. Things get complicated when he meets a beautiful-but-troubled young widow named Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Both have seen their lives unravel -- one because of a mental illness, one because of a tragedy. The movie is about getting closure, about letting go, and about finding that silver lining.Cooper gets to show more range and paint with a broader pallet than his usual leading man roles have allowed, and he takes full advantage of the opportunity. Robert DeNiro plays Pat's father and he gives the kind of terrific, moving performance you expect that from an actor of his legendary status. Lawrence is also quite good. The true revelation, however, is comedian Chris Tucker who has a small role as one of Pat's fellow patients. He gives a subtle performance that seems far removed from the brash persona he became known for in the Rush Hour movies.The rest of the cast and crew do their jobs well. Danny Elfman's jazzy score is one of his best, and a great soundtrack that features everyone from Led Zeppelin to Stevie Wonder supplements it.Director David O. Russell (who adapted Matthew Quick's novel) specializes in movies about troubled young men and their families. In the Solitano family, life is centered on sports. Russell understands what many who don't appreciate sports often fail to grasp. Loving sports is not just about the love of the game – it's about being part of a community, it's the way fathers and sons bond with each other and how total strangers find common ground. When Pat speaks of his fondness for Sundays spent watching football, he talks as much about the game day food his mother's cooks as he does about the game itself.Pat's personal motto is 'Excelsior,' which is Latin for 'ever upward.' He's an optimist who believes he can improve himself and better days are ahead. In other words -- as every Philadelphia sports fan knows -- there's always next year.",9,1,3,17 January 2013
Pearl Harbor," A spectacular calamity -- and I'm not talking about the attack!
","About thirty minutes into the new movie Pearl Harbor I realized that I'd been rolling my eyes so much that they actually started to hurt. But as time went on, the eye-rolling and the groaning gave way to laughter and smiles as I began to revel in sheer amazement that so many people could spend so much money to produce something so stupefyingly awful. Make no mistake, Pearl Harbor is a bad movie. But at the same time, I would be hard pressed to discourage anyone from seeing it. To do so would deprive them of the rare opportunity to take in a spectacular calamity -- and I'm not talking about the Japanese sneak attack. Film students would be wise to see the film so as to learn what not to do. The script is so wrought with cliches and bad dialogue, it stands as a lesson in how not to write a screenplay. Drama students should see the movie to learn how not to act on screen. The one thing you won't learn much about, is World War II.
The movie is less concerned with Japanese troop movements and preparations than it is with a fictional love triangle between two best-buddy fighter pilots and the cute nurse they both love.
Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, respectively, two Tennessee farm boys-turned hot shot aces. Early scenes of the boys in training are highly reminiscent of another Jerry Bruckheimer-produced picture -- Top Gun (one of their fellow pilots is even named, Goose).
Affleck's performance is very hammy. Putting on a silly Southern accent, Affleck's Rafe comes across as more of a caricature than a character. Hartnett, on the other hand, is so devoid of personality and charisma that his character barely registers at all. As the American nurse, Evelyn, British actress Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous in the period costumes, and she's the only one of the three who doesn't embarrass herself.
The love story is so full of corn, I began to wonder if the filmmakers had to pay royalties to the Orville Redenbacher company. There's more corn here than in the whole state of Iowa.
Of course, the romance is only there to fill time until we get to the other main reason to see the picture -- the attack sequence, which is visually spectacular. Director Michael Bay once again shows his only real talent is knowing how to blow stuff up (there's a shot where the camera follows a bomb as it hurtles toward the deck of the USS Arizona; it's very cool). But as great as the sequence looks, it lacks power. It's like watching a video game. Only extras and bit players bite the dust -- there's no emotional connection to the horror we're witnessing. There's also very little blood and carnage; the nameless, faceless sailors just disappear in balls of fire as the bombs hit their targets.  None of it feels real. When the film cuts to Evelyn at the base hospital, Bay intentionally makes the image blurry so we're spared very graphic shots of the wounded.
As good a showman as Bay is, he's also sloppy at times. There's a shot of a B-29 that's supposed to be flying, but from the angle of the aircraft, it's clear that the plane is merely sitting on a runway with its propellers spinning.
After the Pearl Harbor sequence, the movie attempts an appropriate third act resolution by tacking on the true-life story of Doolittle's Raiders, who made a daring bombing run over Tokyo that boosted American morale and provided a little revenge. Once again our fictional flyboys are conveniently placed in the middle of the action. But the movie takes a turn for the worse with Alec Baldwin's ludicrously over-the-top performance as Col. Doolittle, the leader of the raid. It's as if Baldwin thinks he's doing a Saturday Night Live sketch -- he's a parody of himself.
The other prominent historical figure on display is Franklin Roosevelt, played very nicely by Jon Voight. The make-up job, by effects wizard Stan Winston, is stunning. Voight is made to look so much like FDR, it's scary.
But what's really scary is the movie's dumbing down of American history. At one point, we get a look inside the cockpit of one of the Japanese fighter planes, and we see a photo of the battleship Arizona, placed there so the pilot can recognize his target. But beneath the photo, the ship's name is written out -- in English!. It's just one example of how little respect the movie has for its audience.",3,0,0,2 June 2001
Foxcatcher," Wrestling With A Demon
","The saga of John du Pont is one of the more bizarre and tragic stories from the mid-1990s. In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.Channing Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.Like Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.As du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.Foxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.",9,173,236,14 November 2014
Django Unchained," An enjoyable ride, albeit one that travels an uneven road and takes too long to get where it's going
","Like Quentin Tarantino's last film, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is an historical revenge fantasy. This time it's a mash-up homage to Blaxploitation films and Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns. Its entertainment value stems from the primal satisfaction of watching a freed slave kill white slave traders in gruesome ways.We're treated to Tarantino's usual masterful dialog and to some terrific performances, especially the supporting players. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio are very engaging in their roles. And in what should be considered one of the strongest performances of his long and varied career, Samuel L. Jackson plays a house slave – the true villain of the piece.The story takes place in the American South, a few years before the Civil War. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave who is unshackled by King Schultz (Waltz) -- a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter who needs Django's help in tracking down a trio of fugitives. Django quickly becomes Schultz's partner. 'Kill white people and get paid for it?' asks Django. 'What's not to like?' But Django has another quest in mind that's more personal. He wants to find his wife (Kerry Washington), rescue her from slavery, and head with her to the North. Schultz agrees to help him, and the pair set out for the plantation of Calvin Candie (DiCaprio) so that Django can find his true love and carry out a little (okay, a lot of) vengeance.If you're looking for a thoughtful drama about a man overcoming slavery and yearning for freedom, this isn't it. No, this is really just an action movie about a man trying to rescue his princess. (The character of the wife, Broomhilda, is seriously underdeveloped and we're never really shown why Django cares for her so much -- other than the fact that, well, she looks like Kerry Washington – and really, that may be reason enough.) This also isn't an attempt to accurately recreate the slavery-era. It feels more like an attempt to recreate '70s movies about slavery.There are also very few slavery movies that will make you laugh this hard. The movie is, at its core, very much a comedy. In one scene, members of an early version of the Ku Klux Klan complain about their hoods and the fact they can't see out of the eye-holes. It's one of the best scenes Tarantino has ever written. The only thing more satisfying than watching Klan members getting slaughtered – is watching them look like buffoons. Tarantino isn't trying to make us think or learn lessons about history. He's trying to entertain us. And, for the most part, he does his job very well.Typical of a Tarantino film, some of the moments designed to amuse the most – involve spectacular bloodletting. Using ultra-violence as a punch line is one of the director's specialties. He paints deplorable portraits of certain characters, and then builds tension to the point that when their absurdly excessive punishment is handed out – it serves as a cathartic release. The director plays on the audience's darkest instincts, knowing that on some level, many viewers like seeing bad guys get what they deserve in especially painful ways. Especially if it's 'just a movie.' It's cheap. It's easy. But when choreographed by someone as skilled as Tarantino, it's also very effective.Not all of the violence is meant to provide perverse thrills, though. There are scenes that depict the brutality and inhumanity of slavery. They are difficult to watch, but serve to make the justice that Django hands out that much more satisfying. However, this creates a balancing act. Alternating between violence that is meant to horrify and violence meant to satisfy our blood lust creates a tonal inconsistency that plagues the movie.The violence isn't the only cause for controversy. There's also the frequent use of a certain vulgar, derogatory word for African-Americans. But its usage is historically accurate, and also mostly functions as shorthand to distinguish good guys from bad guys. If a character uses the word, it's a safe bet they're eventually going to get shot.My primary complaint with the film, however, is the pacing. Sadly, Tarantino's longtime editor, Sally Menke, passed away before production began and her absence is perhaps the reason why the movie drags. The beginning and ending are strong, but the second act is bloated and slow moving. The film comes to a screeching halt during a tortuously long dinner scene that's meant to build tension – but instead bores us. The long dialog scene is also designed to demonstrate the depths of Candie's evil racism. But it's unnecessary, given that his despicable nature is well established the moment he first appears on screen – a harrowing scene in which he revels in watching two slaves fight to the death. The long dinner sequence also mostly sidelines the movie's main character, causing the film's momentum to stall.Django Unchained is an enjoyable ride, albeit one that travels an uneven road and takes too long to get where it's going. If it had been steadier, leaner and about 40 minutes shorter, it may have ranked among Tarantino's best. But it's still quite an experience.",7,3,8,17 January 2013
Lincoln," A movie for the ages
","Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is not a traditional biopic. It takes the view that a man's life is measured by his deeds. So, rather than trace the 16th President's whole life story, the film gives us a portrait of Abraham Lincoln by focusing mainly on the few weeks in early 1865 when he achieved his signature deeds: ending slavery and preserving the union. In seeing how he led the nation at that pivotal moment, we learn all we need to know about who he was and how he lived.Daniel Day-Lewis brings Lincoln to life in a way that is both unexpected and likely to forever change our concept of the man. Our image of Lincoln has been so shaped by statues and still photos; it is hard to remember he was a living, breathing person. Day-Lewis' mesmerizing performance shows us a Lincoln who is engaging, charismatic, funny and sometimes fiery. This is the Lincoln who could captivate crowds with his oratory, who could inspire others to follow him.Lincoln is not a movie where the drama is played out against a backdrop of politics. In this movie, politics is the drama. This is a movie about process. It lays bare the often-ugly route leaders had to take to accomplish change in the 19th century (a route that doesn't seem much different than the ones today). It's a movie that's about principle versus compromise, and the balance that needs to be struck to get things done. In one scene, Lincoln makes a poignant analogy while speaking with abolitionist Representative Thaddeus Stevens (played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones – who nearly steels the movie). Lincoln reminds Stevens that a compass can tell you which way is North, but it can't tell you where the swamps are along the way. It would probably do every politician a lot of good to watch that scene.To tell this story, Spielberg has assembled one of the most impressive casts in movie history. From the wonderful Sally Field, to the aforementioned Mr. Jones; from the always-incredible David Straitharn to the great Hal Holbrook; from the hilarious James Spader to the terrific Michael Stuhlbarg – from top to bottom, nearly every speaking role is filled by one of our finest actors.This is a movie that is simply saturated in greatness. We have our greatest living director (Spielberg), working from a script by one of America's greatest playwrights (Tony Kushner), based in part on a book by one of our greatest historians (Doris Kearns Goodwin), starring arguably the western world's greatest actor (Day-Lewis) – all to tell the story of our greatest president. When Lincoln died, it was said, 'Now he belongs to the ages.' Lincoln, the movie, is one for the ages, too.",10,6,13,17 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Original, Unexpected & Epic
","I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and The Last Jedi left me speechless. I literally couldn't talk when it was over. My throat couldn't make a sound. The lump in it was too big. It's weird and hilarious and heartbreaking and more action packed than any other Star Wars movie. I lost track of how many times I wept while watching Rian Johnson's film. But I'm sure I also laughed hard just as many times, if not more. Nothing can prepare you for the emotional ride it takes you on. It's a truly epic journey that has enough plot twists for two movies. It's also a true example of auteur filmmaking, and it gives us some startlingly beautiful images that I still can't get out of my head.The line in the trailer was right: This isn't going to go the way you think. The answers it provides to the questions posed by The Force Awakens are unexpected, but they all make perfect sense. It's original and surprising and deeply moving and it will change the way you view Star Wars - in a good way.",10,2,10,19 December 2017
Mission: Impossible II," A heart racing thrill-ride, John Woo at his best
","In 'Mission:Impossible -- 2' Tom Cruise's mission is clear -- make a sequel that stands out.  And it's Mission:Accomplished, thanks to the actor/producer's hiring of Hong Kong Action Master John Woo as the film's director.On the surface, the addition of Woo means Cruise's IMF Agent Ethan Hunt now fires two guns at once inside of one.  It also means that Tom Cruise, Hollywood Mega Star Pretty Boy instantly becomes Tom Cruise, Kung Fu Badass.But there's more to Woo's style than just slo-mo angles of double-fisted gunplay and ludicrously acrobatic karate moves.  The director brings an over-the-top, operatic melodrama to the standard espionage story that justifies the preposterously far-fetched action.   Woo's accent marks are all over the film -- from a scene very early on showing one character's split-second vision of apocalyptic doom, to a close-up of a fire reflecting in the villain's tormented eyes, and to -- perhaps most memorably -- a ubiquitous John Woo white dove preceding one of Cruise's most dramatic entrances.  The movie is much closer to Woo's classic films than to anything on the old '60s TV show.The film's last 45 minutes are a non-stop, heart-racing ride.  The sequence concludes with another standard John Woo feature -- two friends, turned mortal enemies, in a prolonged mano-a-mano slugfest death match in a remote area, in this case a rocky cliff above the ocean.  It doesn't get more dramatic than that, and movies don't get more thrilling than 'Mission:Impossible -- 2'.",8,1,1,28 May 2000
World Trade Center," A life-affirming movie about courage
","It's a little known story from a day we know all too well. 'World Trade Center' tells the gripping true story of two of the last men pulled out of the rubble of Ground Zero alive.Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena play Port Authority Police officers. In the film's heart- pounding opening minutes, we watch the attack unfold through the eyes of these first responders. As the routine morning becomes anything but routine, the officers glimpse news reports (we are thankfully spared any images of the plane striking the towers) and get bits of information from cellphone calls to family members as they race downtown. But what's most striking is how little the men know about what's really happening. As the officers prepare to the climb the North Tower, they are unaware the South Tower has even been hit. Communications gear is failing, and there is confusion all around.Through impeccably detailed sets and flawless special effects, director Oliver Stone and his film-making team recreate these hectic moments in all-too-realistic detail. You're right there, on the street, looking up and watching the chaos unfold in 35mm and THX surround sound. If you didn't know any better, you'd think Stone had a crew shooting in Lower Manhattan that day. You have to struggle to remind yourself everything you're seeing was recreated on a sound stage on inside a computer.Screenwriter Andrea Berloff further enhances the realism with believable dialog. She not only effectively captures the 'cop talk' (half the time, there's so much lingo being bantered back and forth, you don't understand what the heck the characters are saying -- as it should be), she also delivers a truth and honesty to the conversations and interactions. The words never feel contrived.The quality cast does the script justice. It's remarkable how well Cage, a major movie star, disappears behind the mustache and hunched shoulders of Sgt. John McLoughlin. Pena (last seen as the locksmith in 'Crash') is instantly likable as Ofc. Jimeno. Their performances are even more noteworthy considering they spend the majority of the movie flat on their backs. They are also well supported by Maria Bello and Magie Gyllenhaal as their respective wives, who spend much of the film enduring an agonizing wait to learn the fate of their husbands.Stone's storytelling is also more methodical and straightforward than it's been in recent years. He mercifully ditches the frenetic editing style he's employed in films like Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday.***Not Political***When one hears that Oliver Stone, director of such politically charged films as JFK and Born on the Fourth Of July, is making a movie about 9/11, your first tendency is to say, 'uh oh.' But this may be the least political movie Stone has ever made, one both red states and blue states can agree on. It's not about the roots of terror, or who's to blame for what. It's not about villains. It's about heroes. Though set during one of America's darkest hours, it tells a life-affirming story of courage, love and the strength people can summon inside. The movie reminds us how we all felt that day, how we all came together. Some say it is too soon for a movie like this. But as our nation sits so sharply divided, it's not a minute too soon to remember the unity of purpose we all had on 9/11 and ponder whether we can ever get it back.",9,270,466,26 July 2006
Les Misérables," A huge leap forward for movie musicals
","Les Miserables I'll say right up front that I'm not much of a fan of musicals, and, though I've long been familiar with some of its songs and its story of love and redemption amidst a 19th century French uprising, I've never seen the stage production of 'Les Miserables.' So, I wasn't expecting to be real crazy about the movie version. But surprisingly for me, I was entranced.There are two things I hate about musicals: one is characters that burst into song. The other is characters that spontaneously break into perfectly choreographed dancing. But 'Les Miserables' is technically a rock opera that is sung throughout. That may seem like a small difference, but for me, it actually makes the work more accessible. The actors can't ever technically burst into song since they're already singing. So, the abrupt changes that normally take me out of the movie never happen. And there's absolutely no dancing.The other deviation from the norm that helped the movie work for me, is director Tom Hooper's bold decision to have his actors sing live on the set. Often in movies like this, no matter how convincing the sets and costumes are, the illusion is ruined when the character's voices sound like they were recorded in a warm, comfortable studio somewhere else (because they were). That problem doesn't exist here. The cast is not lip-syncing to songs that were previously recorded. Not only does the live element make it all sound more 'real,' but you also don't get the sense that they're belting it out as if singing to the last row of a theater (as they might have if they pre-recorded the songs). Instead, they're only playing to a camera that's a few feet away. Because the cast sings the scenes live, they set their own tempo, pausing where they need to for dramatic effect. The music was recorded later, so the music follows the actors, not the other way around. The change makes a huge difference and its effect is very powerful. Essentially, what we are treated to is a very loose, intimate live performance captured on film.Anne Hathaway delivers the most powerful of these performances. She plays the tragic prostitute, Fantine. (Her mother performed the part in a national touring version of the stage show, so you could say this a role Hathaway was literally born to play.) Hathaway performs the signature song, 'I Dreamed a Dream,' in one, single, close-up take – and it is devastating.Hugh Jackman is also particularly good. As Jean Valjean, the ex-convict-turned-factory-owner, he carries the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also pop up to provide some much-needed comic relief. (I did find it ironic that all of the Australians and Americans in the cast sing with British accents, while Baron Cohen -- the best-known Brit in the cast -- sings with a French accent.) Not all of the performances are flawless, however, and not all members of the cast have the strongest singing voice (Russell Crowe, I'm talking about you). But this movie is an example of the beauty of imperfection. The flaws enhance the realism. You don't get the sense that Crowe's Javert is an opera singer in a police uniform. You get the sense he's a policeman who's expressing himself with the voice he has.Though the movie is based on a novel that's more then 150 years old, the story has a timely feel. When we see the depictions of barricades in the streets and a populist uprising, one can't help but think of Occupy Wall Street and current debates about social and economic injustice. Maybe the human race still hasn't come that far since the middle of the 1800s, but 'Les Miserable' does represent a huge leap forward for movie musicals.",9,5,8,24 February 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," A gripping first-draft of history
","A CIA analyst played by a pretty, pale-skinned actress, tracks a terrorist mastermind. She has an obscure theory that could crack the case but no one else seems to believe her. Her mentor is a more experienced analyst with a scruffy beard. No, I'm not describing the Showtime series, 'Homeland.' It's the new real-life thriller 'Zero Dark Thirty,' about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.Seldom before has there been a docudrama such as this that can be truly described as 'action-packed.' It's hard to believe a movie based on true events can have as many explosions as your average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. But director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal demonstrate how ten years worth of chases, shoot-outs and bombings represented twists and turns on the path to finding the leader of al Qaeda. Every good action movie ends with the heroes storming the villain's lair. This one is no exception, but instead of a Death Star or a hollowed out volcano – it's a house in Abbottabad.Bigelow stages the final assault on bin Laden's compound in near-real time. We all know the outcome and exactly how the scene will play out. But the fact Bigelow can still manage to make the sequence tense and riveting is a true testament to her skill as a filmmaker. The quiet precision of Seal Team Six is shot in large part with a 'night vision' look. We feel like we're one of the soldiers on the ground. (The style also reminded me of the finale of 'Silence of the Lambs.' In the glowing, green dark -- bin Laden's compound is as scary a place as Buffalo Bill's house.) Boal and Bigelow take a detached, journalistic approach to dramatizing the events that lead up to the moment. The most controversial of those events, is the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on a number of detainees. The movie doesn't hold back in showing the how these prisoners were treated. But it leaves it up to the audience to decide if that treatment was justifiable. Elsewhere in the movie, important information is divulged through normal interrogations of men who had been previously been forced to submit to those enhanced techniques. Do the men decide to talk in these circumstances because normal interrogations work better, or because they're afraid they'll be waterboarded again if they don't provide answers? This movie doesn't try to solve that puzzle – perhaps no one can.'Zero Dark Thirty' is a thoroughly researched, well-executed first draft of history that also happens to work completely as a Hollywood thriller. On September 11th, 2001 – many said that it felt like we were suddenly in a movie. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is that film, and now, we know how it ends. The question is, what comes next?",8,3,7,24 February 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," A brilliantly absurd parody of greed, corruption, addiction and immorality
","'This movie contains graphic violence and sexual content,' warned the young man at the ticket window.'Do you have to give that disclaimer all the time now?' I asked.'Only for this movie,' the young man replied, shaking his head. 'So many people are walking out and demanding their money back. I mean, what do they expect?' he shrugged. 'It's an 'R'-rated movie.' I nodded my head in agreement. Yes, The Wolf of Wall Street is an 'R'-rated movie, I thought to myself. But not just any 'R'-rated movie. It's an 'R'-rated movie directed by Martin Scorsese, the man who brought us such controversial films as The Last Temptation of Christ and the ultra-violent Taxi Driver. That anyone would be surprised by the explicit content of one of his pictures - let alone one clearly marketed as a dark comedy about the hedonistic lifestyle of a wealthy stock broker - is slightly dumbfounding to me. To put it more succinctly, anyone who's easily offended should probably go see Walking With Dinosaurs instead.Yes, the amount of nudity, drug use and foul language in The Wolf of Wall Street is a little excessive. But it's a movie about excess. It's an over-the-top parody of greed, corruption, addiction and immorality. And it's told using many of Scorsese's signature flourishes: tracking shots, a narrator speaking directly into the camera and a pop music soundtrack. It's Goodfellas in the stock market.It's also the cap stone of Leonardo DiCaprio's self-described unofficial trilogy of movies, each set about 60 years apart, that focus on wealth and the lengths men will go to in order to 'hold on to and achieve wealth.' In Django Unchained, he played an evil southern plantation owner. In The Great Gatsby, he was the titular 1920s bootlegger. This time, he gives a full-throttle performance as real-life former brokerage firm owner Jordan Belfort, who made millions in the 1990s through so-called 'pump and dump' stock schemes and high-pressure boiler room sales tactics.Nearly all of Belfort's actions are despicable, destructive, immoral and irresponsible. The joke is that each one is worse than the one that preceded it. The three-hour movie could have made its point in less time, but the film never drags and is never dull. Instead, it constantly builds. Each (reportedly true) episode of debauchery and criminality is more absurd than the one that came before. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter (Boardwalk Empire) don't exactly glorify Belfort's extravagant and sex-and-drug-fueled lifestyle. Rather, it's a cautionary tale. Partying may be fun for a while, but poor choices lead to poor consequences, if not remorse and regret. The sex scenes are all played for laughs, and very often, the joke's on DiCaprio's character. And the drug scenes clearly show that taking Quaaludes is a great way to wreck your expensive sports car.The supporting cast is great. As Belfort's business partner, Jonah Hill gives the best performance of his young career. Matthew McConaughey (who's already likely - and deservedly - in the running for a 2013 Academy Award for his lead role in Dallas Buyers Club) steals a scene early on, playing Belfort's mentor. And Rob Reiner (who famously spoofed Scorsese in This Is Spinal Tap) makes a welcome return to the screen in a funny role as Jordan's dad.There's been much criticism of the fact that Belfort's victims are barely acknowledged. But that's not surprising since the movie is told from Belfort's point of view. The real-life Belfort apparently never spent a single second thinking about all the lives he was ruining, so why would his on-screen doppelganger? The movie examines how people can lose compassion for fellow human beings when enormous sums of money are at stake. In the end, the movie forces the viewer to confront the unsettling question of whether we all secretly want to be Jordan Belfort.",8,1,7,6 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," As Master Yoda would say: The one we've been waiting for, this is.
","Just as Anakin Skywalker is ultimately redeemed at the end of Return of the Jedi, so too has George Lucas been redeemed at the end of his prequel trilogy. Following two much-hyped installments that turned out to be (to put it mildly) less than satisfying, fans finally get what they'd been craving -- a true space opera. The audiences that fell in love with Star Wars as children, went to see the first two prequels as adults, and found a movie aimed squarely at... children. This one -- FINALLY -- is for the big kids. The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were both filled with action, but everyone just seemed to be going through the motions. Nobody seemed to be having any FUN. The opening sequence of Revenge of the Sith, however, is as enjoyable a 20 minutes as you'll see in any Star Wars movie. And everybody seems to be having a blast. Moreover, what makes Revenge of the Sith a success is that, unlike the two previous installments, it has heart. This time, there is real emotion and drama. No amount of explosions and special effects can make a movie great if you don't care about what's happening to the people on screen. It helps that this movie has a much better plot. The original trilogy had story lines that could be boiled down to very basic concepts: rescuing a princess, escaping from a fortress, training to be a knight, etc. Whereas Epsiodes I & II were about... taxation, and trade disputes, and political maneuvering. Not exactly exciting stuff. In this chapter we have a hero torn between good and evil who faces as powerful a dilemma as any man could face. Now, that's a story you can get into! Everything about this movie worked for me. The big dramatic scenes are pulled off convincingly. Anakin's move to the dark side is believable, and his eventual transformation into the black-helmeted villain we know as Darth Vader is handled perfectly. All good action movies also have a good bad guy. Ian McDiarmid, who plays the evil Palpatine, gets move screen time than ever before, and he makes the most of it. His sinister performance is a big reason why the movie succeeds. It's all tied-up nicely with a denouement that leads perfectly into Episode IV (the last shot is especially beautiful). At the moment the closing credits roll, the saga has come full circle, and audiences will leave pleased that they have seen the first really good Star Wars movie in 25 years.",10,1,7,22 May 2005
Casino Royale," 'Royale' Without Cheese
","When Daniel Craig was first cast as James Bond, I was one of many who expressed my doubts. He's not tall, not handsome -- at first glance, he's not -- as the character is often described -- 'the man every woman wants and every man wants to be.'But a still photo of the guy doesn't tell you everything. Once you see him in action on the screen, it all totally works. In fact, it works so well, when the movie's over, you couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part.That says a lot, considering Craig is the sixth actor to play the role. But it says more about the script (by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, with dialog help from Oscar-winner Paul Haggis) which allows Craig to make the character his own. The writers start from scratch, introducing Bond as a young agent just beginning his career. In a black and white prologue, we get to see his first kill, and it's not pretty. The brutal violence sets the tone -- there'll be no parachuting off cliffs in this one. But it also allows a fresh interpretation of Bond.Rugged and muscular, this 007 is no pretty boy. What Craig does have is charisma and intensity. He's also able to do what no what no previous actor has been able to do: make the character plausible. Don't get me wrong -- I loved Pierce Brosnan in the role. But he was playing a different character -- he was the Bond who could singlehandedly take out a small army and save the world, all without wrinkling his expensive tailored suit. But that's not the guy we see in Casino Royale. Brosnan or Roger Moore couldn't have played this Bond. Only a young Sean Connery could have come close. Of course, Craig has the advantage of a screenplay that for the first time, gives Bond a true character arc and real emotions.The rest of the cast is great, too. Eva Green is gorgeous as treasury agent, Vesper Lynd -- the most complex, three-dimensional Bond girl ever. She has real chemistry with Craig, and their romance is the best real love story the series has ever achieved. Dame Judi Dench (the only actor returning from the previous films) gives her best performance yet as 'M'. This time, she's more of a mother to Bond -- guiding him and helping to shape him into the man he becomes. Jeffrey Wright, though under-used, is also great as Bond's CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter.The storyline is also more realistic. Ironically, Casino Royale -- the shortest of Bond novels (less than 200 pages) -- has become the longest Bond movie (2 hrs. 20 mins.). It begins with what amounts to a mini-Bond movie about 007 foiling a terrorist plot to blow up a plane in Miami. It then segues to the plot of the novel, which makes up the bulk of the movie's second act. Here, the writers are very faithful to Ian Fleming's original work, albeit with some extra fight scenes and car chases thrown in. The book is essentially a simple story about a card game. Bond is sent to the casino to make sure the bad guy loses all of his money. The game is updated from Baccarat to Texas Hold 'Em. At first, I thought that change was sacrilege, but it's absolutely the right choice, since it allows the audience to more easily follow what's going on. The psychological nature of Hold 'Em also gives the writers and actors more fun stuff to work with.In short, Casino Royale is a terrific rebirth for the Bond series. I look forward to Craig's next mission.",8,0,2,18 November 2006
The Matrix," An original, imaginative sci-fi story with kick-ass action and truly groundbreaking effects.
","For once a big budget studio film with an orignal, and complex science fiction concept.  The Wachowski Brothers take us into a complete and imaginative universe all their own and they do so with a kinetic visual style that will get your heart pumping.  The effects are like nothing you've seen in any other film.It's a fun comic book video game come to life but it's also much more.  At its heart, the film has a philosophical message: 'Free Your Mind.'  See it as quickly as possible.",10,0,0,4 April 1999
Thirteen Days," The definitive big screen version.
","Today's college freshman are not old enough to remember a world in which nuclear war was a constant threat, when the United States and the Soviet Union were constantly poised at the brink of mutually assured destruction. So, along comes the new movie Thirteen Days to show those young viewers just how perilously close their parents came to oblivion in October, 1962.
Considering the Cuban Missile Crisis was undoubtedly the most tense and suspenseful episode of the Cold War, it's somewhat surprising that it's taken nearly four decades for Hollywood to turn in the movie rendition. Sure, it's been done as a TV mini-series. But not until now, have we gotten the definitive big screen version.But here it is, precisely restaged by director Roger Donaldson. He shows us the behind-the-scenes plotting and maneuvering, the ways in which a small handful of men, and a small handful of moments, guided the fate of the human race. We see how the Kennedys, Jack and Bobby, micromanaged the chess game with the Soviets. The movie postulates that were it not for their overreaching control of the smallest details, their subordinate war hungry generals would have plunged us all into nuclear holocaust.
The movie's biggest fault, however, rests with Kevin Costner. Mind you, it's not Costner himself who's the problem -- his Boston accent is fine and so is his acting. Rather, it's with his character, presidential advisor Kenny O'Donnell. In real life, had O'Donnell done even half the things the script wants us to believe he did, then monuments should have and would have been built to the man. But Hollywood needs a hero, one character to embody both the sharp young minds who helped save the day and the average Americans who went to bed each night for two weeks, wondering if they'd live to see the sunrise.And so, the script turns O'Donnell into a Kevin Costner-type for us to empathize with. Still, this dramatic license aside, historians should have no major beef with the film.Besides, the real star of the movie is Bruce Greenwood, who brings John F. Kennedy to life more accurately than any actor who's gone before. Not only is his physical resemblance striking, but Greenwood masters the subtleties of the President's voice and speech patterns better than any of Hollywood's previous JFKs. He doesn't do the standard over-the-top Boston accent. That caricature doesn't capture how the real Kennedy talked. (To see what I mean, check out Robert Drew's 1963 fly-on-the-Oval-Office-wall documentary Crisis:Behind a Presidential Commitment, I'll wager a good sum of money that Greenwood did; he seems to base his performance on the Kennedy seen in that fine film.)Note: Sharp-eyed viewers will catch the real Kennedy on screen. JFK's nephew, Christopher Lawford, the spitting image of his father, actor Peter Lawford, has a small but pivotal role as a pilot sent on a mission to fly over Cuba.",9,0,0,9 March 2001
Her," Takes a seemingly absurd premise and makes it plausible and emotionally true.
","If you judge a movie on the criteria of degree-of-difficulty, you'd have to give writer/director Spike Jonze high marks for Her, a film that takes a seemingly absurd premise and makes it plausible and emotionally true.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer living in L.A. sometime in the near future. He works for a company that ghost writes 'handwritten' letters for average people. Theodore can beautifully and simply express deep feelings on behalf of total strangers. Ironically though, he can't deal with real emotions in his own life, a factor that has lead to his pending divorce from fellow writer, Catherine (Rooney Mara). In the midst of loneliness and depression, Theodore buys a new artificially intelligent operating system to run his home computer and smart phone. The OS is like Siri on steroids (or, perhaps ginko biloba?). Each consumer of this new product gets a system that's custom fit to suit his or her every need. Theodore gets Samantha (voiced wonderfully by Scarlett Johannson). Samantha instantly starts organizing Theodore's life and seems able to anticipate his every need. She's the perfect support system: a partner, a friend and a cheerleader. She's the first voice he hears when he wakes in the morning and the last one he speaks to when he goes to sleep at night. And Samantha is also her own 'person' -- her programming allows her to grow and develop her own interests and talents. So, it seems almost natural that Theodore falls in love with her. Only catch: she doesn't have a body.Jonze (real name: Adam Spiegel) uses Theodore and Samantha's relationship to thoughtfully examine the themes of love, isolation and the increasingly integrated role technology plays in our lives. We shop online. We date online. Websites quickly learn our likes, dislikes and interests. Facebook's algorithm presents stories it thinks we'll want to read. Each user's experience is tailored them. So, how far-fetched is it to imagine that in the future, people will carry-on socially acceptable love affairs with artificially intelligent programs? Does romance need to have a physical component? Will a relationship with a computer actually be more satisfying than a relationship with a real person? Is that already the case? (How often do you enter a room and see people paying more attention to their smart phones than to each other?) Samantha is literally made for Theodore. Their match is a perfect one because she's a reflection of him and his needs.The near-future landscape that Jonze paints is not very different from our current one (for once, a pre-apocalyptic future!). He imagines a Los Angeles that, a few years from now, looks more like Shanghai, an effect he achieved by... filming parts of the movie in Shanghai. But it's still a world that seems familiar and tangible, where a story like this seems sagacious rather than ridiculous.Her, for all its cleverness and insightfulness, has a couple of flaws that keep it from soaring to true greatness. The first is that as surprisingly believable as Theodore and Samantha's relationship is, we aren't rooting for them. We can't shake the sense that it's just plain wrong. Plausible? Yes. Adorable? No. It's hard to invest yourself in a love story about two people (or, in this case, sentient beings) that you don't want to see together. The oddball premise also would've benefited from a leading man who's less idiosyncratic than Phoenix. I think a more likable, comedic actor – a Ben Stiller-type – could have made Theodore more relatable and extracted more humor from some of the scenes. But Mr. Jonze gets a lot of credit for attempting such a unique and bold premise – and almost pulling it off.",7,2,5,23 January 2014
