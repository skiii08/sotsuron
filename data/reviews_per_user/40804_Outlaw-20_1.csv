Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One Word: BooHoo
","As I stood in the queue, I was very excited what will be waiting for us and after the movie I could not hold back my tears. What I loved was killed by its maker. The religion of the Force was no longer a religion, it depended on small pieces of 'Force'...That was not happening. And the Special FX were hyped for nothing. O.K., I have to admit, the podrace was quite well made.The best part was with no doubt that of Ray Park as Darth Maul, but he could have lived through the first and second part. He was quite evil, really cool.But in the end, I was disappointed. Sorry for you people who liked this movie. I prefer the old ones.",Null,0,1,7 April 2000
