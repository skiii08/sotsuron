Moneyball," This is still underrated!
",Ok this is not a ten. But heck this is not a 7.5! I am overrating it and hope to push it to 8.0 and up territory where it belongs. Help me out folks!,10,1,2,14 January 2020
Groundhog Day," for all time
","A film to remember on the day you die. 'Have a lived even a day in my little life like the last day of Groundhog Day?' But then Groundhog Day tells us it takes infinite practice to live one such day. Are we then doomed to live out the failed Groundhog Days? Most likely. Perhaps we can shorten the practice period? Unlikely. So the movie is an exercise in envy as the jerk gets a chance to un-jerk his life - no, even just one day of his jerky life. This movie was itself created from 10,000 cycles of filming. It only exited the loop when the director got it perfect. The end-product is what we see now. Awesome.",10,1,3,30 December 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," As generic as the surname
","No offense against Smiths (my brother-in-law is one!) But this is said to be the most common surname in the US. And this is about as typical a US action flick as it gets.Wait - perhaps that is overstated. It is a tad duller than your average Hollywood action-comedy flick. It goes well in the first 45 minutes or so. It takes its own good time for the two to finally try to finish each other off. Then it takes an unbelievable turn with the two kidnapping an earlier target of their former employers. Then it tacks on a royally protracted ending where the two finish off the hundred-odd goofballs who commit suicide by making themselves target practice to the dance-shooting couple.In short, this movie could have benefited vastly from better editing. Total screen time was two hours, when it could have been done far better with a little over an hour. Take out the whole shebang about trying to survive the onslaughts of the two erstwhile rival companies. End it right where the two get together after having some fantastic shoot-ups and fight scenes. Maybe put a hint of fighting it out side-by-side, but leave it all open-ended rather than see the boring thing through. Of course that means half the budget go to waste, but no point throwing away your good money after their bad, right?",4,28,56,12 June 2005
