Iron Man 3," One of the worst superhero movies ever.
","I'd like to keep my reviews short and sweet. So here it goes: Iron Man 3, really not worth the hype. First of all, we rarely see Tony Stark in his suit. Even when he gets inside one, the suit gets messed up real soon. Second, there isn't much to watch in the movie except the scenes we saw in the trailers. Third, the idea used in the story line seems stolen from another movie, whose name i won't like to reveal as it may become a spoiler, maybe. The 3D effects wasn't any good, but for that, i should probably just blame the movie theater. Ah whatever, the movie sucks. No big visual treats + an ordinary story; put together, one of the worst superhero movies ever.",2,37,75,30 April 2013
