Iron Man 3," The good, the bad, and the mandarin
","Let me start out that I love what Marvel studios had done with their movies. I loved phase one, with their crowning moment in the Avengers. I was super excited to see Iron Man 3, because I enjoyed all the others. The movie starts out with a flashback scene, which was different, but flashbacks are never ideal. I liked the acting of the cast, there was some very funny parts that made me laugh very hard, but I had to realize that I was watching a Iron Man movie not a slap stick comedy. The scenes with the boy and RDJ where enjoyable, Harley held his own, but it didn't really help the plot, if there was one. I was excited to see the mandarin with his ten rings and Iron man in an all out battle, but to my disappointment the mandarin was a scam, just an actor named Trevor, oh Ben Kingsley you could have done better. The role was so pointless they could have given it to Stan Lee for his cameo. The movie was hard to connect with, I left the movie theater disappointed.",5,3,7,4 May 2013
