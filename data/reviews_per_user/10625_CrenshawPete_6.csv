Requiem for a Dream," Masterpiece? Realistic? Are we watching the same movie?
","This review is for those of you who have not seen this movie yet. Please, please, read it all! You may thank me, you may not. I'm not here to change the minds of those who think this is 'the' gospel of movie telling. I made the mistake of buying the dvd before I had seen the movie because (A) the movie had amazing reviews on here and (B) it was only $12 brand new!After watching Requiem for a Dream, Spun, Traffic, and The Basketball Diaries, I can safely say that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I will first review this by comparing it to the latter films.I acknowledge that alot of the techniques/effects in Spun were ripped-off from this movie, however after viewing both I find Spun to be [oddly] more disturbing than this movie [even though Spun is supposed to be somewhat satirical], and thus Spun does what it set out to do: show you 3 days in the life of a driver of a meth cook. Neither films are really worth seeing but I give Spun credit for making me cringe at the thought of drugs.Traffic doesn't quite belong in this review, although in the drug genre and a great movie, it's more crime-drama and has a documentary-style-feel.OK, now people seem to act like Requiem for a Dream, a movie about New York heroin addicts, has never been done before. Ha!!! Guess again, it has been done and 1,000,000 times better! If all the Leonardo DiCaprio haters can get over that hate for just 102 minutes, you'll see what Requiem should have been, plus it's based on a novel, which is based on the true life of Jim Carroll. It's one of my favorite movies of all time.As for Requiem...[Possible spoilers coming]It is hard to comment on the plot itself. What's the point of the movie? To tell you drugs are bad... but with unbelievable outcomes? It's a film that's more concerned with artful direction than content. Is Ellen Burstyn a good actor? Yes, but her character is too dimwitted to be believable. Secondly the mother starts using drugs after the son does. My guess from the movie trailer was: mom's a speed freak and her son picks up this behavior from exposure to it. Like a child raised in a bad environment is likely to pick up the same bad habits. Or monkey-see monkey-do, as is the case often in real life... Not so in this plot.The <>fictional<> plot is mostly about 2 friends and a girlfriend running around trying to get a fix during a time when smack in New York is in shortage...haha ya right! Except its choppy and 90% of the footage is just scenes of people laying around in their apartment strung out, complaining and scheming.The most coherently told story is that of the dimwitted mother, who receives a call out of the blue that she's going to be a contestant on a game show even though she never applied to be one. So she starts using speed to fit into a red dress to look good on the show, which was a prank call or something?What's the final result? Mom ends up in a mental ward having shock therapy, son ends up in a hospital, having his arm amputated by doctors [in the most blood-splattering fashion, the likes we haven't seen since the chainsaw scene in Scarface] from an infection stemming from needle injections, friend ends up in jail, and girlfriend ends up doing dirty deeds in a gentlemen's' club. So this is reality? This movie is realistic? I think not.If you want to see realistic and you are mature enough that you can do without jumping refrigerators with mouths, dildos, and blood-splattering amputations  folks, Requiem has it all!], please watch The Basketball Diaries.The end.",1,13,25,26 October 2003
Cloverfield," If you didn't hate shaky cam before, you will after seeing this!
","Despite being a cross between a rip off of Godzilla, War of the Worlds, and Alien / Aliens, Cloverfield (whatever that refers to) sort of had an interesting approach: make the viewer feel like they're along for the ride. Unfortunately the execution was horrible.I've always hated this 'shaky cam' approach to TV and film that's become a fad in the last 15 years or so. Although some of my favourite TV shows and movies have been filmed using this approach, I totally despise it. What is wrong with mounting the damn camera? People are going to look back in 20 or 30 years and roll their eyes at this idiotic fad. Was it supposed to make us feel like we're there, in the scene? It doesn't.Well anyway, someone told the makers of this movie that people love shaky cam. In fact, they love it so much so that they want to see the effect put on steroids! And so we're treated with two hours of the camera bouncing up and down and zooming in and out of focus on random things. It's an abuse, not only on the eyes, but to all the senses.If that weren't bad enough, the first 20 minutes or so of the film is just a party where a bunch of twenty-something hipsters babble on about the usual twenty-something he said, she said nonsense while looking at their phones and nursing their beers. This is what passes for character development. For me, it was about as exciting as watching a dog lick itself where the sun don't shine... on shaky cam!After the monster is introduced into the movie... I don't know 30 minutes into the film... we follow Rob around town. Rob is apparently some genius who makes the world go round, because all we hear about throughout the film is 'where's Rob', 'what does Rob think?', 'what's Rob doing?', 'Hey, Rob!', 'Rob!', 'Rob!' Not since Mary Tyler Moore in the Dick Van Dyke Show have I heard someone say 'Rob' that many times on screen.Unfortunately Rob's an idiot. He decides to go against conventional wisdom (i.e. to get out of town) and instead goes marching straight into the carnage. His friends, who follow this guy around like David Koresh, go with him on his merry adventure to an early grave. When the group finally stumbles upon the military, the military allows them to leave the secure zone and go back onto the streets! Why? Glad you asked! In order to climb to the top of a skyscraper that's on fire and has fallen over and is now leaning against another skyscraper. Apparently these folks didn't watch 'The Towering Inferno'.The cover of this Blu Ray had quotes like 'Terrifying!' I think it should have had quotes like 'Stupid!' or 'Absolutely makes no sense!' Had I been at the theatre, I would have walked out. I couldn't have cared less about any of these people or their white upper-class, privileged, yuppie interpersonal drama.The number one problem with this movie was the camera gimmick. It was like watching unedited vacation footage shot by a five year old on a Sony Handycam. NEVER again will I sit through a movie shot like this. The second problem was the characters and dialogue, or lack there of. I can live with the fact that the plot makes no sense and the film really has no point, but the former ruins what little redeeming qualities this thing has left.I'll be generous and give it 4/10 for a twist on the themes it ripped off, but I don't think I could sit through a second viewing. All in all this film seems to be a marketing gimmick, rather than an original contribution to the science fiction genre.",4,1,1,10 April 2016
Black Mass," Goodfellas, meet Black Mass!
","I'll keep this review short. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, American Gangster, Donnie Brasco, and Blow, then you're going to love Black Mass. In terms of style and direction, it feels a lot like American Gangster with shades of Donnie Brasco. Black Mass is by far the darkest of the aforementioned movies -- it makes The Sopranos look like The Simpsons -- but Johnny Depp proves once again he's one of the most talented and versatile actors alive. His portrayal of Whitey is downright scary and deserves an Oscar.Now, I've got to say the critical reviews below are ridiculous. I'm reading comments like this movie doesn't bring anything new to the genre of gangster movies. By that logic no movies should have been made after The Godfather or The Goodfellas. This is a true story about Irish gangsters in Boston who colluded with the FBI during the 1970s and 80s. These are scary, unlikable people -- you know, like cold blooded killers actually are. If you want realism, and you're not squeamish, then this film delivers. A solid 10/10",10,4,11,25 October 2015
Interstellar," Interstellar is not a movie; it's an experience!!!
","I've been waiting for someone to make a movie like Interstellar for over 25 years. I really enjoyed The Martian; it was certainly better than most 'science' fiction movies these days, but it just didn't have that mystery and wonder you feel when watching Interstellar. To be fair, most 'science' fiction movies today are rip-offs of Alien(s), Star Wars (i.e. war in space), or pure fantasy (i.e. magic, vampires, ghosts). Very few, if any, deal with exploration of time and space or paradoxes that make the audience think. I loved every moment of Interstellar. It's visually stunning and has so many layers to chew on. I highly recommend watching this on a home theatre projector with surround sound and sub-woofer. It looks phenomenal on a big screen. Without a doubt, this movie is a solid 10/10. It might sound like a clich√©, but I'd have to say this is now my favourite movie (and I'm a film buff). Interstellar belongs in the top 10 of the IMDb.",10,2,5,25 December 2015
Oblivion," Excellent Sci Fi. Don't listen to the negative reviews!
","I just finished watching Oblivion, and once again, the ratings and reviews were mostly unhelpful. This seems to be a growing trend here. Movies have actually been getting better in the last half decade and yet audiences are getting more cynical. Oblivion is so much better than the 7/10 it's currently rated at on IMDb. Yes, there are some familiar ideas contained within the plot, but it definitely stands on its own, and the film is a visual masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Oblivion is better than all the modern Star Wars movies put together. I don't know what it takes to satisfy people, because I don't know how anyone can walk away from this film without feeling thoroughly entertained.",10,3,4,26 March 2016
Snowden," Brilliant! But read the book BEFORE you see it!
","I'll try to keep this short. I loved the movie. Oliver Stone and Joseph Gordon-Levitt nailed it. I've read the critics' reviews, and some are saying this movie could have been so much more. Like a political statement? They've completely missed the point. The movie is called 'Snowden' for a reason. It's not called 'PRISM' or 'NSA', because it's about Snowden, himself. It's the answer to 'who' and 'why'.If you want to know what's in those files, you'll need to read 'No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State' by Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who Snowden sought out to release the information. Hopefully people will read the book (the answer to 'what'). There's very little overlap with the movie, but it will definitely help you understand the events in the film better. Also, the book is shocking -- like jaw-dropping shocking.I'd read it about a year ago and thought they did a heck of a job recreating the scenes at the hotel, even if that part of the story was super-condensed. In the book, there's actually a lot more drama going on during that part of the story. But again, this movie was more about the lead-up to the leak, not so much the aftermath. My dad enjoyed the movie, but since he hadn't read the book, he said it was sometime difficult for him to follow. Even if you're unfamiliar with the details of the spying programs, you'll get an 'executive summary' in the film.It's a complex topic, and I think they simplified it as best anyone could. I hope people will read the book and see the movie. As again, they serve two different purposes, but both are necessary to get the complete picture. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a highly underrated actor, does such a good job playing Snowden that at times it feels like a documentary. If you liked Spy Game, Syriana, The Insider, and The Imitation Game, then you'll definitely enjoy Snowden. A solid 10/10Edit: It seems trolls (probably paid) are voting down positive reviews of this film. That's not surprising given the subject matter, but it only shows their desperation. They don't want you to learn about this heroic person or the serious issue of unaccountable government and corporate surveillance. All the more reason people need to see this movie!",10,5,13,25 September 2016
