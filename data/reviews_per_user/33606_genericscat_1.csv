The Blair Witch Project," can't recall posting
","I cannot believe I wasted my time. At least I got it from the library for free. Those guys should have stuck a cap on the lens and tied it to her and pushed her in the creek, then hiked out instead of all screaming at one another. Why not just follow the creek down the way it was flowing? After you lightened the load, of course. ;-) Yawn. I liked the parody of this in Scary Movie. BW #2 was as dumb as this one. Why did I waste my time? :-( Just think If they would have actually known how to use the compass or map. I find it hard to believe this made more money and thus beat Halloween as the highest grossing independent film. I wonder how they would have faired if this had been a real horror film like Halloween was. At least no one screamed at one another over a lost map in that movie.",Null,1,3,4 December 2004
