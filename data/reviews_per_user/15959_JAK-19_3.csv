Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Beautiful, a die-hard fan wouldn't expect any less.
","The Phantom Menace merely gets the ball rolling for the saga, but I cannot wait for 2002 and the next installment.  Lucas presents his movie to the public the way he wished he could have for the first three.  Beware, Episode I is only a teaser for what is yet to come.  Most of it is politics of the galaxy far far away and character development.  Any true fan will be completely satisfied.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
Army of Darkness," Very Entertaining
","This is a great movie to pop in the VCR while you hang out with some friends.  When you aren't laughing with the movie you will be laughing at it.  No matter how you look at it, Army of Darkness will provide you and yours with a great time.",Null,1,1,18 June 1999
Raging Bull," Not at all up to my expectations.
","Raging Bull was a complete let down.  The story alone is as old as time. An abusive, over-reacting, over-protective, and over-bearing boxer loses two wives, his children, and his brother.  Not by any sort of tragedy, but his own temper and actions.  DeNiro, of course, was outstanding, and its always nice to see little Joe Pesci beat the precious body fluid out of some poor sap, but LaMotta was no one special to write about (I guess that's why he took it upon himself).  I can't believe one of the most notorized directors of time actually became more notorized because of 'Raging Bull.'",5,7,19,14 June 1999
