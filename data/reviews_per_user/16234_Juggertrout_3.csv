Requiem for a Dream," Nightmares Come True
","My god. Where to start with this? Darren Aronofsky's follow up to indie hit Pi could be one of the most brilliant and emotional films ever. Aronofsky has managed to adapt Hubert Selby Jr's magnanimous novel to the big screen Â– and he's done a superb job of it.The cast is amazing. Ellen Burstyn's TV addicted, speed taking mother was robbed of an Oscar by Julia Roberts' frumpy, irritating Erin Brokovich. She gives one of the most emotional performances you will ever see, her passionate monologue about what it's like to be old, and her paranoid acting makes you truly believe that acting is an art. Jared Leto, as her drug addicted son, also gives very worthy performance as does Jennifer Connely as his girlfriend. Marlon Wayans, too, delivers an amazing and serious performance that belies his slapstick comedy notoriety.But this is a director's film; Aronofsky pulls out every directing trick in the book to make this a truly original experience. The shot of an overjoyed Sara Goldfarb as she runs out of her apartment and walks across the street with her old female friends as the camera swoons in front of them, creating a strangely eerie shot is one example. But it is the editing that shines, Aronofsky never leaves the viewer board with his unique style of hiphop montage editing and special effects.The music in this film also shines, the classical score is wonderfully composed and highly dramatic in a film which demands it so heavily.Although disturbing, this is a film that everyone should see, it is full of great acting, editing and truly memorable story.",10,3,6,29 January 2005
Spirited Away," The best animated film I have ever seen
","Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature, large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house, stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and human-frog hybrids.The animation is stunning. Miyazaki truly sees animation as an artform. Many stand out scenes contain no dialogue at all, and are merely animated images creating surreal effects: Chihiro in the lift with the Radish spirit, Chihiro running through the flowers, and the final train ride, where our young protagonist takes a mysterious train journey across a sea, with her spirit friend, No Face. Nothing much happens, it's just simple, colourful, oddly unsettling, and lingers long after the film ends.The characters are also perfect, and add to strange storyline. There's Kamaji, the multi limbed boiler room operator, Yubaba, the evil witch, and her massive baby child. No Face is a peculiar spirit who turns feral when Chihiro is not around, and finally, Haku, a boy spirit, who shares an emotional scene with Chihiro towards the end of the film.Colourful, imaginative, interesting, and emotional. Spirited Away is a film you'll want to see time and time again. Buy it.",10,23,34,21 June 2005
Mulholland Drive," Lynch at his best
","David Lynch is a master of dark, surreal films and this is no exception. It is his best work for ages and a good film to get into Lynch.After a bizarre car crash, a young woman is left with amnesia, she befriends an aspiring actress coming to LA to work and together try and solve the mystery surrounding just who she is. Meanwhile, a famous movie director's new film is seemingly taken over by a bunch of macabre producers, with a mysterious way of working. Also we see the story of a hit man and a young man and his psychiatrist in a diner.But what do these stories have in common? Well if you head isn't doing cartwheels in the first 20 minutes then you're watching the wrong film. Just when you think the solution is about to emerge, Lynch destroys any notions you had of what you may have thought had happened by more or less turning the story upside down into something much more...realistic, let's say.It's unlikely you'll understand this the first time round, especially if you're not used to Lynch's bizarre symbolism tricks. There is an answer, but most people prefer to admire it for it's beauty, the directing is wonderful, and the two female leads are brilliant, so there's a lot to show for.Mulholland Drive is a dark, confusing yet beautiful film. I highly recommend it to anyone.",10,2,3,8 January 2005
