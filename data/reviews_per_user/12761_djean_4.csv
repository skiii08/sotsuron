The Incredible Hulk," Finally! The Hulk Is Given Justice
","Ah! June 21, 2003 a day that will live in infamy in my movie going experiences. Why will this day live in infamy for me? Well, it was the day i experienced Ang Lee's The Hulk on the big screen. The day provided me with one of the most crushing disappointments i've experienced in my life. I remember leaving the theater after the film was over confused by what i saw and angry that the hulk was completely distorted taking away his Hulk Smash and turning his story into a psychological drama dealing with his crazy scientist father and lame romance with Betty Ross. Topping it all off with killer mutant poodles and Nick Nolte turning into a lightning god, a rock, and a giant green nuclear cloud that fights the hulk before being blow up by a jet. Then the movie didn't show Hulk for 42 minutes and didn't end with him in a final shot. Talk about lame.So now we flash forward 5 years later and everything has changed for the sequel. New cast, director, and tone than the original with this one putting more emphasis on action. I can pretty much tell you they hit a home run. Not only do they get it right this time they even change the backstory to what it was in the comics and completely ignore Lee's film even exists.The strength of this movie lies with having things the original movie lacked like strong performances and a great villain. Ed Norton beats the crap out of Eric Bana's version of Bruce Banner. Norton's Banner is a man in control of his own world and has the ability to control his inner demon without sacrificing his inner human ability to care for others. Li Tyler is a much better Betty Ross simply because there's a warmth to her that was sorely missing from Jennifer Connely's take on he character. You actually feel she loves Bruce and would be devastated if something was to happen to him, where as Connely just stood on the side lines and let things happen to her hubby, just so she could yell at her general father. William Hurt does an admirable job replacing Sam Elliot as the general who wants Banner dead but i felt Eliot was far more menacing in the original (The only thing the original did better than this film. Finally, we get this film's biggest strength the villain. Tim Roth does a sensational job as Emil Blonsky aka Abomination a man fed up that he wasn't promoted higher up in military rankings, so he takes his anger out on Hulk and forces Hurt's character to steal a mutated Hulk serum that gives him super human strength thus turning him into the monster Abomination. Overall this film was action packed with wall to wall action that stayed true to the comic books. Plus Hulk even says his catch phrase Hulk Smask! Thank you to all involved with this for getting the Hulk right. This fan appreciates it.",9,3,6,14 August 2008
Tropic Thunder," A Horrible Waste of Time
","Out of all the movies i have seen this year only a very few have qualified for my worst films of the year list: Meet the Spartans, 10,000 B.C., The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Wanted, and now you can add Tropic Thunder to that list. I don't know what Ben Stiller was thinking but he wasn't thinking clearly. How can you make a movie with this many hateful jokes against the mentally challenged and expect people to laugh. How can you make a movie start off strong and fast paced but then spend an entire hour with side characters wandering around a jungle slowly walking their way towards a drug camp where one of their friends is being held captive? The second act is pathetically slowly paced and brings the film to a complete and total halt. There are good things about the movie like Tom Cruise's amusing part as a sleazeball studio exec and Ben Stiller playing with a real decapitated head even though he thinks it's prosthetic. These two good things are not enough to save it. Overall skip this entirely in theaters and go watch Mummy 3 instead you'll be far more entertained. What an unfunny embarrassment!",1,31,66,14 August 2008
The Dark Knight," Good movie that's been way overrated
","So here we are a month after this films release and we're still talking about it. Actually by talking about it i mean it's jaw dropping box office performance and recently ranked best film of all time on IMDb. Thankfully as of today it has dropped from #1 to 3 and probably will keep dropping. Let me get this off my chest i thing it's a good movie not a great one and it sure as hell is not a masterpiece or even the greatest comic book movie of all time that dubious honor belongs to the Fantastic Four followed closely behind by the first Spider-Man. I know this to many is blasphemy so crucify me fellow comic book fans but this is what i truly believe. My main problems with The Dark Knight stem with the fact that it's way to friggin long, is a little hard to follow, and at times felt rushed with scenes either missing or suddenly appearing with no flow to them. For instance (one of the awkward scenes i'm talking about occurs at the beginning) after the joker puts his calling card on the table next to Gotham's most notorious mobsters while they have their therapy session meetings (as the Joker puts them) in a anonymous kitchen. The moment the joker bolts out the kitchen's swaying doors suddenly we're treated to a scene with Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes sitting at a table having dinner in an expensive restaurant. This may not seem as bad in my review but trust me in the movie it's really awkward like there's no built up to it it just shows up. one of other problems i have with this movie is the way scenes seem to go on forever just to have the film run two and a half hours where they could have been resolved much faster or cut out entirely. (Spoilers)Example: The ferry scene. Toward the end The joker has 2 ferries rigged with explosives one carrying innocent civilians the other convicted felons and convicts (One of the convicts happens to be played by Tommy Tiny Lister Jr. from Friday and The Fifth Element). The reason their on the ferries is because the joker has threatened to level gotham and cause chaos and anarchy in the city. Gotham officials order the people be evacuated some choose the ferries. The joker puts one detonator on each boat and plays a game with his victims he tells them that at the strike of midnight one will decide whose lives are worth living more the civilians or the convicts. Than when midnight hits whoever puts the detonator together the fastest lives and in the process blows up the other ferry killing everyone on board. However, in the end everything gets resolved by Tommy Tiny Lister Jr. simply throwing his ferries detonator thru a window into the water and turning to his superior and rightfully proclaiming 'You should have done this a long time ago'.My words exactly had Tommy Tiny been the one to decide the fate of everyone on the two ferries instead of the warden who was stupid enough to believe that the ferries were rigged the scene would have lasted mere seconds cause he would have known that the whole thing was a charade. Cause convicts know when they're being played. So this lengthy scene for nothing had one character gotten control of the situation. The movie would have ended 15 minuted earlier.My big last complaint against this movie is the way it treats two of Batman's other villains. (Spoilers)Scarecrow is horrificly underused in this movie to the point where it's anti-climatic. Scarecrow appears for about 2 minutes in the beginning as a drug dealer selling his hallucinogen drug in a parking garage only to be ambushed by fake batmen and then batman himself before he's tied by batman and left in the garage probably to be used again in the next movie. We never find out his fate whether he's arrested or put in arkham asylum. Then to top it all off Cillian Murphy himself who plays Scarecrow only says one line in his deep raspy voice (a mere three words) while the rest of his dialogue sounds like willem dafoe crossed with a young child. Talk about weird.(Big Spoiler) However, the greatest sin this film commits is the killing off of Two-Face. Yes, people two face dies in this movie. i thought he was being built up for another movie but i guess that was beneath Chris Nolan so he kills him off. The problem with his death is it's so damn weak he simply falls over a ledge with Batman after holding Jim Gordon's family hostage and breaks his back. What a waste of an iconic villain. Why aren't more comic book fans upset about this? Way to forgiving.I know i'm making this review sound like i hate it i don't i'm just pointing out it's hugely glaring flaws that everyone seems to be looking over.The good things about the movie are a great performance by Heath Ledger (tragic what happened to him) Great chase/ambush scene with armored trucks, helicopters, the batpod, eighteen wheelers, and police cars all vying to get harvey dent who's being transported to prison, and a couple of well timed out of left field plot twists.So overall good to watch once but more of an experience than an entertainment.",5,6,15,11 August 2008
Iron Man," Entertaining Comic Book Movie Hurt by Slow Second Act
",Iron Man was the first movie to open this summer and was one of the most anticipated it's been a huge hit with audiences so i'm sorry i've been late in writing this review.Iron Man stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark a weapons manufacturer who gets kidnapped in the middle east and held hostage by crazed terrorist Raza who wants Tony to build him a missle that would due great damage to wherever it hits. Stark instead builds a metal suit equipped with flame throwers and an arm that shoots out and sends men flying thru the caves of afghanistan. After blowing up the base where he was held captive Tony comes to the stunning realization that the weapons he makes are being used by the terrorists to do harm around the world and to kill American soldiers fighting in afghanistan. Because of this Stark shuts down all weapons production in Stark Industries which angers mentor Obidian Stane (goatee wearing Jeff Bridges)and confuses love interest and assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Realizing he must do good for now on Tony builds a much more advanced version of the suit he built in Afghanistan do defeat the forces of evil foreign and domestic. (Spoiler) We find out later in the movie Stane ordered Tony's kidnapping and planned to kill him so he could take over the company. He's also in cahoots with the terrorists and has been giving them the Stark Industry weapons Tony wants destroyed. A showdown occurs between him and Tony at the end on top of Stark Industries. Overall i liked this movie it was breezy summer fun with enough laughs to lighten the other darker elements of the picture while having enough action to satisfy action fans (even though it could have had a little more action and little less talk). My only gripe is it's slow second act that drags at times and especially the lengthy scene in which Stane goes on and on about how he orchestrated the kidnapping in Afghanistan while pulling Tony's heart respirator out of his chest. (You'll know what i mean when you see the movie) So overall definitely see it it's worth your time.,7,1,2,11 August 2008
