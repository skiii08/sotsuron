Sucker Punch," Sucker punch - SPOILER ALERT: aptly named given the epic trailer is a dream sequence unrelated to the movie
","SPOILER ALERTSUCKER PUNCH - aptly named when you realize writer/director Zak Snyder suckered you into paying $15 based on an epic trailer made entirely of THINGS A CHARACTER DREAMS IN THE MOVIE. This is an incredible innovation scamming movie goers. Why doesn't everyone who doesn't have a compelling screenplay have their main character dream 2 minutes of unconnected, cool looking action that doesn't actually happen in the story line, then make a trailer out of it? Batman v. Superman had the same crap trick (Batman desert fight scene) but to a lesser extent. At least Michael Bay makes an attempt at cramming the incoherent action from the trailer into the story.Can't wait for Notebook 2, wherein the main character has an epic 2 minute dream styled after BladeRunner vs. Citizen Kane vs. The Color Purple that ends of being 100% of the trailer, having nothing to do with the 98% of the movie about a stationary store.",3,4,9,28 June 2017
