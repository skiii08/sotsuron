The King's Speech," Good but not great
","I really enjoyed this movie. It's nice to see such a cerebral film for a change, one that's not full of nudity, ghetto swearing, and explosions. Add to that it's a historically accurate portrayal of events which occurred not that long ago, but about which most viewers will be ignorant.Firth and Rush were both quite good, although at times Rush pushed the boundary on mugging to the camera.That said, I think if fell short of the great movies in this genre, such as A Man for All Seasons.My only big complaint was the actor who played Churchill was terribly miscast. Although WC did not play a major role in the film, nevertheless he is an important historical figure. The actor pushed his chin into his chest, stuck out his pouty lower lip, and carried a cigar. That was it. I believe most high school drama teachers could have selected a better actor.All in all, it is good, and unless you like Tom Cruise or Angelina Jolie movies, go see this one.",7,4,7,10 January 2011
Life of Pi," Bad Drugs Will Do It To You
","When Pi comes ashore on the first island, the Floating Island of Acid, --- stop and think about that -- 'floating' and 'acid' --- get it?, he nibbles some plants then gorges himself on them. He sees thousands of lemurs (!) that don't run away even when the tiger walks amongst them eating his fill. Hmmmm.Pi is drugged out of his mind people! Of course the story was made up, but not maliciously. He is having the strangest acid trip on record.If you want to see a movie that is good at telling what really happened on the lifeboat, see the Hitchcock version of 'Lifeboat'. The physical similarity between the 2 lifeboat bad guys is startling.",4,5,23,12 December 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Sick and stupid
","I'm sure that somewhere on here it has been mentioned that the real title of the book (in Swedish) is 'Men Who Hate Women'. Just as you might suspect, it's a sick book, in which vile and sickening violence against women (and men!) is wrapped in a thoroughly ridiculous whodunnit. I can understand that the book's American publisher did not think the original title would sell very well, so it was changed to something which, outside of the book itself, has no significance whatsoever. The title change also attempts to change the focus of the book. In Sweden, the book was about men who not only hate women, but about men who hate women so much that just killing them is not enough. In America, the focus turns to a geeky girl who rides a motorbike and uses computers, not knives, to hack her way through complex crimes. The whole Vanger family thing was overdone. I kept visualizing Saturday Night Live doing a parody of this book. A door opens and it's the 2nd cousin once removed and his 3 children. Oostervanhaaven Vanger and Hansoover, Fransoover, and Gertaoover Vanger. Was the Vanger family supposed to be the Kennedys? Let's see. Serial murder and sex. Depraved murder and depraved sex. Forced anal sex, with and without lubricant. Bondage. Rape by father of son. Rape by father of daughter. Rape by brother of sister. Torture. Bird shoved into dead woman's vagina. Dismemberment. Burning of flesh. More dismemberment.",1,16,28,11 June 2012
Meet Joe Black," Joe, Susan and Bill
","I bought the VCR (2 tape set) of this, still shrink rapped, at Half Price for $1.00. I really enjoyed watching the first tape, but should have stopped there. The second tape brought the story and the characters to a dead halt. I just can't imagine why anyone thought it was necessary to extend this film to the length it is. How to trim it? First, the silly side story about the planned merger with another company could be jettisoned entirely, which would also allow us to jettison entirely the character of Drew, Susan's boyfriend (is he her fianc√© ... who knows?). This irritating character adds nothing to the story. If we need a boardroom scene to show Bill's character, then put one in and be done with it.The other way to shorten the film would be to cut the duration of all of Susan's scenes by half. A skinny Angelina Jolie who squints like Clint Eastwood. Only Death and Drew would find her interesting (except for for her being the daughter of a mega rich father).Aside from the length, the ending didn't do much for me. Susan sees her father and Death walk over a hill, and only Death come back. She asked not a word about where her father went. Anyone who has lost a parent knows that no matter how long it was in coming, it's still a tragic moment,esp when it's the last parent to die. All Susan can do is get googly-eyed (again) at Death.Pitt delivers all his lines in a monotone that would make Kevin Costner jealous. Death, who has been around for thousands of years, doesn't know how to speak?",4,0,1,13 March 2012
Limitless," The Elephant in the room
","Question: If this guy was using all of his brain, why couldn't he realize that he was running out of pills? Aside from that problem, I liked the movie. Its purpose was to entertain, and at that it did a good job.There is nothing deep here, and aside from De Niro there is not much to be said for the acting.It moved at a good pace, kept me interested, and even surprised me a few times.Aside from De Niro, there is not much to say about the acting. A few times, the camera work was so ... avant garde that it almost induced motion sickness. I can do without that.",5,1,3,4 April 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," I didn't care about these people
","Riggan apparently made a fortune as Birdman, drank it all away, and ran off his wife and daughter in the process. He wants to stage a comeback purely to feed his ego. I didn't care. I don't care. This is a movie about an extremely depressed, hallucinogenic man who eventually kills himself. Thrown in to fill the slow spots is an 'I'm preggo, you don't love me' subplot; 'you were a lousy dad' subplot; 'you cannot get an erection' subplot; 'I cheated on my wife' subplot; 'I'm broke' subplot; 'you have a nice ass' subplot; and a 'girl on girl kiss' subplot. Or, maybe it's just another superhero movie. Who can tell? How many writers sat in separate rooms and each contributed 10 minutes of dialog? It's such a mess I can see why critics loved it. A lot of angst, a chance for the 'haves' to sniff about their importance, but in the end who gives a blanking blank about any of these people?",3,20,47,3 November 2014
Casino," Roll dem bones
","Two people whose movies I try to avoid are Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone; Pesci is a one trick pony with a very tired act, and SS just nauseates me. So, clearly, I held off seeing Casino for many years. The other day it was at Half Price for a dollar so I picked it up. I always enjoy stories about Vegas; it's fun to peek behind the scenes of the casinos. This was one of the last good roles DeNiro had, before he descended into the Valhalla of romantic comedies with the likes of Ben Stiller. The good is simply the story itself, which is essentially true. (It is certainly NOT true that the mob was not skimming in Vegas until the 1970's). DeNiro was good, especially when he tried to deal with an old friend who he realized and always knew was an out of control idiot. DeN was clearly ready to jettison Pesci if that was what it took to keep the casino running, but was afraid he could not do so because Pesci was a made man and DeNiro, a Jew, was not and never could be. The scenes 'back East' with the big boys were always well done; good supporting jobs by all involved. Don Rickles was good. The bad, aside from Pesci and Stone, were: the soundtrack; I felt it got in the way because it was continuous, too loud, and often at odds with the tone of what was showing on the screen. The lighting; in many scenes Scorsese put a hot spotlight on a character or a desktop. I just can't figure out what he was trying to do. The running narration was not needed after the first few scenes. All in all, I'd recommend it. Get a bottle of pure strength ammonia to sniff whenever Stone appears on the screen and you will be OK.",6,6,10,22 March 2012
