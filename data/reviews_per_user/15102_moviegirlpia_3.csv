The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Slice-of-Life
","I read this little masterpiece a few years ago; and fell in love with it. It appeals to a broad range and tells a wonderful story about a boy who feels left out; which many of us can identify with. I was excited to find out they were making a movie and even more thrilled when I knew the writer was adapting the screenplay AND directing. However; I feel as though he fell short in a few areas. He was targeting the audience who read the novel; when I think he should have done the opposite. Don't get me wrong- I was able to fully appreciate what he did here. But I saw the movie with folks who didn't read it; and sort of felt bad that they weren't getting the most out of this wonderful story. I was also a bit disappointed in Emma Watson's performance. Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman were brilliant; but Watson lacked the brilliance of her counterparts. And to me; this was disappointing. I felt she was cast for her 'star power' rather than her talents. But hey; if I put myself in the writers shoes; I guess I can't blame him. I would have probably done the same- especially if a star like Watson came to me with the excitement they said she did. However; she lacked the acting ability and voracity that I think this character needed. Although she was very beautiful to look at; Sam could've been played by many other American actresses with much better 'chops'. I will say that the movie was still beautiful and captured the essence of this novel perfectly. I did enjoy it despite my few disappointments. And I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a 'slice-of-life', heartfelt movie. And I still give it an 8/10.",8,2,4,28 October 2012
The Theory of Everything," Marvelous
","I will not write what it is about, mostly any one who will see this will know what it is about and why they've seen it. 'The Theory of Everything' is simply the most breath-taking movie I have ever seen. Cinematically it is beautiful and on both an emotional and a visual level, it is breath-taking. The ending is the most beautiful I've seen in cinema history. To sum it up, 'The Theory of Everything' could not have been made better, in any way. It is both heartbreaking and inspiring, and ALL performances are elite and dare I say:PERFECT. Stephen Hawkings is the Einstein of our time and anyone living in our time: Do yourself a favor, and see this film.",10,2,4,9 January 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," not bad, but...
","I read the books, they certainly aren't like the literary giants they speak of in the novels, but it's fun literature, and a decent story. The Fifty Shades trilogy isn't about BDSM, or a man taking control of or abusing a woman. It is about a man and a woman who fall in love and change one another's lives. It's about a woman who wants to explore her sexuality with an unusual man. It is a story, and just that. Its fantastical, ridiculous at times, and far fetched. But isn't that what the reader is looking for? To escape from reality? I feel the movie missed the heart of the books. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. As usual if you didn't read the books you will miss out on the entire point. It's the usual reason a book to film fails in the eyes of the readers. It's the most difficult thing to do because everyone's perceptions are different and it is impossible to bring to life what millions have different ideas and pictures of in their minds. If they go on to make the next two they can redeem themselves and improve upon the things they missed in the first film. I hope that they do.If you loved the books I suggest you go see it. If you want to see it for the hype, don't bother. If you want to know the story, read the books first.",5,1,4,3 March 2015
