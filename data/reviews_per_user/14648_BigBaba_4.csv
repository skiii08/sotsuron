Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well...
","Of course, you cant expect much when having to watch the movie in a pirated version with Russian voiceovers. However, exactly that makes it easier to be less swept away and, in a way, make more unbiased comments on the movie in some aspects.I found the first half hour much too rushed, as if too much plot preparation had to be pushed through intime for the finally. The last hour though was very nice, classical great stuff. All in all, however, not as good as the previous installments.",7,0,1,11 August 1999
Sucker Punch," Visually attractive, but not more than that
","Conceptually interesting and visually entertaining, the script and characters are lacking in their ability to hold the viewer's interest.Directed by the guy who brought us 300, it's clear that cerebral qualities were told to take a backseat in this production. It almost,but not quite, works, with the whole film, relying heavily on music to set the tone, feeling like a mix between Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet and your random Japanese absurdist anime. However, though the viewer is thrown in headfirst and treated to a visual spectacle, as soon as the plot becomes obvious, there's little to keep the viewer entertained. And not even the short skirts on the quite girls can change that.Features a cover of The Smith's Sing me to sleep.",4,1,3,3 October 2011
The Truman Show," The scariest movie ever made?
","This is the scariest movie I have EVER seen. You know that the plot is about 'true man' Burbank, discovering that his whole life is a TV show and that everyone he knows is, in fact, an actor, paid to let him think his life is 'heaven on earth'. Why is it scary? The Truman Show is about the ultimate conspiracy. A conspiracy that can actually pull it off for 30 years of this man's life. Creating a make believe world where nothing is even close to what it looks like. And it IS believable. In Truman's world, about 5000 cameras are positioned around the gigantic set. Although the government-is-watching-you-scare is now less than it used to be, our lives are becoming more and more public. Not in the least because of this great Internet. But mainly because media is bringing everyone much closer to each other and giving us the opportunity to know much more than before; Making information available on every subject possible. What then, can assure us that eventually our lives will NOT be like Truman's? One big show, for everyone to see. And fake from the bottom up.",9,0,0,19 November 1998
The Thin Red Line," Poetry. Period.
",This is not a movie. This is pure poetry. This is not a story. This is life.Easily the best production of the year. A visual feast and highly intelligent. Simply too much for words.,10,2,5,28 February 1999
