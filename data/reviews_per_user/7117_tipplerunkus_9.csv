The Blair Witch Project," An interesting failure.
","'The Blair Witch Project' was an interesting idea, and it's easy to admire the ingenuity of the filmmakers and their little experiment.
Sadly, the film is ALMOST as scary as a particularly good segment on 'The Simpson's Treehouse of Horror', and offers practically no entertainment value. The improvised dialogue is witless and unimaginative, and the shaky hand-held camera work would give Michael Bay motion sickness. The performances are inconsistent, thought Heather Donahue's believable work is the highlight of the film.Overall, I cannot stress clearly enough that 'The Blair Witch Project' is just not scary. At all. In any way, shape or form. It is, unfortunately, an excercise in sheer boredom.",3,0,2,2 April 2003
The Fifth Element," I want to hurt this movie.
","'The Fifth Element' is bad beyond all possible levels of badness. The acting is atrocious, the writing is so inane it seems to have come from the mind of a dim-witted nine year old, and the visuals are merely stolen from 'Blade Runner' and many other, better films. This would be an awful movie even without Chris Tucker in it. Throw him into the mix, and it becomes unwatchable.",1,38,87,7 February 2003
The Bourne Identity," Possible the worst book adaption of all time - but not a bad little thriller if taken on it's own terms.
","I don't think I have ever felt more conflicted about a movie than I did about this one. Tony Gilroy's script absolutely mutilates the source material, Robert Ludlum's gripping, intricately woven novel. The simplified, dumbed-down version of the story seen here is down right painful to those who know the real story. The change to the central premise of Jason Bourne's identity is roughly equivalent to remaking 'Citizen Kane' and saying 'Rosebud is . . . a flower . . . or something' (okay, the book isn't as good as 'Citizen kane', but it's the best analogy I can think of).That said, had I seen this film without ever having read the book (or seen the Emmy nominated mini series, which may be a little hokey put retains far more of the intelligence of the plot), I have no doubt I would have quite liked this film. It's a good little thriller. Matt Damon, one of the most talented of the current crop of overexposed young actors, surprises again by making a credible action hero, as does director Doug Liman (who would have thought the 'Swingers' guy could do action/suspence?).If you aren't familiar with the real story, see this movie first, and you'll enjoy it. If you have seen this movie but not read the book, read it and you'll understand what we Ludlum fans are complaining about.",6,0,1,9 July 2003
Armageddon," A cancer on the backside of American cinema.
","Hollywood has never produced a worse film than 'Armageddon', and for the sake of civilization as we know it, we can only pray they never do.NOTHING about this mind-numbing piece of unwatchable dreck even approximates being tolerable. The acting is a career low for everyone involved, the script is beneath contempt, and Michael Bay's direction is the cinematic equivalent of a war crime. Quite simply, the production, release and success of this movie ranks as one of the darkest hours in the history of mankind. People need to be educated on how a movie this bad was made, in order to ensure that such a thing NEVER happens again. The legacy of humanity depends on it.",1,2,4,4 July 2003
The Last Samurai," Dances with Samurai
","Few films in recent memory have inspired as much ambivalence from me as Edward Zwick's action epic `The Last Samurai'. Zwick has made his best film since 1989's `Glory', a truly gripping and visually stunning effort. But `The Last Samurai' is frequently undermined by it's extreme similarity to Kevin Costner's `Dances with Wolves'. In fact, the mid-section of `Samurai' could be considered a virtual remake. Admittedly, I am perhaps overly sensitive to this - `Dances with Wolves' is one of the films that most influenced my views on film, and will therefore always stand out in my mind. But to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Costner's film,. the similarities will be distracting (the decision to have the Tom Cruise character actually keep a journal which is used as the filmÂ‘s voice over narration ranks among the worst ideas in movie history).The third act of `The Last Samurai' corrects that problem. While at this point the film actually shifts into something more akin to Mel Gibson's `Braveheart', it is far less blatantly so, and at this point Zwick's movie takes off and assumes a life of it's own, with dazzling action scenes and strong performances from Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. In fact, the film plays so well at this point that it's tempting to completely overlook it's earlier missteps, which speaks very highly of Zwick's abilities as a director (as well as the abilities of two-timeOscar winning cinematographer John Toll. who will probably win his third statue for this one)..Other than it's derivative nature, the biggest flaw to `The Last Samurai' is that it never clearly demonstrates what exactly the samurai are fighting against. Whether or not you agree with `Dances with Wolves' take on western expansion, you have to admit that IN THE FILM, the Sioux are clearing being mistreated, and their plight is made clear. In `Samurai', we are told that the Japanese Emperor is listening to advisor who `act in their own interests', and that a proposed treaty between Japan and America is `not in the best interest of the Japanese people.' And yet, we never really see or hear exactly why this is true. In the end, `The Last Samurai' is really a dressed-up action movie, and as such, it's one of the best we've had all year.  If you are able to get past the `been there, done that' feel of the mid-section, there is much to enjoy, and despite my reservations I give the film a strong recommendation.",7,0,0,11 December 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," The longest trailer ever produced.
","'The Matrix Reloaded' is entertaining, but not truly satisfying. While the action is as spectacular as ever, the second film is decidedly lacking in story. In fact, it feels as if this could have (and probably should have) been told in 40 minutes or less, as the first part of 'The Matrix Revolutions.' This really plays more like a trailer for that film than it does an individual film in it's own right.The said, 'Reloaded' is exciting and fun. It is well worth seeing. It's only a pity that the Wachowski's did not make a sequel that lived up to the original, or stood on it's own. On a scale of sequels, this is not 'The Empire Strikes Back' or 'The Two Towers.' In fact, it's not even quite 'Attack of the Clones.' The best possible comparison would be 'Back to the Future Part II.'",6,0,0,15 May 2003
The Terminal," Spielberg's comic masterpiece.
","Steven Spielberg has proven himself to be equally adept at at number of different genres, but comedy has been the one genre wherein success eluded him - '1941', his one flat-out comedy, was also his one complete artistic failure. 'Hook' was a largely comic fantasy, but was neither entirely a comedy nor entirely successful (though it is a better film than some of it's most vocal detractors have implied). 'Catch Me If You Can' was, before now, the closest Steven had come to comic success - but that excellent film is really as much drama as comedy.While 'The Terminal' has been marketed as a comedy-drama, this really is a true comedy, with some dramatic elements. Unfortunately, our society has been dumbed down to the point where people think comedy means 'Austin Powers'. Here, Spielberg had succeeded completely at creating another classic, and Tom Hanks creates the most endearing character he has played since 'Forrest Gump'. 'The Terminal' is hilarious, touching, fast-moving and entertaining, and the biggest stretch Spielberg has faced since 'Schindler's List'. It is one of his most character driven works to date.Sadly, we have reached an appalling mentality among many filmgoers, especially those who congregate on the internet, wherin any upbeat movie that makes you feel good is trashed, regardless of quality. Anyone of even moderate intelligence realizes that there is room for many types films, and a truly well-made 'feel good' movie which is not shamelessly manipulative or contrived can be a great thing, which is exactly what 'The Terminal' is, along with being the best film of the summer.",10,0,1,23 June 2004
Gangs of New York," The most interesting failure of 2002.
","At times, Martin Scorcese's 'Gangs of New York' does a very convincing impersonation of a great film, but make no mistake, this is no masterpiece. Some strong performances (particularly from Daniel Day Lewis), exqusite cinematography and first-rate art direction do their best to compensate for a plodding, overly ambitious train wreck of a screenplay (somewhat surprising considering it comes from A-list writers Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan).This film has been a dream project for Scorcese since the late '70s, and while all of his technical brilliance is on display, he never really seems to decide what exactly it is he is trying to say. The disjointed and convoluted story never really seems to have a point. And many of the characters, particularly those played by Leonardo Di Caprio, Cameron Diaz and Henry Thomas, are uncompelling. This is not the fault of the actors. The much-maligned Di Caprio is, in fact, a very talented young actor, as we see from his outstanding performance in 'Catch Me If You Can' (a film made by Scorcese's only peer, who, unlike Scorcese, is still at the top of his game). It's the fault of the script, which places them in a relentlessly bland and stale revenge plot, and and even more stale romantic triangle. It's also the fault of Scorcese, who doesn't seem to be as interested in the characters as in the overall atmosphere, and in the technical razzle-dazzle of what he's doing with the camera.'Gangs of New York' has a lot going for it, but in the end, it does not work nearly as well as it should. It has moments of brilliance, but is not a great film.",5,2,4,21 January 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," One of the most perfect entertainment films ever made.
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' has everything you could possibly want in an entertainment film, and does every bit of it to perfections. Action, humor, romance, heart - every element is flawless. It is impossible to imagine a more enjoyable cinematic experience.Harrison Ford's performance has an effortless level of wit and charm, and the relationship between Indy and his father adds a new and welcome dimension to the character. Sean Connery plays one of the most unique roles of his career - a stuffy, bookish and vaugely wimpy professor who is quite the opposite of the suave James Bond or the hard as nails Marko Ramius. Yet his distinct sense of dignity is preserved, and he and Ford have Redford and Newman quality chemistry. The supporting cast contributes a great deal, particularly returning 'Raiders' sidekicks Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies. Underrated character actor Michael Byrne also does a nice turn as a Nazi commander, while Alison Doody makes for quite possibly Indy's most appealing and intriguing love interest. While Julian Glover's Walter Donovan doesn't have the prescence of previous Jones villains, he is nonetheless a interesting character, and Glover gives a capable performance.The script (by Jefferey Boam, with uncredited but unmistakable work by acclaimed playwriter and Oscar winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard) is extremely witty, but never in a self conscious or smirky William Goldman sort of way, and delves deeper into the character of Indiana Jones than the previous two films.John Williams score ranks among the best and most fully realized ever for a sequel. Rather than merely recycling the same themes, Williams created sensitive, evocative and downright fun music, complementing with occasional snatched of his own classic 'Raiders March.'Finally, Steven Spielberg's direction is at it's most imaginative and assured. The action sequences are eye-popping, and the character interaction is equally entertaining.There is no legitimate criticism to be made of 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.' It is the highest standard to which escapist entertainment can aspire.",10,1,1,22 March 2003
