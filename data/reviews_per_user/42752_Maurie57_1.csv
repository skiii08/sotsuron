The Blair Witch Project," I was very disappointed in the ending of the movie.
","Be forewarned - if you did not visit the Blair Witch Project website and watched the sci-fi cable channel's hour special about the movie - you will not understand the whole concept of this movie.  It was only after I came home and watched the cable special again, that I started to understand the ending.  I really loved most of the movie and I enjoyed the buildup.  But what was with that ending?  I know it is cool to use your own imagination - but that is why I read books.  When I go to the movies I expect to see the ending in front of me.They should have incorporated some of the one hour cable special into the movie.  I also feel that the movie was ruined by the ending.  This had the potential to be a really good scary movie.  'Scariest movie since the Exocist' - I think NOT!",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
