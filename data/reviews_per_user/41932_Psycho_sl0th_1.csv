Walk the Line," copy of ray
","Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie and i love Johnny Cash, but as i was watching it i could not help noticing a lot of similarities between 'Walk the Line' and 'Ray'. The story was very similar, but that cannot be helped much considering they are based on true lives. I just felt that the formula was the same for each movie, and i also felt that Ray was in fact a much better movie because i had not seen anything like it before. I also think Ray had more texture to it, it got me more involved with the characters and had a draper meaning within it. It also made me feel for Ray Charles and his addiction to heroin, more so then Johnny Cash and his addictions to speed. What i guess I'm trying to say is that in my opinion 'Walk the Line' is a poor mans 'Ray'.",7,0,0,7 March 2006
