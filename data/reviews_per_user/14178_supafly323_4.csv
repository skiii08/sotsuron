Requiem for a Dream," Required viewing for all film devotees *MAJOR SPOILERS*
","*MAJOR SPOILERS*Requiem for a Dream is not just another movie. Requiem for a Dream is right at or near the top of several lists: most intense, most disturbing, most depressing, most powerful... and, oh yeah, best of all time.
I'm not saying that this movie is the number one, best movie ever made. It has some flaws, mostly minor stuff, but they exist. Maybe I'll bring them up later, if I'm not too tired after praising the unequivocal genius of Darren Aronofsky and, equally, Herbert Selby, Jr., who co-wrote the screenplay and authored the novel that begged the movie.First of all, I have to comment on the split-screen technique. It is genius. I didn't think too much of it in the first scene, thought it was a little gimmicky but cool; but when Aronofsky split screened Marion and Harry on the bed, with one side on one of the characters' faces and the other on the small of the other's back, or the other's Adam's Apple, it made me shiver. The intensity of that scene, the power, the love I felt, I have never experienced in watching another movie. I have never felt the warmth of that scene outside of real life.Must comment on the actors' performances as well - Ellen Burstyn, while somewhat annoying at times, turned in the performance of the year precisely because she was so annoying. I just started to crawl down in her hole with her when she started popping more than one pill at once - and it shocked me. Jared Leto, who I've never thought much of before, was also mesmerizing. The scene in the kitchen with he and Burstyn (when he wants to tell her about the TV and finds out she is doped up)is, IMO, the finest scene of the movie. The tension, the feeling that these characters - with help from Aronofsky - create is absolutely gutwrenching. I love it. Jennifer Connelly is superb as Marion, so believable even as she descends into the arms and den of Little John. And Marlon Wayans as Tyrone also does an excellent job, especially once he and Leto decide to take off to Miami - the scene in the car, '600 miles from home' is also one of the movie's best.The attitude of this movie, the pacing, everything directorial, is perfect (thanks, Darren)... the script is mature and leaves just enough to the imagination. I love the way Aronofsky films the drug/coffee sequences... it got me thinking, hey, this isn't going to be that graphic. But all it does is hit you ten times harder when Leto shoots up in the car on the way down and you see his arm... and then you don't...The only negatives... I thought Ellen Burstyn's story was far inferior to the story of Leto, Connelly and Wayans. If Burstyn did not turn in such an amazing performance I would have hit the fast forward button about ten times. And without her performance, there really was no 'other' story besides the kids'. Here I think the script fails, spends too much time watching Burstyn descend, showing the same scenes over and over, when we just need PROGRESSION from her story. You'll notice Aronofsky only pulls out the 'gimmicks' - flying food, a walking refrig, and the TV show in her living room - for her story. No such fluff for the other story. In fact, I hated the living room TV hallucination in the same way I hated the hallucinations in THE BIG LEBOWSKI... it detracts from an otherwise mesmerizing script.Also at the end, the kids both end up in jail... i didn't get that... and Burstyn gets the shock treatment, which is graphic for the sake of being graphic. It doesn't add to the story. All the other graphic parts of the movie are totally necessary, totally realistic, except for that.Loved it overall, can't recommend it enough if you can stomach it...9.4/10",10,0,0,11 August 2001
The Others," Feh. (to quote another critic) *MINOR SPOILERS*
","*MINOR SPOILERS*Ahh... a mansion surrounded by fog. 'Eerie' characters and events that the director holds back from us, like we care, to create suspense. And many cliches later, you have the ultimate cliche, which would, yes, be that funny little cute little twist that smacks of The Sixth Sense. I liked it with Bruce Willis. I was ready to walk out after enduring an hour and a half of Nicole Kidman in one of the worst-scripted roles I've seen in a while. (She chases ghosts with a rifle - yes, it's true - and I was trying hard not to laugh out loud and disrupt the theater.)Not that she can act very well, either, but that's beside the point; i'll give her the benefit of the doubt here and put Eyes Wide Shut, and this bomb of a script, out of mind.What's good? Atmosphere. Kids.What's the worst? Waiting for nothing. I mean really, nothing. I knew it would come out why the girl is mute, i knew they would tell us the big deal with all the ghosts, it was just a matter of time. It's usually the responsibility of the director (and writer; in this case, the same unfortunate soul) to make sure we care why the girl is mute. In this case, feh. You know, I liked the candles but I didn't like Kidman drawing out the explanation, like it's some big mystery, like maybe we won't find out. Of course we find out. So tell us up front. Waiting on something like that does not make a movie. And that waiting WAS the entire movie. The entire 100 minutes that felt like 200, easy.two stars out of five, for Nicole Kidman being easy to look at, for the kids, and for that glassy look on the husband's face...",4,1,2,13 August 2001
Fargo," Doesn't even crack the Coens' top three
","Fargo is a very overrated movie.I've seen Blood simple, Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, and now Fargo, and I have to say, the first three win big over the last. What I like most about Coen movies is the originality - look at the crazy biker guy in Arizona, or the climax in blood simple, or the the entire movie in Lebowski. Their movies are stunning and ahead of their time.Fargo, on the other hand, is not. In fact, the script lies down so flat it's hard to believe that someone actually made this movie... it simply didn't need to be made. I have to give credit for poking fun at the north midwest - I was born in North Dakota and moved to Rochester, Minnesota and then St. Paul before heading East - but that just doesn't make this a good movie.The premise (guy hires thugs to kidnap his wife and he gets the ransom) isn't original. The criminal hi-jinks (kidnappers shoot everybody and anybody in their way) certainly aren't original. And please, Frances McDormand's character might just be the biggest cliche in the entire movie. Good cop gets the bad guys in the end. There wasn't even any suspense, nothing went wrong... most of the entire movie was predictable. And even though McDormand delivers a fine, fine performance, she's only in the movie for fifty minutes or so!The Coens' unmistakable touches on the film are what save it for me. The humor, the accents, the situational irony are superb. But they can't save the plot, which is just too ordinary.Overall a 6.5 or 7 out of ten, for fine cinematography, a very good score, the realistic accents, and the great ensemble acting. And any movie with William H. Macy in it deserves a good rating, IMO.",7,0,0,20 August 2001
Signs," Overhyped, ridiculous b-movie that doesn't try to be one
","-- Spoilers, because you shouldn't waste money on the movie anyway --Signs is not horrible.  Let's get that out of the way at first.  But it is a very mediocre movie, especially considering the rating it has on this ridiculous website.  Much like The Others, which was another supposedly creepy movie, there's really nothing scary in this movie.  You don't get to see what's scaring you -- some people have pointed this out -- and yet, well, yes, you do.  The movie's 'faith' question that everyone seems concerned about is essentially trivial -- some people believe that weird things happen because of coincidences, others think that weird things are signs, and when Mel Gibson breaks down, crying out, 'his lungs were closed!' you see Shyamalan's take on the question.  But it never really mattered whether Mel lost his faith in the first place, because Shyamalan is far from a gifted writer and Mel's character development was poor.  I cared more about why the little girl wouldn't drink her water (which we never found out) than why Mel's faith even mattered.  At no point in the movie did he really seem to have lost it, or did it matter whether he did or not.  (And speaking of the water, thanks, M. Night, for the ridiculous aping of Gremlins.)The problem is that Signs is a B-movie trying to masquerade as something deeper than that.  The plot is silly, but I found no evidence that Shyamalan was trying to pull a big joke.  I wondered out loud during the movie whether this was supposed to be a farce (having looted ideas from Gremlins, Close Encounters, Aliens, Evil Dead, even Blair Witch!) on the order of a Scary Movie, but it ended up taking itself too seriously.  The joke's on Shyamalan, and, I suppose, anyone who's actually scared by little green men, especially when the plot is so obvious from the get-go.
Shyamalan's movies keep getting worse.  Sixth Sense was pretty good. Unbreakable was intense and powerful, but ended up cluttered and confused. Signs is a sloppy mess.  Let's pray the 'next Spielberg' figures out what the ____ he's doing before he makes another complete dud and pulls the wool over the eyes of another massive audience.",4,1,1,14 August 2002
