First Man," Could have been better if......
",Decent casts but I would have changed a few of the actors. Script was good enough. My only real complaint was the background music. Have we lost all of the great people who in the past kept you interested in the movie instead of distracted with how bad it was? I kept turning the volume down only to lose hearing the dialog. This is the second movie this week who failed totally with this. Sad day for the movie industry & viewers. Better music it would have had a higher rating.,6,0,0,4 January 2019
