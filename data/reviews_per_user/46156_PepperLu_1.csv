The Sound of Music," One of the best movies you'll ever see--I sat through a downpour and a dousing by automated sprinklers to see it on a large screen at an outdoor theater this summer and I loved every minute of it! (Even tho
","This is, without question, one of the best movies ever made.  OK, it's sweet and simple, but what's wrong with that, anyway?  I'll take that over the mindless, loud, trashy, computer-generated drivel being made today.  The Sound of Music never fails to lift and inspire the best that is in me and I believe that is a large part of its tremendous appeal.  It speaks to our noblest ambitions and most dearly-held beliefs--freedom, family, God, country, love and the beauties of the world--the things that no one can ever really take away; the things that matter most.  Combine that with how beautifully crafted every element of the film is and you've got a classic, worthy of repeated viewings and of passing on to successive generations as an example of a well-made film that is truly a credit to all who participated in its production.  Beautiful music, outstanding performances, exquisite scenery, strong themes, humor, adventure and romance--it's got it all.  If I knew I was going to be stranded on a desert island with my VCR and only one movie, this is the one I would choose.  We need a little more innocence today and a whole lot of cheering up.  Thank heaven for the Sound of Music--long may it endure!!!",10,1,7,12 October 1998
