National Treasure: Book of Secrets," You call this a screenplay??
","Now, this may not at all been the screenwriters' fault, given the nature of movie making today. But there were so many holes in this script that it became distracting....anytime anything pulls you out of the world of the movie you know your in trouble, and there were moments in this mess when you found yourself just tossing your hands in the air and saying, 'But, but, what about (fill in the blank)????'. No spoilers here, but just know that there are enough problems with this story that it takes away all and any of the charm of the original.And am I the only one who thinks Cage is woefully miscast in this series?",3,5,9,4 January 2008
