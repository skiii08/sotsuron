Requiem for a Dream," A better-than-words sensory explosion.
","This is not a movie, it is an experience. From the beginning to the end, every element of this movie will touch you, thrill you, scare you, disgust you, and change you forever. It goes deeper into the subject of drug addiction than any other movie ever has. It also doesn't just focus on run-of-the-mill 'drugs' (ie heroin or marijuana), it shows the viewer that we use drugs on a normal everyday basis (ie pills, coffee, and the worst of all, television). Requiem is the story of four people whose lives are totally different, yet totally the same. I apologize if you haven't seen this movie yet, I cannot possibly tell you here how amazing this movie is. My words are dulling it down and making it so much less than it really is. I want to sound smart and analyze every part of this movie but it just isn't possible. There is too much. I promise that seeing this movie you will amazed at how much work Darren Aronofsky put into making this film utterly perfect in every way.",7,0,0,17 July 2001
