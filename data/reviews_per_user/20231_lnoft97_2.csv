Ford v Ferrari," BORING
","Picked this up at the Redbox because it has such great reviews. Good cast. It's OK for some, but I was bored. to. death. I really should have known better.It's just car racing like the trailer trash flocking in the red hot sun at NASCAR, hoping to see a flaming horrific accident. '

Puss in Boots," 7 stars, and that's pushing it.
","A wonderfully good looking movie about 20 minutes too long. All the chase scenes, the flying-through-the-air scenes, the long back stories grew tiresome, so I can only give it a basic five stars. I am adding one because the cats are just so darned cute, and one more star for Lady Gaga's song 'Americano' which somehow I never heard until I saw this movie! The little puns and bits of 'cat business' were cute, but I wanted to punch Humpty Dumpty in the face after a while! He was a bad egg, get it? And there should have been a little more fairy tale and a little less 'Zorro' type swashbuckling. A good movie, but not great. But if there was any spin off from Shrek, Puss In Boots was the logical result.",7,4,6,23 September 2012
