Skyfall," Good movie, but not a Bond movie
","------Spoilers-----Ahead----After reading rave reviews, I really wanted to like this movie. However hard I tried I couldn't. This one is absolutely brilliant film. but it is hardly a James Bond film. This is more like the copy of Bourne films like they did before + DB5 and attempt at some humor. And they recreated the last scene from Bourne Identity as well. Brosnan era might be absurd with WW3 plans and invisible cars, but at least they had the essence of Bond.It seems to me like the formula for last 3 bond films is to kill off the Bond girls and put some emotional stuff mix it, and serve. (did Bond cry at the end?)I personally like to see the classic James Bond film formula, like pre credit story which usually do not relate to the main story, and for heavens sake give us the Gun barrel scene at the beginning, and some villain with elaborate plan with less serious tone.and where is the James bond theme? Where is that surf guitar riff.? OK anyway this film.I think the humor is out of place and it will not make you laugh the James Bond way. and the DB5 is just there to remind us this is a Bond movie in case we forget. Action is average at best. (no goosebump raising scene like Bond in a Tank) and as a whole it does not feel like a James Bond film.I think villain is good but too serious, Craig is not bad but he cannot handle to humor bits very well. As a whole the movies has some nice scenes and done well.conclusion.I like to see Bond go on a spy mission, bed couple of girls, kill some bad guys, some gadgets from Q, and Villain with a plan to overtake to world. + an Aston Martin.I feel all three Daniel Craig movies are like Bond, Jason Bond.",4,9,19,23 November 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Anything but a Bourne film
","Everything that was right with the first three films is absent from this film. All 3 films starts with a mystery and then begins this fast action cat and mouse chase city by city all over Europe and ends with Jason Bourne bringing the fight back into the enemy's doorstep. That is the pretty much tried and tested formula all original trilogy went by. Now compare it with the story line of this film.The Bourne Legacy has a slow boring start to the film which tries to explain everything from the beginning and anyone in the Audience can guess what is the next step is. There is no mystery, no plot twists just a boring story line and two actors who try to make that work.As for the actors I got nothing towards Jeremy Renner's acting but we fall in love with Matt Damon because he looks like this short guy you will see everyday on your way to work who has amazing ability to use whatever there was in his arms reach to his advantage. With Renner I feel like they were trying to make him this superhero guy who is special than the rest of us.anyway. All I have to say is that it is apparent this film is made for love of milking the success of first films but not to make a great trilogy even better. Action is dull and boring, No mystery, No plot twists and finally no win for the good guy. This sucks",1,25,51,16 August 2012
