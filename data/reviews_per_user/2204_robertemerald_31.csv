Come and See," Perfect war horror
","The Director here is a champion of what I call the camera sweep. At times the camera travels as if bound to a drone flying long and slow over rural Russia taking in the landscape and the effects of war. It's such a mesmerising tactic, making the viewer an eyewitness. The other technique used is the framing of the shots and the concentration on faces, in particular the boy whose life during the war we follow intimately. There are other techniques, such as the use of animals to show suffering and shock, brilliantly effective and very moving. The use of mists was terrifically atmospheric, and contained an impression of being on the edge of danger, which, of course, it was. There is still more genius though, as some sequences are shown just beyond forest lines, creating a sort of outrage, as well as a true sense of partisan warfare. As well as this, one comes to realise a really true picture of the Russian farming life, poor yet happy, cruelly upset in gradually increasing violence, and thus more outrage for the viewer. I don't know if this movie was intended as a tragedy involving a boy or a broader indictment of war and its ravages, but both have been indelibly achieved. It's true at times there is a certain weirdness to behaviours, and certainly some licence was taken, but again the Director has purpose. I can't go into specifics without using spoilers, but the initial return to home was one case in point. Again I consider this technique genius. The closing sequence is also a stroke of genius. I consider this movie to be seminal, along with The Grey Zone, Schindler's List and The City of Life and Death. Easily one of the most authentic and heart-breaking war movies I have ever seen.",10,3,3,12 March 2019
Requiem for a Dream," Powerful anti-drug movie is a masterpiece
","Many of the techniques used in this movie (a lot!) would now be very familiar to watchers of music videos and horror, whilst others would be similarly familiar from other sources. However given this movie is now over 17 years old one has to wonder at the genius who created it. The techniques never throw the overall continuity or conformity to style out of whack, and strangely, despite the radical nature of the techniques, the movie never really descends into farce or comedy, attaining a satirical line above that perhaps, especially because we sympathise with the lead characters all of whom are basically good, but more than that, telling its story with heart, sincerity and determination. It's almost operatic toward the superb end. The important message comes across thanks to the casting characters and their very honest performances, from normal to disintegration. It's an eccentric movie, a joy to be swept away in. It's also seriously disturbing by its end and not suitable for children of any age. It's a timely swipe at the times it represents as well, the dangers of suburban isolation and loneliness in New York in 2000, and has a profound cultural importance. For movie buffs this is a must see.",9,0,0,8 March 2019
The Equalizer," Great flair
","I avoided this movie for years because it was very obviously just another big star big action movie. It's better than that. It reminds me of Bourne movies, highly professional and really, really enjoyable. The filming is super, wherever this movie goes, streets, bars, stores, one gets a real sense of rich urban texture. For no other reason this is a great look at Boston. The director has a talent for lighting and sympathetic closeups, as well as a sort of earthy pathos. It's a good length, its a good pace. How the baddie got his accent is pure talent. Denzil is as cool as Man On Fire. This movie is a guaranteed antidote.",10,1,1,31 January 2019
War Dogs," Solid biopic
","If you like movies like The Preppie Connection (2015) or Tom Cruise's American Made (2017) then you should like War Dogs. It's a well made movie with a great script. It seems natural and uncontrived, and has an ever more tense arc that delights. Seeing as it's all probably true, I can't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy War Dogs.By the way, here in Australia The Preppie Connection is marketed as The Cocaine Connection.",8,0,0,28 June 2020
Hereditary," Genuinely scary horror
","The set up here is truly original and propels the story forward with precise use of props and consequent framing of the imagery. I couldn't help admire the filmmakers' talent for finding perfect shots out of each scene to command the dread or outright spook the viewer. I'd imagine establishing shots or images were crucial too, and again a touch of genius. Use of dawns and dusks was also creepy. Spooky background soundscape as well, also a thing of unspoken talent. This movie must surely be cutting edge horror. The unusual rambling house in the woods is perfect, as strange lights from strange angles come on or extinguish. The filmmakers were bold with their use of special effects early on, and thus the transition to wilder happenings toward the end comes across as, well, perfectly reasonable. It's a descent into the abyss, it's spellbinding, and by the end of two pulsating hours one is genuinely transfixed. The evolution of the characters is truly a slow train coming, brilliantly timed and performed. There's nothing lazy about this movie. Aside from the creeping horror there are genuine moments of pure shock and awe. You'll be jumping with fright from very early on. And scared. Hereditary is a really good horror movie.",9,0,2,11 February 2019
The Death of Stalin," Surprisingly historically accurate real life farce
","I've just read about Stalin and his Terror, beginning in 1933 and lasting until his death. No one was safe, absolutely no one. As such the period is ripe for a movie about his death, particularly as he took a full 7 hours to die, and virtually no one had the courage to help him. This grand irony is given full measure in this production The Death of Stalin, and much, much more besides. We are given a clear picture of what the Terror meant for ordinary citizens, and the unfathomable character of affected people of those times. It's a black comedy with a sharp and difficult script for the actors, but thankfully they do a great job. Certainly not the funniest movie of all time (I only laughed once), nor the most brilliant historical piece (a lot of the characterisations involve persons far better looking, or inaccurate looking), but, for me, it was a blast to see history, accurate history, so well scrutinised. I so wish there were more films that do this. Wonderful, and important, entertainment.",8,8,11,4 September 2019
Train to Busan," Possibly best zombie fare I have yet seen after Resident Evil
",If you want to know what Train to Busan is like then think World War Z (2013) without the need to pay homage to Brad Pitt the scientist action hero. Busan is much more a touching tale of an ordinary man and his cute as pie daughter caught up in world slamming events. Those events broil away just as the train is leaving and then spill like angry snakes and writhing intestines at every survivable turn right through to the hold on to your seat ending. Amazing cinematography combined with amazing scenes of thrashing humanity. This one is worth every penny.,10,2,5,5 December 2019
Green Room," Unlike anything I've seen before, and full of tension
","This is a fine example of crisis horror, and groundbreaking, much in the way Wolf Creek was groundbreaking when it came out. Like Wolf Creek, it introduces us to a diabolical baddie, this time played by an unrecognisable Patrick Steward. He's a million miles from Star Trek in this, and magnificent. His performance was intoxicating, and together with the wandering and constantly surprising story and script, hard to look away. In many, many horror stories we are used to a group of young people being picked off one by one. Green Room's originality is that although that's the case here as well, it is presented in such a way that you really won't be able to see around any corner. It's much more real than your average teen horror, in that no-one falls to pieces, although clearly terrified, and in that things actually happen as you'd expect them to in real life, chaotically and usually with everyone (baddies included) fumbling badly. No-one is really a hero, another brilliant aspect. Patrick is not the only baddie, here they come in all shapes and temperaments, and their scheming is diabolical. Everything is just so unexpected. All the performances are terrific, perfectly cast, and although nothing is groundbreaking in any of the film techniques themselves, they were obviously all professional and competent, as all you'll ever notice is the strange tale being told and being spellbound as to what the hell might happen next. It's full of classic new shivers this one, and Jeremy Saulnier deserves to be on people's watch list for creating a truly original against the odds piece of genius.",10,4,6,29 May 2019
Us," As clever as Get Out, but better put together
","I loved the unusual and original idea for this movie. Us is doing what Hollywood is supposed to do with this movie, by suspending us in a lost world between belief and disbelief. Us works a treat. How I wish there were more movies like this one. Great imagery too. Top marks from me.",10,2,6,14 December 2019
Aquaman," Probably this year's best extravaganza
","No-one could safely complain about this movie. It's got everything. It's got a tidal wave, it's got vicious sharks, it's got as much colour underwater as Avatar's forests have luminescence at night, it's got as much action as two Bond movies and fantastic fight scene bashes, it has endless fantastical locations underwater and awesome scenic locations on land, it has better beasts than Harry Potter, and it has better submarines than Extraordinary Gentlemen. Quiet moments are rare, and in any case poignant. The water graphics are amazing, and often tasteful. I really don't understand critics who deride this work as too over the top. Over the top is the job of movies and the wonder of our age. If too much cgi bothers you, you should pay for a theatre ticket instead. What a relief this movie is, I can't thank it enough for being all in. A wondrous experience. This is the sort of movie that easily sustains itself for over two jaw-dropping hours. Punters should try to see it on the best quality, largest HD digital screen possible, preferably on Ultra 4D Blu-Ray. Buckle up.",10,0,2,28 April 2019
Moana," Classic Disney family fare with all the modern bells and whistles!
","This was possibly the best Disney movie I've seen this year. The songs are wonderful, the animation fresh, spectacular and not overblown. Everything sparkles with originality. The cast is, well, perfectly cast. If you enjoyed The Croods then this is the next step up. Hugely enjoyable.",10,0,4,30 June 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Interesting times, feel good story
","My problem with this movie is that it has two agendas. On one hand it's a feel good bonhomie, with a spicy love attraction, boisterous good cop buddies and zippy to and fro between the troops and higher command. That's entertaining. Then again this is also about an undercover operation with real perils, where the 'bonhomie' (with the racists) is contrived and false of course, and should have had me gripping my seat. I'm sorry but these two agendas clashed for me. Maybe for others that won't be an issue. Basically I found it all mildly exhilarating, and somewhat intriguing from an historical perspective, but couldn't resolve the nonchalant attitude of, well, just about everyone to everything.",7,0,4,5 May 2019
Underworld Awakening," Terrific action throughout
","It's true that this instalment doesn't have the charismatic villeins we know from the previous three, nor the Bram Stoker evil winged monster of Evolution, or the medieval mysticism of Rise of the Lycans. I think that it was this departure, with a storyline more in common with the original, that has caused some fans to think twice about Awakening. I myself thought some of the mystique had worn off with this one when I first saw it some time ago. But having watched it again I'm now convinced that this one deserves to rate well compared to the others. The editing, the use of silhouettes, and the more advanced use of stunts (Selene is extremely acrobatic, and that's for the entirety!), with wizard car chases, wizard jumps, lycans spinning cars, terrific explosions, brilliantly choreographed fight scenes, well ... it just works a treat. This is pure entertainment from start to finish. I strongly urge people to give this wonderful piece a fresh perspective.",9,2,2,30 December 2018
Suicide Squad," Thrilling action DC blockbuster
","This is a Will Smith movie. He has the best lines, is in nearly every scene and ultimately comes across as a huge righteous hero. But it is also a really fun blockbuster with all the bells and whistles you expect from DC and Marvel, brilliant special effects, fast action, fast cars and aeroplanes, lots of stunts, blazing firefights and punches, explosions, amazing props, and massive backdrops. Two classy classic villeins for this one too. Seems all the action I read as a 10 year old in comic books is now coming to life in this ever expanding universe. Even The Joker is in this pic, and I'll be honest, a whip cracking fellow he is! For any fans of this genre, Suicide Squad must be welcome news indeed.",9,0,0,27 February 2019
Doctor Strange," Explosive effects, kind story, honest characters, Marvel's marvel
",Some of the effects in this movie reminded me of the most over-blown moments in Inception back in 2010. Years later Doctor Strange offers viewers a movie that is worth seeing for the effects alone. I continue to be impressed by the Marvel Universe.,10,0,1,28 September 2019
Lion," Deeply sentimental eye-opener
","I loved seeing rural India in this movie. The first half, being a straight story arc without flashbacks, is set entirely in India and, indeed, is truly a masterpiece. The second half sees several complications added to the storyline, with the importance of other characters (with their own stories), along with frequent use of flashbacks as Saroo begins reliving his early childhood in earnest. This half sees many tears. The first half is on par with Salaam Bombay, and in fact resembles that movie in many ways. The soundtrack is orchestral, and I thought a little old-fashioned, although the motif is sweet, with piano dominating at times. As a biography it's a good reflection of an emotional loss and subsequent journey to find one's origins. Personally I thought other India based movies were better, such as Slumdog Millionaire or the one mentioned above, but then again I'm not sure it's fair to compare them. I'm sure most people will find this heartfelt and very sentimental journey a revelation, but for me the frustrations of the latter half, albeit a true story, were not as spellbinding as the magical first half.",7,0,1,4 June 2019
Incendies," Beautifully filmed, explosive and deeply saddening film of the Middle-East
","Incendies is like a series of shocks. It's as if there is a aeroplane circling overhead, with each circle pulling back a curtain over time, and on each circle dropping yet another bombshell on the viewer. Wonderful cinematography, rich colour, many panoramic vistas of the Middle-East, for this alone the film has power. As the tale swept over me during it's length I could see the honourable statements the filmmakers were making about war. I took a point off for the ending, which, for me, strayed off message and was one bombshell too many. It did explain the two parallel stories however, so, alas, I am forced to take another point off the score for that as well. For me just the story of the mother was all I needed to see, and except for the last ten minutes, that is what is deserving of a 10. Wonderful movie, but too much.",8,0,0,10 April 2019
Léon: The Professional," Carefully composed action drama that has a big heart
","The innocence of the two protagonists here, despite one being a killer, is what makes this movie. Leon is a very simple man from a poor background in Sicily, and although highly disciplined, comes across as very honest and caring. The slightly precocious Matilda is equally enigmatic, from a troubled background she is continually forced to rise above. Their relationship leaps off the screen from perfect performances, tugging our heartstrings. Gary Oldman also gives a no holds barred performance to create a supremely twisted character. It all has the quaintness of good child/adult drama whilst sending out regular sparks from orchestrated violence, a tough act to follow.",9,3,4,1 April 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," Sturdy and scenic construction, plenty of shock violence
","What makes this film is not so much the violence, which is well choreographed for impact and brutality, with survivors ending up soaked in blood, or the story, which is a sort of expansion of a desert, mutant Deliverance (1972), the mutants themselves being suitably grotesque, but the carefully chosen killing grounds. The locations were a sort of hostile charm offensive, full of stunning rifts, ridges and craters, as well as a spooky ghost town and a dilapidated service stop. This important aspect made the camera work and editing all the more stark and real, so you can more easily feel the rising heat and sense of despair. The Hills Have Eyes is not really like Last House On The Left (2009), being a separate genre more in common with Wrong Turn (2003), The Descent (2005) or Feast (2005). I'd argue that The Hills is better than all three of those movies, though there is plenty of teenage alarm as in Wrong Turn, and the bad guys are similar. The bad guys are less similar in Descent or Feast, which involve basically a separate species after mutation, although the dropping off of characters one by one in highly dramatic incidents is now run-of-the-mill. Still, this is full-on entertainment with great casting and direction, some totally classic scenes and moments, and, for me, some cool originality. Admittedly I haven't seen the original Wes Craven film. The plot wasn't predictable, and the tension was palatable. Great horror that hasn't aged.",9,2,3,23 September 2019
The White Ribbon," Disturbing
","Honestly, if you just want a vision of pre-war rural Germany then The White Ribbon is an idyll, very picturesque indeed. Beyond that, I'm not sure what the filmmaker was aiming for. My take was that as a result of the entrenched disciplinarian conceit of an older generation, with perversion as well as cruelty, some sort revenge by a younger vigilante is randomly attached to the most severe and guilty of this isolated community. Or perhaps, presciently perceiving the coming horrors of war, someone thus disturbed has protested with inspired acts of terrible cruelty. The movie is beautifully filmed, and the choice of black and white was inspired in that regard, but, alas, it's slow moving and the story is dark and strange and although a kind of resolution is achieved, I'd venture, for most, it will not be enough. Mind you, as a subtle warning against a type of strict conservatism of the past that we may at times confuse with a cleaner, more innocent time, well, in this regard the filmmaker may certainly have made a brilliant point.",7,0,0,8 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not like earlier films
","I understand Mr Tarantino's nostalgia, but I'm not sure why we the public had to subscribe to it. I hope this is his first and last vanity film. Brad Pitt looks good for his age and fans of his will enjoy his role in this. DiCaprio proves he can act. Is the age of Westerns and old Los Angeles really that romantic? If you think it is then this is for you. Nothing much happens in Once Upon A Time, and all the tension, such as there is, is provided by prior knowledge of what Charlie Manson's terrible acolytes did later. In this movie Tarantino has garnered the indie formula of a huge 90% build-up (relying on the actors to deliver interesting drama), to 10% monster ending, only his ratio is 5%.",6,0,2,29 March 2020
The Lion King," Lovely retelling with amazing real life animations
","I'm not really a fan of The Lion King as a story. Somehow it just doesn't make sense that predators and prey could ever really come together as one happy family. However, the fact that this is real life animation, similar to the brilliant Jungle Book (2016), makes this Lion King highly watchable. The problem I think is not that this version 'lacks heart' as some reviews have said, but that, for parents, it is a nightmare as to know what age can safely enjoy this. Possibly for under 10 I'd show kids the cartoon version, and wait until they are at least 11 to show them this one.",9,0,0,30 June 2020
Patton," Wonderful panoramic war movie
","The studio spent more than a few dollars on Patton and it makes all the difference. Without the incredibly good cinematography and wide-angle, sweeping and majestic outdoor recreations this movie would have been a very different cup of tea. Never boring and faithful to its objective, this is one of the best war movies ever made.",9,0,0,28 January 2020
Logan," More realistic X-Men episode works better
","I had heard that this movie could stand alone as a good movie even if it had nothing to do with X-Men. That it can and does says a lot about where a lot of independent or stand-alone movies that feature special powers as a premise could be like. For me that is the strength of this movie. Beautifully filmed with wonderful locations, terrific action, brilliant acting and a tiny sprinkle of cgi, this is the masterclass of how movies could look in the future. Science Fiction is an immense library. I think Logan opens up a lot of possibilities.",10,5,9,3 January 2019
Hotel Mumbai," Thrilling, heroic, and important
","There is never a dull moment in Hotel Mumbai. You cannot look away for a moment. Innumerable close calls and riveting moments of tension make this movie the easiest watch I've had this year. There are plenty of other astute and exciting movies about actual terrorism. 6 Days (2017) is a British movie that comes to mind. However Hotel Mumbai, in terms of the violence and terror is probably closer to Elephant (2003). How odd that Hotel Mumbai is also, like Elephant, ascribed to Australian Production. 6 Days is ascribed to New Zealand. Hotel Mumbai and Elephant both try to convey the sheer senselessness, stark terror and tragedy of a determined rampage. Hotel Mumbai has to be congratulated for putting together a movie which has so many moving parts, and in such a realistic and moving style. It is top shelf movie making and deeply honours a subject which causes so much concern. Absolutely heroic.",10,4,25,2 July 2019
Midsommar," Slow, long, but a competent alternative to The Wicker Man
","There are 2,502 reviews of this movie so I'll keep it basic. The Director here also did Hereditary (2018). That was a very creepy ghosty movie with very frightening slashes, so to speak. By the end it was both creepy and borderline bizarre, and truly frightening, with all up against an insidious, evil and almost unstoppable power. Top notch modern horror, in other words. Midsommar has the shock slashes, but you have to wait an hour for them. Neither movie is deeply original in its story, but certainly the style is original to the Director, and I began to notice that notably in the last 45 minutes or so of Midsommar, which was certainly tense. Midsommar is an excellent horror movie. It's not as frightening or as shocking as Hereditary. With Hereditary you couldn't see around the corner what was coming up. In Midsommar you can, but it's done really well. It's the same basic premise as The Wicker Man, but the story is not the same, and it's a different style, different vision. I had to dock it a point or two for the length (over two hours) and the fact that it gave the lead character a serious backstory, which was, to me, lazy writing. It meant that aspects of the story were obliged to be related to a prior tragedy, aspects not really related to what was actually happening. Midsommar differs from The Wicker Man in this regard too. I thought that significant and a mistake, but it does make good drama. It was just a bit too 'extra' for me, and extra, for me, implies pushing believability. It's a debatable and minor point. Midsommar is easily a decent 8 stars. Thankyou if you actually read my review.",8,0,8,5 June 2020
The King," Truly great film from Netflix
","The King has everything you want from an historical drama, particularly if you are male and love battles. The battle scenes are awesome, though still fall short of the literal thousands that actually took part. Close-up fighting means you won't really notice. But The King is also a thriller as well as a drama. There are some very unexpected twists. And it has a conscience, which is perhaps the main theme. This is the real surprise. It's a beautiful piece of writing, keeping within actual history, yet expanding for intrigue. Many of the characters are truly well done. It's brilliantly cast in that regard. Oh, and Henry actually looks like the real Henry. I can't tell the filmmakers how important that is. There's an overall darkness, that is, low light, to the piece. The medieval ages were lit by candles. Whatever, it works, as does the muted tones. The King will be one of the more respected historical pieces for 2019.",9,4,7,6 November 2019
Sausage Party," Seth Rogan does 3D
","Sausage Party is a Seth Rogan film, indeed, in the closing credits he appears several times, and that's the problem. Even though the animation is as clever as anything you'll see out of Dreamworks or Pixar, this is still a Seth Rogan film with, now, very familiar style of humour. I did laugh out loud once, and to be fair, the animation (if not the humour) was sufficiently inspiring for me to see the movie through to the end. Hollywood as well as Britain has a similar problem with comedy that is does with sci-fi, in particular superheroes, zombies and anything initially successful, in that it will endlessly repeat such successful themes. From America come Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell comedies, one after another, which to some of us appear more of the same. From Britain come huge sex-based comedies such as Little Britain. Seth Rogan comedies follow a similar pattern, although his movies This Is The End (2013) and The Interview (2014) did represent something classically different. In the same way Sausage Party represents something different again. It's still basically powered by massive sexual innuendo and stoner culture however, like almost all of his work. Much as I'm sure that that is exactly why people love him, for those that find such humour immature, then I think it important in a review to point out that that is still very much what one is getting into when you elect to see this show.",6,0,1,8 December 2019
The Last King of Scotland," Brilliant biopic. Moves like a thriller.
","I can happily give The Last King of Scotland a 9. It's tense, eye-opening, brilliantly played, and a bonus, it's all true. Just as a side note: Why was this ever called The Last King of Scotland when it's about Idi Amin? For years I saw Forest Whittaker's smiling face on the cover of the dvd, along with the title, and, weirdly, assumed it was a comedy like Eddie Murphy in Coming To America (1988). There must be something wrong with me... what a dolt I am!! Regardless, so glad I finally found this gem and the treasure within. This is a great movie, a really strange tale, one that cannot disappoint.",9,1,2,7 November 2019
The Woman in Black," Creepy, really creepy
","I remember this movie as the first thing Daniel Radcliffe did after Harry Potter, and we were all keen to see it. He was good! I've just seen The Woman In Black for the second time. I'd forgotten how really creepy it is. Set in the late 19th century was creative and wise. Full marks to the costume and props department. The house hovers between just lived in and abandoned, it's fantastic, and very haunting. Full marks for location too. All the actors are excellent. Daniel's character is deep and, importantly, brave. The filmmaker did a great job with lighting, film angles, atmosphere, framing, sound, etc, and there is a good hour of some really spine-tingling stuff. I had to dock it a couple of points for the ending, and having said that I'll have to press the spoiler button. Without spelling it out, well, it just didn't make sense after all he'd seen and been through. That's becoming a bit of a gripe with me. Too often in movies there is an important story detail that is just illogical as far as ordinary, responsible behaviour is concerned, and no one could accuse Daniel's character of irresponsibility. It didn't make sense and thus you are disappointed. Coming in at the climax, well, to be honest, lucky for the writer/Director team I'm only docking the two points. In my mind I made an adjustment and invented my own ending. It was too good a story to spoil it with an illogical ending.",8,1,3,1 April 2020
Warm Bodies," Oddball zombie thriller has found a winning formula
","Nicholas Hoult also stars in a sci-fi thriller called Equals (2016) with Kristen Stewart. Here, with Teresa Palmer in 2013, I found an odd similarity between the two, as both are love affairs. Equals is a regimented, sterile society with space travel, whereas Warm Bodies is an enclave and hard and gritty with zombies outside, but both stories are somewhat Romeo and Juliet. I wonder if one was the inspiration for the other. Warm Bodies has high production values. There is good cgi throughout, and as they have gone to the expense of using good cgi for some of the zombies, this movie has managed, in my mind at least, to jump from just another nod to cult popularity, to the true realms of really good sci-fi movie-making. Breathtaking backdrops on a scale like I Am Legend enhance the apocalypse vision here. I had to tag a point for never quite commanding the line between oddball (romance) and serious (apocalypse), as well as at least one minor flaw in the story. Aside from that I found it one of those movies that aims to get better, both visually and in terms of excitement, as the story progresses. This is a really good zombie film, and one where, even if you aren't a fan of zombies, you may just find yourself enjoying it.",9,0,0,19 July 2019
