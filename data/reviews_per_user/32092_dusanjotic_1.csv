First Man," Slow, dark, hand held camera...just wrong
","I was surprised that these people were allowed to successfully ruin one of the mankind's most exciting story. If you expect to see an extraordinary adventure and possibly find out more about moon landing, you should look for a different movie. This one is full of dark scenes and close-ups. All recorded with shaky hand held camera, so you actually fell as if you are watching a documentary. Story centres around the life and struggle of Niel Armstrong rather than the moon landing itself. The only reason I didn't walk out of the theatre is the hope that the ending will be done right. I was wrong to be hoping. Moon scenes were cut and again very slow and non exciting. So disappointing.",2,7,11,1 May 2019
