Vertigo," Far greater than you might have expected!
","Who says exposure of mystery or not is the key to distinguish Thriller and Mystery? In fact, I felt them both in this movie! As plot goes by, I discovered the truth with protagonist. Then at the end it caught my breath. I was wondering what he would do and what could possibly happen.I've been always unwilling to watch movies in old days, thinking they are old and might be unacceptable. To be specific, the cinematography is absolutely not as beautiful as today, and the edit is now like today's style — fast-pacing. So many times I chose to watch some ordinary ones in current age instead of some classic ones in old days. But that's so wrong! As time goes by and technology develops, what's left for the next generation would always be the best. Those average- quality ones would simply be replaced by the best. So for now, most of the movies would be regarded as trash maybe in hundreds of years later. Then why waste time watching them if I'm not enjoying them?So, only look for those movies which can make you enjoy - the fantastic story the movie tells - the way the director represents the story - the work of editor and cinematographer that makes it an art - the great performance of those actor and actressBack to this movie, the reasons I love it stated below. Its dialogue is designed so natural. I don't know whether it is just the style they talked in 50's or not. For me, overall, it looks natural. And the other thing is they keep connecting to the next topic they wanna talk about or the next plot that's gonna happen. And it is so fluent.Actress is so beautiful. I've always heard that in Hitchcock's movies, actress would always be beautiful blonds. Haven't got a chance to see that. We'll see.The editing and filming is actually far better than I expected, since you know it's a 1958 movie..In a word, it is so great! And now I get to understand why people would talk about Hitchcock's movies a lot and regard him as one of the greatest directors in film history.",10,4,6,16 November 2015
Zodiac," Overall, it is a movie that worth recommending
","Before I watched this movie, I never knew David Fincher has this movie. It might not be that famous so people rarely mention this.So before I actually watched it, I did some research. - This movie is based on a book. - Zodiac is an astronomical term describing sun and moon moving paths. - Cast. — Jake Gyllenhaal is good at playing some guy who is really obsessed in something or could be really concentrated on something, like detective in Prisoners (2013), reporter in Nightcrawler (2014). — Robert Downey Jr, well we all know, he is good at play iron man, and iron man-ish characters, meaning that his style is some talented guy, enjoying luxurious life and at the same time doesn't care about details. — And Mark Raffulo, the professor in The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), detective in Now You See Me (2013), and some character in The Normal Heart (2014 TV movie). In my memory, his character was always pursuing something and exhausted and always not the one who won the most. I would say, his performance is really wonderful, especially in how to bring audience into the way he is thinking. - James Vandebilt is the writer for this movie, taking care of screenplay. It's the first time I pay attention to writers. So really no comments..So as the movie begins, I was thinking, Fincher is really good at attracting people's attention, and he's really good at Thriller genre movies. There's a scene at the beginning, two young kids are shot and that suddenly gets my into thinking. What is happening? Why was that? What is it about? Questions like these would strike my mind make me focus on this murder case. But as time goes by, I feel like the movie was too long and my attention slipped away. Since I cannot really focus on the mysteries Fincher was trying to make. And thus at the end I felt it was not that good.Then I did the research again, and found out that this is the real murder case happened in history. And someone said this is so good cause it makes everything so real and while we are watching it we will always keep thinking about the real case. Well I can only say it depends on background. Since I'm quite not familiar with that, I didn't really pay attention to this.So in summary, I wanna list all elements in Thriller Movies. - Stories. Really good stories! It is always combined with Crime and Mystery. And of course Drama. Since movie is about telling a story (not only about the story itself), it is also important to keep an eye on rhythm. — Usually there's like puzzles or some patterns that make people obsessed. Since it has this really requirement. The writer or the director should somehow make it more dramatic. In fictional ones, it's okay that they create wonderful but unreal plots. But in factual ones, they need to pay more attention to how they handler facts and drama. — And good characters, maybe detective, maybe the bad guy, how has this really special personality that is so attractive. Or even psycho! — Well I'm kind of confused about the difference between Thriller and Mystery.Overall, it is a movie that worth recommending.",7,0,0,15 November 2015
Black Mass," Great performance but weak story
","Johnny Depp's performance is so great! So is his makeup. And what else would be a good reason to recommend this movie?The Story is really not that wonderful. And also the character is not outstanding, special enough for people to remember.It is based on history in Boston. So that might be a reason for me to go to theater to watch it.Good but old, classic mob and gangster movies would be: Godfather (1972, 1974, 1990) Goodfellas (1990) Pulp Fiction (1994).Besides this, we cannot really see there's some good gangster movies recently. How is it coming?",7,0,0,15 November 2015
Million Dollar Baby," It's good story what brings up your feeling of loving life
","Write before watch it.About cast:The director is Clint Eastwood. And he also performed in this movie. Hmm, interesting. Then I did some research, and found out he did the same thing before — directing and performing in the same movie — in Gran Torino. That's pretty cool!This movie won the best picture of the year, 2005, as well as best directing in Oscar. So the Eastwood as a director may be doing a good job! And also, as an actor, Eastwood also get dominated as well. That's awesome!The screenplay writer is Paul Haggis. He writes for both TV series and movies. He is famous for writing for this movie, Million Dollar Baby(2004), and two 007 movies: Casino Royale(2006), Quantum of Solace(2008). And he got dominated!It won best leading actress performance, by Hillary Swank. But I don't know who she is..It also won best supporting actor performance. Morgan Freeman took it. And it's the only one he got awards. The other four are only dominated.Also, the editor got dominated! He's Joel Cox, edited in Prisoners(2013), Gran Torino(2008) and this one Million Dollar Baby(2004).About the story:Quote from IMDb, 'A determined woman works with a hardened boxing trainer to become a professional.' That's pretty simple.So I guess the genre would be only Drama. It's about boxing, so it's also Sport. But before that, we already have Rocky(1976), and The Fighter(2010) etc. What makes this one outstanding? Though I haven't watched the other two..Last word:My doubt is, how to watch/analyze the editing of a movie? In the words, what makes them good or bad?So let's begin.After I watched it:Clint Eastwood actually is good at acting, far better than I thought. So I did some more research on him. And he really rocks!Directed American Sniper (2015), got dominated in best motion picture; Directed Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), got dominated in best motion picture and best directing; Directed and performed in this one, Million Dollar Baby (2005), got dominated in best motion picture, best directing and best performing; Directed in Mystic River (2003), got dominated in best motion picture; Directed and performed in Unforgiven (1993), got dominated in best motion picture and best performance.God this guy is a rock star!Second thing, I keep thinking what is film, and how they are supposed to be. Someone told me, that watching a movie is more like experience a different life (yes even it's in that two hours). If it's true, then the only standard to test all the things in a movie is whether it can bring us into that 'life' or say that feeling. Actors and actress' performance, costume, makeup, decoration, photographing and editing, the of course directing.So, without all the fast-pacing action scenes, mysteries, unnatural elements, I always wondered why drama movies keep attracting audience, and how. Then it turns out that it might be the similar feeling in this genre of movies that brings up our feeling or memory. And that happens to the most important quality of a movie, according to what says above. But of course, it needs a good story and a good director.This one is really worth recommending to those who love lifes.",9,0,2,27 November 2015
