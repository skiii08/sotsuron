The Benchwarmers," Why such bad comments???
","I went to see this movie after finding the previews funny on TV. I expected it to be mildly funny, but not hilarious. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a slapstick-type of comedy, but it wasn't the BEST comedy I've seen. Nor was it the WORST. I have read so many negative posts about this movie, and can't understand why. I find it hard to believe that some people were unable to find 'one' funny part in this movie. I, personally, LOVE Jon Heder, and loved him in Napoleon Dynamite. His character was just as funny in this movie, and I liked all of the other supporting actors' roles. It was funny and entertaining overall. I don't feel that I wasted my money. Against my usual 'rules', I took my 11 year old daughter to see this. After seeing the PG-13 rating, I was a little hesitant. But she's BIG into softball/baseball, and begged to see it. She LOVED it also, as did the rest of the theater audience. They were laughing equally as hard as we were.",5,0,3,10 April 2006
The Notebook," Delightful movie full of soul and true love.....
","I cried through the entire movie. It is full of true love, dreams, and miracles. I love romance and love stories. This movie encompassed all that is good in love and life. The story line was great, and I just wish everybody could be as devoted to their loved ones as the characters in this movie were. This is one of my favorite movies to date, and I hope more people can watch and learn from it. I know I did. :) I would watch this movie over and over, hoping to catch new things I didn't notice the first times around. I hope to see more love stories like this one, about devotion and true, unconditional love. I even had my husband watch it with me a second time, and he liked it as well. If you haven't seen it, rent it. Make sure you have tissue nearby!!!",10,0,0,13 November 2005
