Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad.
","Too much Jar Jar, not enough development of Maul or Qui. Would have been nice to see Maul make it to the second movie. Now Siddious has to train yet another cool bad guy while waiting for Vader. Movie was too much of a Star Wars (orig) clone. Should have been made more as part one of three instead of a completely stand-alone movie.",5,0,1,21 May 1999
