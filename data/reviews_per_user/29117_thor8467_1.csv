The Incredible Hulk," Great...as long as you like the Avengers plan
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun, loud, and reminded me why I enjoy going to see movies in a theater.As many have said, there are plot holes. But they seem intentionally done. It is well known that the powers that be are intending to create several superhero movies with a culmination of an Avengers movie. It is dreadfully obvious within The Hulk that the focus was to have different story elements tie into that final project.The acting was alright. I preferred Eric Bana's version of Bruce Banner over Norton's. But, as we have come to expect from good ole' Edward, he puts up a decent front as a cowardly scientist. Live Tyler gives the most generic performance of her life, complete with her trademark breathy voice and all. But, having her not be in the limelight so much actually worked for this movie.The two stand-outs in this movie are William Hurt and Tim Roth. Hurt plays a great General. While he didn't do a whole lot with the role, he made it believable. Tim Roth is superb, finally finding a role for himself outside of the shadow of Mr. Orange. I loved him in every scene of the movie.The CGI was never completely amazing, but it does its job. Best part, though, is the Hulk has a five-o'clock shadow. Seems like no big deal, I know, but it was just fun to see an 'edgier' looking Hulk (as opposed to the far too clean Hulk in the last movie).As for the director, he knows action sequences like no one else and flaunts it here. Each battle was uniquely and interestingly handled, with the final one being very satisfying. Granted, the ending may not have been to everyone's taste, it heavily ties into my statement in the first paragraph. The intimate scenes weren't perfect, but they do their job to help push the story.I recommend going to see this movie...that is as long as you intend on seeing this Avengers plan follow through. Basically, it is like Pirates 2: Dead Man's Chest: it's a good movie if you plan on seeing all of them. The Hulk proves to be an awesome superhero, but he's lucky that there are tie-ins to the Avengers project.",7,4,8,15 June 2008
