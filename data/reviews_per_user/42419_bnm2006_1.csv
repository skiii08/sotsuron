Deja Vu," Watch this movie...
","This movie was an absolute treat. I consider myself a movie enthusiast who is always critical when a movie deserves it, but this movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout. I want to shake the hand of the person who created this masterpiece. If you like action/thriller/suspense in any combination, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie...and if you don't, you must not like being entertained. Watch this from beginning to end and kick anyone who has already seen it out of the room because I needed to take a breather halfway through to collect myself for what was coming. You have no idea what you're in for and I'm really not embellishing. This is my first comment and probably my last, unless another movie can make my heart beat like that again. Now I must go lay down and relax after what I just went through. Enjoy.",10,6,12,6 May 2007
