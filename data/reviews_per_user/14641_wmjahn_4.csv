3:10 to Yuma," What a train wreck of a movie !
","Whilst the original adaption of the Elmore Leonard story is a nice B-movie, the re-make is a D-script (if D at all ...) filmed with an A-budget and starring a totally miscast 'hero' Russel Crowe.My God, what a turkey! I have just seen the re-make on TV out of interest, so I could compare todays filmmaking with the old semi-classic. I didn't expect much, but what I got was even less than I could have expected.I know, yeah, a really good western is probably the toughest movie to make (and the last time Hollywood succeeded in doing so was OPEN RANGE and before that Eastwood did one of his best works with UNFORGIVEN), because the settings of the genre are limited and you can't have that much 'big/expensive scenes' with explosions, car chases (smile), etc, so you have to rely to a reasonable/good story and some interesting characters, but both is totally lacking here. In fact the makers of this re-make didn't trust the story at all and threw in all kinda over-the-top action-scenes, which just look much too implausible to be taken seriously.The character of Russel Crowe and especially one of his gang-members is despicable, but of course having a leading man like Russel Crowe (who gives the label 'wooden acting' a new meaning), Hollywood can't show him as filthy criminal, but needs to build a hero out of him. So the movie takes a good time developing that the people he has killed and kills 'deserve' their fate. It's just ridiculous - and sorry for moralizing - that Crowe/Wade killing a member of the posse with a fork (!) gets him just a medium-severe beating. The same goes for his next victim: in fact the only above average-interesting character in the movie, the Pinkerton-man played by Peter Fonda, is characterized a good half-hour as the most evil person imaginable (by a moralizing (!) Crowe) to be then thrown off a cliff for good sake and what happens to Crowe: nothing again! Come on, I hate it when scriptwriters think I am an idiot, taking sh-- for gold.And Crowe is established as some kinda good (!) anti-hero, about whom the boy fantasizes as being a morale person, not totally evil. That's ludicrous and I don't see how somebody, who kills and destroys merciless, can have a good side or be worshiped?? When LEONE had an evil character in his western, he established that right away, of course with a portion of cynicism, for example like in GOOD, BAD, UGLY (EASTWOOD being 'good', Lee van Cleef being 'bad'), but this 3:10 TO YUMA re-make does in fact take the good side of Wade indeed seriously.And to 'balance' that, the movie does of course need somebody really 'evil' (to establish how 'good' Wade is in comparison) and introduces a silly-staring gang-member, who lets somebody burn inside a carriage. That scene is especially ludicrous, because that just would not have happened in any decent western, it's totally against the 'rules of the genre'. Near gore-like scenes like this don't fit into a western, and it doesn't have anything to do with 'widening the boundaries' of the genre to put in repulsive scenes like this one.As I already mentioned, on top of all that Crowe is totally miscast. Not for a second do I believe his 'character' as an outlaw, he just looks 'too good', too well-fed with his puffy face (Mr. Crowe, stop eating junk food!) and too contemporary with his 'I don't like fat' (haha!) eating-habits. Of course somebody like him cites the bible and tries to philosophize, which probably should establish the intellectual side of the evil. Yeah, in 'modern'-day Hollywood it has become kinda 'politcal correct' to have the bad guy being a misunderstood intellectual with a hard upbringing ... hey, come one, that can't be meant serious (but it indeed is!) ?? Of course, compared to that (the lesser star) C. Bale looks like a stupid farmer, whilst in a good script, if there would be some moralizing, then it would fit (T)HIS character ...And the ending ... well, I think I can skip that, many other posters on the IMDb have already pointed out how silly/stupid/unfitting it is (btw, Elmore Leonard doesn't like the changed ending either).So ... another re-make which should have been avoided. It's sad, but Hollywood can't do any good genre movies anymore. People, who don't understand the western-genre, should simply stay away from it instead of ruining it even further!",1,16,28,16 August 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," So what ?
","I just saw 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' and it is time for a bad review.What is one of the worst things a 'thriller' (even a 'funny' one) can be, aside from an illogical plot, story-loopholes to get tanks through (right from the start), sup-par acting and a brain-dead script ...? Well, maybe predictability ? This one is predictable from start to finish ... And it is a one-joke-movie ... how must the producers have laughed at the 'clever diea' of a hit man and a hit woman marrying by accident ... Why did I watch it ? Well, at least I did not spend some hard earned money on it, because I just saw it on TV, but of course ... money ...I read somewhere that this one cost 100 million dollar to make (where are they ? I could not see them, but maybe all the fireworks cost that much ?) and that it crossed unbelievable 400 million at the box-office. If so, that's a shame! Anything good to say about it ? There are 2 or 3 nice one-lines, but 2 or 3 one-lines don't make a good movie. Yes, Angelina Jolie looks great, but again ...So what's the most memorable about it ? I give it two points for Ms. Pitt's tits.Otherwise forget it and watch PRIZZI'S HONOR from 1985, that is a good one (and I bet nobody from the crew or cast of 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has ever seen that one).",2,0,5,28 October 2007
The Departed," And the audience laughed ...
","Well, I went to the cinema yesterday evening to give Marin SCORSESEs new so-called 'masterpeiece ' a viewing and there are indeed a couple of positive things one can say about this movie: 1.) It could have been a really nice little mean & dirty B-movie (the storyline is indeed great and would have made fantastic B-movie material), but it was not to be. 2.) DiCAPRIO does indeed give an outstanding performance, much better than I had expected. 3.) It's a nice time-killer and certainly watchable 4.) There's one really terrific scene very much at the beginning, when DiCAPRIO beats up two molesters in a small deli. This scene has a raw quality and utterly believable eruption of violence, which is unmatched in the later scenes of the movie.That said, there are unfortunately so many (needless!) implausibilities, logical impossibilities and story-holes, that the movie as a whole is unfortunately a far cry from the 'masterpiece' it has been called by some critics. In fact Scorsese seems to be out of sync with his material fro a few years already and has not achieved any major artistic achievement since the days he has made such great movies as RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. Personally I consider this a pity and can actually not imagine Scorsese has not himself realized the above mentioned and down below discussed shortcoming, which are:1.) The major implausibility or even logical impossibility is Mark DAMON walking in some high-$$$ fancy apartment - as a young policeman - and either renting or buying this (I think more renting). He simply could not afford this with the average or below-average income he is supposed to have. Looked at critically by the guy, who would rent it to him, he utters some line that somebody would guarantee for his payments, but at that time of the movie, the only rich person he's connected with is the molester played (over.played, unfortunately) by Nicholson. As the story progresses and the police has realized that they have a traitor in their own lines, all people are checked in detail, but obviously nobody takes any notice of the question, how DAMON can afford this style of living (even now equipped with an average-wage-earner girlfriend). Come one, that's not a minor implausibility, given the fact that everybody's lives are checked so much in detail!! And it's completely useless! There's no need for the story to have DAMON live in such an expensive apartment. he could have easily rented a small affordable one and the following story would have developed the same.2.) Now I am certainly no moralist, when it comes to foul language, but with foul language you have the same problem as with exceeding violence. With more and more of the same, it does not only get redundant, but it also wears thin, get's implausible and even ridiculous. Already at one of the very first scenes with DAMON he calls other footballs players some (here) unprintable words. He does not call them that once, but he calls them that some 4 or 5 times, speaking as fats as a machine-gun and already after that scene you ask yourself, if the guy is really in control of himself (which he'd certainly need to be, with that story to follow). The whole picture goes on like that, every 10th to 15th word is ****(in), ****(in), **** sucker and whatever else. Everybody (!) seems to talk that way, the low mobsters, the high mobsters, the low and the high policeman, only the few women are an exception. Now, is that believable that really EVERYBODY shouts obscene words in every fitting and unfitting scene? I very much doubt this and less would certainly have been more and more impressive. A needless waste of credibility again. (I do have an explanation for that nevertheless: SCORSESE wants to show us - the audience - how similar the good and the bad guys are ... well, an old story and not the right way to tell us that, I'd say).3.) NICHOLOSON is usually good when playing a mobster. And that's how he starts. He does look sinister, does some SHINING-faces, does a lot of wise-cracking and the movie strolls on. As time progresses, Nicoloson seems to get out of sync with his role. He does some wisecracking, he makes faces, utters lines here, utters lines there and that how it goes on until a real low-point, when NICHOLSON does some wise-cracking and makes the face of a rat. For the first time people laughed in the audience, but it wasn't the laugh of apprehension, it was that of disbelieve and I'd say SCORSESE would not have cherished theses laughs. As the movie progresses NIOCHOLSON becomes more and more unbelievable in his role as a hard-boiled mobster. Wise-cracking once in a while is fine, but also in this case: (much) less would have been more ... In fact as the movie progresses one starts to wonder if the mobster NICHOLSON plays is really intelligent enough to get a top position in organized crime, to become 'the king' as he himself seems it and to hold such an organization alive with wise-cracking and his mimic antics. I VERY MUCH doubt it. I also see the difficulty of even a seasoned director like SCORSESE to say a 'no' to NICHOLSONs antics in shooting, but that doesn't change the impression of implausibility that rests with the viewer. A middle-'management' guy in organized crime, yeah, but the top leader in Boston ... no!Since I am only allowed 1000 words, this is continued at the discussion board!",4,2,5,28 December 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Just plain simply DEPRESSING .... :-(
","Come on, this gets an 8,0-voting on IMDb ?? Who are those viewers, who think this is a superb movie ? I saw it yesterday, because I liked the first 3 (esp. 1, of course) movies, but it was nothing short of a let-down. Just plain awfully depressing.Willis is still OK, but the whole movie is nothing but stupid popcorn-cinema. After the overlong 2 hours 10 minutes were over I had the impression the producer, 'director', scriptwriter and whoever else, set out to make the most unbelievable, ridiculous, unrealistic movie imaginable.The whole storyline is laughably unrealistic (even AFTER 9/11 !) and utterly implausible. It doesn't do the picture any harm, but speaks volumes about the script that even at the end it is NOT clear, what the bad guys actually wanted: money, destabilize the USA, bring down the financial system, revenge, destroy capitalism, ... whatever ? Sure, the motives are unnecessary, it's just an overproduced multi-million dollar star-vehicle anyway, but still, it shows how little care was given to any 'character development'.But that's the least problem this movie has.It's plain simply boring, too! The first 10, 20 minutes have some nice scenes, but when the action starts its just run-of-the mill stuff, and most action scenes are just computer-animated cartoons: unrealistic looking and completely implausible. That does not create any tension (at least not for me).Besides, its direction is completely uninspired. Who is Len Wiseman ? After this picture I don't care. Tiernan and Harlin, who made 1 & 3, respectively 2, are directors, who know their craft. Especially Tiernan knows his job and has done some brilliant work: DH I, Predator, Hunt for Red October, but obviously he didn't want to do # 4. I understand why, with this script. Renny Harlin is no match to Tiernan but still did a lot better job than Wiseman. Wisemans direction is plain simply uninspired.Die Hard 4 tries 'hard' for humor, but it all comes over very forced. The dialog is even bad for a silly action flick, all this stupid blabla about heroes, it just does not fit (it fits into a John Wayne flick, but not into a DIE HARD-movie, it's simply uncool there - Willis looks bored in these scenes anyway, I guess he would have thrown out this dialogue, if it would have been his decision).The MUSIC by Beltrami is nothing short of lacking ANY compository skill, it's just VERY loud and pounding noise, impossible to listen to.A real let-down, depressing to see this last entry. Now I know why Willis did not want to do a # 4 and am sure no # 5 will ever be made (unless he would need a lot of money). Still, even in this mess of a movie, Willis does come off best, which speaks for him.Nothing anybody has to see, just skip it and remember # 1 (to # 3, which I consider the second best entry).",1,27,53,19 July 2007
