The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Amazingly beautiful!
","'La Double Vie de Veronique' must be  t h e  most beautiful movie in the history of filmmaking!! The camerawork and the acting is great and the story intriguing, but the best thing of all is Zbigniev Preisner's music around which a lot of the plot is centered. I went directly from the movie theater to the record store to buy the sound-track, and it remains one of my favorite CDs today, almost a decade later. SEE THIS MOVIE AND HEAR FOR YOURSELF!!!!",10,2,4,5 March 2000
