Scarface," An opening eye for a reality unseen...
",Truly an amazing movie. For anyone to criticize this movie on it's gore or violence shows ignorance for the movie's scene. How can you portray a school without children? How can you portray a drug lord without violence? Sure it has it's cinematic over-spurs as any movie would but they are surely justified by the conclusion of the main character. Truly a movie worth the time to watch or even buy. Not one for the younger kids. A story of a Cuban coming to the United States with a dream of freedom only to be locked down like most Americans by financial burdens. Instead of taking the common burdened path this driven Cuban chooses an alternative risk for reward route and climbs to a level of success unseen by the vast majority of society.,10,1,2,3 March 2005
