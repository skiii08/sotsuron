Sucker Punch," Ass-Kicking Schoolgirl action against Zombie-Nazi's
","I went to the theater completely blank, and came out dazzled with sparkly bits in my eyes. I think if you take the movie for what it is, you'll have the ride of the year, but if you expect Shakespearian dialogs and minute character depictions... don't, please. I feel all the criticism on this movie is utterly misplaced, it's just what it is guys, come on. To sum it up: 'Candy doesn't need to have a point, that's why it's candy' Besides, I was in love with the first part of the movie. I thought it was really powerful the way it was approached, a bit like a silent film noir, which would be appropriate for the time it's set in. I also feel that Emily Brownings is a great actress and she made the absolute most of what she got to work with. She is blond and has big lips, yet doesn't look like your average Hollywood bimbo. She shows a pain and intelligence in her eyes that really gets under your skin. The only questions that rose to my mind was, 'who's fantasy is the cathouse?' and 'how come it's the same for everyone?' but those were eased really fast by a simple fact, it's all filmed from Baby Doll's point of view. And why is there so much criticism on the skimpy costumes of the girls? I thoroughly enjoyed that, and I'm female! Ye olde 'OMG this is degrading to women!' is REALLY getting old, everyone... what is so wrong with girls showing off their body, if they have a body that is so beautiful? I feel that all the actors in the film did a really good job, and this flick is just one big middle finger to the stereotypical shallowness of Hollywood, interwoven with just plain nerdy fetishism of Big-eyed-Nazi-zombie-ass-kicking-school-uniform-wearing hotties. I think this movie is a 'Charlie's Angels steak with a nice, buttery Sin City gravy' and there's nothing wrong with that.Addition: As I have mulled this movie over for a few days, I came to realize it's much much more than just the blatant eye-candy. THIS candy does actually have a point. I'm agreeing with others on the theories of the use of metaphor for the abuse endured by the girls in the asylum, and it has strengthened my belief that whoever hates this movie, simply didn 'get' it. So critics: Go see the wizard, and ask for a brain, please.",10,4,10,30 March 2011
