Casablanca," 'Everybody goes to Rick's'
","I'd seen 'Casablanca' many times before taking Robert McKee's 'Story Structure' workshop several years ago. His artful dissection of the film--the centerpiece of his presentation--served only to increase my admiration for its many levels of significance. Its narrative design, its psychological subtlety, and its effectiveness as propaganda early in World War II make this a film that offers new insights with each new viewing. Like great literature, its richness remains superlative but never superfluous, and its economy of expression articulate, not taciturn. When I occasionally teach scenes from the film in theater and literature classes, students often note how even very minor characters with only a few lines achieve a presence that exceeds their roles. For many of my students, 'Casablanca' becomes the beginning of a 'beautiful friendship' with their own capacities for appreciating the kind of artistic integrity it embodies.",10,1,2,25 December 2004
