Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the classic adventure-action movies Hollywood has made in a long time
","The movie 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has everything a viewer could ask for. From the opening scene, where Indy establishes himself as a go-for-broke adventurer doubling as a mild-mannered university professor, to the climatic scene where the lost Ark's contents are opened for inspection by 'unworthies', the movie goes from one big adventure to another.  It plays like one of the 15-chapter serials that used to be made, as there are so many cliff-hanging escapes by Indiana Jones and his friends.  This film gave birth to two sequels that featured their own escapades, but this should rate as the best.  'Raiders' gives a new and exciting meaning to the term 'CLASSIC'.",10,0,0,26 November 1998
Spartacus," Story of the Roman slave that attempts to lead a slave revolt against the might of Imperial Rome
","'Spartacus' used the talents of Kirk Douglas and the other members of the cast to invoke a strong message against the ancient practice of slavery. Based in part on an actual time in the history of Rome, Spartacus, the slave portrayed by Douglas, does remain true to the times of this screen epic.Kirk Douglas did have a hand in some of the production tasks of the film, but the major part of the work goes to Stanley Kubrick.  While on camera, Douglas delivered a performance that should have won an Oscar, but did not. However, Douglas did a lot of the physical stunts involved with the film, and delivered a very fine on-screen performance.  Other members of the cast that made this film stand out were Jean Simmons, as his wife, Varinia, Charles Laughton, as a Roman senator, Laurence Olivier, as Crassus, the one that ultimately captured Spartacus, John Gavin as Julius Caesar, Tony Curtis as a friend of Spartacus, John Ireland and in a role that many actors relish, Peter Ustinov, who trained the slave as a gladiator, and then saw him lead the uprising against Rome.  Battle scenes are first-rate, the gladiator contests are well staged, and the viewer is taken back to the city streets and arenas of Rome, when that location controlled all the known world.  A lengthy film that gets better appreciated after each and every viewing.",9,1,2,30 June 2002
Gettysburg," An overwhelming effort to capture the spirit of the battle that ultimately led to the making of the country
","'Gettysburg' is the cinematic effort by Turner Pictures to produce the spirit and courageous efforts by two armies during the three day battle of the American Civil War which ultimately led to the demise of the army of the Confederacy and an eventual Union victory.  Many times, movies based on historical fact tend to be dry, sappy, uninspiring efforts and they leave the viewer with a sense of 'So What?'  This film does not.  It is able to re-enact the saga that was Gettysburg, PA in 1863 without being too overly preachy or hard to take.  A bit long, but the film needed as much time on screen to share with the viewers the feelings as expressed by commanders on both the North and the South.This film has been able to capture on screen some of the most authentic and realistic battle scenes from the time of the Civil War.  The members of the cast would be hard-pressed to present their individual characters than they did.  Tom Berenger, as Gen. Longstreet, CSA, and Jeff Daniels, as Chamberlain, USA, give strong character strengths to their roles.  In good form were Martin Sheen, as Gen. Robert E. Lee, CSA, and Sam Elliott in a role of Major John Buford, USA, upon whose efforts it falls to stem the Confederate advance till other Union forces can reach the battlefield. Richard Jordan, in his last role on film, gives a supreme performance as Gen. Lewis Armistead, CSA, who finds himself having to combat old friends from days past at West Point and in other campaigns.Lengthy perhaps, engrossing definitely, a must-see or must own, for those who are involved with Civil War history.  9/10",9,1,1,9 July 2001
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," May not be the complete truth, but it's great fun to watch
","In this film, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' Paul Newman and Robert Redford team up to portray those two notorious bandits from the later days of the Old West.  Newman and Redford give the two bandits an almost likeable image, and one almost wishes they had not chosen the path they were on, because the ultimate price is paid for their devotion to criminal actions and misdeeds.  The two outlaws could probably have made a success at any line of work, but they chose to be good at a vocation that was outside the limits of the law.With the two stars, Newman and Redford, turning in great performances, a great musical score featuring the tune 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head' by Burt Bacharach, and a fine supporting cast, this film will rate as a very enjoyable way to spend an evening.",9,0,3,24 April 2000
U-571," Edge of seat suspense while US Navy commandos attempt to get aboard a disabled German sub during WWII and capture a top-secret decoding device.
","'U-571' is a simple enough story from WWII. A German submarine has been disabled, but not sunk. A team of Naval commandos is assigned the task of getting aboard the sub, capture the device, then safely return to home port. Simple, but the plan goes awry when the team manages to get aboard the German sub. A destroyer from the German navy sinks their own sub, and the US Navy team is left to return safely to base in a crippled German U-boat. To make matters worse, the Germans have gotten wise to their plan, and are making efforts to put the crippled U-boat to rest permanently, at the bottom of the ocean. Depth charges are dropped every few minutes, just to shake the viewers up, and attempts are made to make the U-boat an effective weapon to use against the destroyer trying to sink the craft.The cast includes Matthew McConaughy as the leader of the US team, and ably backed by Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton, and David Keith. There's also a batch of fresh, new faces on screen and these young actors do show some potential. There's highly explosive entertainment for the viewer as U-571 sets sail across the screen of his/her wide-screen digital television.",8,0,4,27 June 2007
Judgment at Nuremberg," A movie that depicts justice being administered to those who dispensed justice in the name of the 3rd Reich during WWII
","'Justice at Nuremberg' took on the matter of the post WWII military trials that took place in Germany with many of Hitler's associates as the defendants. In this film, those jurists that administered justice in the name of the 3rd Reich are brought to answer for their roles in the legalizing of Nazi atrocities. It is a difficult subject, to be sure, because they were acting, in the statement of the defense attorney, for the benefit of their country, right or wrong. Patriotism, an American virtue, is to be practiced by German patriots who felt that Germany was correct in its quest to rid the world of certain undesirable groups. In the end, the viewer has to discern all the questions and thoughts that arise, which can make this movie a bit tough. However, it is a film to be viewed with an honest, clear-thinking mind that makes one think and recall those times of sheer horror and torment.The cast is top-notch; Spencer Tracy plays the American judge who ultimately has to deliver the verdict to four former judges, and he plays it with quiet dignity and integrity. Burt Lancaster plays one of the four defendants with silence and intensity, which erupts when his attorney, played by Oscar-winner Maximillan Schell, tries to make the actions of the judges both acceptable and correct, for the times of occurrence. Lancaster delivers a very moving soliloquy in his time to finally testify which rivets the viewer to heed all that is said. Richard Widmark plays the prosecuting attorney with a fierce determination to see justice done, no matter what, and Judy Garland,along with Montgomery Clift, contribute moving scenes during their time as witnesses to recall horrors inflicted upon them during the control of the 3rd Reich.All said and done, this film needs to be recognized as one of Stanley Kramer's directorial masterpieces, but viewers need to realize that these events did occur, and hopefully, are now prevented from ever occurring again.",8,1,2,22 February 2006
Kelly's Heroes," Clint Eastwood about to rob a bank!! It's okay, it's WWII, and it's a German bank.
","'Kelly's Heroes' is indeed a film set during World War II, but there is little or no similarity to actual happenings.  Clint Eastwood and a rag-tag band of US army soldiers undertake the knocking off of a bank behind enemy lines, and the results are pure pleasure for the viewing eyes.Eastwood, during interrogation of a captured German officer, learns of a German bank located behind the lines, and plans a bank robbery during an enforced furlough.  Naturally, he is unable to do it himself, but he would like to keep the numbers down as low as possible.  Secrecy, or keeping the information from the ears of the commanding officers in his army group is also of a paramount importance.  With the aid of such stalwarts as Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, and Donald Sutherland, the 'heroes' head out for the town where the bank is located.During the trek toward the bank, the band of men encounter the usual military problems, but manage to make it to the town where the bank, and the fortune in gold bullion, is located.  Germans still hold the town, the real army group headed by Carroll O'Connor, is drawing nigh, and Clint needs to deal with the German tank command that is right in front of the bank.  How that is handled will leave the fans of this genre with a pleasing watching experience.",9,2,4,6 February 2000
Where Eagles Dare," Burton and Eastwood against the German fortress called the 'Schloss Addler'. Excellent film
","Richard Burton, who would ordinarily be given roles of less action and hardly any adventure, does a joint effort with Clint Eastwood in this WWII movie, based on the novel of the same name written by the British storyteller deluxe, Alistair MacLean.Burton, as Major Smith, is given the task of leading a top-rate team of commandos to a German fortress in Bavaria to rescue an American general whose plane was shot down after he had received some advance plans for the upcoming invasion of Europe.  Burton's team includes Eastwood, a member of the United States Ranger corp, trained for combat and secret missions. However, there are some unknown factors built into the mission, namely, MI6, the British intelligence agency, seems to be infilitrated with German agents.  So, Burton's task of rescuing the American general is merely a cover-up, as he is really on task to ferret out all the names of the German agents operating in the British intelligence agency.Eastwood carries out his part of the mission, the shooting of every German soldier he sees, while Burton, with the aid of an unknown female operative, Mary Ure, attempts to penetrate the fortress, rescue the American, and then, effectively make an escape behind enemy lines to safety.  For those who crave top-notch adventure, seemingly impossible odds, and incredible mountain scenery, with high levels of explosions to match, then I'd encourage those viewers to take a flight/trip to 'Where Eagles Dare.'  One won't be sorry for the time spent.",10,5,7,31 January 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," The movie about Christmas that fits any time of the year
","If one wants to find the perfect movie, this film could be the answer to that search.  Featuring the story of an individual, George Bailey, who has spent his entire life in a small New England town helping others while letting his own needs go by, this film allows the character to see what would have happened had he not been there.  Maybe George's life was not a financial success, but in the things that truly mattered, he was certainly blessed.Jimmy Stewart turned in the zenith performance of his career with this 1947 film classic.  Joined by the other cast members and the directorial touch of Frank Capra, a remarkable piece of film was given to the American viewers to be enjoyed time and time again.",10,1,3,24 December 1998
The Sixth Sense," 'I see dead people, and some of them don't know they're dead!'
","'The Sixth Sense', released in 1999, and starring Bruce Willis, gives a new version of the age old mystery regarding life after death.  Does the dead person immediately leave this world, or is there a time when the spirit has a chance to stay around awhile?  This film will cause the viewer to ponder that mystery while watching the cast wrestle with that concern, and watching dead people appear, then leave the screen.Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist that takes on a case that involves a child, Haley Joel Osmond, who has a problem relating to peers and his single parent.  Willis has recently been involved in a situation that left him wounded, and this is one of his first cases since a shooting that occurred at his home.  Willis is able to establish a working child-doctor relationship with Cole, the Osmond character, but at the same time finds his own relationship with his wife chilling, even to the point of not existing. During the film, there are several scenes that involve Dr. Crowe, (Willis) with his wife, and she totally ignores him, as if he weren't even there.The film does hold the viewing public in a suspense-filled grip, with the ending being somewhat expected, but nevertheless, causing the watcher to want to see the film again to see what they missed.  A good film to have on VHS or DVD, as there are some excellent commentaries on both formats in regards to the clues that were given during the film.  This film was nominated for several academy awards, and while not an oscar winner,it was very much on the minds of the movie public during the end of the 20th century.  A good, intense mystery.",8,0,0,10 July 2002
Rear Window," A stylish mystery by the master of suspense that only gets better with age
","Alfred Hitchcock had the ability to take an ordinary citizen, project a possible mishap, or even worse, a capital crime on the person, and then completely involve the viewing audience in living through the solving of the matter.  That talent is superbly used in the 1954 classic, 'Rear Window', which starred James Stewart and Grace Kelly.The story is a very simple one; James Stewart portrays a photographer who lives in a New York apartment building with a rear window that faces other apartments in the complex.  Due to an accident he sustained while on assignment, he is recuperating from a broken leg, and that has him confined to a wheelchair.  Still, he is somewhat mobile, and his mind and ability to sense things, is very active.  Grace Kelly, in a stunning portrayal of his girlfriend, adds a screen beauty that very few were able to duplicate. Stewart and Kelly both begin to suspect that one of the neighbors in the complex has committed a murder, and they face the tough task of convincing the local police of such an happening.  Wendell Corey handles this role in good fashion.  Eventually, Hitchcock neatly wraps all the elements together in his usual manner, and the viewing audience sees the Suspense Master unfold a truly classical masterpiece. Well worth the chance to view.",8,1,3,26 June 2002
Braveheart," The story of just to what limits a man will go in order to secure freedom for himself and his country
","While 'Braveheart' is a bit long, over three hours, and a bit bloody, the battle scenes are very realistic, there is very little in the film to make a viewer regret the choice.  Based on the struggle that Scotland endured to gain its independence from England in the 1200's, the film focuses on Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace, the leader of those fighting for the right to be free.  As one watches the film, a sense of real appreciation for that which he has was gained without the Scottish struggle.  This is a definite must-see.",10,1,2,26 November 1998
