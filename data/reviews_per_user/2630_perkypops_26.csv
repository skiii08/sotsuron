Whip It," Drew Barrymore can do so much more than acting....
","When I first saw this film I found it hard to believe it was Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, it is such a very good film in so different many ways. Great story, well told, well shot, and well acted. It has tremendous energy in the action sequences, deals with the underlying 'coming of age' theme in a way that demonstrates how we have to accommodate change as we come to treasure all those who participate in our journey through life. And Drew Barrymore uses all her personal experience in drawing the best out of Shauna Cross's excellent screenplay.The extremes at play are the 'Blue Bonnet Pageant' trophy or a roller derby league in which various 'girls' find something they can really do. And girls at play can be really scary as Drew Barrymore touchingly asks us to remember, as bitchiness enters the pageant scene.This is a movie that flies past you in a series of well timed scenes, so the almost two hours seems like it is much shorter. And, not one character is wasted on the journey.Enjoyable and recommended.",8,1,5,17 April 2011
Source Code," An effective sci-fi story with plenty of twists
","Take a measure of science, add copious science fiction, a few dashes of 'Groundhog Day', a touch of 'Deja Vu' and 'Premonition', and presto you have Source Code.The first minutes of this film, eight minutes in story time, are a little edgy, uneasy, as if the actors are not sure where things are going, and I am captivated. Slowly a difficult first experience is made easier as the film reveals a deliciously inventive plot and sub-plot. And our main characters play it out so extraordinarily cleverly as the explanations for early clumsiness come thick and fast. And that is one of the exceptional talents of this film as it changes up the gears but keeps the suspense lingering right the way through.The editing, cinematography and soundtrack are very well done, and the sets are a work of art. Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan and Jake Gyllenhaal are excellent and there is very good support from elsewhere too, as things rev up towards the final fifteen minutes or so.There are bound to be a few people who'll point out the impossibility, scientifically, of what we see, but remember they'll only be correct through what we think we know, not what we may come to learn. And this film does its own thinking on its feet to come up with a clever, and somewhat unpredictable, ending.This is more than worth a watch especially if you are feeling down and out. A classy eight out of ten.",8,1,3,17 February 2013
Catch Me If You Can," Not Mr Spielberg's best by a long way
","Good films generally have good stories which have been rewritten as great screenplays. This film's screenplay fails to live up to the story it retells. Any film portraying the hero/villain (Frank Jnr) as a contestant in a game show as a first take has a lot of ground to make up before it ends.There is a hollowness in this film which begins with the tale of the two mice who fell into a bucket full of cream, because I thought only one of the mice was honest and, by the end of the film, I knew I was right. There is a nastiness in this film which is apparent via the targeting of the female bank clerks and others for trickster game playing during the film. The scams actually do harm people along the way although we are not credited with enough intelligence by Mr Spielberg of what that harm may be.We have an unlikeable character for the alternative hero/villain (Hanks's FBI investigator Hanratty) who is not allowed to show any redeeming quality at all, except for a crafty swipe at Frank Jnr whenever he can, and doesn't the lad deserve it? We even have characters playing 'suspicious minds' just in case we lose sympathy with Frank Jnr's game playing, but, unlike Hanratty, they are actually mostly clueless. And any who aren't clueless seemingly don't get a mention in case it spoils the plot. So what may have been a very believable book is not a believable screenplay.The acting is patchy. I enjoyed Frank Jnr's parents doing their thing, and, mildly speaking, Amy Adams's Brenda, but that is about it. The rest were just not very convincing at all.So definitely not Spielberg's best and if you'd like to see the man at consummate ease with his medium spend your money on a re-run of 'Duel' which is still my favourite Spielberg film.3/10 because it is overlong and I wasn't entertained.",3,2,7,16 May 2011
Child 44," A compellingly deep and dark hunt for a serial child killer
","Take grim times, the Soviet regime, add in child killings, Party politics, corruption, brutality, betrayal and Nazi leftovers, stir well, add plentiful quality actors, a stupendously good script, superbly dark and atmospheric cinematography and you have a ridiculously good film, whose only failing is it's muddled up language - it could have been subtitled throughout or English throughout but not mixed up in places.The acting is superb, with a hat full of memorable lines, plot twists and turns, love, hate and deception heaped into each other. The story takes a while to fall into place but, by the end, it all makes perfect sense, a tribute to the way the film is allowed to unfold in real time.I am going to see it for a second time and I am hoping to look out for things I may have missed first time around. It really is a must see film.",8,0,1,1 January 2016
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Potentially good story poorly transposed to screen
","The Resident Evil franchise has had its ups and its downs, and it is a pity that a really good story, written by director Paul W. S. Anderson, has not been better utilised in this episode. Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter do their best but sadly there are parts where the film just doesn't scan as it should.The opening is promising with Alice (Jovovich) searching for Arcadia, somewhere in Alaska, where there is 'no infection', but there is Claire (Larter) who is not herself. The pair, searching in a plane for survivors, find a group holed up inside a prison surrounded by hordes of voracious undead. For those who need to work out how you break into a prison then the method is commonly used when breaking out.I suppose the weakness in the story is timing making the story seem very pretentious. I mean just how long does it take an 'undead' to know how you get at 'food' inside a prison? Although much use is made of CGI it really isn't that convincing, although the concluding sequences are better than much that has gone before. As others have said the talents of many of the cast are wasted especially Angel Ortiz. It's probably impossible to know all that went to the cutting room floor, but I have a feeling a lot of this was botched together because continuity of action is poor.I do hope the next output is better because from unpromising material some of the series has been excellent. I suppose this episodes suffers by comparison but, had it been standalone, I would have had trouble giving it better than two out of ten. However out of reverence to the franchise I give it five out of ten.",Null,0,1,25 July 2011
Just Go with It," A competently crafted romantic comedy but not the best
","There is nothing to dislike about this film apart, perhaps, from the fact it does go on a bit too long and by the time you get to the point where it begins to wear thin you probably know the ending already. In fact if you follow romantic comedies closely you will have guessed the end not very long into the movie at all but it doesn't spoil the journey in the least.The back story opening is not especially well done although it serves the purpose of dishing up the reason why Dr Macabee (Sandler) wears a wedding ring. From there the plot clumsily lunges into the smoother tale as to why wearing a wedding ring when he is not married inevitably eventually leads to trouble. Sandler is his usual self, Anniston is as good as I have seen her in a movie, and Kidman has a minor riot with a wonderfully flawed character.If you like romantic comedies it will not disappoint you but there are better choices elsewhere.",6,0,0,3 February 2012
About Time," Mr Curtis is on top form with this rom-com with a difference
","There are touches of deja vu in this film which cleverly stitches in time travel to a love story encompassing all the central characters. First and foremost it is about love both romantic and familial, but with a couple of characters who can play little tricks with time. Not all the time trips go as planned but they always provide food for thought. There are the usual Curtis-marked laugh out loud moments, the careful casting of the leads, the flawed diamonds of characters that always bejewel Mr Curtis's scripts, and the tragedies that open our eyes so very successfully. Through all their faults the lead characters are such believable characters, and, as usual for Mr Curtis, the token American character, this time Rachel McAdams, is perfectly cast.Perhaps Mr Curtis is guilty of formula writing you may say, and you'd have a point, but just like his use of rain and foul weather, he manages to freshen it all up and keep us guessing until the end. It's a formula others copy but no one does it better than the director himself.And so if you want to watch a heart warming rom-com does very professionally then this is up there with the best.Nine out of ten as a film, but ten out of ten for the lead actors - all of them.",9,3,4,20 July 2014
Midnight in Paris," A likable, if snobbish, romantic comedy from Mr Allen
","When Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) takes a stroll in Paris after midnight strange things happen and these strange things help him to revamp his life. It is another romance typical of Mr Allen which could have been a whole lot better had we not been treated to such a predictable array of opinion as to what Paris must have been like many years ago.As it is, and at face value, the story is helped by an almost good outing by Mr Wilson because whilst never convincing it seemed fitting that such a foppish twenty first century misfit should be so greeted by such predictable characters from earlier times. However it all seems a very complex way of getting to the point of what romance definitely isn't through seeing Mr Allen's idea of what it is. However with such an array of talent making up the support what is there not to like about the portrayal of such an average script? I have given it six because, as a romantic comedy, it has some sharp dialogue at times, but it is very uneven and this brings you down to earth with a bang much too frequently for it to be described as a good film. Worth a rental but not much more.",6,0,2,10 December 2012
Horrible Bosses," The good moments are very funny but it is so uneven
","This film warrants a much higher rating than I have given it for its very funny moments and that is because sometimes it just lets things slip. Perhaps I am just asking too much but if I just read some parts of the script to myself I can make it sound funny whereas in the film it seems to fall flat.Jennifer Anniston is a revelation, Kevin Spacey is bloody brilliant, Charlie Day is excellent, Jamie Foxx is part perfect and Colin Farrell camps it up like the best. The rest are chiefly okay but, in parts, do the sliding I referred to earlier. The script is better than the movie, a work of art, and with several laugh out loud moments.The premise is probably central to all our lives - what to do with the boss from hell - but is compounded by the characters themselves since they are just not good enough to be horrible bosses if you understand my meaning. But they do kid themselves they are up to the task of relieving themselves of their nemesis and this is when the film begins to go where the comedy can come thick and fast.This is not a must see film but it is a good comedy. I just wish a Tina Fey may have appeared somewhere to help with delivery.Six out of ten but moments when it reaches ten out of ten.",6,0,2,13 October 2012
Salt," A top notch spy thriller
","Look for them and you'll find the flaws but this spy thriller has Angeline Jolie showing how good an actress she is in keeping us guessing which side she is on. The acting is excellent throughout.The opening scenes sets out the story the clearly for us with Evelyn Salt (Jolie) being tortured and then released in an exchange between the US and North Korea set up by her husband Mike. Pan forward two years and we find Ev and Mike in marital bliss when a Russian defector walks into Ev's CIA office out of the blue. Ev interviews him and within a few minutes everyone is asking who she is. A plot has been uncovered which suggests Ev is about to assassinate the Russian president. Whose side is she on? As in the 'Changeling' Jolie plays a doubted woman exceedingly well, and there is some well crafted subtlety in this performance too, as Ev tries very hard to contact her husband whilst the plot unfolds.The set pieces are well executed, the plot twists cleverly worked, and even the predictable sometimes working as quite unpredictable. This isn't another 'Bourne' movie but at times it does show similarities with the genre.If you enjoy spy movies see this film. Eight out of ten.",8,1,3,24 June 2011
Now You See Me," Enjoyable in parts but somewhat overrated
","There is entertainment and action in abundance in this colourful, glossy and, at times, highly enjoyable, film centred on the world of illusion, deception, and the magician. And, at times, we appear to be treated to explanations as to how tricks were done, but sadly, in doing so, many important pieces of the descriptions were simply ignored because they were inexplicable. It kind of takes the biscuit when you explain the easy and, perhaps, most dramatic parts of trickery but fail on the subtleties where the real tricks occur. But the context of the film is how trickery can be used to fool us all via the many diversions the film uses along the way.Of course you have to suspend reality watching this film or it can get a little tiresome, which is probably why I found it enjoyable but only in parts. It is a good twenty minutes too long and kind of waffles it way through the final five minutes or so. The actors seem like they're having a good time and the sets are fabulous. But the whole seems to add up to something a little less than satisfactory.Six out of ten.",6,1,1,24 July 2014
No Strings Attached," A role reversal that gets in the way
","The moment this film sets out to present a girl's idea of what a man would desire most - an ongoing, no strings, purely sexual relationship with a beautiful woman - we see the flaws in this premise as a desirable arrangement either sex could make last for any length of time. And what this screenplay does best is to highlight how we try to protect ourselves from risk by whatever method we think works best. Although the script does a reasonable job with the flaws it really doesn't explain how such a premise could even enter someone's head without there being a string attached, no matter how flawed their character is.But the idea provokes a fairly entertaining series of episodes where the leads Emma (Portman) and Adam (Kutcher) test each other to the point of distraction, the only difference to an ordinary romance being the falsehood constructed at the very start of the relationship.The acting is largely good with a range of characters to ease us through the episodes that zig-zag us around the houses in a chase that has one of two endings - either they have a proper relationship or they don't, and long before the end we know the sex only thing is not working.So we have to work quite hard to get to the conclusion but it is a pleasant enough duty to perform with Portman and Olivia Thirlby as Katie being the star turns. It is good enough to want to see again but not so great you'll regret it if you don't.Six out of ten.",6,0,2,2 March 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," This film about emotional baggage has brilliant simplicity in its hi-octane mix
","Every so often you come across a film with so many layers of complexity on what appears to be a simple subject you either become engaged in the drama of it all or have a headache by the end. The therapy of reversing this in Scott Pilrim Vs The World is so cathartic, refreshing and entertaining who could be left with a headache? Certainly not the cast and crew of this wonderfully original take on love in all its many guises. And certainly not the audience, either.We take the complex subject of emotional baggage and exorcise it in the simplest way we can, visually, with cues, cartoons, music, fantasy, and energy in abundance. Love wins out in the end, no matter how hard we try to stop it happening. And we are only victims if we decide to be victims. And what can be wrong about a story that is designed to be so very uplifting? Nothing.Please see this and enjoy it for what it is: sheer inspiration in education, entertainment and enlightenment. Ten out of ten.",10,6,14,4 July 2011
Bridesmaids," Funnily enough it is awful....
","One trick ponies are cute to watch - for a few moments. Ms Wiig's story may have contained every one of her visual jokes, remembered or imagined, and every fantasy or nightmare she has ever dreamed but the pivot upon which this film rests is female competitiveness. Unfortunately for me (when a film lasts two hours) I have seen it all before and the joke grated long before the film's conclusion was due.Sure there are funny moments, some unintentional ones too, but it is not enough to carry this 'hit' film anywhere other than the overrated box. It is just that 'in your face' humour ceases to do much for me after thirty seconds and sometimes less and this film has very little subtlety.And it's sad because I really do like Ms Wiig....",3,5,8,20 June 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A short story turned into a long and deeply flawed film
","I don't know what the fuss is about, or the high score, because this isn't a good film and it uses material which has been better developed and more inventively used elsewhere. Sure the action is mostly cleverly done, although there are some rather poorly put together moments. The acting is competent but the ape to human interface isn't quite so polished as it seems.Basically we have a brilliant scientist looking for a cure for Alzheimer's (his father is in serious decline from it) by testing potential cures on chimpanzee. Of course what benefits a person can also have side effects and so the action in this film begins.The plot's credibility depends on the act of bonding (or rather ganging up - see the difference) and it is that element which escapes the human side completely whilst engendering the apes with a togetherness not seen in the wild.It left me mildly entertained for thirty minutes and then just watching a pretty poor development of what could, and should, have been a really good movie.Four out of ten.",4,1,5,3 September 2012
Unknown," Neeson just doesn't have the extra gear this demands
","This Bournesque - Hitchcockian affair is a well written story, slightly flawed by the trauma from accident which drives the whole plot. But its biggest flaw is the miscasting of Neeson as Dr Martin Harris. Neeson just doesn't have the range required to make this role as effective as the film's plot demands to achieve credibility. And that is a pity because otherwise it may have been challenging Bourne and even some of Hitchcock's best like Saboteur.Dr Harris and wife (Jones) arrive in Berlin for a conference but the doctor mislays an important briefcase and sets in chain a series of events that shock, surprise and confuse. There is a lot of twisting and turning and some excellent cameos from Bruno Ganz as Jurgen a man who finds things out, and Eve Lobau as a nurse who is concerned for Dr Harris's health. It is in these characters we begin to find the Hitchcockian elements.I'd have liked a different ending since the chosen outcome left too many loose ends and perhaps I would have rewritten the entire last twenty minutes in the interests of credibility. But the film is at least competently enough out together to entertain. It could have been a lot better with a little more attention to detail.Six out of ten - Neeson four out of ten.",6,1,1,17 January 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," Its over complexity almost kills a half way decent romantic story
","This is an enjoyable film, entertaining, well acted, and keen screenplay which crosses a few genre boundaries but is largely about the on-off romance between David (Damon) and Elise (Blunt). It mixes in such vagaries as free will, 'The' plan, and strange men all wearing hats to create a world where nothing, except perhaps the romance, is what it seems.It is a kind of Dark City meets City of Angels meets Star Crossed Lovers meets.... and that is what gives the film a lot of charm and covers over plot flaws such as - well I let you discover the biggest flaw in the whole movie when you have answered the question 'Are relationships ever predictable?' Because if they are predictable then the whole film loses its way, and if they are not, it loses its way too. But hey it's enjoyable and entertaining too so why worry.Is it over rated? Yes, if the score of over seven is anything to go by. Sure it's cute but it is no blockbuster and I have seen better romantic movies that don't have such a dig in the sci-fi circuits.Six out of ten.",6,0,1,25 January 2012
Up," It is a lovely story but why the animation?
","Now there are things that couldn't be done with live actors but CGI has changed that and it left me wondering why this very lovely story was produced as an animation. For the first half of the story there seemed no earthly reason why, and even in the second half I was still wondering.Perhaps it was in the marketing as a 3D production that we are treated to camera angles and shots that would be quite difficult to achieve in live action and that is a pity because the story stands up on its own and is overplayed in many of the animation sequences. Fortunately it doesn't spoil the entertainment value but I am left thinking it reduces what could have been a great film into a good one.Yes the spectacle is, in places, a visual treat, but there is something missing in the personalities that the film doesn't quite make up for. And so I am awarding it seven out of ten for entertainment value, with three out of ten deducted for trying to divvy up reasons for three dimensional viewing.",7,0,0,21 November 2011
Limitless," Visually stunning but undone by flaws in plot
","There is something a little Twilight Zone-ish about the plot involving a drug which allows full access to memories, enhanced learning and seemingly impossibly powerful abilities to do anything humanly possible, but has a fixed life and potentially fatal side effects. This film uses special effects which are stunningly clever and often a little nauseating and the story line is full of clever twists and turns because it is concentrating on what really may happen if such an event occurred. From that perspective it is excellent.But there are flaws in such a plot line which only partially developed the side effects themes, and, at points in the plot simply kicked them into touch as they got in the way of a good yarn. To taste the side effects is one thing but to suddenly ask us to believe they have been removed and not replaced by other side effects is simply spoiling what could have been a totally excellent film. Continuity is a little careless at times too.As it is the film is still worth watching and enjoying although I believe it could have been even better in more subtle hands. The acting is pretty good all around and the script is better than average for the genre.Six out of ten.",6,3,4,17 January 2012
In Time," Extras required: Must be aged 25 or under...
","The central premise of this film, that time replaces money as a commodity in a world where you are zapped one year after you reach twenty five unless you have time credits to live longer, is a creative Pandora's box but it isn't well worked out here. In fact it is very poorly rendered. On the good side the atmosphere is, in places, really well expressed but somehow it just doesn't convince on a greater scale, especially the idea of time zones. There are scenes that are touchingly, almost movingly, painted, but they are few and far between. In the main the plot cannot make up its mind what it wants to be, thoughtful or obvious.And the pity is that the opening five minutes or so are very promising as if the participants really cared about what they were doing. And the best acting by far is contained in this brief period of the film. But sadly, by the end, you'll wish time had run out for all of them.",5,1,2,18 November 2012
The Blind Side," A super film about as many -isms as you can fit
","I have watched this film four times now and it still moves me in all the right ways in all the right places. I am not a great fan of American Football and yet it doesn't matter one jot because this movie is so much deeper and profound than any sport could be.It is real life peeled away, layer by layer, just as the screenplay says it should. It doesn't attack anything by exaggeration, dramatic effect, or overstatement, it simply plays it out richly and simply through good, honest acting from a good, honest cast and a good, honest story.The film is brave enough to lay bear the counter arguments about 'agendas' hidden within its own story and expose our own doubts, fears, presumptions and prejudices.I adore Sandra Bullock and I am pleased for her she found such a wonderful part to truly demonstrate her capacity for her art: an Oscar seems scant reward for such a wonderfully inspiring piece of drama. And the support is truly wonderful too.Go see this movie if you want to leave a theatre with a good feeling in your gut despite 'the warts and all' you go through in its two hours or so.We can all change something even if it is only ourselves.",10,0,1,8 April 2011
Win Win," A well written and well acted comedy drama
","This is a film which is a kind of back handed 'On the Blind Side', utilising the same basic energies as will be found from its award winning predecessor but with subplots which are inventive and cunningly woven into twists and turns. It is well acted, brilliantly so in parts, and is allowed to flow naturally upon the screen.We start with an economically troubled lawyer having a rather bad day which steadily declines. We get the picture: this guy is suffering. His energy is low and he is hardly supporting his family from his second job as a wrestling coach. Trouble really starts when a simple but devious way out appears and he rather clumsily takes it.Amy Ryan (as Jackie Flaherty) and Alex Shaffer (as Kyle) win the acting plaudits, with very good support from elsewhere, especially Melanie Lynskey (as Kyle's mother). The script is generally interesting and involving and the cinematography, especially in the wrestling scenes, is well presented.As with 'Blind Side' this is a movie to embrace and enjoy, although it is not quite in the same league as a whole.Six out of ten.",6,1,2,3 September 2012
Lucy," Lucy in the sky on steroids....
","The beginning is promising - female is tricked by selfish male friend into a rather horrific chain of events in typical Luc Besson fashion. As in the Fifth Element mayhem is released in abundance, in many unlikely places and in many unlikely ways, but it is watchable, likable, and an entertaining couple of hours or so.Perhaps the sci-fi facts are loosely (should that be lucily?)interwoven but it is tightly directed, well paced, and, in places, inventively shot. Scarlet Johannson does everything she is asked to do and more, is almost well supported by the rest of the cast, and the cinematography and sound are up with the best.Not a film to be taken too seriously, for, as Morgan Freeman tells us, 'it's only theory', but taken on face value it is worthwhile cinema.Watch it for some light hearted thrills in one of Mr Besson's better films.",8,1,5,23 June 2015
Easy A," Super script and a great performance from Emma Stone
","You know a good film from early on as it sucks you in and refuses to let you go until the credits roll. Emma Stone (as Olive) sucks you in right from the start after an inventive title sequence which lasts well into the films first few minutes. Stone is not just perfectly cast for the role of Olive she delivers every ounce of sharpness from a terrific script and screenplay. And the characters around Olive are just so perfectly pitched and played by a very strong support.It is hard to dislike this film or its multi-layered messages about how we deceive ourselves as we seek to deceive others, and how we'd like to have something stronger than the truth to suck and see especially when the revealed fiction is about someone we can watch being destroyed. Olive becomes an unlikely target for destruction because truth bores the pants off of others in her life.But Olive is not the destructive type. In fact Olive has a heart so big it gets her into all kinds of mischief and it is just a question of how far things will go before she breaks if indeed she has a breaking point.The film is fun to watch with some real laugh out loud moments but it still manages to get its messages across at every opportunity. So I award a maximum ten to Emma Stone and a handsome nine to the film as a whole. Recommended with a warning (You will want to watch it all over again).",9,0,2,24 December 2011
The Fighter," Multi-stranded drama, well performed but ultimately unconvincing
","The onion skin layers of human reality are brilliantly teased out in this drama, from the competing strong females in Micky's life, to the jealousy within families, how people are driven to fight for survival, and the simple actions that lead to success over the complexities that thwart. And because there is so much good acting on view (the female elements in Micky's life are all brilliantly portrayed) apart from Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, and the excellent Melissa Leo, the drama is very compelling.Although this is about a part of a boxer's career the boxing strands do not outweigh the drama outside the ring, which is good because the boxing is what, in my opinion, ultimately lets the film down. Let me explain a little further without spoiling the plot. There is considerable evidence within the film of Micky's good nature, his loyalty, and his strength of character but there is also a great deal of his weaknesses on show too. There is an attempt to transfer this personality to the boxing ring and it does not, for me, work.It is still a very watchable and enjoyable piece of drama, but the intended 'feel good' ending is out of keeping with the excellence that has gone before.I award it seven out of ten for the superb acting but as a film it is not up there with the best.",7,1,1,27 November 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Is it such a flawed end?
","My first reaction to this film was to fault what seems like an unsatisfactory end to a story that builds up its attack on flawed judicial systems with their preoccupation with career, politics, anything but justice. I still feel it fails to a point but I do understand the final reasoning a little better. Shelton (Butler) obtains the oblivion he seeks, whilst Rice (Foxx) must live with a conscience that will catch up with him sometime. Perhaps there was justice after all.Butler plays the 'law abiding citizen' almost to perfection once he knows the law is no longer abiding to his reality. Bereft of his family, his reasons for being, he has no alternative than to use his flair, his genius, to seek to change others. That he plays his cards so wistfully is unsurprising given the triple whammy he suffers through fate. That he should seek to change such an odious set up as the one portrayed through Foxx's ambitious, duplicitous, and hypocritical character, is wholly commendable. That he commits murder along the way becomes logical within the story if unacceptable in real life.But there is little morality within this tale, from the failure of the law enforcers, through to the bitterness of the battle between Shelton and the State machinery. Both sides are riddled with flaws. And perhaps that is the central point of the whole picture. Personally I would have preferred an ending where Shelton's character is always one step ahead of Rice and they perish together in the final scene - a real justice given what has gone before.The acting is pretty strong throughout and makes up for some of the flaws in the storyline. A competent movie but it may just upset people for all the wrong reasons. Six out of ten.",6,0,3,23 September 2011
