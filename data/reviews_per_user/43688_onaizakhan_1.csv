The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not up to the mark
","The Hunger Games movies have been amazing till now. The characters, the action and the sets breathtaking. But the only problem is that they don't match the level of the books. The book explains everything in details. I believe one can never actually understand and feel the story from the movie like from the book. The book is pooling with action all over and yet quick and interesting. There are movie franchises like Twilight that do better than books but The Hunger games movies are not that. There is a lot of scope of improvement ant entertainment. This movie seems like a sluggish attempt at picturing half the book. I wouldn't even give it 6 stars if I had watched the movie without reading the book. It wouldn't engage and hook me. All the while I was comparing the movie with the books. And I realized the book was so much better. So if anyone finds the plot of Hunger Games interesting, he'she should give the books a shot. But if you can't read the books, the movies aren't that bad either.",6,0,0,9 September 2016
