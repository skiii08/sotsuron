The Devil's Advocate," Unbelievable, Al at his best
","Being a huge Al Pacino fan, it is hard for me to choose only one of his movies as being my all-time favorite. Scarface would have to be near the top of the list, the Godfather movies were good (not as great as most people think, but pretty good nonetheless), Heat was underrated,and Sea of Love was solid. But if I had to choose one, this movie is it. Pacino is awesome throughout the entire movie, and his two monologues directed at Keanu are as gripping as any others in movie history, no other actor could have pulled it off. He seemed born to play this role. I could go on all day about Pacino in this movie, but others deserve mention as well.I'm still trying to figure out if I like Keanu Reeves. I try as hard as I can to dislike him, because I really don't think he is a very good actor. However, he seems to choose his roles carefully, because he manages to find himself in terrific movies every once in awhile. He will forever be Ted searching for an excellent adventure in my mind, but Point Break was as entertaining as most action movies get, Speed (yes I know, it was completely ridiculous and stupid) was still pretty cool, and there's always Bill & Ted. But he has really outdone himself here. While overwhelmed by Pacino's performance, Keanu still quietly gives a pretty good performance as the lawyer who sells his soul for the big bucks and glory associated with a big New York law firm, at the head of which is Pacino. I won't give away any more of the story, because it is too good to hear it from me. But anybody who has not seen it, do yourself a favor and rent it. Even if you don't enjoy any other part of the movie, Pacino's monologues and every scene he's in, for that matter, make it well worth the money. Pacino's best, and one of the best of all time. 10/10",10,1,1,29 November 1999
Se7en," A work of art.
","It seems to be the trend now to equate this movie to Silence of the Lambs, but to me, this movie far surpasses that one. Not to say that Silence of the Lambs wasn't good, it was actually one of the best of its kind, and Hannibal Lecter might be the best serial killer ever. However, Seven blows that movie away and if not for The Usual Suspects, it would be the best detective-thriller of the 90's.There are so many aspects to this movie worth mentioning, I couldn't fit it into 1000 words. Yes, this movie may be considered too slow for the action junkies of the world. Sorry, Arnie and Sly Stallone do not make an appearance here. But for those who place a higher importance on acting, directing, and storyline, this is the movie for you. Fincher deserves top mention. This guy continues to amaze me with top notch films. Never saw Alien3, as I don't like horror movies and don't care about the Alien trilogy. But The Game is a very underrated thriller, you can't go wrong with Sean Penn and Michael Douglas.  And as far as Fight Club goes, well, words cannot express how good that movie was, so I won't even try. But with those 2 movies alone, as well as this one, Fincher proves he is one of the best up and coming directors in the business.We all know Brad Pitt is usually placed in movies merely for eye candy for the female audience, but obviously Fincher has a knack for bringing the best out of Pitt. He's really not a terrible actor, and he was actually pretty good in 12 Monkeys, but it is here and Fight Club where he does his best work. He's no Morgan Freeman, and he is certainly eclipsed here by Freeman, but Pitt manages to hold his own effectively. Paltrow is, well, Paltrow here, pretty boring and monotone, just like most parts she plays. But she is as important to the story as any of the others, and based on that she fits in well.As good as everyone was in this movie, Kevin Spacey dominates the screen, as he does with every movie he has ever been in. He is far and away the best actor going today, and his role in Seven may be his best so far. Giving away any details of his part would take away from the effect of the movie, but let's just say it is chilling how good he is. Every scene is important, and the scenery and music help develop the mood of the story, which is definitely grim. Not sure why so many people have revolted at the 'gore and violence' of this movie, as most of it is implied and never really shown. People don't seem to have a problem reading about it in the newspapers, in books, or even the Bible, but I guess it's different when it's presented in your face on the big screen. Doesn't make sense to me, but whatever. If you can look past that, you're looking at one of the top 10 movies of the 90's, and one of the best ever. 10/10, 100/100, 1000/1000, an all-time classic.",10,0,0,2 December 1999
Armageddon," Lighten up, people
","Let's start out by saying this is NOT the worst movie of all time. Not even close. It seems the more money a movie makes, the worse it becomes in people's mind if they didn't like it to begin with. That's narrow minded, and it is apparent that Armageddon suffers from this narrow-mindedness. I am not a sci-fi fan at all, and mindless action movies are not usually my type of thing either, but I liked Armageddon. You wanna see a big-budget, money making, thin plot piece of crap, go see Independence Day or Men in Black. Not even Will Smith, who is pretty funny, could save those.I can't even remember all the stupid comments I've seen regarding this movie, but all I can say is, they're entitled to their opinion. And I do recognize the plot holes in Armageddon, and the cheesy storylines, but so what? All action movies are like that, and it's laughable that the same people who 'f**king crush' this movie will come right back and praise the likes of Star Wars and Independence Day. The same guys who will sit out in front of a theater for 3 weeks to have the 'honor' of being the first to witness a bunch of muppets and monotone wooden actors fly around in a space pod or whatever are the ones ripping Armageddon for similar story lines. The only difference is, Armageddon is funny as hell. I understand that lots of people just go to movies looking to redeem their soul and cry their eyes out, but me, I appreciate a little humor once in awhile.Like always, Steve Buscemi is hilarious here. Some of his lines are great, such as when a federal agent tells him he has a national security problem he must discuss with him, he turns and asks the girl he is with 'How old are you?' Most of the other characters have some humor, even occasionally Bruce Willis, in his deadpan sort of way. Liv Tyler doesn't do a whole lot here, but she's pretty hot. Billy Bob Thornton is great, and there is a funny line from the guy who discovers the asteroid in regards to his wife.Last but not least, it seems it would not be an Armageddon comment without commenting on the 'animal cracker love scene'. Stupidest scene in the history of movies? Please, you haven't seen enough movies. It is a silly little episode between two people in love, and if you tell me you've never done the same type of thing with your woman (or man), then you've never had one. Maybe not quite as corny, but everyone acts like that once in awhile, and to show it as a kind of final moment between two people in love, I can tolerate that. So, all I have to say is, lighten up, and stop taking yourselves so seriously.",Null,1,1,13 December 1999
Good Will Hunting," One of the best 5 movies of the year.
","After reading some of the previous comments made by viewers on this site, I get the impression some people believe a group of 21 year old guys who go to bars and drink and fight is not realistic. I would suggest they try spending a night in bar and come back to reality. Even beyond realism, this is just a flat-out great movie.Robin Williams, normally not the best actor in the world, does an outstanding job with this role. He was at the same time funny and insightful and deserved the Academy Award. Damon was convincing as a 'lazy genius' and this was definitely his best role so far. The script was excellent, and Van Sant got every bit of emotion possible out of his cast. It is so rare to see a dramatic movie like this that combines humor and drama so effectively. Even if, like me, you are not interested in run-of-the-mill drama-tearjerker type movies, I highly recommend this one, because it is fantastic. The only dim spot in the movie is Minnie Driver's character. I've never really liked her, and I found her character to be more than slighlty annoying. Despite this one flaw, Good Will Hunting is one of the top movies of '97, and other than L.A. Confidential, maybe THE top movie if the year.",9,0,1,29 November 1999
There's Something About Mary," Let's not take this movie too seriously
","Seems some people are a bit uptight around here. You don't like the movie? Fine. But to correlate this films success to the downfall of society and the state of American comedy? Please. I can understand that some people are very morally upright and have been raised to think that people should not be made fun of and everyone is created equal, blah, blah, blah. But to say that there was not one funny scene in the whole movie is ridiculous. I happened to love the movie, thought it was hilarious, and yes, I am an intelligent person. But movies are sometimes used as an escape from everyday life, and for those who are versatile enough to laugh at a funny scene without taking it seriously, this is one movie you should not miss.Extremely funny, and I give it a 9.",10,0,0,30 November 1999
Titanic," A Joke
","I can't begin to express how bored I was with this movie. It's not that it was a poorly made movie. I understand the movies appeal to the romantics at heart, but that still does not validate it as the best movie of all time. It was boring, far too long, and completely uninteresting. I've always thought the movie could have stood on it's own as a much more fascinating film if the first half had never been made. Cameron did a tremendous job of showing the horror and hopelessness the members of the ship felt while the ship was sinking. But it took so long to finally arrive at this point in the movie, it was almost impossible to get back into it by that time.  This movie was thoroughly uninteresting, and the only redeeming factor that comforts me is that there will never be a sequel. 1/10",1,4,9,24 November 1999
Scream 2," Upon further review.......
","The first time I saw this movie, opening night, I couldn't have been more disappointed. After the opening scene, which was great, I thought Scream 2 spiraled downward and every scene was worst then the one before it, finally wrapping up with the worst ending ever seen on film. I hated this movie. That is, until I was able to see it again on video. Sometimes it takes a second viewing on video to really concentrate and pay attention to all the little details to really appreciate a movie. This is one of those movies.   While I still believe the ending was terrible, I thought the rest of the movie gets better every time I watch it. The opening scene is fantastic, and (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I loved the idea of the killer sitting in the movie theater amongst hundreds of look-alike killers, with nobody knowing who the killer is or if he's even there. As Jada Pinkett finds out in a very clever scene, he is there.   I thought the best scene in the movie occurs when Randy, Dewey, and Gail are standing in the grass courtyard at the college, and the killer calls them on Gail's cell phone, playing games and watching them from a distance. I love the camerawork used while following Randy around as he searches for the killer. One shot in particular has the camera looking down on him from the sky, nobody else visible in the whole shot, which gives a feeling of me against the world, which Randy must have been feeling. The whole scene is great.   Is Scream 2 better than the original? No, but you can't compare a sequel to its original, because it will never compare (as they discuss within the movie.) 'Sequels by definition alone are inferior films' Scream was one of the few horror movies I could truly call great, and Scream 2 is likewise one of those rare sequels that at least approach the quality of the original (such as with Lethal Weapon 3 & 4 and Die Hard With a Vengeance).
   Now for the ending. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) They hinted throughout the movie as to the killers identity 'Mrs. Voohries was a terrific killer' But I never thought they would cop out and go for the simple answer of 'Billy's mother?' She was terrible as the killer, and did nothing but annoy me the entire movie. Mickey at least was interesting, but his character was barely even developed and then, all of the sudden, here he is, your serial killer. I thought for sure going in that Stu somehow survived the first Scream and was coming back for part two, and when they introduced Debbie Salt as the killer, my heart took a dive. The ending was pathetic, and I still hold out hope of a decent killer in part 3 (maybe Stu), but I still give it a 9 out of 10, with the ending keeping it from a 10.",9,0,0,6 January 2000
