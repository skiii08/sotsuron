Blade Runner 2049," Who knew a bleak future could seem so entertaining
","Coming 35 years after the events of its predecessor, Denis Villeneuve's futuristic law enforcement thriller 'Blade Runner 2049' picks up further down the road when the world of replicants has evolved for better or worse.Instead of centering around the POV of Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard, we follow Ryan Gosling as he navigates the pitfalls and threats of greater Los Angeles to get to the bottom of a mysterious discovery that could jeopardize society's otherwise oblivious view of the human-like replicants' roles in their lives. This sets us up for an interesting ride full of mystery, confusion and winding roads. Gosling is well cast in this role, as his trademark poker face comes in handy given the serious nature of his character K's job as a blade runner. We also get to see Robin Wright give the kind of performance she's really been able to own of late, as the no-nonsense, deceptive Lieutenant Joshi.Otherwise, the casting is more or less 'meh,' aside from Ford's (all too short) screen time. Jared Leto barely has a chance to make an impact as the psycho genius Niander Wallace, and the two female leads are a holographic assistant, Joi (Ana de Armas) and a ruthless Wallace confidant, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). Neither have anything special to offer here, mostly due to poor character writing. But it's not the acting that makes '2049' what it is. Villeneuve is on a sci-fi hot streak, coming off the heels of 'Arrival,' and is developing a specific filming style that will likely become associated with the director in the coming years. '2049' is filmed beautiful, with haunting cinematography and a soundtrack (and in some cases, lack thereof) that translates to sensual overload in many scenes.There's a healthy balance of typical 'bad guy beat-up' action scenes and low-key dialogue-heavy ones that help '2049' drift into 'boring' or 'over the top' territory, and despite the fact that the plot seems to reveal itself in a formulaic way, there are a few twists in the film's third act that keep audiences from feeling like they've seen this all before.'Blade Runner 2049' was not considered to be a monster hit with general moviegoing audiences, but it's clear the effort and investment that went into creating the movie has resulted in a quality final product.",7,0,1,10 June 2018
First Man," Armstrong biopic prioritizes conflict over outer space
","The renewed interest in the final frontier in film has resulted in some really good (and pretty bad) projects. Damien Chazelle's critically acclaimed box office bust 'First Man' falls somewhere in the middle of the pack, as some had a much different vision of what this film would be about.At its core, 'First Man' is the story of the conflict experienced by the most famous man to ever visit space. Ryan Gosling stands in as Neil Armstrong alongside Claire Foy as his wife, Janet. The two are very good actors in their own right, but they do not have the necessary spark or chemistry to make the strained relationship feel authentic. That said, this is very much an actor's movie, and neither one should be disappointed with their performances. The supporting cast is alright - nothing spectacular, but they do the job. The special effects are not the main attraction here, that's for sure. Yes, part of the film takes place in space (and more specifically, on the moon), but these scenes feel like they are inserted just because they need to be based on the story.The one aspect that really stands out in 'First Man' is the soundtrack. Just Hurwitz ('La La Land,' 'Whiplash') really goes all in and delivers a memorable story through sound. It earned a Golden Globe, and easily could have ended up with an Oscar, too.Despite its poor commercial success, 'First Man' did not deserve all the negative attention it received. It's not an amazing film by any stretch, but it's an important story of one of the most beloved American heroes.",6,1,1,24 August 2019
Deepwater Horizon," Berg highlights heroism in 'Horizon'
","We all know the story from the headlines - the April 2010 BP oil rig disaster off the Louisiana coast that left 11 dead and many more injured. In Peter Berg's 'Deepwater Horizon,' we see the circumstances that led up to the moment when the rig malfunctioned, as well as the heroism that took place as the events unfolded in the black of night.The focus of 'Horizon' is not on the politics behind the disaster, nor is it about the technical aspects of working on an oil rig (although there's a little bit of both mixed in here). It's about the people. Chief among them is Mike Williams, portrayed by Mark Wahlberg, who oversees electrical engineering, and operations supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by a banged up Kurt Russell). The Williams/Harrell duo try to raise awareness of the state of the 'Horizon' to the BP bigwigs, including one middle manager played by John Malkovich. But where the cast really delivers is showing how people acted when everything went to hell.'Horizon' has the signature marks of a Berg film. From shaky-cam effects and aerial shots to Michael Bay-esque sound effects and heart-pounding soundtracks. The action sequences are enough to keep you interested throughout, and visual spectacles cause by a structure in chaos. People's heroic actions are highlighted, like Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) and Caleb Holloway (Dylan O'Brien), and the fact that there are actual real individuals who were able to make a difference as employees escaped the inferno is a positive aspect to focus on.Sure, some could say 'Deepwater Horizon' is over the top and melodramatic, and it languished at the box office. But the fact that it pays homage to those who lost their lives or were forever impacted by this disaster - something that was lost in the aftermath as covered in the media - is a solid reason why this film was made.",7,0,1,22 July 2018
It," 'It' is more than your average horror film
","Among the entries in the Stephen King library, few stories have frightened audiences the way 1990's made-for-TV movie 'It.' Flash forward 17 years, and Pennywise the clown has made an impact on a new generation in Andy Muschietti's take on the classic coming of age tale.The reason 'It' works so well is because it's not just about chocking up cheap scares for the sake of being scary. The way the story evolves really helps us get to understand the young crew from Derry, Maine, who cross paths with the demonic clown (played by Bill Skarsgard). We get to see the rapport between the friends, who bond through experiences with being bullied, trying to enjoy their summer and coping with disappearances of their peers without explanation. Of course, once everyone begins to understand what's happening, thanks to run ins with Pennywise and strain visions, their bond becomes stronger and is put to the test.A reason why 'It' succeeds is because it is pretty evenly balanced. It's a dramatic horror film rather than a generic, standard horror film. There are some scenes that are actually pretty funny due to the fact that the main stars are all adolescents - it would be odd if the film took itself too seriously. It's also not dry or boring. As a result of the pacing, there is enough taking place onscreen to keep the audience engaged. From an acting standpoint, it's hard to overlook the performance Skarsgard gives. He brings out the cheeky yet sinister demeanor in a way that you'd expect a pro like Jim Carrey to be able to do, and his presence (or implied presence) is the main driver of events in the film. Specifically, the opening scene is something that sets the tone for the rest of the film - and will stay with you for days after watching it.Again, 'It' is not just about a killer clown - it's about friendship, acceptance, young love and many other things. 'It' should be appreciated for the way these concepts are captured in an otherwise terrifying story.",7,0,2,1 July 2018
Hereditary," Slow-burn horror that sticks with you
","When 'Hereditary' first hit the film festival circuit, it garnered a reputation of being one of the most unnerving, scariest movies ever made. Since its official release, this reputation has held up.Written and directed by Ari Aster, 'Hereditary' is chilling on a number of levels, including how it was filmed. From the opening scene, it's clear that the techniques used in the film can make all the difference in how it translates to the audience. The use of slow pans, long stationary shots and silence throughout the film ratchet up the fear factor beyond what's expressly shown on screen. On the latter point, however, there are a few scenes that are so grotesque that you can't help but feel your jaw drop and sit in a state of shock. These scenes come out of left field and really stay with you long after the credits role, to the point where you feel the need to take a shower.But what makes 'Hereditary' what it is is the people profiled. Toni Collette's performance is deserving of an award, as her emotional range is tested throughout the film. Alex Wolff transforms from an annoying kid to a dead behind the eyes teen who captivates with his expressionless face. Milly Shapiro plays what is without question the most disturbed young girls to ever walk the earth. And Ann Dowd delivers a performance that can only be described as hauntingly matronly. The Graham family undergoes so much pain that it's hard to understand what could have warranted this. By the film's climax, however, things fall into place.If you're expecting 'Hereditary' to be your run-of-the-mill horror entry, think again. This isn't for the faint of heart.",7,0,1,21 January 2019
A Star Is Born," Cooper's 'Star' burns bright
","No film released in the past year has had the cultural impact that Bradley Cooper's remake of 'A Star is Born' has. The gritty musical love story has brought home plenty of hardware and accolades since its release, and was a hit with audiences, largely due to the chemistry between the two leads - Cooper and Lady Gaga.'Star' does a lot of things right, from focusing almost exclusively on the bond between Cooper's washed up rocker Jack and Gaga's insta-success Ally. By not losing sight on the passion, tension and everything in between on the emotional spectrum in the music power couple's relationship, we avoid unnecessary distractions that often find their way into these kinds of films. Sure, there are odd scenes like the one at Noodles' house (Dave Chappelle in the most un-Dave Chappelle role) and Cooper's gravelly voice gets grating, but things by and large feel 'real.' The role music plays in 'Star' is a key one, and it really can be considered a third lead in the cast. Nothing feels forced or overdramatized - another win considering the subject matter presents a stage that could be littered with these moments.Some believe 'Star' is primarily a vehicle for the soundtrack. While this may be true, the film could still stand on its own without the music. The acting performances, pacing and cinematography (despite shaky-cam syndrome) are all really strong, and Cooper deserves all the credit he gets for this product. Gaga especially delivers the performance of her career, and proves she is a serious actress instead of being an example of stunt casting.'A Star is Born' will long be regarded as a top quality entry in this genre, and gives hope that musical dramas will continue to evolve and find audiences.",8,1,1,20 July 2019
Wind River," This 'River' will chill you to the bone
","While a good script is usually needed for a film to be considered 'good,' a great script can make a film memorable. Taylor Sheridan's 'Wind River' benefits from this, just as his previous screenplays have ('Hell or High Water,' 'Sicario'). The film is set in the windswept, springtime snow peaks of Wyoming, as a Native American reservation deals with a horrific crime involving the murder of a teenage girl.On its surface, 'River' is a suspenseful, somewhat procedural murder mystery thriller. At its core, 'River' is dark drama that looks at the struggles faced by Native Americans - particularly women - as they fight for survival in the desolate wilderness of the American west. Specifically, we follow the story of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) as he is pulled into a case that is all too familiar to him. Then, enter Vegas-based FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), who is tasked with the case, given the fact that the crime was committed on federal land, and it quickly becomes clear that she is out of her comfort zone - figuratively and literally - and must rely on Lambert to make progress.'River' is filmed beautifully, as the harsh environment inserts itself at every moment possible. The landscape and weather sets apart what could otherwise be a semi-straightforward thriller, and Renner's and Olsen's characters are visibly the mercy of the elements, which heightens the sense of excitement and danger. While the first half of 'River' is a bit slow, this build is necessary so that the climactic act has that much more of an impact, even though some of the plot that unfolds can be seen from a ways away.Aside from the obvious parts of the film that make it what it is, there are core themes that are present throughout 'River.' From dealing with loss to seeking retribution, understanding cultural differences and allowing karma to take hold, these themes are central to the film. There's also a fair amount of symbolism, with the mountain lion being somewhat of a barometer for how Renner's character evolves throughout the film. Renner and Olsen do an amazing job conveying pain and passion through their performances, and while they are the most prominent actors here, strong supporting roles including Apesanahkwat as tribal patriarch Dan Crowheart and what amounts to basically a cameo from Jon Bernthal are also important to the storyline.'Wind River' is a quiet, understated powerhouse thriller that is slowly but surely finding an audience, and it certainly deserves a number of nods come awards season, including 'Best Picture.'",9,2,6,4 September 2017
Darkest Hour," Don't mess with Oldman's Churchill
","Biopics seem to be a dime a dozen nowadays, with some that are a much closer reflection of their subject matter than others. 2017's take on Winston Churchill's defining moments in 'Darkest Hour' comes across as seeming fairly accurate in its interpretation of the brash World War II era prime minister, portrayed magnificently by Gary Oldman.As the Nazi forces march across Europe, the allies are faced with a dilemma - do they stand down, or up? After a period of appeasement has clearly failed at the hands of Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), Churchill is selected by England's King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) to serve as prime minister and steer Parliament and the British Empire toward a path to victory.What 'Hour' does particularly well is show how authentic Churchill was; a reluctant but willing soldier. The film is inextricably tied to Oldman's performance - without him, this could have been a very different end product. He has everything down to the hoarse chuckle and mannerisms, which explains why he was handed an Academy Award for the performance. But the supporting cast really does a great job not being completely eclipsed. Lily James is an especially bright star, as she portrays Churchill's trusted typist, Elizabeth, in a way that shows a range of emotions, from fear, to empathy, to pride.'Hour' is a period drama, so is not intended to feature all of the bells and whistles that big budget blockbusters are known for. Instead, it's a combination of Oldman's on point portrayal of Churchill, smart dialogue and a chilling score that are what make 'Hour' the solid film that it is.It's true that hollywood has saturated theaters with WWII-set films over the years, but 'Darkest Hour' is a good example of how there are still some gems to be found in the rough.",8,0,1,8 September 2018
Captain Marvel," Larson and 90s nostalgia help 'Marvel' go supersonic
","The Marvel universe is nearing its twilight era, and it's about time someone like Captain Marvel appeared on the scene. In 'Captain Marvel,' it's Brie Larson's turn to step into her suit and answer the call, as she is technically the first official SHIELD member (not including Captain America, of course).A lot of 'Marvel's success rides on Larson's ability to command the screen, and thankfully the Academy Award-winning actress brings the confidence needed to make it work. As to be expected, Larson's Carol Danvers/Vers must overcome challenges thrown at her, and she experiences many setbacks throughout her upbringing. Her story is not as conventional as many other Marvel superheroes' stories were, which gives 'Captain Marvel' a feeling that's more along the lines of a 'Guardians of the Galaxy' than an 'Iron Man.'There are a host of supporting actors who make 'Captain Marvel' what it is, though. The best part is that Samuel L. Jackson gets a shining role as Nick Fury, as does the familiar face of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). Annette Bening, Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn also make appearances, with Bening's being the one to write home about. But it really comes down to Larson, as she proves she's able to shoulder the weight of a big budget blockbuster just like the big boys. And the constant 90s nostalgia, from pop culture references to a killer soundtrack, are appreciated.As audiences eagerly anticipate the arrival of 'Avengers: Endgame,' it's definitely worth giving 'Captain Marvel' a try as an opening act.",7,2,11,23 March 2019
Us," Despite a predictable twist, Peele still delivers
","Jordan Peele has already proven his directing and writing abilities with 2017's horror breakout 'Get Out.' If he really wanted, he could have sold his director's chair and retired to a private Caribbean island having left a lasting legacy on the genre. But that would be a waste of talent.In 'Us,' Peele returns to a story that becomes increasingly unsettling and sinister the longer it goes on, and the formula once again works. As the Wilson family embarks on a beach vacation to Santa Cruz, old secrets begin to emerge that threaten not only the family of four, but society as a whole. Led by Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke and supported by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, we get to see a lot of stalking from shadowy strangers to harrowing escapes via car and boat. It's not your typical horror film - there's plenty of action built into it, and it's actually well done. Even smaller-scale appearances from Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker do not go wasted in 'Us.'But the best aspect of the film is without a doubt the underlying current of psychological fear throughout. Regardless of how things unfold and build, 'Us' never loses its edge, even though the major plot twist can be seen from a mile away. It may not be quite as groundbreaking as 'Get Out,' but it's not fair to compare the two - 'Us' should be viewed as its own film.Whatever you think of 'Us,' it's clear audiences will wait eagerly for the next offering from Peele.",7,1,2,1 February 2020
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," 'Ridiculous' doesn't even begin to describe this
","Video game-based films have mostly suffered at the box office, with only a few bright spots - namely the 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' series (and a lot of that was due to the 'Jolie Effect'). 2010 brought us Disney's attempt in 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,' which was directed by Mike Newell and produced by none other than Jerry Bruckheimer.The $200M big-budget action blockbuster was a blistering blunder at the box office, which explains why there was never a follow-up effort. At one point, Disney was hopeful that 'Persia' could follow in the footsteps of successful franchises like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or 'National Treasure.' So what went wrong? For one, while Jake Gyllenhaal is generally a good actor, he didn't fit the part of Prince Dastan, the protagonist who stumbles upon a magic dagger that can turn back time, as well as a feisty princess (Gemma Arterton) who becomes quite a handful for him, given the rest of the situation he's in. Gyllenhaal is as wooden as a park bench and has an accent that is pretty much indistinguishable.In a nutshell, 'Persia' is a total mess. It's not entertaining, feels unintentionally comical at points and is just ridiculously campy. Whether it's the fighting scenes that look like a 12-year-old designed them, complete with slow-mo and over-the-top sound effects, or characters who add little-to-no value, there's plenty of that to go around here. Even talented actors like Sir Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina have their talents wasted in this film. The only good thing about 'Persia' is it's not too long, at just under two hours.No doubt, 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Times' was a big gamble taken by the Mouse House, and like most video game adaptations, it crumbled under its own weight.",2,3,8,1 September 2017
The Irishman," Scorsese's Netflix vanity project delivers
","Going into the 2019/2020 awards season as one of the favorites for taking home accolades ranging from 'best director' to 'best picture,' Martin Scorsese's long-winded period drama 'The Irishman' is surely a film that will capture the attention of a wide, diverse audience.Sure, the main cast may be comprised of cinematic dinosaurs, but they've all earned the right to be referred to by their last names only: De Niro. Pacino. Pesci. As Scorsese proves here, there is no better actor to play an Irish-American than an Italian-American, with De Niro's Frank Sheeran proving to be one of the most honorably vengeful confidants that lived in the 20th century. At the center of 'Irishman' is the struggle between the Teamsters and the Federal government, with political infighting among the union's leadership serving as the backdrop for much of the on-screen action.For many, the major takeaway of 'Irishman' is its length. Clocking in at three-and-a-half hours, the film is quite a time investment. But in true Scorsese fashion, this runtime is not for the sake of keeping the audience in its seats - it's all deliberate. For one, the timing allows for proper character development, as we get to see the real ups and downs in the relationships between Sheeran, Pacino's Jimmy Hoffa and Pesci's Russell Bufalino. And there are definitely a number of ups and downs. And what goes hand-in-hand with solid character development is smart dialogue - which there is plenty of to go around here.Some may accuse 'The Irishman' as being a Scorsese vanity project. And to be fair, it totally is. But it's a very well done vanity project, and for that, it should be appreciated.",8,1,3,23 December 2019
Spotlight," Journalism at its finest gets its time in the 'Spotlight'
","Newsrooms are often prime settings for gripping dramas. Whether about a political scandal like in 'All the President's Men,' a war scandal like in 'The Post' or a religious scandal like in 'Spotlight,' these films have the ingredients needed to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. 'Spotlight' in particular is a standout thanks to the A-list cast and the difficult storytelling required given the somber subject matter.A best picture and best original screenplay winner, 'Spotlight' truly earned these accolades thanks to Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer for outstanding writing. As we've seen many times before, a film can have a great ensemble, but they can easily fall flat if the writing isn't top-notch. Here, we see the likes of Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci build on each others' talents as the Boston Globe Spotlight team does its best to get to the bottom of the Boston Archdiocese's decades-long coverup of priest sexual abuse.Again, this is heavy stuff, but the way the pieces come together is really remarkable. Ruffalo's no-BS portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes is a particular highlight, as he clearly will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of the story. Keaton also does an admirable job as the spotlight team leader - his background making things more complicated as he tries to navigate the tangled web that is the 'system' in place between Boston politics and the Catholic Church.There are some films that just stand on their own two feet without needing explanation for their brilliance. 'Spotlight' is definitely one of those.",9,0,0,26 April 2020
Insomnia," Nolan and Pacino could have done better
","Al Pacino is one of the greatest character actors in the past 40 years, and while not every one of his films have been met with the same level of success, he still tries to give it his all regardless. His performance in 'Insomnia' is a good example of this.The film finds him as an LAPD detective who is nearing retirement and is called up to investigate a murder of a teen in a small Alaska town where there is 24 hours of sunlight for months at a time. The premise itself is really intriguing, and with an all-star supporting cast of Hilary Swank and Robin Williams, it's hard to go wrong. That said, the execution of 'Insomnia' is a bit clunky, as the screenplay is a major letdown. The twist is pretty easy to spot from a mile away regardless of the curve balls that are thrown into the mix. Also, it's hard to take Williams seriously in a serious role, considering he always shined when dishing out one-liners in comedies.Still, there's plenty to like about 'Insomnia.' For one, the setting in the wilderness of Alaska (or, British Columbia, to be more accurate) is a nice change from the cityscapes we're used to seeing in these kinds of thrillers, and the inner battles that Pacino's character fights while in the midst of everything else adds another dynamic to things, in addition to the lack of sleep in the midnight sun that causes even more chaos.'Insomnia' is not Christopher Nolan's best directing effort, but his signature style comes through in the thriller and it's worth a watch.",5,1,3,4 July 2017
Aquaman," No 'Wonder Woman,' but wildly entertaining
","The DC Universe has an uneven track record when it comes to recent film adaptations of its franchise. For every 'Wonder Woman' there's a 'Batman vs. Superman' or 'Justice League.' Thankfully for fans of these superheroes, James Wan's 'Aquaman' is closer to the former than the latter, at least in terms of entertainment value.While 'Aquaman' is pretty much billed as the Jason Momoa show, the cast actually does an excellent job sharing the limelight, even in the face of typically wooden dialogue. Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman do their very best as royalty from the sea, while Patrick Wilson surprises as scorned Atlantean brother King Orm - a role very different from those he is known for. Not to mention Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren, and a kraken voiced by none other than...Julie Andrews? As for villains, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II takes on the role of modern-day pirate Manta, whose suit looks like it would be a better fit in a Power Rangers movie.But the cast is not the main attraction here - it's the visuals. It's hard to imagine 'Aquaman' being filmed a decade ago when Vince Chase made it the biggest blockbuster in history on 'Entourage.' The level of preciseness required to make the underwater worlds of Atlantis and others come to life without coming off looking cheap is not to be taken for granted. There is such detail included to ensure these scenes are believable that in some instances it comes off as Pandora-like. This alone makes seeing the film on the big screen worth the price of admission.As for the plot, it's your standard comic book fare, with the hero story lifted from numerous films that have come before 'Aquaman.' In this case, the execution actually makes up for the poor storyline and scripting. The soundtrack and score are also above average for a DC Universe film, with the only exception being a ridiculous interruption from a Pitbull song that samples 'Africa' (but why?).'Aquaman' may not come anywhere close to 'The Dark Knight' series, or even hold a candle to some of the better quality Marvel efforts, but it surely is an entertaining ride that should be enjoyed for what it is.",7,11,19,23 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A fun, entertaining rebirth of the 'Thor' saga
","Ever since Disney acquired the rights to the Marvel franchise, there have been signs of change in the films that have released compared to earlier efforts. 'Thor: Ragnarok' stands out as an example of a film that feels very different from its two predecessors, as it's closer to a 'Guardians of the Galaxy' vibe than a 'Captain America' one. This is true despite the fact that it revolves around Thor's quest to thwart the destruction of his homeland of Asgard at the hands of the evil war goddess Hela (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett).'Ragnarok' is fun, yet dark. Campy, yet mature. A lot of this is likely influenced by its director, Taika Waititi, who is able to bring out more character in each actor. While Blanchett is easily the best part of 'Ragnarok,' Chris Hemsworth once again picks up his hammer and delivers a performance that is anything but wooden. Other standouts include Tessa Thompson, whose Valkyrie is the perfect sidekick for Thor, while Tom Hiddleston is his usual mischievous self as Loki. And then there's Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster, who is quite possibly the oddest individual ever conceived for this series. 'Ragnarok' also does a good job of continuing to weave together others from the Marvel universe, from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to the boring as watching paint dry Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).It's clear there are almost too many people to keep track of in 'Ragnarok,' although it doesn't feel as overwhelming as an 'Avengers' film. Perhaps one aspect that helps in this regard is that the main settings of Asgard and Sakaar are interesting. It's nice to see the majority of a Marvel film take place somewhere other than earth, which seems to be a new trend for Marvel. And then there's the soundtrack - a mix of 80s-infused electronica - which doesn't really fit the story, but still sounds pretty cool. Perhaps its weakest element is in the dialogue - too many cheesy jokes thrown in to the point where it almost sounds like a running gag reel.It wouldn't be fair to say 'Thor: Ragnarok' is one of the best Marvel films, but what it lacks in sophistication is made up in the entertainment department.",7,1,5,21 January 2019
Milk," One of Penn's greatest performances of his career
","Sean Penn has a long list of character portrayals, many of which were critically acclaimed. One that earned him the honor of 'best actor' at the Academy Awards was his role as the assassinated politician and LGBT advocate Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sant's 2008 biopic 'Milk.'Everything about the film revolves around Penn and how he brings to life the San Francisco city official's grassroots rise and tragic fall. Say what you will about Penn, but he's able to really dig down deep into his roles and almost actually become them in a way that makes him come across as authentic. In 'Milk,' Penn is supported by the likes of Emile Hirsch, James Franco and Diego Luna - all of whom are high-caliber actors in their own right - and he has the perfect foil in Josh Brolin as Milk's political archrival, Dan White.The film does a good job of not stretching to fit too many aspects of Milk's life into its 128 minutes, instead opting to focus on the events that took place later in his life that would shape the LGBT movement for years to come. And while it's based on true events, 'Milk' doesn't come off as being too sensational or preachy.It may not be one of the most memorable film adaptations of a U.S. politician's life, but 'Milk' continues to be one of the high water marks of Sean Penn's career.",7,0,0,8 March 2020
Ready Player One," Pop culture references abound in this wild arcade ride
","In the nerd-iverse where comic books, arcade games and (apparently) the soundtrack of the 80s resides, there is 'Ready Player One.' Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of Ernest Cline's best-selling futuristic fantasy thriller made a big splash at the box office in 2018, in large part due to a dedicated fanbase. General audiences could identify with the number of pop culture references littered throughout the film - everything from Batman climbing Mt. Everest to Stormtroopers and Freddy Krueger - and the dazzling CGI, of course.As a movie, 'Ready' is a wild ride. The premise is simple enough: a young, downtrodden Columbus kid finds new life in a VR universe that has taken hold of the world - the Oasis. Played by Tye Sheridan, Wade, or 'Parzival' as he's known in the Oasis, is your typical protagonist in this kind of story, as he's the perfect candidate to try to take on an ominous corporate conglomerate that's led by the intimidating Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). We also see some noteworthy performances from Olivia Cooke (Art3mis / Samantha) and Lena Waithe (Aech / Helen), not to mention seeing a spaced-out Mark Rylance as the reclusive inventor of the Oasis, Halliday.To be clear, 'Ready' does a great job with some key scenes, especially one that takes place in the notorious Overlook Hotel and another racing sequence in Manhattan. However, when comparing the film to the book, it's no contest. Of course, when is that ever not the case? Still, 'Ready' does run into the issue of feeling a bit rushed in certain instances - as if the actors are racing against the clock in order to finish the story.While not perfect, 'Ready Player One' is simultaneously an exciting trip down memory lane...and the path to the future.",6,0,1,22 December 2018
"I, Tonya"," A dark comedy of many, many errors
","In the history of American competitive athletics, there are a few moments that stand the test of time and are remembered many years after they happen. One of these moments is profiled in 'I, Tonya' - the 2017 quasi-fictional documentary-style film that follows the tumultuous life of former U.S. figure skater Tonya Harding (portrayed here by Margot Robbie), who had a swift rise to the top of the podium and an even swifter fall from grace thanks to the actions of her former husband.But 'Tonya' is about more than just 'the incident' (as it's referred to in the film) - it takes us behind the curtain to see how the self-professed redneck was able to defy the odds, fending off constant verbal and physical abuse from her monster mother, LaVona (played brilliantly by Allison Janney), and her one-time husband, Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), to make the U.S. Olympic team twice in two years. 'Tonya' is filmed in an unusual way, where the story's characters are interviewed present day, reflecting back on the events, and we then see these events play out. Director Craig Gillespie takes liberties with this approach, doing things like having the actors break the third wall multiple times to dialogue with the audience and editing together reflections to tell a disjointed story.But as serious as this story could be, since it's not a happy one, it's interesting to see how much sarcasm is injected into 'Tonya.' Of course, this was likely something that was cleared with Harding herself, but it still is almost shocking to see some of the things that are depicted onscreen and are then basically shrugged off. Because Gillooly and her mother were such domineering personalities who controlled Harding, the relationships are what drive the entire film more than anything else. Also not lost on us is the stupidity of nearly everyone involved here - from the attack on Nancy Kerrigan to the cover up, it's like a comedy of error after error - and everything is captured in a way that makes it feel almost unreal.'I, Tonya' is not an amazing film in and of itself, but it's a vehicle through which standout acting performances are carried. And for that reason, it should be recognized.",6,1,4,25 June 2018
Moana," Disney goes far in 'Moana'
","Disney Animation Studios has been on a hot streak for a number of years now, and 2016's 'Moana' was another example of how far the studio will go to release films that resonate with its audiences. While we are clearly beyond the days of the classic 2D animated movies that audiences of all ages fell in love with, 'Moana' proves it's possible to capture the magic of this era through quick wit, lots of laughs and, of course, catchy songs.The film follows the story of a young Polynesia princess who's forbidden from leaving her homeland - an island in the South Pacific. As is the case in most Disney pictures, the protagonist, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), defies convention and embarks on a journey to find a demigod named Maui (Dwayne Johnson) so she can retrieve Te Fiti's heart, an ancient artifact that is needed to restore order to the open seas. This plot is nothing spectacular - it's pretty basic, but is in line with what's needed for a foundation of a great animated film.'Moana''s strengths are obvious. From the beautiful scenery brought to life through animation, where everything in nature appears to be alive - even the inanimate ocean, to the standard comedic moments that are expected in Disney movies (most of which come at the expense of Maui), there is plenty to enjoy about the film. The standout for sure is Cravalho, as her vocals are impressive on the soundtrack, including its biggest hit, 'How Far I'll Go.' As a heroine, Moana is fiercely independent and self-sufficient - a strong role model particularly for young girls. The only areas that feel a bit lacking are the few number of characters - much less compared to traditional Disney movies - and the fact that there is no traditional villain (think Jafar, Cruella de Vil, Scar, etc,). That said, there's plenty of action and adventure to keep audiences engaged.While not the most memorable story, 'Moana' is a fun, free-spirited adventure and is an example of how Disney is continuing to explore new areas while working with a proven formula for success.",7,1,2,18 December 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee goes for the gold - and delivers
","Spike Lee is known for translating difficult stories into cinema, and 'BlacKkKlansman' is no different. In what is one of the most interesting and head-scratching tales from the civil rights movement, Lee brings us the story of Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first African-American police officer, who also is part of a covert team that infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan.One of the biggest surprises in 'BlacKkKlansman' is the job John David Washington does as the aforementioned Officer Stallworth. The son of a film legend and a relative newcomer to acting, Washington has everything down from the accent to the look to - most importantly - the quick wit needed to outsmart a bunch of backhills racists. Joining him on this journey is Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), a Jewish officer who is also an unconventional choice to take down the KKK.The film is many things all at once - a crime drama, a dark comedy, a time travel back to a different era - and it delivers on all of these points. Through the eyes of Stallworth, the audience can identify with the personal struggle he experiences, trying to be a black cop in an all-white force with few friends or believers, while also straddling the line when it comes to sticking to his roots, including the young civil rights movement led by Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier).'BlacKkKlansman' also earned Lee his first Oscar, for best adapted screenplay - incredible to believe given his long career. It is not the best (nor is it his best) effort, but it's a well done film that tells a crazy story in a unique way.",7,2,5,23 March 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The reboot this franchise has been waiting for
","Disney's Marvel is a juggernaut unlike we've ever seen, as there is almost no end to the films the studio churns out of the comic book universe. So much so that they've resorted to rebooting franchises multiple times, with 'Spider-Man' now on its third reinvention of itself.In 2017's 'Spider-Man: Homecoming,' we get to see the full backstory of Tom Holland's take on Peter Parker, who fans got a glimpse of in 'Captain America: Civil War.' When compared to Spideys of years past (Maguire and Garfield, looking at you), this interpretation of everyone's favorite neighborhood crimefighter seems closets to what's depicted in the comics. Holland looks the part of a nerdy high school geek, and he plays it well, making nerdy seem cool.And while the superhero is the main attraction here, his supporting cast is stellar - from Michael Keaton as a construction crew supervisor-turned winged villain to Marisa Tomei as Aunt Mae, not to mention Donald Glover, Jon Favreau, Zendaya, Iron Man himself and a special cameo from everyone's favorite pepper (Potts, that is). As the Marvel cinematic universe has expanded, it's been easier to squeeze in all these characters, and there is a feeling that it is one continuous storyline as opposed to siloed chapters.As for the storyline here, 'Homecoming' seems a bit lukewarm compared to previous efforts. Sure, the protagonist is still going to Spanish class and competing on the academic decathlon team, so we can't be dealing with anything extra crazy here, but Keaton's Vulture nemesis is not the most menacing thing we've ever come across. Instead, 'Homecoming' opts for a lot more humor and lightheartedness, focusing on adolescent issues like first love and getting asked to the homecoming dance (makes sense now, right?). Still, there are plenty of action sequences and cool shots of the NYC skyline that should not be taken for granted.It's not amazing, per se, but 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' feels like the reboot this franchise was in need of, and will fit as a better piece in the Marvel puzzle for the foreseeable future.",7,0,2,19 February 2018
Lost in Translation," Coppola's breakout film still translates nearly two decades later
","The early 2000s were filled with films in which middle-aged actors who were perhaps just starting to reach the outer limits of their careers were recognized for quality work in indie films. 2003's 'Lost in Translation' is exhibit A of this trend, as Bill Murray played what could almost be considered a caricature of himself as a 'past his prime' actor who finds work across the Pacific in Tokyo.Sofia Coppola's first major, critically acclaimed effort as director generated a lot of buzz (and biz) around its release, and its Academy Award for best original screenplay was well deserved. At the center of 'Translation' is the relationship that forms between Murray's Bob Harris and Scarlett Johansson's twentysomething Charlotte - a role that is really considered a breakout by many (sorry 'Eight-Legged Freaks'). Both Bob and Charlotte feel like prisoners in a foreign city, with neither of them really wanting to be there. Yet over the course of the film, we see an unlikely friendship develop, with some lessons learned along the way.The fact that 'Translation' is set in a city in which English is a second language also adds to its uniqueness, as it's another element that makes the two protagonists feel even more isolated. It's interesting that this film did not set off a domino effect of many others trying this out for effect.'Lost in Translation' is a little quirky, a little unorthodox, but a lot entertaining.",7,2,2,8 March 2020
Doctor Strange," A mediocre Marvel effort
","As far as the extended Marvel universe goes, there are a handful of entries that seem like they were hastily whipped together for the sake of introducing a character so that he or she can be included in an 'Avengers.' This is the case with 'Doctor Strange,' as not even an American-sounding Benedict Cumberbatch can save the film from mediocrity.To be fair, at least 'Strange' is unique, and not a fourth 'Iron Man' or a third 'Spider-man' reboot. Director Scott Derrickson deserves credit for steering this behemoth, as it boasts some pretty amazing visuals and pretty cool settings (Nepal, anyone?). Sure, there's some 'Inception'-like building shapeshifting going on, but it still has a nice look. But when it comes to the content of the story, it's pretty basic (a cocky doctor suffers a setback in his life that he must overcome).As for Cumberbatch, while a great actor, he doesn't feel authentic as a Marvel superhero. The humor injected into the dialogue feels unnatural, as if he is being forced to become Tony Stark. Similarly, Rachel McAdams is usually a great actress but her role as Dr. Christine Palmer is just not a good fit. As for the rest of the cast, a bald Tilda Swinton is hands down the best part of 'Strange' as the mysterious 'Ancient One,' while Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Wong make for good sidekicks.While not the worst of the bunch, 'Doctor Strange' could have been much better had a few adjustments been made to the story and cast.",5,1,2,1 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A messy conclusion to one of the most storied franchises of all time
","Few cinematic franchises evoke as strong emotions as 'Star Wars' does. While the original trilogy has, and will always, be the gold standard in the series, the prequel trilogy and sequel trilogy have split the fanbase right down the middle in many cases. In the case of 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' - the conclusion of the 42-year Skywalker journey - we have a deeply flawed, messy but exciting final chapter.It is clear that 'Skywalker' is actually intended to be a film-and-a-half, following the fairly disastrous fan reception that greeted 'The Last Jedi.' The apparent overcorrection by J.J. Abrams is painfully obvious, as the amount of content packed into the 141-minute runtime feels like an overstuffed suitcase. From the nonstop planet-hopping to the number of faces, voices, Force ghosts and breeds of stormtroopers that make appearances, it's a miracle if anyone short of a diehard fan can keep track of everything.Without diving too deep down into the minutiae, the aspects of 'Skywalker' that stick out, for better or worse, are the use of the camera, the uneven plot and the famed John Williams score. The score is once again first-rate, as would be expected, but the cinematography is noticeably sub-par and does nothing to support the rest of the film. The plot feels rushed in some part and drawn out in others, with one big reveal falling flat and character development being an afterthought. It instead feels like Abrams and team developed the film with a master checklist, checking each box off while they went along.Perhaps one of the worst parts about the film is the incorporation of Carrie Fisher's post-hostumous portrayal of General Leia Organa. While it's a nice gesture to continue Fisher's legacy on through this final film, some of the scenes are particularly jarring and difficult to watch. And then there are just ridiculous things thrown in there like horses on star destroyers, awkward kisses and lightbulb moments that feel like a stretch even for this galaxy far away.The finale is pretty okay, with enough left open for interpretation and the kind of closure that should satisfy most fans. But that doesn't excuse the fact that 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' is a disorganized joyride through time and space with more plot holes than the Emperor has star destroyers.",6,3,14,24 December 2019
Lion," Important message of hope and strength for all families
","The whole 'based on a true story' mantra has been done to death in Hollywood, but every once in a while you'll come across a film that actually lives up to the tagline. 2016's 'Lion' is a prime example, as the Garth Davis directed drama tells the amazing story of an Indian man who was separated from his family at a young age, only to end up as an adopted son a continent away in Australia.From start to finish, 'Lion' is a touching tear-jerker of a film. We see life through the eyes of Saroo (portrayed by Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel), who unfortunately gets onto a train that takes him far far away from home. This journey is one that forces Saroo to grow up very quickly, and when he gets adopted by a loving Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman), he gets a sense of stability and opportunity. But it isn't too long before he gets the itch to locate his 'real' home and family.What 'Lion' does very well is tell the story of Saroo through beautiful visuals and sound. The soundtrack adds to the magic of the story, and the majestic landscapes of India and Australia are shown throughout. In terms of acting, Patel and Kidman especially deliver strong performances. Rooney Mara also doesn't disappoint as the girlfriend of Saroo, as she is a pivotal force during a time when he questions many things. And then of course Google does a fine job in its supporting role. There are also many themes that take center stage during 'Lion,' from identity to forgiveness and, of course, family - whether real or adopted.'Lion' is a powerful film that carries a strong message and serves as a beacon for all those who are separated from their families but still believe they will find their way home.",8,0,0,11 November 2018
The Lost City of Z," Hunnam brings Fawcett's trials and travails to life in 'Z'
","Not all period films are created equal, and those that focus on expeditions to uncharted territories are scrutinized even more. Amazon Studios' modest effort 'The Lost City of Z' explored the life of Percy Fawcett, a British colonel who explored the jungles of Amazonia in the early 20th century.With James Gray at the helm ('We Own the Night,' 'The Immigrant') and Charlie Hunnam in his element as Col. Fawcett, 'Z' is a more of a high-quality biography that focuses on character development than it is an epic blockbuster that is obsessed with special effects and antics found in action films. Following Fawcett's inaugural voyage to South America, it's clear to see the spark of desire to unearth the mystery around the indigenous civilization that inhabited the lost civilization. From this point on, Fawcett's thirst for discovery seems to take over more and more of his life, which takes a toll on his family, including his young children and wife (Sienna Miller).This personal struggle is one that is constant throughout much of 'Z,' which adds more meaning to the film as opposed to just focusing on the travails in the piranha-infested waters and among the arrow-wielding natives of the Amazon. Of course, the sacrifices Fawcett must make are necessary, but seeing them play such a central part of the film is unique. Another one of the film's strengths is its focus on the politics of the Royal Geographical Society and British society as a whole, as the pressures forced upon Fawcett as a result of the disbelief among those who never set foot in the 'lost city,' as well as their protests at the insinuation that the civilization could have been 'advanced.'Another element that works in 'Z's favor is its smart pacing. Instead of wasting time on the multiple months-long transatlantic voyages, we instead see how Fawcett's life and fortunes turn both at home in the UK and abroad. It's also worth noting that Robert Pattinson's portrayal of Fawcett's sidekick Henry Costin is actually a pretty good performance, suggesting there might be some more niche roles he can play in the future.'Z' may not have found a strong following at the box office, but the fact that Amazon Studios was able to deliver another quality picture suggests we're in store for even more. It also would not be out of the question for Hunnam to be a dark horse for acting noms come awards season.",7,1,2,8 October 2017
Ant-Man," Kind of a mess, but still fun in a bite-sized way
","Falling squarely in the 'overlooked and somewhat underappreciated' camp of Marvel films, 2015's 'Ant-Man' was not our typical effort from the studio. The Paul Rudd/Michael Douglas/Evangeline Lilly-starrer was a little bit goofy, kind of awkward but still fun, and for that reason it remains one of the odd men out among the bigger, badder entries from the 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America' franchises.'Ant-Man' has a few things going for it, namely Rudd. He's the unlikely underdog superhero in the vein of Spider-Man, falling into his role and needing to live up to sizeable expectations. Rudd is perfectly cast for this part, as his 'aw shucks' personality and non-intimidating demeanor make him an unassuming agent. Lilly's Hope van Dyne is the kind of unpredictable, cutthroat semi-villain who could be just as helpful as she could be dangerous, and her onscreen father, Douglas's Dr. Pym is a likeable grandfatherly mad scientist type. Together, they make a band of renegades who might just have what it takes to thwart evil corporate suit Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). We also see some surprising supporting roles, from a bumbling Michael Pena to an 'on autopilot' T.I., plus it's good to see Anthony Mackie as Falcon in a creative, pretty funny matchup with the Ant-Man himself.But don't go thinking this film is one of the stronger offerings in the franchise. It's not. In fact, 'Ant-Man' feels like it was created just for the sake of giving Rudd's Scott Lang a starring role just so he could make it into other films ('Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' come to mind).'Ant-Man' should be enjoyed for what it is - a fun, wild ride in a modern 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' kind of way.",6,0,1,31 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A search for identity told through a bohemian rhapsody
","One of the biggest blockbusters of the awards season, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' had all the elements needed for the perfect storm of attention - lots of controversy, both on and off screen, an iconic band with a killer soundtrack, and a frontman who is nothing if not interesting.When you put all of this together, 'Rhapsody' becomes a story that is one of tragedy, overcoming adversity and personal identity. Without a doubt, it is Rami Malek who is the standout, as his portrayal of the conflicted Freddie Mercury leaves very few stones left unturned. The fact that Malek earned an Oscar for this role tells you pretty much all you need to know - he's the star of the show, and he won't let anyone forget it.To be sure, there are plenty of openings for audiences to criticize 'Rhapsody.' Perhaps Mercury's story was sanitized more so than it should have been. Maybe it was how Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) was portrayed. Maybe the friction between Mercury and the rest of Queen was downplayed. Whatever may be the truth, it shouldn't take away from the fact that the film is entertaining. Just take the Live Aid concert scene - that in and of itself is worth the watch.It won't be remembered as the greatest music-focused film of all time, but 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a pioneer in this genre and may in fact be responsible for a new wave of similar films that will be hitting theaters over the coming years.",7,1,1,22 March 2019
Bird Box," Put a blindfold on Bullock and she'll still out-act you
","Very few actors can anchor a Netflix movie and turn it into a massive hit. Sandra Bullock fits this bill, as the Academy Award-winning actress carries the apocalyptic thriller 'Bird Box' on her shoulders.The sign of a solid 'mess with your mind' thriller is when it stays with you long after you watch it. In 'Box,' Bullock stars as Mallorie, a mother who must guide her children while blindfolded through the wilderness as supernatural forces try to hunt them down. As the film progresses, pieces begin to fall into place that help the audience understand the events that transpired. While some twists can be seen from a mile away, there are plenty of 'OMG' moments around every corner, which feel like a punch to your gut. Not every film in this genre can accomplish this nowadays, but writer Eric Heisserer and director Susanne Bier were able to achieve this. A lot of this is due to smart cinematography, as well. Using tight shots that leave much to the imagination about what's going on surrounding the actors, as well as quick transitions and flashbacks - these techniques work well here.Bullock is of course the lead here, but a number of familiar faces are seen hiding in houses behind drapes and shades. Sarah Paulson stars as the sister of Mallorie, and although her screentime is not super long, she brings 'horror cred' to the film. Others like BD Wong, Machine Gun Kelly and Trevante Rhodes do alright, with the latter making the biggest impact. And John Malkovich is quintessential John Malkovich, bourbon and all. But 'Box' is really all about Sandra, and she steals every scene she's in.And then there's the birds. Birds represent much more than winged creatures who sing. Not only do they serve a functional purpose, but they are also emblematic of the psychological imprisonment that humanity experiences throughout the film. And so the film's title is not as random as it seems.There have been a few Netflix films that have gone on to garner buzz (and some even critical acclaim), and 'Bird Box' is surely one that will encourage more to be made.",7,1,5,28 December 2018
Justice League," Proving to be the little league of superhero franchises
","After three film entries in the DC Comics universe that found varying degrees of success, Warner Bros. hit a snag with 2017's 'Justice League.' Directed by Zack Snyder, the film brought together the new kids on the block of superheroes in Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Jason Fisher) and everyone's favorite man of steel (Henry Cavill).While on paper, this all-star cast gives off an 'Avengers' vibe, it's a far cry from that franchise. For one, the actors completely lack chemistry. Everything seems forced, especially the few comedic moments that are thrown into the mix. Sure, 'Justice' is supposed to be more serious in nature than anything in the Marvel universe, but it's possible to strike a balance without coming off so wooden. Even Gadot's Wonder Woman does not radiate the same sense of confidence as she did in her titular role last year.Aside from the poorer than usual acting, the story is nothing special - the heroes band together to stop the threat posed by New God member Steppenwolf as he tries to collect three powerful boxes that could destroy Earth. This is standard fare for any superhero entry, so it doesn't really count against 'Justice,' nor does it do it any favors. So what does this leave us? Not much, unfortunately. Everything here is pretty much forgettable.It's possible that DC films can make a comeback, as 'Wonder Woman,' 'Suicide Squad' and 'Man of Steel' all seemed to click with audiences. Hopefully 'Aquaman' can beat the odds in December, otherwise many will blame 'Justice League' for casting a shadow on future releases.",4,2,4,29 May 2018
Split," Shyamalan strikes back with a psychological scarefest
","After a string of box office and critical disasters, it appears M. Night Shyamalan has got his groove back. In 2017, the notorious horror/suspense director from Pennsylvania brought audiences 'Split' - a deeply disturbing psychological thriller that focuses on the human mind - and experience- rather than aliens, ghosts or killer trees.'Split' revolves around a kidnapping of three teenage girls by a creepy young man who is revealed to suffer from dissociative identity disorder (DID). In fact, 23 personalities reside within the mind of McAvoy's character. It's fair to say an alternative title for 'Split' could be 'The James McAvoy Show,' as the actor demonstrates his breadth in this role. Not every actor could play this role, as he brings out eight of his personalities in their entirety and never misses a beat.Because his performance is so strong, it's easy to overlook the job done by Anya Taylor-Joy, who is handed the tough task of playing the girl who must remain calm when everything in her being tells her to react differently. However, the audience soon learns to understand why she is the way she is - through a slow reveal of a traumatic childhood experience. This backstory gives her character even more of a reason to succeed in this challenge.While the cast is the main attraction in 'Split,' it's also worth noting that Shyamalan's signature filming style is back. From unique camera angles to the use of foreshadowing as a technique, it's good to see the director who won over so many fans nearly two decades ago can still deliver. While the film is not scary in a traditional sense, it is incredibly unsettling and hits a nerve with many.'Split' is not the greatest film out of the Shyamalan collection, but it signals the director is back in the saddle.",7,0,1,19 November 2017
Little Miss Sunshine," An ensemble cast and great writing bring the 'Sunshine'
","Fox Searchlight's 2006 surprise indie hit 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a film that accomplished one thing more than anything else - it got audiences to feel better about their own families. Set in the American southwest, we follow the Hoover family as they race to Redondo Beach in their VW van to have 7-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) take part in the stereotypically scary 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty pageant. Cue the crazy.Between the heroin-addicted patriarch (Alan Arkin), the suicidal uncle/brother (a 'The Office'-era Steve Carrell), a purposely mute nihilistic teen (Paul Dano) and a hopeless, wannabe motivational speaker (Greg Kinnear), it's a lot for the arguably only sane person in the family - Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) - to handle. There are so many ridiculous antics that unfold during the 800-mile trek, from their beaten down VW suffering mechanical troubles to an awkward roadside diner breakfast that every family can relate to.What really makes 'Sunshine' work is the writing. Written by Michael Arndt, the quirkiness comes through in every line in the script, without feeling forced or gimmicky. There's also a lot of emphasis on character development - something that's crucial for a film that relies so heavily on an ensemble cast - and the dysfunction almost seems like an art form. It's no surprise the writing resulted in an Oscar for best original screenplay.It may not be the best comedy ever, but 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a fun, zany ride through the challenges of family life and a commentary on the fact that beauty really is skin-deep.",7,0,0,11 March 2018
Dunkirk," A war film that actually feels real
","When you think of some of the greatest war films in history, there are a few that come to mind. From 'Saving Private Ryan' to 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket,' there are a few that have made a huge impact on society and are considered to be some of the greatest cinema made.Enter 'Dunkirk.' Christopher Nolan's extravagant take on the evacuation of allied forces from a French beach town during WWII as the German forces descended on them. Central to the events was the fact that British civilians were called on to man their own vessels so that they could make the trip across the English Channel and lend a hand in the evacuation, as the German air force complicated the rescue mission from above.The main reason 'Dunkirk' works so well is it feels 'real.' Nolan is a master of letting elements unfold on screen without the need to add unnecessary dialogue. The use of sound and wide shots of the open water and beach give the audience an immersive experience, which explains the three Oscar wins for sound editing, mixing and film editing and multiple other nominations. There are enough moments throughout the film to get your heart racing that are truly genuine.Other achievements by Nolan in the film include the ability to develop many characters in such a short runtime. The audience gets to know Mr. Dawson and his son Peter (Mark Rylance and Tom Glynn-Carney), who heroically race to save soldiers on their personal boat, as well as British soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and fighter pilots Farrier and Collins (Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) whose heroics collectively make a difference in the effort.'Dunkirk' will likely be remembered as one of the better efforts in this genre for years to come, and a large part of this is Nolan's application of film techniques that have worked for many of his previous projects.",8,1,2,3 June 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," It's no 'Harry Potter' but it still entertains
","We will never be able to capture moviegoers' excitement of, love for and connection with the 'Harry Potter' series, whether we're talking about the blockbusters or the books. This point should be understood in order to fully appreciate 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,' and even so, it's still hard not to compare it with its sibling series.To get it out of the way, it's true 'Beasts' has commonalities with 'Potter,' including the fact that the story comes from the pen of J.K. Rowling, takes place in the same universe (albeit a few generations earlier) and it's directed by David Yates (who also directed the final four 'Potter' films). But there is a lot more at the center of 'Beasts' than meets the eye.We're introduced to Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who arrives in New York City from London with a magical suitcase filled with...well...fantastic beasts. New York City has been under siege due to magical disturbances with notorious evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald at large, which gives rise to an anti-magic movement that forces the American magic community underground. After a chance run-in with a 'No-Maj' (non-magical person/muggle) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and fellow magic person Tina (Katherine Waterston) in a bank, Newt and his newfound friends (along with Tina's flirty sister Queenie, played by Alison Sudol) are taken on a wild ride through 1920s NYC to capture escaped creatures while battling a sinister force in an 'obscurial.'Aside from the core cast, there are some other noteworthy castings in Colin Farrell as Graves, a high-ranking official from the American Magic Ministry, Carmen Ejogo as President Seraphina Picquery, Jon Voigt as a high-profile NYC banker and a bonus cameo from Johnny Depp himself. The cast are not the best part about 'Beasts,' though. The CGI has got an upgrade from the days of 'Deathly Hallows Part 2' in 2011, and the focus on all the crazy, creative creatures featured here makes this most apparent. Additionally, the score from James Newton Howard brings to life a lot of what takes place on screen.Again, it's not the best thing to come from the mind of J.K. Rowling, but 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is an exciting thrill ride through the magical world that we've come to know and love.",7,0,0,9 July 2017
The Conjuring 2," James Wan surprisingly avoids sophomore slump on 'Conjuring 2'
","There are few horror films that have exceeded expectations in the past 20 years. In fact, you can probably count them on two hands. Most people would put 2013's simple-yet-striking spookfest 'The Conjuring' in this list, so it's hard to imagine any follow-up effort coming close to it in terms of quality.Director James Wan clearly realized how important it was to live up to expectations, so he brought his A-game on 2016's 'The Conjuring 2,' which follows world-famous demonologists Ed and Lorraine as they investigate a media circus of a case of a haunted house in Enfield, England. While there's much criticism about the veracity of the story, and the level to which the Warrens were involved in the case, this doesn't change the quality of the film.In 'Conjuring,' we once again get to see Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (both of whom are modern-day scream kings/queens by this point) reprise their roles, and while there are a few other key actors who are key here, particularly Madison Wolfe as the young Janet Hodgson and Frances O'Connor as her mother, Peggy), it's really the 'Patrick and Vera show' once again. They both deliver strong performances and are the best part about the film. That said, as you would expect, the thrills and chills sent up audiences' spines are also key, and somehow the ones dished out in this film are on the same level as those in its predecessor. Sure, there are a lot of commonly used techniques like shaky cam, quick transitions, etc., but they are done so well here and do not feel cheap at all.Additionally, the soundtrack and sound effects really bring 'Conjuring' to life, as any haunted house movie would rely on. But the main reason this film lives up to expectations is because it has a strong script.

Avengers: Endgame," The thank-you note Marvel fans deserve
","It seems like just yesterday that Tony Stark built his suit in the desert caves of Afghanistan - an experience that set into motion an incredible chain reaction that forever changed superhero cinematic history. 11 years and 21 movies later, fans finally got the finale they deserved in 'Avengers: Endgame.'The Russo brothers already proved their abilities to craft masterpieces that balanced character development with humor and the sleek action sequences that are expected in the Marvel Comic Universe, most recently delivering the critically acclaimed 'Avengers: Infinity War.' In 'Endgame,' they again exceed expectations, as the film is filled with more easter eggs than most kids' Easter baskets - clear signs of appreciation for the fans. Sure, the film carries an ultra-long runtime (at 181 minutes), but this length is needed in order to tie up the multiple storylines, given the number of superheroes who must squeeze in some screen time in this extravaganza. To this point, it's rewarding to see so many avengers who haven't traditionally been given the spotlight in previous films the chance to shine. And some give unexpectedly memorable performances (here's looking at you, Wanda).As a whole, 'Endgame' is not quite on the level of 'Infinity War.' Despite the third act being the most satisfying, emotionally-charged segment in the entire franchise, the overall product doesn't quite have the same lustre as its predecessor. It's the 'Return of the Jedi' to 'Infinity War's 'Empire Strikes Back.' Still, there is nothing really worth criticizing about 'Endgame,' aside from a few plot holes and the fact that its existence means many people's childhoods/young adulthoods are coming to an end.Throughout the laughs, the gasps, the tears, the smiles, 'Avengers Endgame' proves to be the thank-you note that fans didn't even realize they'd be getting. Stan Lee would certainly be proud.",8,0,4,28 April 2019
The Pianist," Music is stronger than any weapon
","Traditional World War II-era films focus on the battlefields, whether in Europe or the Pacific. In 2002's 'The Pianist,' we instead see what it's like to live as a civilian under German occupation, focusing specifically on the story of a Polish Jew who must do everything he can to survive over the course of the later years during the war.'Pianist' is really made what it is by Adrien Brody, whose Oscar-winning performance earned much praise from critics and audiences alike. Brody portrays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist who plays on Poland's national radio broadcast. Close with his family, Szpilman eventually must learn to survive in the ghettos of Warsaw and beyond as he fights for his life against the Nazi forces. The story is a real one, which makes it that much more remarkable, but as powerful as it is on paper, it's a tough task to bring it to life onscreen. Fortunately, Brody is able to breathe life into the role, bringing the emotion and rawness needed to make it a respectful telling of the story.As a film itself, 'Pianist' doesn't feel lofty or overproduced. Instead, it accurately depicts the grittiness and horror of war, but still feels somewhat simple. The use of ambient sound over dialogue in long stretches of the film heightens the emotion and forces audiences to really pay attention to what they're seeing unfold on the screen. This is likely what helped Roman Polanski take home the Oscar for best director, despite his high profile personal issues. But the most powerful scene comes near the film's climax - a moment when Szpilman almost literally play for his life. This scene is by far the defining one in the film and will be remembered for years to come.'The Pianist' is a serious account of a dark part of history, but it tells a story that showcases how music can transcend parties, nationalities and allegiances.",8,0,0,18 November 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A Marvel film that hits all the emotions
","After 10 years of the current era of the Marvel universe, 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the beginning of the end for the stories of many of the characters we've grown attached to throughout multiple film entries. What else can you expect but a gargantuan cast that brings together nearly every single major superhero and supporting character?It's difficult to keep track of everyone in 'Infinity,' as different factions team up with each other, whether it's the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' crew splitting up with the likes of Thor and Doctor Strange or members of the original Avengers crew heading to Wakanda for a last stand of sorts to protect an infinity stone, everything is all over the map. But regardless of where our heroes are physically in the universe, they are united in their mission to defeat big bad guy Thanos before he can wipe out 50% of all living things in the universe.Despite the obvious bloating that 'Infinity' experiences, the film works very well. It feels as grand as it's billed, and lives up to the hype. There's plenty of material here, from the stylized action sequences we come to expect from Marvel fare to humorous banter between the old friends - and some new ones - when everyone crosses paths. In this sense, 'Infinity' feels more like a space opera than it does your typical superhero blockbuster. There's also an ominous tone that 'Infinity' takes on as it becomes clear that the situation is dire, and it's a hard pill to swallow when events transpire, including the final moments of the film that leave many breathless. One of the few criticisms of the film is that it moves too quickly - the story could have unfolded much better as a Netflix series, but of course the filmmakers did what was necessary to get it to an appropriate runtime.The Russo brothers deserve much credit for being able to tame this beast of a movie, and it's likely that 'Avengers: Endgame' will be a must see when it hits theaters in April.",8,0,4,22 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A classic Tarantino film...if there ever was one
","Once upon a time in Hollywood, there was a famed director who had a reputation for telling engaging, twisted, thought-provoking stories on the big screen. Quentin Tarantino has proven himself over and over again, through efforts like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Django Unchained' to 'Inglorious Basterds,' Tarantino surely knows how to pull off a great piece of cinema.In 'Hollywood,' Tarantino tells the story of a washed up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) as they navigate the landmines of the 1960s film industry and (unknowingly) become more deeply entangled in a sinister plot. As usual for a Tarantino film, the dialogue really carries the torch for everything else. The Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth quick-fire exchanges serve as the foundation for the entire film, and the constant barrage of witty one-liners do more to build up the story than they do to detract from it.The casting throughout 'Hollywood' is on point, with Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate and Bruce Dern as the cranky old film studio head George Spahn being two standouts. And given this film is about Hollywood, it would only make sense that there are a number of familiar faces from tinseltown, from the late Luke Perry and Damian Lewis to Dakota Fanning and Emile Hirsch. Each of these actors deliver in one way or another.But perhaps one of the most impressive aspects of 'Hollywood' is the way it bobs, weaves and otherwise maneuvers through dramatic sequences without feeling too heavy. Even in some of the most serious scenes, there is always a hint of sarcasm, irony or deadpan to keep things from feeling too jarring. It would be unfair to categorize 'Hollywood' as anything other than a drama, but as expected for a Tarantino film, it's not your typical Hollywood drama.'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' is going to get all the right attention and accolades in the runup to the Academy Awards nominations. Don't be surprised if it takes home more than a few golden statues.",8,0,2,23 December 2019
Get Out," Peele proves his versatility in 'Get Out'
","In 2017, Jordan Peele proved he's not a one-trick pony when it comes to his career. When not playing all kinds of various characters on his Comedy Central series 'Key & Peele,' he lately has starred in mostly lower-tiered comedy movies. Then came 'Get Out' - Universal and Blumhouse's terrifying psychological thriller that was written and directed by Peele. The film follows the story of a young couple who happen to be mixed race (Daniel Kaluuya as 'Chris' and Allison Williams as 'Rose') who take a weekend trip to visit her parents' estate in the country.What's expected about 'Get Out' is the major emphasis on race, as Rose's family (and extended family) is virtually entirely white, and their two hired support staff, Georgina and Walter (Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson), are black. As Chris begins to learn more about his girlfriend's family as he spends more time with them, he realizes things are not exactly what meets the eye. While some films mishandle the issue of race relations, 'Get Out' is written in a way that seems fair and doesn't spend too much time on stereotypes. But make no mistake - there is a lot more at play than race in this film.The themes of guilt and regret have a central role in 'Get Out,' including references to characters' pasts (especially with regard to Chris and his upbringing). What helps these feel authentic is the excellent character development and acting performances, not only by newcomers Kaluuya and Williams, but veteran actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are standouts as Rose's parents. They are complicated individuals and things become clearer as the film progresses, but they never lose their edge as we drift into 'the sunken place.' And then there's LilRel Howery, who portrays Chris' TSA agent friend Rod Williams. Rod's character is definitely the film's attempt at comic relief - and for the most part, he delivers without making things seem too cheesy or out of place.The only issue with 'Get Out' is the final third of the film, which seems to follow a typical formula. Despite the adrenaline rush that results, there are flashes of a 'seen it before' feeling in some of the final moments. Even so, this does not really take away from the overall effort.Based on the runaway success of 'Get Out,' it's likely Jordan Peele has a future in directing and writing rather than just offering up laughs.",7,18,35,1 January 2018
Aladdin," Not even a horrible Jafar casting can bring down 'Aladdin'
","Another year, another live action remake of a Disney classic. In fact, 2019 sees another three entries in the catalogue, from 'Dumbo' to 'The Lion King' and of course, 'Aladdin.' In Guy Ritchie's take on the 1992 animated classic, we get to see how the timeless story holds up after 27 years. And, not surprisingly, it holds up pretty wellWhile there was much to be skeptical about based on this take on 'Aladdin,' it actually delivers in a number of ways. For one, there are very few departures from the original. A lot of the action unfolds the way it's expected to, and there are nearly all of the familiar faces that you'd expect to see. The soundtrack is perhaps the highlight of the entire film, with most of the same showstoppers ('Friend Like Me,' 'Prince Ali,' 'A Whole New World') and a few new numbers thrown in, as well.But it's Will Smith's Genie who really steals the show. No, he can't hold a candle to Robin Williams' portrayal, but he clearly exceeds expectations and injects enough quick wit and wisecracks into the script. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott give great performances, and Nasim Pedrad shows she can make it on the big screen just as well as she can on the SNL stage. The one weak link, however, comes in Marwan Kenzari's Jafar. Talk about a horrible miscasting - Jafar is supposed to be a snappy, devious, crafty villain...perhaps Disney's greatest of all time. The declawing of Jafar is a travesty that never should have happened.But be this as it may, it's still worth taking a magic carpet ride to see 'Aladdin.'",7,0,5,27 May 2019
A Quiet Place," Krasinski proves he's got a lot to offer behind the camera, too
","The post-apocalyptic horror/thriller genre has been on a roll lately, and John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place' is a monster example of the success that can be achieved with a small budget. The spring 2018 release proved that a semi-gimmick (majority of the film lacking spoken dialogue) can grab attention, but when a film resonates with an audience, it really resonates.'Quiet' is able to make a lot of noise in the absence of chit-chat. There's no denying the eeriness that results from the environment that has been established thanks to alien invaders with ultra-sensitive hearing. In fact, the role that sound editing plays in the film is breathtaking. It should have won the Academy Award for this. And think of the cast - think of how challenging it is to act when you pretty much need to be silent the whole time.Aside from the whole no/low volume thing, 'Quiet' is different, but it's not that different. Low budgets usually mean we're stuck more or less in one area, so there's not a whole lot of exploration to be found. There are also moments where it feels like you're watching a high-end version of 'The Walking Dead,' or even 'Bird Box.' And then there's the 'bathtub scene'...yeah, no.Despite its flaws, 'A Quiet Place' deserves a lot of recognition for its ingenuity and for being a hit with audiences.",7,0,0,14 April 2019
Cars 2," Back when Disney/Pixar drove off the road...
","The Disney/Pixar library has grown extensively since the debut of 'Toy Story' back in 1995. In 2011, we saw a follow up to one of the studios' least popular entries - 'Cars.' The sequel that no one asked for was, as expected, not good.The problem with 'Cars 2' is similar to the problem with the original - talking cars are just not as compelling as fish, toys or even monsters. It's like, 'so what, who cares?' Even with the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Michael Caine and Bonnie Hunt, it's not enough to make up for the overdone plot and the constant grating of Larry the Cable Guy's voice (why was Mater in almost every scene in this movie?).Sure, there's a nice message in here about being yourself, etc., but the wrapper that this principle is stuffed in is just not appealing whatsoever.'Cars 2' is perhaps one of the biggest clunkers from these animation studios' catalogue, which makes the fact that it yielded a three-quel very perplexing.",3,0,0,17 May 2020
Call Me by Your Name," Dry, depressing and drawn out
","Considered a frontrunner at the 2018 Academy Awards, Luca Guadagnino's 'Call Me By Your Name' gained attention as a story of 'young, forbidden love.'Propped up by a relative newcomer (Timothee Chalamet) and an otherwise generic mactor (Armie Hammer), 'Name' takes viewers through a summer of building tension in the Italian countryside, where the two leads form a bond while Hammer's Oliver boards with his professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his family to work between semesters. It's not long before Chalamet's Elio realizes his feelings for the college student, and not much longer before he realizes the feeling is mutual.While the plot is supposed to make for some form of scandal or controversy, 'Name' is more boring than anything. While the scenery is beautiful, as is the constant Italian that is spoken among the cast, and the music that weaves the scenes together (including some pretty impressive piano playing), there are plenty of shortcomings here. For one, the acting is stale. While Chalamet has a few scenes that are hard-hitting (the fireplace scene during the credits comes to mind), the dialogue between the two leads is not well written by any means. As for the long, droning soliloquy by Elio's father, Mr. Perlman, at the conclusion of the film - while the content is powerful and has a good message, the way it's written and delivered makes it more awkward than anything else.There are also too many instances where we're reminded that the producers did everything they could try to make it feel like the 80s...to the point where they tried too hard and it instead feels like a cheap, formulaic blast-from-the-past romantic foreign film.'Call Me By Your Name' made a lot of noise during its run, and clearly has found itself fans. But when you remove the outer apricot flesh to get to its core, it's a recycled story that is not as unique as some may think.",5,1,10,28 August 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," We're almost at this franchise's 'Apocalypse'
","Marvel's 'X-Men' series has never been a mega hit among moviegoers. There's definitely a core fanbase that appreciates the film adaptations of the comic book franchise, but as 'X-Men: Apocalypse' has proved, there comes a point when it feels like things are just being rehashed and the fire of originality has gone cold.In 'Apocalypse,' we see again the 'first class' (i.e. new kids on the block) of mutants (played again by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, etc.) as they take on the latest threat to mankind - an evil super-mutant named Apocalypse (portrayed by Oscar Isaac). The premise is straightforward - perhaps too straightforward - and so the plot is one of the weakest parts of 'Apocalypse.' It has a 'been there, seen that' kind of vibe, which is only acceptable in films that overcompensate in other areas.Unfortunately, 'Apocalypse' does not have this benefit. The acting is second-rate at best. While Fassbender naturally does the best job, a lot of this is based on how Magneto's character is written. It's surprising to see Lawrence's portrayal of Raven/Mystique feel like such an afterthought, but to be fair, she signed on to this franchise before she was the megastar that she is. The one other bright spot here is Sophie Turner, as she gives it her all in trying to convey the internal struggles Jean Grey faces.Everything else in 'Apocalypse' is forgettable or throwaway, similar to the previous installment - 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' From generic special effects to forced dialogue littered with cringeworthy one-liners, it's easy to see the well has run dry when it comes to creativity. While Bryan Singer has been at the helm for the majority of this franchise, it's time he folds up his director's chair and lets someone else take a turn.There's nothing special about 'X-Men: Apocalypse,' but then again, there hasn't been much special about this franchise for quite some time.",4,2,5,27 August 2017
Hidden Figures," Three inspirational stories brought to life in 'Hidden Figures'
","This year's crop of Academy Award-nominated films for 'Best Picture' was a crowded one that saw three films starring predominantly African-American casts. In 'Hidden Figures,' we get to see stories that have not previously been widely told about the important roles African-American women had in America's space race against the Soviet Union.In 'Figures,' we follow the challenges faced by three 'human computers' at NASA who fight their own personal battles for advancement amid the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement. Specifically, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) are profiled, as the exceptionally talented women make incremental strides toward better lives for their families. The film most notably revolves around the life of Johnson, who is a former prodigy-turned-math superstar. Johnson is called upon to become the first African-American to serve in NASA's Flight Research Division, which is monumental accomplishment in and of itself. But she joins at a time when the US is in the throes of the space race, which means it is constantly a high-pressure environment.There are a few things about 'Figures' that work well. In addition to the script itself and the acting performances, the film is based on a true story - and not in a loose way. Additionally, the relationship between the NASA department head (played by Kevin Costner) and Johnson is touching and shows how when the stakes are high in a situation, people can look past differences that might otherwise cloud their view of someone else. It helps that there are more stereotypical characters cast in 'Figures' as shown in performances from Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons, both of whom do respectable jobs. But what 'Figures' really does well is it does not take itself too seriously. Sure, there are plenty of tense and emotional scenes, but there are also a number of laughs that lighthearted moments that keep things from getting too dark and depressing.'Hidden Figures' is one of the most heartfelt underdog stories that hearkens back to films like 'Remember the Titans,' and is an example of how quality films based on powerful true stories can still find audiences in this day and age.",8,1,4,4 July 2017
1917," Mendes makes war look beautiful
","While it's usually history's second world war that gets the most attention from Hollywood, the original 'great war' gets thrown a bone once in a while. The Sam Mendes-conceived tale of risk, sacrifice, duty and honor that is '1917' is one that should be held on a pedestal as an example of what excellent filmmaking can bring us.To be fair, what really makes '1917' what it is is the masterful cinematography. Mendes uses the camera in ways that make the ugly horrors of war have a sense of beauty. There's not a single film in the genre, with perhaps the exception of 'Saving Private Ryan,' that brings the frontlines to the general audience in a way that puts them right there on the battlefield. We feel for Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) as they are tasked with the impossible mission of delivering a message to a regiment that could be a matter of life or death for thousands of young soldiers.The journey over the hills and trenches of war-torn Western Front is one that we are afraid to follow along with, but we must step up to the plate and grip our seats for the sake of those whose lives are at risk. This is exactly how we all feel while watching '1917,' and any film that can have this effect on viewers deserves all the accolades it can get.It may not have won best picture, but '1917' remains a landmark cinematic milestone for war stories that will be referenced for years to come for its ingenuity.",9,0,1,14 March 2020
Children of Men," Cuaron tells a story of hope born from fear
","Back when it was released, 'Children of Men' was a controversial concept and unlike many other films given the futuristic setting and dark subject matter (a dying, infertile world). Since its release, many other dystopian stories have been told through film with varying success. The reason why 'Men' works is because of one man - Alfonso Cuaron.Cuaron has proven over and over that his ability behind the camera has been appreciated, through Academy Awards for cinematography and directing, among others. In 'Men,' there are a number of aspects that are signatures of his, with the hallmark being a extended single-shot sequence that immerses the audience into the events on the screen. This kind of execution is not for novice directors, and Cuaron is able to pull it off flawlessly. But aside from the technical aspects, there is a difficult story at the center of 'Men.'As the leads, Clive Owen and Julianne Moore balance each other out in their time on the screen together. It's clear that Moore is the superior actor, as Owen is his usual wooden self, but they do a good job when paired. There are also some supporting performances from the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Caine that should be praised, with Caine taking on a role that is outside his usual buttoned up self. And Clare-Hope Ashitey portrays a woman who becomes a symbol of hope who must be protected at all costs.Despite the doom and gloom throughout the film, there are plenty of reasons to enjoy the storytelling that comes through 'Children of Men,' and it's likely it will be remembered as a cinematic achievement years from now.",7,0,0,21 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 'Jedi' is a far cry from Lucas' vision
","Few would question the notion that 'Star Wars' is the greatest story ever told in cinematic history. Even through the dark days of the prequel trilogy, fans still kept the faith, waiting for the continuation of the galaxy far, far away created by George Lucas.in 2015's 'The Force Awakens,' J.J. Abrams more or less did the franchise justice, as familiar faces crossed paths with the 'new generation' of torchbearers in what was an engaging plot. Despite some minor issues and plot holes here and there, fans were generally receptive to the film, and its box office performance is the best evidence of this. In setting aside the (far superior) film that is 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,' the saga continues in Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi,' which hit theaters in December 2017.If one thing is clear, it's the fact that 'Jedi' is much closer to 'Episode II: Attack of the Clones' than it is the masterpiece that is 'The Empire Strikes Back' when it comes to middle installments in the trilogies. A culprit that many are pointing to is Disney, which, for better or worse, has entrenched its influence following its acquisition of Lucasfilm. To say 'Jedi' has been 'Disneyfied' is pretty much spot-on, as it's clear the studio is trying to appeal to an important demographic - kids and teens. While 'Star Wars' has become a multi-generational part of our culture, it's difficult to cater to multiple audiences and satisfy everyone.To be sure, there are a lot of things to like about 'Jedi.' From the larger focus on Carrie Fisher's General Organa and Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker to the special effects that are consistent with what's to be expected in the franchise, it definitely feels like the film belongs in the 'Star Wars' universe. We are also reunited with the likes of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and the new 'it droid' (sorry, R2) BB-8. And John Williams' Despite a lot of elements that would normally make for a solid film, 'Jedi' suffers on multiple fronts.While dialogue has always been the weakest link in 'Star Wars' movies, it's downright painful here. It's not just 'plain bad,' like it usually is - it's been exchanged for one-liners that are not funny and cheapen scenes in a way that make them feel like they're written for kids. 'Star Wars' isn't supposed to be a comedy, but the screenwriters didn't seem to get the memo. There are also plenty of inconsistencies with other aspects of the 'Star Wars' universe - not that the average fan would pick up on these, but still bothersome to those who know the saga well.Additionally, Adam Driver has continued to underwhelm as Kylo Ren (aka new Darth Vader). The villain is not intimidating and comes off awkwardly in the majority of the scenes he's in. Lightsabers are also used in a very flippant way, and it seems as tho characters are squeezed into parts of the film that they shouldn't be - just for the sake of them appearing onscreen. There is also a point in the film that feels like a natural place to conclude the story - or at least leave it as a cliffhanger - but instead, things drag on for longer than they should.It's not the worst in the bunch, but 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is certainly one of the weakest installments in the franchise. Hopefully the quality of this film is not a harbinger of how things will conclude in Episode IX.",5,1,3,26 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," 'Guardians' go big, not home
","2014 was a crowded year for superhero films, and James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' emerged as the highest-grossing of them all. The unconventional film follows a bunch of intergalactic misfits who are forced to band together in order to survive a villainous pursuit of a weapon of mass destruction in the form of an orb.While 'Guardians' is a member of the Marvel family, it definitely is not your uncle's superhero movie. It might just be your grandfather's, though, based on the soundtrack of psychedelic 60's and 70's tunes that permeate the scenes of spacecraft, aliens and lasers - which makes for a creative juxtaposition. But perhaps the best part of the film is the camaraderie that develops between everyone - from Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the rag- tag bunch of Drax, Rocket and Groot (Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, respectively). It's great to see everyone's relationships change over the course of the film, as circumstances more or less bring them together.'Guardians' is not a groundbreaking film, per se, but it is different enough from our standard fare that it has a sense of originality, which works to its advantage. The dialogue is smart, funny and not totally idiotic, as it easily could have been. Even the special effects are what you would expect from a big budget blockbuster, so there are no real weak spots in what is an otherwise run-of-the- mill action-packed extravaganza.True - there are plenty of seemingly similar films out there to watch, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is an example of how to offer up something that can satisfy a diverse audience and appeal to all age groups while still being pretty entertaining.",7,1,2,4 July 2017
Silence," Scorsese's 'Silence' speaks volumes
","Martin Scorsese has been the mastermind behind some of cinema's greatest triumphs. While some have become pop culture institutions ('Taxi Driver,' 'Goodfellas,' 'The Departed'), others have not had nearly as much of an impact. 2016's 'Silence' falls into the latter camp, although this does not take away from the fact that it's a very well done film.In 'Silence,' we follow two Portuguese Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) as they travel through 17th century Japan in search of their mentor (Liam Neeson), who has gone MIA. While searching for him, the two priests try to spread Catholicism through missionary work - something that slowly tears the two apart, as the religion is under assault from the Japanese government.Scorsese's signature techniques are on full display here, From the meticulous cinematography - which earned an Academy Award nomination - to the use of symbolism and powerful dialogue, 'Silence' is almost a work of art. Between the raw emotion that comes through in Garfield's performance and the persecution that the Japanese common folk experience, there is a lot of pain and suffering to go around. But it's not all for naught. True, the themes at the heart of 'Silence' are dark, but the way the story unfolds on screen is something to be marveled at.Perhaps the biggest issue with 'Silence' is its runtime. At 161 minutes, the film is excruciatingly long. Some may argue this entire length is necessary in order to tell the complete story, but this really isn't the case. And while Scorsese is known for helming films with super long runtimes, sometimes this works better for certain films over others.While 'Silence' may not have been awarded with box office glory or Oscar gold, the film is one that will have a special place in Scorsese's catalogue.",8,0,1,28 January 2018
Logan," A worthy, respectable finale to a storied franchise
","Marvel's 'X-Men' universe has come a long way since its debut on the silver screen back in 2000. 17 years later, audiences get to experience 'Logan,' the final chapter in the franchise as we know it.In 'Logan,' we have a much darker, grittier story in which Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is faced with helping a young mutant (Dafne Keen) escape the anti-mutant strongholds of Mexico and the USA to Canada. In this sense, the film should not be considered a traditional superhero story, but instead a violent drama. There is much more of an emphasis on character development and dialogue as opposed to special effects and cheesy one-liners, as we see how the physical and emotional wear-and-tear that Logan has experienced over the years has finally taken its toll on him.In addition to Jackman and Keen, we get to see strong performances from Patrick Stewart reprising his role as the venerable Professor Charles Xavier and Boyd Holbrook as the bounty hunter Pierce. This core cast is enough of a foundation on which to build the rest of the film, and is a better way to create a more meaningful film compared with stretching screen time too thin in previous 'X-Men' offerings.There are also a few themes that are explored through 'Logan,' including perseverance, sacrifice and faith, which elevates the impact that the film has on audiences. Through all of these, it's really the metamorphosis that Logan undergoes as an individual based on the challenges he confronts that really puts an accent mark on the film.While it's bittersweet to see this franchise likely end, 'Logan' is a worthy, respectable finale that does enough to satisfy fans.",8,16,33,13 August 2017
Midsommar," The kind of horror that gives your mind a workout
","On the heels of the deeply disturbing 'Hereditary,' Ari Aster returns with the equally unsettling Nordic nightmare that is 2019's 'Midsommar.'Graphic. Gruesome. Trippy. Twisted. All adjectives that can be used to describe this film. The events that unfold throughout can be interpreted in many different ways, but at the center of everything is a fractured relationship between the two young American twentysomethings - Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor). Unfortunately, the fragile bond that ties them together is not much of a match for the centuries-old barbaric rituals that take place during their summer adventure in a remote village in northern Sweden.Seeing how the relationship between Dani and Christian weathers the storm during their stay on this compound is something that doesn't really register until after the credits roll. 'Midsommar' messes with your mind and makes you question how things got to the way they end up. How much of the storyline is impacted by outside factors, and how much of it originates from within? This is a question that is up for much debate.But among the drug-fueled highs and the depressing lows of 'Midsommar' is the frighteningly beautiful fantasyland in which the film is set. The natural wonder of the Swedish (or Utahan) landscape sets an incredibly stark contrast from the horrors carried out by those who inhabit the area, and the incredible cinematography warps things even further. Maybe it's the midnight sun, maybe it's the use of color. Perhaps it's the use of sound (or lack thereof). Whatever it is, it reaches out and grabs you, and doesn't let go.Before you are finally able to move on from the final 15 minutes of 'Midsommar,' you wonder why you just sat through it. But the more you think about it, the more you recognize the metaphors and themes woven into the script, the use of foreshadowing and visual cues. The film is heavy, yes, but in a weird way it's like abstract art. Some love it, many hate it, and others are still trying to figure it out.",7,6,8,1 February 2020
La La Land," Welcome to the Gosling & Stone show
","'La La Land' was the toast of the town this past Awards season, earning scores of nominations and six Academy Awards. But while critics loved the film to death, and most of the movie-going audience was cool with it, too, there's no denying that it's a schlockfest that's high on itself and its pretentiousness.Despite this, 'La La Land' clearly benefits from the vision of Damien Chazelle, who recognized an opportunity to bring back the musical genre in a way that hearkens back to films from decades ago. From the opening freeway sequence to the many impromptu song-and-dance moments scattered throughout, there's a lot of commotion going on. This musical whiplash might be interesting to some, but it can be very jarring for those who are not bonafide fans of the genre. Even though these musical numbers might seem somewhat all over the place, they are actually a useful device that help guide the audience through the story between two struggling Los Angeles transplants (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone). While annoying, 'City of Stars' is the song that acts as a needle that threads everything together.But yes, 'La La Land' is basically the Gosling & Stone show. Both are major stars in their own right, and together they do bring a good deal of chemistry to the screen. But when a film relies too heavily on its leads, it can have some weak spots in other areas. For 'La La Land,' this includes the fact that there's pretty much no supporting cast (John Legend's role is an elongated cameo) and there's really no 'there' there for a plot. Sure, the somewhat straightforward progression of the film is thrown for a loop in the climax, which is refreshing, but it's still not the mark of a first-rate film.'La La Land' may not have won best picture, but it won enough critical acclaim that was mostly based on what some were hoping the film could be, not what it actually was. It's not the worst thing to come out in 2016, but it's also far from the greatest.",5,2,3,12 August 2017
Snowden," Traitor or patriot, Snowden's story remains relevant
","Oliver Stone's storied career as a director is well known to many. Usually finding inspiration in subject matter that's within the political realm, he has a way of telling stories that usually end up causing a side of the aisle to get annoyed.In 'Snowden,' we get a behind the scenes look at the shaping of the man who would go on to become one of this country's most infamous whistleblowers. While Edward Snowden is viewed by many as a traitor, and others as a patriot, it's clear there was a major transformation that happened to the former CIA agent as he experienced various events that gave him pause due to privacy concerns. We get to see this evolution, from a young man whose faith in government could not be shaken to a skeptic who went to great lengths to expose an intricate network of spy games.While Joseph Gordon-Levitt has proven to be a fairly versatile actor to date, it's clear his resemblance to Snowden helped him get the part. Gordon-Levitt does a good job capturing his dry, shy demeanor, coming across as being authentic. There are also noteworthy performances from Shailene Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend from the other side of the tracks, as well as supporting actors Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto as the documentary filmmaker and investigative journalist duo who help Snowden tell his story to the world. In a dramatic thriller of this kind, these performances carry a lot of weight, and fortunately they are on point here.What Stone does well here is telling the story through a series of important events in Snowden's career that help setup the rationale for why he did what he did. Everything is laid out in a very linear manner, and it works well here. While 'Snowden' is not intended to be a 'Jason Bourne'-style spy thriller, it is entertaining and interesting all the same, and still as relevant today as it was five years ago when it actually happened.",7,0,0,22 July 2018
Don't Breathe," Proof that thrillers can be developed on the cheap
","The emergence of indie suspense-thrillers/horrors in the past few years has not gone unnoticed. And while Blumhouse Productions has virtually owned this genre of late, Screen Gems/Ghost House Pictures had a monster hit with 2016's low-budget 'Don't Breathe.'The premise is simple enough - three young burglars in the metro Detroit area decide to break into a decrepit home of a blind war veteran to steal $300K he was awarded in a settlement following the death of his daughter. What could go wrong here? Well, let's start with the fact that said blind man (Stephen Lang) has basically turned into a dog with a heightened sense of hearing and smell. Of course, things don't start out well for the three bandits (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto) and they don't get any better as things progress.The reason why 'Breathe' works is because it's so raw and it doesn't try to be some grandiose spectacle. The success of the film relies on the small cast, the setting (i.e., the house) and sound - or lack thereof. These basic elements are enough to captivate audiences when done correctly, and that's why 'Breathe' is what it is. There are enough scenes where you are on the edge of your seat because you know what will likely happen, but it's just a matter of how it will happen. The best part is, a lot of what's expected either doesn't materialize or the plot is a winding road that takes a while for things to actually play out.Sure, there are some part of 'Breathe' that feel a bit cliche. The foreshadowing/harkening back to moments noted earlier in the film, particularly those relevant to Rocky - the female bandit who is motivated to seek a better life for her and her little sister - are blatant and can be seen from a mile away. There are also plenty of 'Seriously?' moments that just seem ridiculous, but that's also what makes this film so interesting.'Don't Breathe' is proof that you don't need millions upon millions of dollars to create something edgy, smart and thrilling.",7,0,1,15 April 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Disney revisits a tale as old as time
","Tale as old as time, or in the case of 'Beauty and the Beast,' 1991. After 26 years, Disney breathed new life into the animated classic in the form of a live action musical that starred the likes of Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the famed beast.The latest in a string of live action conversions of 2D animated pictures, 'Beauty' is nearly a carbon copy of the fan favorite, from the same songs and dialogue to nearly identical scene selections. While this is kind of eerie in one respect, it's kind of cool and respectable to see Disney pay homage in this way.While Watson does a pretty good job, she does not exactly fit the part as well as a few other actresses probably could have (including Anna Kendrick or even Lily Collins). Still, she does a good job with her vocals and generally acting. Luke Evans is pretty spot-on as the boisterous Gaston, and Josh Gad adds a dose of humor as the dimwitted LeFou. For the rest of the cast, they are pretty much limited to being vocal actors, but still bring to life everyone from Cogsworth the clock (Ian McKellen) to Mrs. Potts (Emma Watson). And then there's Stevens as the prince-turned-beast himself, who fulfills the role quite nicely.In this version of 'Beauty,' we get a little bit more backstory, which is helpful when it comes to character development. And while the film is mostly a vehicle for musical numbers, it doesn't come off exclusively as a musical in the way other recent similar films have. And for a film that is so dependent on CGI, it doesn't come off this way visually. The French countryside and the enchanted castle look and feel authentic, which is not something that can be said about many similar films.Judging by its massive box office return and love among fans, it's fair to say 'Beauty and the Beast' is another example of why Disney will continue to give these stories a second wind. Expect 'Aladdin' and 'The Little Mermaid' to follow in the future.",7,1,1,4 July 2017
Sicario," Moral dilemmas abound in 'Sicario'
","The Mexican drug cartels that are responsible for a large part of drug trafficking across the United States' southern border and the FBI that is responsible for pursuing them are front and center in Denis Villeneuve's thriller 'Sicario.' The cat-and-mouse chase that is widely known by many but understood by few makes for an interesting plot, but it's really the politics, red tape and difficult decisions that need to be made that are explored in the film.In 'Sicario,' an up-and-coming FBI agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is summoned to support a multi-agency effort to weed out a kingpin drug lord on the El Jason border - an effort led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and a chameleonesque Mexican agent played by Benicio Del Toro. As the sting gets underway, Macer quickly learns things are not quite how they appear on the surface, and through the process she is tasked with acting on her principles or what others believe is the appropriate thing to do. This set of moral dilemmas is what increases the interest level in 'Sicario,' rather than the action sequences that dominate the screen time.The film's strengths are namely the screenplay, cinematography (including earning an Academy Award nomination) and acting performances, particularly when it comes to Blunt, Brolin and Del Toro. The tug-of-war between the dueling priorities among the U.S. team's side makes for an exciting premise from an acting standpoint, as there is a lot of tough talk and tense situations that must be navigated. There are plenty of twists and turns before we get to the climax, and it's fair to say the resolution will leave many questions among audiences.'Sicario' is the kind of thriller that will fly under the radar but still be held in high regard among fans of the genre.",7,0,3,4 July 2017
Les Misérables," Can't hear the people sing
","Can you hear the people sing? If not, try listening harder to 'Les Miserables.' Tom Hooper's take on the musical based on the Victor Hugo classic is a raucous, bloated Parisian behemoth that embraces its musical roots to its detriment.'Miserables' boasts an A-list cast and earned a best picture nomination in addition to others, but it's hard to see how it got there. Sure, Anne Hathaway isn't a half-bad singer (Russell Crowe, on the other hand...). And yes, there is some pretty awesome set design going on here. And sure, the numbers from the musical are magical, from 'I Dreamed a Dream' to 'One Day More,' but the way they are brought to life on the big screen feel lackluster at best.There's also just too much going on in this adaptation. Sure, it's hard to fit the story into an appropriate runtime, and you're never going to please anyone when you take on a classic like 'Miserables.' But Hooper probably could have decided to make a few different decisions in some areas.If you are a huge fan of the musical genre, you probably shouldn't skip 'Les Miserables.' If it's generally not your thing, you're going to be sorely disappointed.",4,0,3,3 May 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Second time's not the charm for 'Guardians'
","On the heels of the ultra-successful Disney/Marvel offering 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' the studios have followed up with another action/comedy slugfest in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' The film is not as original as the first, but it builds on a lot of the elements that fans loved - namely the characters themselves.Of course, we get to see the core group of Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) in action, and a few additional faces we recognize from the original get more screen time (especially Nebula and Yondu). We also get to know the biological father of Quill (played by Kurt Russell), who is a pretty gregarious character and serves as a foil for Quill himself. This father/son relationships is the primary focus of the film and helps elevate the story line to give it a bit more substance than a sequel of this kind normally would.While there are a lot of instances where we've 'seen this, seen that' littered throughout 'Vol 2,' especially the comedic banter between the crew and the crazy acrobatic CGI stunts, we get to see a little bit more character development here, which adds a nice balance compared to the first film. This includes the relationship between renegade sisters Gamora and Nebula, which is a case of sibling rivalry gone awry. Despite these improvements, it's fair to say 'Vol. 2' is basically on the same level as the predecessor. This includes the signature soundtrack that has defined the franchise.'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is not the best Marvel effort by a long shot, but it's a sign that there is a healthy pipeline of films in the works.",6,1,4,4 July 2017
The Shape of Water," If boredom were a shape, it would be the same shape as 'Water'
","There have been countless depictions of unusual friendships that turn into full-fledged relationships depicted on the silver screen over the years. Think of 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Her.' But the one that transpires in 2017's Academy Award-winning 'The Shape of Water' is something unlike we've ever seen, for better or worse (mostly for worse).At the core of 'Water' is the story of lonely mute Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) who works the night shift as a janitor at a secret government research facility. She befriends her colleague Zelda (perennial Oscar nominee Octavia Spencer) and the two stumble upon an amphibious creature that is held captive in the facility. Elisa quickly develops a friendship with said creature, and thus begins a quest to free him, which becomes a much bigger production than anticipated.While on the surface, this is a love story (an unorthodox one, at that), there's a lot going on in 'Water.' There's a sub-plot involving a spy game with KGB agents, which makes sense given the Cold War backdrop, but the true antagonist is the facility's director, Richard Strickland (played masterfully by Michael Shannon), who is out for blood and to weaponize the creature against the Soviets. But the main focus is on the creature, which is understandable given director Guillermo del Toro's fascination with monsters. It is well done, CGI-wise, but that doesn't mean the film as a whole is amazing. In fact, 'Water' is your typical critically acclaimed Oscar bait whose boredom masquerades as beauty.Sure, the use of water in this film is kind of intriguing, with one scene in particular coming to mind involving a flooded bathroom. But the plot is so odd and out there. This is a case where being different with a capital 'D' actually works against the film. It just exists - nothing to write home about, and surely not deserving of a best picture Oscar.'The Shape of Water' will not be remembered for years to come, and if it is, it will be for all the wrong reasons.",4,4,7,2 June 2018
The Witch," 'The Witch' proves low-budget scares are still possible
","It's rare these days that we see the hysteria and fear that gripped 17th century New England captured on the big screen, but the low-budget 'The Witch' does so in a way that is simple yet chilling.The story follows a devout family of seven who settle in the wilderness of Massachusetts just in time for things to fall apart. A series of unfortunate events ensue shortly after they take up residence, including the disappearance of the youngest family member (a baby boy), infighting among multiple family members and accusations of deceit and witchcraft. Of course, the latter is what drives the majority of the film, as the young children Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Granger and Lucas Dawson) accuse their eldest sister Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) of the act. Taylor-Joy dominates with her performance, which is not an easy feat considering the film is so depending on acting compared with other elements.One way 'Witch' succeeds is it is not overt or over the top in what it shows (at least, for the most part). Most of what gives the audience chills is not seen on screen, but it instead implied. Although, the use of devices such as the family's black billy goat is a creative way to send shivers down spines. Another aspect that works well is the gray scale filming style that's used. The coolness of the color used conveys the damp, dark atmosphere and harshness of the environment in an effective way.To be sure, there are a good deal of disturbing parts in 'Witch.' Some of the scenes are difficult to watch, but again, a lot more is hinted at than is actually shown. Near the film's finale, things unwind at a rapid rate, but this is the culmination of a slow build to the climax.'The Witch' is not a masterpiece, nor is it one of the more memorable films of its kind to come out in the past few years. But it's a good example of how low-budget efforts can find an audience and rival their much more sophisticated, pricey peers.",7,0,3,26 November 2017
Joker," Joaquin takes us to a twisted, dark fantasyland
","It's hard to think of a film released in the past year that has been more polarizing than Todd Phillips' 'Joker.' Some loved it, others didn't. But most appreciated the beauty of the dark exposÃ© on a symptom of society's ignorance of the mentally ill.'Joker' is nothing without its anti-hero lead, Joaquin Phoenix, who does what any true actor must do to get into the mindset of a poor, lost soul like Arthur Fleck. It's not just a physical transformation - which was impressive in and of itself given the actor's vulnerable, emaciated state - but it's an emotional downward spiral into oblivion that cannot be done without someone who has real acting chops. It's really no surprise this portrayal earned Phoenix a 'best actor' nod. He brings Fleck's inner demons out onto the table, devolving into the monster he becomes as each minute passes before our very eyes.Aside from the acting prowess on display, 'Joker' showcases how a DC property can come to life on screen without allowing the good guys to win. The film cuts against the grain - everything we thought we knew about a 'superhero' movie comes off the rails. It makes you think, too - who is worth rooting for in a situation like this? The grittiness makes everything that much more real, albeit not in a positive way.True, many feel conflicted about 'Joker.' On one hand, there is a 'sick to my stomach' feeling that's hard to shake, which we get based on the natural good that's deep within all of us. But on the other hand, the film can be considered a modern-day cinematic character masterpiece, and that's likely the kind of legacy the film will have.",8,0,2,14 March 2020
Kong: Skull Island," 'Kong' collapses under its own weight
","2005's 'King Kong' was a big budget blockbuster that was met with mixed reviews and arguably underperformed at the box office. Despite this lackluster track record, WB took a gamble with green lighting 2017's follow-up effort 'Kong: Skull Island.' While the film is equally bloated from a budget standpoint, it takes a step backward even further in terms of quality.'Skull Island' follows a somewhat intriguing premise of following monster chasers (John Goodman and Corey Hawkins) and a post-Vietnam military escort (headed up by trigger-happy Samuel L. Jackson) as they explore an uncharted island in the Pacific. On paper, this all sounds fine and good, but as we get deeper into the film, it's clear director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is presiding over just a tired old formula of 'pick them off one-by-one.' From an acting standpoint, the roles are written very stereotypically, so even though there are some strong actors cast (Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly), they are not done any favors. Whether an antiwar idealistic photo journalist, meek scientists or a jaded yet-adventure-hungry former British special opps agent, all of these characters are just wooden and hollow.As for the actual events of the film, there are a few scenes that are kind of new and different, but the vast majority feels like it's a rehash of many other films we've seen before, including 'Jurassic Park,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and others. Sure, it's pretty standard to see Hollywood recycle things here and there, but when the majority of a film feels like deja vu, that definitely works against it. As for the CGI, it's good but not spectacular, and so there are next to no good aspects of 'Skull Island.'Sure, there are some who will be entertained by 'Kong: Skull Island' due to its action sequences and formulaic flow. But that doesn't change the fact that it's pretty flawed and generally a mess of a movie.",3,1,2,12 August 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Branagh delivers on remaking a classic
","Another example of Hollywood trying to regenerate success through a remake, Kenneth Branagh directed and starred in 2017's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Although it opened to little fanfare, the film boasts an all-star cast and has a lot to offer audiences who've been waiting for a whodunit thriller to come along.On the surface, 'Express' is a sophisticatedly simple mystery that follows the world's greatest detective, straight talking Hercule Poirot (Branagh), as he takes an international steam engine from Istanbul en route to London to investigate a murder. While onboard the train, a number of things happen as Poirot meets many interesting people who appear to be cut from different cloths. But it's something rather shocking that puts the brakes on the extravagant trip (as the title suggests).The best aspect of 'Express' is without a doubt the plot. There are enough twists and turns to keep your attention, and it's fair to say the reveal at the end is one that's hard to see coming. But the cast comes in a close second, as we get to see strong performances from everyone from Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr. But veteran actors really steal the show, including Dame Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer and the aforementioned Branagh - there's really nothing to complain about - or find fault in. And it would be remiss not to acknowledge the amazing cinematography. From sweeping views of cities and landscapes to the use of the close quarters on the Orient Express, the camera work is worth noting.Sure, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is a remake, and as such it must overcome the challenge of not being the original. But Branagh manages to deliver in a genre that doesn't get much attention anymore.",7,2,5,25 November 2018
Parasite," Didn't deserve best picture, but still a wild ride
","The 2020 best picture winner is a sleeper hit that started to get some buzz last summer, translating positive word-of-mouth into Oscar gold in February. 'Parasite' may be the first foreign language film to win the honor, but it's fair to say it isn't the best foreign language film to make an impression on audiences.Still, there's no denying the cultural impact Bong Joon Ho's dark family thriller has had since making the rounds at film festivals and theater chains. The two families at the center of 'Parasite's plot deserve much credit for what they were able to deliver - a gripping thriller that also serves as a social commentary on modern South Korean society. Aside from the acting, the execution of the plot, filled with more twists and turns than you'd expect from a best picture honoree, is top-notch. And then there's the climax - talk about a series of events that were not expected. Understandably, this earned Ho a 'best original screenplay' award - and for that, 'Parasite' did deserve the recognition.While it is not the highest quality film released in the past year, 'Parasite' is a edge-of-your-seat, original effort that borrows some of the best elements from previous releases in the genre and takes things to another level.",7,1,2,14 March 2020
The Big Short," Stands tall as a tale of betting against the odds
","CDOs. Margins. AAA bonds. Finance doesn't usually present itself well on the big screen, unless there's a major dramatic angle to it. In Adam McKay's cleverly titled 'The Big Short,' we see the slow buildup to the 2008 housing market crisis, which we all know set off a global chain reaction of economic turmoil.At the center of it all is a band of renegade hedge fund managers and their network - from the eccentric Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to the seemingly reckless Michael Burry (Christian Bale) to the pompous, stereotypical Deutsche Bank prick (Ryan Gosling). It takes a little bit of crazy to bet against the American economy, but this crew somehow can see the forest through the trees.Aside from the remarkable true story, 'Short' is filmed in a way that it's almost a dark comedy. Interspersed with bits in which celebrities 'educate' viewers about market dynamics (whether it's Margot Robbie or Selena Gomez or the late Anthony Bourdain), the film is not afraid to be different, including multiple instances where actors break the fourth wall to react to the narration. All of this together results in an incredibly unique, smart film that earned its best picture nomination in 2015.Regardless of the way the chips fell in real life, 'The Big Short' stands tall as a commentary on the unchecked wall street greed that resulted in one of the biggest moments in history from the last 20 years.",7,0,0,11 May 2020
Halloween," Still feels original...even 40 years later
","Before the 10 follow-on entries in John Carpenter's classic slasher series there was the original low-budget 1978 film. Few films in the horror genre have had the impact that 'Halloween' has had - one that has transcended generations and is respected as something that is simple-yet-effective in offering up scares without needing to resort to obnoxious, in-your-face gore.It was 'Halloween' that launched the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, whose portrayal of innocent high school babysitter Laurie Strode was etched in cinematic history thanks in large part to her screaming ability and authenticity she brought to the role. The late 1970s was a period when this type of film really did not exist, so audiences were captured by everything from the chills-inducing opening score to the well done jumpscares (before they became cliched) and of course, Michael Myers. Donald Pleasence's Dr. Loomis is also a character who became synonymous with the Halloween holiday - the duo of Curtis and Pleasence is one that will likely stand the test of time.It may seem old, cheap and unsophisticated in this day and age of souped up, over stylized horror films, but the original 'Halloween' is a film that will forever be one that is credited with setting up the modern day horror film.",8,0,0,21 October 2018
Wonder Woman," DC meets expectations on 'Wonder Woman'
","The DC Comics universe is finally on an upswing after being repeatedly outdone by its Disney/Marvel Studios rival for years, with 'Wonder Woman' being the latest effort that has found an audience.Now the highest-grossing film directed by a female director (Patty Jenkins), 'Wonder Woman' is a powerhouse that is more a war film than it is a superhero one. After having been introduced to Gal Gadot's Diana Prince in 2016's 'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,' we get to see the Amazonian woman's origin story, from her upbringing on a secluded Mediterranean island to her direct impact on fighting the 'world to end all wars.' After rescuing a downed American spy (Chris Pine) and fighting off a wave of Germans, we get to see Gadot's character go through many experiences that change her life in a short period of time. As she's bent on defeating the god Ares, who she is convinced is behind the death and destruction ravaging the globe, Diana discovers her godlike powers and realizes how unique she really is.While Gadot is clearly the main attraction in 'Wonder Woman,' there are some strong supporting performances by the likes of Robin Wright (Antiope), Connie Nielsen (Hippolyta) and David Thewlis (Sir Patrick). Sure - there is something to be said about the inconsistent accents, but these are not as distracting as they could have been. Again, perhaps 'Wonder Woman's best attribute is that it is not over-the-top and is first and foremost an action-drama set in WWI-era Europe. Despite the serious backdrop, there's plenty of laughs to go around, as well, most of which revolve around Diana's unfamiliarity with the modern world.But everything about 'Wonder Woman,' from the way it was filmed to the special effects, is first-rate when compared with other films in the genre. There were plenty of critiques and high expectations to go around before its release, whether deserved or not, and it's good to see 'Wonder Woman' really lived up to the hype.If it had been poorly received, this could have been the nail in the coffin for the current DC Comics film series, but it appears 'Wonder Woman' was just the jolt that was needed.",9,12,27,4 July 2017
Marriage Story," Not a fun watch. At all.
","Despite the constant barrage of films that are meant to excite, bewilder and entertain, there will always be an appetite for those that feel gritty, real and make you use your brain. This is the case with 2019's Netflix drama 'Marriage Story.'In typical Noah Baumbach fashion, there's a lot to unpack here. 'Marriage' looks at the unraveling relationship between two middle class Hollywood types (Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and how they deal with raising a son during a divorce. Unfortunately, this strikes very close to home for many, which is partly why it has found an audience. Unlike the personal dynamics at play here, the plot is relatively straightforward. Just like the flight path between New York and LA (and back) - a typical one for this industry - we alternate back-and-forth like a ping pong match, with Johansson and Driver trading barbs and trying to one up each other around every corner.The real intention of 'Marriage' is to show off the acting capabilities of our leading and supporting cast. While Driver surprises, ScarJo comes off as forced and one-dimensional; the role of Nicole was written for someone who has much better range. And while Laura Dern dazzles as established divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw, she could be accused of rehashing her portrayal of the similarly cutthroat Renata Klein.'Marriage Story' is a long, downward spiral that may make you think, but it also leaves you feeling pretty depressed. Some argue that it's an amazing team performance that should be celebrated, but it's just not a fun watch. At all.",5,2,7,1 February 2020
The Queen," Mirren steals the show as 'The Queen'
","When thinking about which actress is tailor-made to play Great Britain's reigning head of state - Queen Elizabeth II - there is a very short list of names that one can put together. Chief among them is Helen Mirren, and the legendary actress got her chance to portray what is perhaps the role of a lifetime in 2006's 'The Queen.'The film looks behind the curtains of Buckingham and Balmoral to show the royal family's thought process and sparring with newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) in the hours and days following the tragic death of Princess Diana - 'the People's Princess.' This glimpse into a circle of people that is rarely possible is what many found to be the main draw in the best picture-nominated film, and while there is an all-star cast here (James Cromwell as Prince Philip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles), Mirren's first-rate delivery of Elizabeth II's calculating, cold demeanor during this period in her life is really what everyone is here for - and the Academy agreed, handing Mirren a gold statue for best performance by an actress in a leading role.While it's true that Mirren steals every scene she's in, Sheen's portrayal of Blair is also to be respected. The rivalry that forms between the two, including the divergence in the public's perception of them, is clearly evident, but as only the Brits can do, they disagree with class. Another element that makes 'The Queen' a powerful film is its soundtrack. Alexandre Desplat proves once again why he is a go-to for soundtracks of serious dramas.'The Queen' is another reminder that audiences are fascinated with royalty, and how a great film can be created by focusing on angle and side of a well-known event that few were aware of.",8,1,1,11 March 2018
Black Panther," Marvel's first visit to Wakanda sets the bar high
","There's no denying 2018's Marvel universe entry 'Black Panther' made a major statement and had a monumental impact on society. The first film to follow the story of a black superhero struck a chord with audiences not only because it of its historical qualities, but because it was an entertaining, fresh action-adventure ride that breathed new life into the aging franchise.At its core, 'Panther' follows a traditional hero narrative, following a somewhat unassuming leader from his rise to power to his fall from from grace and a nearly unsurmountable pathway to return to his position. We've seen this time after time in stories like 'The Lion King,' what makes it also work here is the fact that it has the 'Marvel touch' - a great cast, good special effects, enough humor to keep audiences laughing and tons of formulaic yet expected stylized fight scenes.While audiences first got to know T'Challa and Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) in 'Captain America: Civil War,' it's clear he was ready to step into the spotlight. T'Challa is likable thanks to his serious yet cool outlook and commitment to the people of his homeland, Wakanda, and the people he surrounds himself with are a great foil. From his feisty younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) to his love interest Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), he is in great company. Even those who are no fans of his, like outsider Eric Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) or frenemy W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) are effective in their roles. But the cast is nearly an endless sea of familiar, successful actors, from Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett to Sterling K. Brown and Martin Freeman.But acting is just a portion of why 'Panther' succeeds. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is the fact that it does not take itself too seriously. Don't get me wrong - this is no 'Deadpool' in the comedy department - but it strikes a near-perfect balance of sweet and salty. Also, the juxtaposition between poverty-stricken Oakland, CA, USA with the prosperous, hi-tech Wakanda, Africa does not go unnoticed. The natural beauty of the African setting is another element that helps set 'Panther' apart from other similar films.Sure, it's understandable why some may say this film is a bit overrated, given the somewhat unoriginal plot. But the plot is not usually the reason you go to see movies like this. It's all about the entertainment value, and 'Black Panther' delivers on this front.",7,0,1,30 May 2018
Mother!," An unintentionally hilarious embarrassment to cinema
","Darren Aronofsky has made quite a name for himself as a director, producer and writer. While he's struck oil a few times in his career ('Requiem for a Dream,' 'Black Swan'), he's also had his share of disappointments ('Noah,' 'The Fountain').But nothing has prepared us for his 2017 effort 'mother!' - an allegorical tale with more imagery, symbolism and smugness than anything in recent memory. The film is supposed to be commentary on the state of the world and how we humans have destroyed the Earth, and has fairly clear ties to stories from the Bible, which is supposed to make us feel repentant for our actions. Sure, okay, whatever. In reality, 'mother!' is an unintentionally hilarious embarrassment to cinema.This film is celebrated by some as art, but it's actually trash. Nearly the entire two-hour runtime is dedicated to following Jennifer Lawrence around an old destroyed house that is in a state of disrepair. We either get to see the back of her head or uncomfortably tight close-ups of her face, most of the time with a shocked, disturbed look. The only thing worse is when she says 'Stop! Don't do that! Get down from there!' two dozen or so times. Javier Bardem does not do much better in the acting department. The only one who brings their A-game is Michelle Pfeiffer, who embraces the destructive nature of the middle-aged woman she portrays as she makes a mockery of the isolated farmhouse.A key issue with 'mother!' is how it was mis-marketed. The film was supposed to be a psychological thriller, but there are next to no scenes that really fit this description. In fact, a good two-thirds of the movie are unintentionally funny, with Lawrence's wasted talents opening her up to being the butt of the joke. And amid all of the mass hysteria that the film devolves into, we're subjected to one of the most grotesque scenes ever depicted on screen. Again, some will say this is 'cinematic art,' but it's not. It's a messy, conflated virus.'mother!' was rightfully rejected by audiences. Hopefully its spectacular combustion is enough to put Aronofsky in his place so that he can go back to making high-quality films.",1,1,6,8 September 2018
The Greatest Showman," A show for the ages - and all ages
","As cinematic musicals experience a sort of renaissance, it can't be expected that every film will be equally beloved by critics and audiences alike. 'The Greatest Showman' is a prime example of this.The conflicted, unorthodox life story of one of this country's most prolific entertainers - P.T. Barnum - is set against a full soundtrack of rising numbers featuring full choruses and classic-meets-new age music. While the public - including families - more or less fell in love with this ensemble, leading to an over-performance at the box office, the Rotten Tomatoes crowd were less impressed.For one, 'Showman' features an identifiable pop culture icon (Barnum), bankable stars (Jackman, Efron, Williams, Zendaya) and catchy songs written by the same cast of characters responsible for the music in another crowd-pleaser, 'La La Land.' All of these elements make a film that can connect with audiences unlike more sophisticated, elaborate films. Sure, it can be argued that Barnum's life is simplified to the point that it almost feels as trivial as the beard on Keala Settle's bearded woman. But this isn't intended to be a biographical drama.Again, it's the music the is the glue that holds 'Showman' together. Kicking off with the energetic 'The Greatest Show' and ending on the rousing finale of 'From Now On,' there are plenty of hits in here that are enough to keep audiences humming along long after the curtains close. Perhaps the standout, though, is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of the operatic vocalist Jenny Lind, who's voiced by Loren Allred on the power ballad 'Never Enough,' which is sure to become a classic to be sung in singing competitions all over the world.Sure, 'The Greatest Showman' is a bit cheesy at times, and would be a shell of itself if it was not a musical. But the final result stands on its own as an impressive, memorable entry in the 20th Century Fox catalogue.",7,10,21,8 April 2018
Thor: The Dark World," 'Dark World' more of the same - with a weaker plot
","2013's follow-up to the Chris Hemsworth-starring Marvel film 'Thor' is one that didn't excite audiences the way other films in the genre have, and has become somewhat overlooked in the studio's library. It's true - 'Thor: The Dark World' was more or less a 'bridge' movie to get from the bigger hit that was 'Iron Man 3' to the superior 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' but it served its purpose.At the center of 'Dark World' is an ancient force called the Aether that takes hold of Thor's love interest Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). What ensues is a multidimensional cat-and-mouse chase in a race to save Jane and put an end to the destructive plans of an evil elf named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). So, pretty standard plot for a superhero movie, and much less interesting than the previous film's plot.While the 'Thor' franchise boasts some memorable characters who have good resumes, including Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Eric (Stellan Skarsgård) and Darcy (Kat Dennings), their performances in this sequel feel just like a continuation of the first movie - nothing new or special. This applies to the dialogue, as well - it's well written considering the genre, with enough cheekiness and wit to go around, but again, it's same old, same old.As per usual, the special effects are great. The world of Asgard comes to life through the CGI, as do the barren lands of 'the dark world' (which was aptly filmed in Iceland). But other than these elements, the film is fairly forgettable.'Thor: The Dark World' was a necessary entry in the Marvel film universe, and should be seen as a 'cross off the list' kind of movie, but it's not near the top of the list when it comes to quality.",6,0,1,24 December 2017
Life," Ironically titled 'Life' is a second-rate space thriller
","Daniel Espinosa's space thriller/horror effort 'Life' aims high on the creativity meter, as the film tries to recreate success achieved by a select few other films in the genre. Despite the intentions, the end result is a second-rate procedural thriller set in space that is closer to 'Apollo 18' than 'Alien' on the spectrum.'Life' starts out fairly innocuously, with a global six-person crew manning the International Space Station (ISS) on a mission to collect a sample collected from Mars in the hopes of finding some signs of living organisms. As expected, the crew finds a small single-celled organism (innocently named 'Calvin' by students back on Earth) that ends up growing to a point where...well...it becomes more of a liability than an accomplishment. From here, we witness the cat-and-mouse chase that takes place on (and around) the ISS as the crew tries to prevent further damage from the discovery.On paper, 'Life' should benefit from the A-list cast, which includes Ryan Reynolds as a 'guns blazing' American cowboy type, Jake Gyllenhaal as a more pragmatic, intellectual astronaut, Idris Elba as a dedicated scientist, Rebecca Ferguson as a CDC rep and Hiroyuki Sanada and Olga Dihovichnaya as experienced pilots. However, the script does not allow these actors to excel for various reasons, whether there are 'early exits' or the dialogue they're forced to recite is underwhelming. It's fair to say Ferguson does the best job with the hand she's dealt, but even so, it's not a memorable performance.But it's not just the script or the cast's fault. There are so many resemblances to other more superior films - whether 'Alien' or more recently, 'Gravity' - that 'Life' does not come off as all that original. While the special effects are good, they're about what you'd expect, and while there are interesting themes explored, including the purpose of life, the scenes that feature these feel like they were inserted jut to keep the film from feeling too much like a traditional 'murder by the numbers' horror movie. Finally, the 'saw this coming' finale does not do anything to help the film's cause.'Life' should have more accurately been called 'Death,' but that probably wouldn't have resonated with moviegoers quite as much.",4,0,1,9 July 2017
Annihilation," Could have been a sci-fi event film
","Natalie Portman has an impressively diverse filmography. From Amidala to Evey Hammond, she can pull off everything from friendly girl next door to badass chic. In 'Annihilation,' Portman aims more for the latter, but what could have been a promising sci-fi drama ends up getting bogged down in the swamplands of the panhandle where it's set.Clearly situated at the crossroads of dissatisfaction with her personal and professional lives, Portman's Lena is thrust into an experience she wouldn't wish upon her worst enemy. Ultimately, the warped scenarios she and a crew of outcasts (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson) come across are a mix of disturbing, fascinating and breathtaking. While 'Annihilation' suffers majorly in the character development department, it somehow makes up for this in the cinematography, art direction and what can only be described as a score that would have been birthed if '2001: A Space Odyssey' and '1984' got together.When the plot finally constructs (or deconstructs, depending on how you look at it), it's clear the limits of Alex Garland's vision are tested...and overstep their bounds. Cliffhanger ending be dashed, the execution was unevenly paced and messy - not in a Picasso way, either. Meanwhile, Portman and on-screen husband Oscar Isaac deliver zombie-like performances, with Jason Leigh coming off colder than her haunted Dr. Ventress should be. Thompson perhaps gives the best effort, but that's not saying much.It's true that 'Annihilation' could have been in the realm of an 'Arrival,' but those hopes will clearly never be realized.",5,2,5,3 March 2019
Her," There aren't many others like 'Her'
","In cinema, love stories usually involve two people, right? But what happens when a someone falls in love with their operating system? In 'Her,' we see the kind of drama that unfolds when this happens, as lonely writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) sparks a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), his new OS' personality (think of a more lifelike Amazon Echo/Alexa).As you can imagine, this atypical premise poses a few issues and prompts some questions that beg answers. How does it work? Is this really where we're headed as a society? Regardless, it's interesting to see how the relationship between the two of them evolves as a 'normal' one would. In typical Spike Jonze fashion, the film is amorphous, and anything but linear - which was supported by the fact that he was recognized at the 2014 Academy Awards for 'Best Original Screenplay.' The flashback scenes that help fill in the gaps are a helpful storytelling device, as we get to understand how Theodore can reach this fragile stage.There are also some great supporting performances, most notably Amy Adams as Theodore's friend...well...Amy, as she plays a role that's fairly different from many other dramatic ones she's better known for. Add a goofier-than-usual Chris Pratt and the voice of none other than Kristen Wiig as 'SexyKitten,' and you have a well-rounded cast that carries 'Her' well. The very fitting abstract, futuristic soundtrack also enhances the overall sentiment of the film.'Her' is part sci-fi, part romantic drama, part comedy. While this combo doesn't work for most films, Jonze is able to authentically bring it to life - no small feat.",7,0,0,29 July 2017
Me Before You," Claflin and Clarke waste their talents in 'Me Before You'
","Schlocky, sappy romantic dramas are a dime a dozen nowadays, and most of them follow a similar story line, just swapping out a few elements, circumstances and characters. In 'Me Before You,' we get to know the story of a young man named Will Trainer who loses his sense of freedom due to an accident that leaves him paralyzed (Sam Claflin), and a young unemployed woman named Lou who gets a job as his caretaker (Emilia Clarke).As expected, 'You' is as formulaic as they come. At the outset, Will and Lou are at odds with each other, but they soon begin to tolerate and then love each other, and then a wrench gets thrown into things before everything ends melodramatically. While that is the general flow of events, there is a hope that something about the film is differentiated from the rest of what we've seen before. Unfortunately, that is not the case.As solid as Claflin and Clarke have been in other work, they come across as hollow, wooden and appear to be less skilled actors than we all know they are. There are some supporting performances from Janet McTeer and Charles Dance that are okay, but they are nothing to really write home about. So, when the plot is below average and the acting is forgettable, it's hard for a film to be enjoyable unless there is are amazing visual effects, soundtrack, etc. While the best element of 'You' is its soundtrack, this is not enough to carry the film.If you like film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels (and this is not one of those, but it sure feels like one), then you will probably enjoy 'Me Before You.' If not, resist the temptation to give it a chance.",4,1,4,4 July 2017
Alien: Covenant," A far cry from 'Prometheus'
","The 'Alien' franchise has seen its share of ups and downs, from the first two installments earning their rightful place as cinematic classics to the clunkers that were 'Alien 3' and 'Alien: Resurrection' (we're not including either of the embarrassing AVPs). The series underwent a sort of rebirth in 2012's 'Prometheus,' which was directed by Ridley Scott and boasted a clever story and tasteful interpretation of the space-set saga. However, 2017's 'Alien: Covenant' appears to be another downward turn for the franchise.Picking up more than 10 years after the events of 'Prometheus,' we see what happens when the crew of the Covenant - who are on a colonization expedition - are sidetracked from their mission to inspect a nearby Earth-like planet due to a mysterious signal that's received. Of course, no film that has begun this way has ever led to a series of positive events, and 'Covenant' is no different. With the ship's captain (James Franco) dead from a freak accident, crew members ranging from Daniels (Catherine Waterston) and Oram (Billy Crudup) to Tennessee (Danny McBride) and Karine (Carmen Ejogo) descend upon the unknown planet to investigate. Quickly, things are revealed to be much more sinister than first thought.Where 'Covenant' differs from the superior 'Prometheus' is in its core underpinnings as a film - the latter is a smart, out of this world suspense thriller and the former is a space-set slasher 'murder by numbers' gorefest. Sure, there are plenty of similarities between the two, including Michael Fassbender's chillingly good portrayal of the cyborg David being a main draw. But 'Covenant' falls way short in terms of feeling fresh and exciting. Instead, it settles for cheap scares and the kinds of gags you'd expect to see in low-budget horror films. Even though there are plenty of interesting plot developments introduced in 'Covenant,' including questions about the origins of the classic xenomorph to the fate of Elizabeth Shaw, the film falls far short as a whole.Sure, the 'Alien' series is far from over. But in order for it to continue to go strong, whatever follows 'Alien: Covenant' must be a much improved film, or it could risk bringing an early end to the franchise.",4,2,3,31 March 2018
