The Blair Witch Project," Intriguing and different
","The Blair Witch Project is a very interesting film, and I've always struggled with how to rate this one. Technically the acting is bad and camera work is shoddy, but there's just something about it that makes it difficult to stop watching.Obviously it kicked off the now massive found-footage genre, and genuinely this is probably one of the better ones, the plot is fairly good and mysterious; and the location being set in a woods is spooky and fantastic. The surroundings and camera work make you feel as if you're actually there, experiencing every twig snap and the wind smack your face as you trudge on.So why do I rate it only 6/10? Because, unfortunately, it is very boring!! Especially on a second viewing, the 'Witch' never even bothers to show her face, and the scares are mostly left up to our imagination (not necessarily a bad thing), actually at times I see this film as art, other times I don't.6/10: Despite the relatively average rating of a 6, (due to bad acting and boredom), this is something you really need to watch and experience. So I 100% recommend giving it a try, you may love it or hate it, but it sure is an experience nonetheless!",6,2,3,5 June 2020
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Light fun and a good magical world
","Whilst not as good as Lord of the Rings this is a perfectly quaint children's fantasy film, the child actors are very good which is always a must for a decent family flick. The world of Narnia feels very real and just how I imagined it in the book, the sets in this are actually really good and the CGI is pretty nifty as well. The music whilst not fantastic is solid and the final battle scene is exciting too.It's fairly lengthy at almost 2 and a half hours long, but I was rarely bored and the acting held the story well enough together.8/10: Engaging for children and adults alike",8,0,0,15 June 2020
The Village," One of the weirdest and most misunderstood films ever created
","MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADThere's been a lot of divided opinion on this film, and I do actually understand why someone may not like it, it's not a horror film so don't go in expecting jumps at every corner and bucket falls of gore, nor is it a stereotypical 19th century thriller, the dialogue is all mixed up with modern-day English and 19th century dialect, but that's because the town is created in the idealistic image of the original designers and people who thought up the idea.Like Shutter Island I would argue that this is infinitely better on a second viewing when you see all the subtle hints that all is not conforming to the usual Victorian rural village life. On my first viewing I would only have given this a 6 or 7/10.The acting is beautiful and the three main characters played by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix and Adrian Brody is quite frankly Oscar worthy. Every shot is very subversive and surprisingly hands play a huge and abnormal part in this, in the forest each branch is snagging forward creakily as if it's a hand and in the scene where Joaquin's character is stabbed the angle the knife goes in and all four of their hands being in shot is unreal and tense. Also, the music by James Newton Howard is actually fantastic and one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard!Not all critics and people will love this film, and that's fine as everyone has a different view and I understand why this film may not be liked, read Roger Ebert's scathing review of it for example, and he's certainly no fool.9/10: Unique and worth two viewings if you've only seen it once",9,1,1,14 June 2020
Liar Liar," Moderately inventive comedy
","Jim Carrey plays a dirty Lawyer and a workaholic, who cares more about elevating his position and earning more money. It's an interesting premise and Carrey plays it really well.The plot is creative and I loved the idea of not being able to lie which set up some silly slapstick jokes which Carrey excels in.Plot-wise it's not the best and I didn't find it as funny as some of his other films, a lot of the jokes were quite repetitive and apart from Carrey in all honesty I didn't rate the acting very highly.6/10: A good, solid and inventive film. Others may enjoy it more than me",6,0,0,27 June 2020
Rango," Name's Rango
","A good animated film, I had never seen an animated western with animals before this. Johnny Depp is fantastic as always and the rest of the cast does a good job.Music is solid and whilst not up the standards of some older Western films like Good the bad and the ugly it's still quite good. I liked the actual cinematography of the film as well, how Rango and Beans stood out in almost every seen, compared to the drabness of the drabness of the town Rango is rather colourful.The plot is really interesting as well, with water being used as currency and the usual corrupt rich hoarding lots of it and not distributing it fairly.Action wise I thought it was average personally but a certain serpentine character was very well designed and thoroughly intimidating.7/10: Definitely deserves a watch, especially if you're interested in classic westernsEDIT: After consideration I have decided to bump this review up to an 8/10, as I think the genuinely interesting characters and animation make it deserving of higher",8,0,0,2 July 2020
