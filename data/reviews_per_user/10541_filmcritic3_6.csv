The Avengers," Alien Invasion thwarted by battling Super Heroes
","THE AVENGERS So, what's not to like? THE AVENGERS promised to be the biggest movie of the year, that is, until the release of THE DARK NIGHT RISES. It is. Mix four of the world's greatest superheroes with three of the world's best spies and assassins and pit them against an invading army from outer space, with some of the best SFX guys in the business, and how could you not have the popcorn movie of the year? This begs the question: How can mere mortals fight along side superheroes? The three in question are Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Director and writer Joss Whedon does a fine job incorporating these characters with those who have powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.Is there great acting? No. Doesn't have to be; none of the characters calls for it. Robert Downey, Jr. can do the wise-ass Tony Stark in his sleep. Mark Ruffalo does a credible job filling in for Edward Norton, but I keep thinking how much better Norton's sneer would have been as Bruce Banner. (Original reports issued from the Hollywood PR machine claimed Norton was holding out for too much money and really didn't want the role. After the spin died, my sources revealed Norton very much wanted to be in the film and reprise his role as The Hulk. The studio cut him out and put out a smear campaign against him, making him persona non grata. Rumors are Downey was afraid of being upstaged, but I find that hard to believe as Downey and Norton have both painted the town red, with aplomb, in the past.) Is there a superior story? No. The invading army coming through the time warp portal is too reminiscent of MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. I half expected to see Frank Langella riding one of the space carriages as Skeletor. The mechanical dragons harken back to the god-awful Hercules films, starring Lou Ferrigno (the original Hulk). And, there are enough continuity errors to scratch your head and cause you to anticipate the extended DVD version, which will certainly plug up the holes with deleted scenes.And, we couldn't have a Hollywood movie without putting a bit of an agenda, now, could we? Even the epitome of American Exceptionalism, Captain America, cites Americans as losers and avers the Stars and Stripes are tarnished. This is an obvious ploy to cater to the anti-American crowd that so loved the comic issue where Captain America lost his faith. It isn't necessary in this movie, and it adds a sub-plot that is never resolved. Thankfully, Nick Fury tells Cap: 'we need to believe in those things again'. Amen, brother. Amen.The stars of films like THE AVENGERS are the techs. They do a masterful job that is the sweetest of eye-candies. The film is shot in 3D and IMAX. It doesn't need it. There's no amazing 3D sequence, like there is in WRATH OF THE TITANS; so my advice is save a few bucks and see the movie in a regular theatre with standard projectors.Is it big? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Especially the scene where Loki tries to explain to the Hulk he is a god. Is it a great night out? Absolutely. Is it the film of the summer? Ah, no. I still think that will be THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.THE RATING FOR THE AVENGERS = A -30-",9,1,4,5 May 2012
Ted," Chock full of laughs
","Not since last year's THE FAMILY TREE has a comedy kept me laughing from beginning to end. TED does just that. I laughed loud and hard during Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut. TED is far and away the funniest movie I've seen this year. It's nasty, irreverent, unexpected and laugh out loud funny. MacFarlane is best known for his impertinent, sometimes sacrilegious animated 'Family Guy' cartoon series. He utilizes the same approach in TED. MacFarlane leaves no one or no topic unskewered. Jews, gays, Boston girls, drug users, grocer store managers, car rental businesses, liberals, conservatives, Christians, Indians, Muslims (especially Muslims), all feel Seth's wrath. A criticism against MacFarlane is his penchant for over playing the liberal and gay agenda. His characterization of Stewie on 'Family Guy' was receiving extremely poor reactions from the fan base and an alteration, though subtle, was instituted. MacFarlane's tone and attitude have mellowed slightly and more conservative mores are appearing in his scripts. Maybe this is because he's older and wiser, and maybe it's because he's been hanging around with talk radio host Rush Limbaugh. Who knows? The bottom line is the comedy is an equal opportunity laugh fest. The nefarious doper-slacker comedians can and should learn well from MacFarlane; you can make a funny movie with more than three bathroom humor gags repeated for 90 minutes.John Bennett, played by Mark Wahlberg, is the kid no one likes. The opening sequence sets his pathetic scenario during the annual beating of the neighborhood Jewish kid at Christmas time. Wahlberg is solid in this role. After a series of yo-yo like performances in action flicks, he dives into this part with relish. I've been rather critical of Marky Mark of late, but he's climbed up the ladder of impressiveness with his performance in TED.Mila Kunis is Lori Collins, John's girlfriend. She is rather nondescript in the part, but with her exotic looks, all she really has to do is make love to the camera with her deep swimming pool eyes. Of course, MacFarlane knows this well and doesn't waste time in mocking her appearance in the guise of sleaze ball boss Rex, played by Joel McHale ('you have that smoky, Baltic something lookÂ…?') In addition to an extended cameo by McHale, Ryan Reynolds, Sam Jones and the rest of the voice cast from 'Family Guy' all appear in TED. The only one missing is Jennifer Tilly. It's a shame; she would have fit nicely into this flick.MacFarlane is the voice for TED. Admittedly, there are times when he sounds too much like Peter Griffith, but most of the time the laughs compensate. The effects for TED are top notch. Credit Production Designer Stephen Lineweaver and Special Effects Supervisor Adam Bellao and his crew for bringing a teddy bear to life. It's a solid blend of puppetry and animation. KEY SCENES TO LOOK FOR: 1. THE HOTEL FIGHT SCENE 2. MEETING SAM JONES (FLASH) 3. NORA JONE'S DRESSING ROOMThere are numerous one-liners in TED. Like the old Peter Sellers comedies, they are so plentiful you will miss many of them while you are laughing at the initial one. This is a good thing, because it will enable you to pick up something new through repeated viewings.If I have one complaint, it's probably the pervasive drug use. It's the only running gag McFarland overplays. Perhaps if dopers weren't causing so much havoc in schools, in neighborhoods and on roadways they would be more amusing. Now, however, they are just wretched.Still, the concept of a young boys wish for his teddy bear to be real presents a plethora of mirth-provoking plights, and MacFarlane pokes most of them. As narrator Patrick Stewart says: 'There is nothing on Earth more powerful than a little boy's wish on Christmas Eve, except the Apache helicopter...'THE RATING FOR TED = B",8,7,19,28 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The epitome of excellence in film entertainment
","Famous writers, and some not so famous, will look at their works and immediately begin to rework and rewrite them. It is in their nature. Something can always be refined, always made more concise. Editors share a similar foible. This is the case with the latest incarnation of comic book fav, Spider-Man. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN is a much better telling of the web head's tale; a tighter script, a more eristic tale, and a more involved and inspired cast. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN is two and a half hours in length, but as I watched the advanced press screening, I was totally unaware of the passage of time; certainly an indication of a well-made film. This version of Spidey is definitely worth the price of admission and repeated viewings. It is one you will be able to watch numerous times and still cull entertainment from; a definite addition to your home video collection. As such, it wins the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2012, exemplifying excellence in film entertainment.Sometimes what is new is old again. Most of the superhero reboots return to a truer, if grizzlier version of the original comic tale. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN returns Peter Parker to high school, rather than college. Encountering Professor Cur Connors is therefore a bit of a story bend. The connection between Peter's parents and Sgt. Nick Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. organization is hinted at, opening doors for Spidey to cameo or co-star with either the X-Men or, more likely, The Avengers. Peter/Spidey is played by Andrew Garfield. He offers a passionate, modern approach to the character, but, again, this is his first outing. Tobey McGuire was solid in his first appearance as the Web-head, too. It wasn't until the sequels his contempt for the part was demonstrated. Emma Stone, sporting a coiffure of blonde tresses, is Gwen Stacey, Peter's first true love. Emma is more than another glitz of glamour on the Silver Screen. She also displays amazing acting prowess and a precocious understanding of the camera lens. In THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, she is a scene stealer.Also in the cast are Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors and Denis Leary as Captain George Stacey. Ifans is adequate in the role but his relationship with Peter is stilted; not from the acting, but rather a lull in the script. The original tales tell of a deep friendship between Connors and Peter, but Screenwriter James Vanderbilt doesn't reveal the rudiments of the friendship, save for an intellectual appreciation on the introductory level. Leary, on the other hand, is reduced to an extended cameo part. He is able, however, to portray Captain Stacey as a knowingly perceptive policeman and loving father. Finally, there is the Hitchcockian cameo by Stan Lee as the high school librarian, played in a collision montage for laughs.THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN has a few drawbacks. One major issue is the appearance of The Lizard. In the comics, The Lizard had large protruding jaws jammed with razor sharp teeth. In this incantation, there are no jaws, just a distorted scaly face. It's not as menacing. This version of The Lizard is also cleaver and calculating. I seem to remember when Connors transformed into The Lizard, he became savage and rather mindless. (If my memory is faulty, I'm sure the comic book fans will forward emails to point out the error of my aging recollections.) The rest of The Lizard is excellently done by Production Designer J. Michael Riva. It somewhat compensates for the lack of jaws.The other issue is one that plagues most superheroes. It's the egotistic desire of the lead actors to rip off the mask. In the last trilogy, Tobey McGuire made it a requirement. He was delusional enough to think his fans wanted to see him and not the superhero in full costume. Garfield is taking the same approach. Every major character in this story knows Parker is Spidey by the film's end. It makes the entire concept of a secret identity rather moot. The only sequence where the mask removal is viable and in character is when Spidey saves Jack, the little boy on the bridge. KEY SCENES TO LOOK FOR: 1. ON THE ROOFTOP WITH GWEN AFTER DINNER 2. THE SCHOOL BATTLE WITH LIZARD 3. FIRST ENCOUNTER ON THE BRIDGE 4. THE IMAX WEB TRAVELLING SCENES 5. THE JACKIE CHAN STYLE SUBWAY FIASCOI had the opportunity to see THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN in 3d IMAX. It's definitely worth it. The sequences of Spidey swinging through Manhattan are quite entertaining and effectively shot. Cinematographer John Schwartzman utilizes camera angles exceptionally well to compensate for any flaws in CGI. And, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Armstrong family. For years I have made it a point to highlight when Vic Armstrong is involved with a film. The iconic 1980's stuntman is now passing the torch as the entire Armstrong family is engaged in fight sequencing and stunts for this film. Daddy Vic serves as second unit director.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN has a conclusion, but leaves so many doors open Columbia Studios can really take this saga in any number of directions. There is the now obligatory added scene after the credits, so be sure to stay to the very end. All told, though, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a most noble reboot of the franchise, a great movie, and, at the risk of angering comic fanboys everywhere, a lot better than THE AVENGERS.THE RATING FOR THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN = A-30-Fiore Mastracci is host and producer of the award-winning Outtakes, soon to celebrate 500 shows.

Jurassic World," Dinos return to glory days
","JURASSIC WORLD I do so love when a movie series returns to its creative roots. JURASSIC PARK was an epic film, and then Spielberg and company found a way to destroy its flavor with two banal sequels. After a lengthy hiatus that included much soul-searching, and dumping Jack Horner, JURASSIC WORLD brings the franchise back to the wonderfulness of the original.I try to not watch trailers before I see a movie. Often, they are misleading. At best, the reveal too many key plot elements or scenes. Unfortunately, the trailers for JURASSIC WORLD permeated media in a major advertising campaign blitz. What I saw in the trailers alarmed me. Did I actually see Velociraptors work along side the film's protagonist Chris Pratt, as a unified force? It reminded me of ALIENS VS. PREDATOR, where viewers were force-fed the notion a petite black woman was the only human representative capable of defeating a horde of aliens by teaming with the creatures who hunt humans for sport. Please. The concept was idiotic, and though they tried to salvage the movie series with a follow-up, the initial theme essentially destroyed the franchise in the world of celluloid.The raptors, in the same frame with Pratt, are not friendly creatures. Luckily, there are no 'we are family' moments between species. I'll test your memory here, but think back to the second film in the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON series; THE REVENGE OF THE CREATURE. In the film, John Agar, experimenting on the intelligence of the gill-man, uses an electric prod to teach the word 'stop' to the Creature. Through Pavlovian testing, the Creature hesitates at the sound. It establishes a necessary reaction for the climatic scene. The raptors work much the same manner in JURASSIC WORLD. It is done well.Now, consider Jack Horner. After JURASSIC PARK, Horner attempted to garner his fifteen minutes of Andy Warhol fame and used rather sketchy paleontology findings to discredit the Tyrannosaurus Rex. He claimed the King of Dinosaurs was nothing but a mooching scavenger. Somehow, he convinced Spielberg to shift attention away from Rex. It was a bad move that culminated in a horrendous JURASSIC PARK 3, where a Spinosaurus, which in reality measured only 20 feet compared to T-rex's 50 feet, fights and defeats Rex. Horner's new Rex theories were dismantled by his peers and colleagues within a year. He is now in the café of scientific oblivion, sipping coffee with the two researchers who tried to convince us of global warming with a fabricated hockey stick graph model. Rex is back in full glory in JURASSIC WORLD. In fact, he received cheers and applause from the preview audience when he appeared on screen. They were louder than any reaction to superheroes.JURASSIC WORLD makes many references to the original, and basically ignores everything from the sequels. It is twenty years past John Hammond's disastrous attempt to bring dinosaurs to a theme park. In that time, technology has improved, enabling Hammond's dream to become reality. Thousands of people visit JURASSIC WORLD on a regular basis, but as with all things, dinosaurs become mundane with the public and the park must find new and exciting ways to keep ticket sales booming. Enter Indominus Rex, a genetically built dinosaur hybrid, meant to add an element of fear and terror to park visitors. BD Wong returns as Dr. Henry Wu, and is the culprit behind creation of the new Rex. He is reminiscent of Dr. Susan McCallister, played by Saffron Burrows, in DEEP BLUE SEA, who created superior sharks, but opted not to tell anyone about the enhances features.In keeping with the Spielberg tradition of constantly putting children in danger, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson star as Gray and Zach, who are visiting the park while their parents attempt to end their marital bliss. There can never be happy families anymore in films. It doesn't fit the template of a dysfunctional society, so loved by liberal Hollywood ideology. Entrusted to the care of their aunt, the boys naturally find a way to immerse themselves in park havoc, while they discover the bond that exists between brothers. Meanwhile, Auntie Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, while chasing the All American Woman Executive Dream, has the hots for Owen (Pratt), who is in this story what Robert Muldoon should have been in the first. All these subplots are secondary and just provide hurdles for a tale about a genetic freak, and the dinosaurs who hate him.Critics were able to see JURASSIC WORLD in 3D. It is worth it. The dinos, especially the raptor attacks, are superb. The dinos look great, thanks to Ed Verreaux's production design. Cinematography by John Schwartzman is excellent and provides several iconic moments sure to appear on posters and memes. Music, though featuring additional tunes by Michael Giacchino is basically variations on John Williams memorable score.All in all, JURASSIC WORLD brings the series back to where it belongs. You can watch the first one, skip the second and third, and jump straight to this one and have a better franchise. The movie is filled with dinosaurs and dinosaur action. It's worth repeated views and deserves a spot on your home video shelf. As such, it exemplifies excellence in film entertainment and captures the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2015. You'll like this one; it's a keeper.10/10",10,168,292,11 June 2015
Woman in Gold," Crucial film, so history does not repeat.
","WOMAN IN GOLD Ultimately, WOMAN IN GOLD is a film about the struggle of the little man against an overwhelming, ruling power. It is the antithesis of the adage 'you can't fight city hall'. These stories always play well with viewers, and WOMAN IN GOLD should not prove the exception to the rule. It is, after all, a story which needs to remain in our psyche, especially in times like these when an incompetent president and his administration and lackeys seem intent on history repeating.THE WOMAN IN GOLD is the story of Maria Altmann, played by Helen Mirren. She was a member of a prestigious family in Austria, before the invasion of the Nazis. Her home and family were destroyed and valuable art treasures stolen from their home. Now, as Austria recognizes its compliance in history with the Nazi movement, the government opts to hear cases for restitution for those WWII victims. Altmann wants her family's paintings returned, especially one of her aunt, with whom she shared a special friendship. Like most governments, however, Austria is not willing to release the paintings, claiming they are now the country's property and part of its historic culture. Faced with the prospect of challenging an entire government, coupled with museum curators and corrupt politicians, Altmann enlists the aide of her friend's son, Randol Schoenberg, played by Ryan Reynolds.It's quite easy to mock and jeer at Reynolds. Movie-goers hold him responsible for THE GREEN LANTERN, a better than average superhero film that somehow captured the ridicule of comic geeks. The same group is already condemning his turn as Deadpool in an upcoming X-Men adventure. Reynolds is suffering the same fate Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck suffered years back. Now, both are holding Oscars and McConaughey is driving a Lincoln and being parodied by Jim Carrey.Reynolds is fine in this film. He plays well off of Mirren. The story is, in essence, a tale of his coming of age in relation to his heritage. Like many Millennials, Schoenberg thinks the world began with his birthday. It takes a trip to Austria for him to discover the importance and significance of his birthright.WOMAN IN GOLD drags at times, making it seem longer than its actual length. Some scenes are repetitious. Surprisingly, others are stilted. This occurs due to remedial dialogue, penned by Alexi Kaye Campbell. Luckily, Reynolds and Mirren are quality actors and able to salvage the scenes.The past six years produced a paradigm shift in culturally accepted indignation. As the Obama Regime consistently turns its back on Israel and promotes anti-Semitism, Holocaust themed tomes are deemed trivial; an obsession by those forever living in the past. Meanwhile, films on slavery and black oppression are elevated to royal status, with private screenings in the White House mandated. America's first black president, second if you believe Bill Clinton, made race relations prominent and the Holocaust insignificant. Look at the films released in the last six years as evidence.Still, at a time when several Middle East countries and militias are stating their mission to eradicate Israel from the globe and further seek the destruction of America, for it is in their eyes, the Great Satan, the lessons of the Holocaust must not be forgotten. Films like WOMAN IN GOLD should help keep the memories alive. History is repeating itself. Muslim leaders are spewing the same rhetoric as Hitler once did, and our current leadership is all too willing to support them. It is akin to Roosevelt and Churchill siding with the Nazis.WOMAN IN GOLD could have more of an impact, with better seamless transitions between segments and stronger scripting; however, the film is salvaged by the power of its stars and their ability to elevate mediocre material. The film is crucial to see for a reminder of what happened in the past and the ability to have the jurisprudence not to let it happen again today.",7,5,12,5 April 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," DARK KNIGHT could be best picture of year.
","THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is an excellent movie; superior script, strong characterizations, solid cinematography and augmenting action. It's just not a particularly strong Batman movie.Chris Nolan is a celluloid genius. He has managed to appease practically everyone in his Batman swan song. He needed to satisfy cast and crew, he needed to wrap his trilogy up in a convincing, yet final manner, and he needed to ensure the relative calm of the comic fans and more fanatical fan boys. He has accomplished all three.First, there's the saga of star Christian Bale and the Batman suit. Bale has a problem with claustrophobia, and the Batman suite has caused him fits throughout the trilogy. In THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, which runs nearly three hours, he is actually in the costume about 20 minutes. That's good for Bale, but not so good for Batman fans. Series regulars return as well, including Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. They both offer outstanding performances, but Caine's is exceptional. It very well could garner him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Nolan said repeatedly THE DARK KNIGHT RISES was his last oeuvre with the character and the series. He brings the story to a definitive end, but leaves a door open for anyone foolish enough to try to follow his act. Bale also said he would quit when Nolan did. This allows Nolan to write in a darker Batman element. Ever since Frank Miller's Batman tome 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns', many fan boys wanted to see an edgier Caped Crusader on film. Knowing Bale was bailing, Nolan scripts a battered and bruised hero, silent in Gotham for eight years and demonstrating the injuries and traumas of a life of fighting crime. This should appease the Miller devotees. While the legend of Batman may continue, it will definitely not be in the guise of Bale.While Bane, played by Tom Hardy, is credited in the comics with breaking Batman's back and putting him out of commission, the character was weak; a runt with an attitude, juiced up on a super serum called venom, to monstrous proportions. Nolan has completely reinvented Bane, for the better. He is a mercenary, quick and strong with ties to the League of Shadows and Batman's arch nemesis Ra's Al-Ghul. Several other comic and fan boy elements are brought to closure as well. Did Jim Gordon know Batman's identity? Did Batman and Catwoman have a tumultuous love affair? And, what about Talia, daughter of Ra's Al Ghul? All of these questions, long debated in print form, are brought to closure in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. There's a political undertone that is alarming in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, preach the true Communist manifesto as they plot a rebellion against Gotham, designed to take from the wealthy and give to everyone else. Their speeches sound as if they were purloined from the ranting of President Barrack Hussein Obama and others of his ilk. 'No one got were they're at alone.' 'If you built a successful business, you didn't do it on your own. Someone helped you.' These troubling Communist mantras fill today's headlines promoting envy and jealousy in the social classes, and they are even more troubling when spewed by Bane and not a slickster in a suit on Pennsylvania Avenue.The world Bane creates with his rebellion is not the land flowing with milk and honey that was promised; just as Obama's platitudes sound utopian, but will surely turn America into a socialist third world nation. Perhaps this is Nolan's way of suggesting everyone vote in November to ensure Obama is limited to one term, as we, unfortunately, do not have a Dark Knight to bail us out. One can only hope the message is received.The scenes shot in Pittsburgh are a distraction. The first time you see the film, be prepared to have a selection of goobers scream and yell every time a familiar landmark or local personality flashes on screen. Some folks just don't go out too often. The recognition factor also hinders the augmenting action sequences. Nolan orchestrates the action scenes like a conductor creating a full crescendo. While the tension is building, a familiar spot pops on screen and the brain switches into recognition mode, momentarily halting the crescendo.THE TRILOGY Nolan wraps up all loose ends in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. What started as one man's search for the meaning of his life ends with the discovery of what he sought.So, with the stars, cast and crew happy, the producers happy, the comic and fan boys happy, Nolan has scored the natural hat trick. He bows from the trilogy with a complete, stand alone tale, much like Bryan Singer did with The X-Men, though this story is quite a bit darker.I originally gave BATMAN BEGINS an 8/10 rating. THE DARK KNIGHT, which I still think is one of the best films ever made, I gave a 15/10. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES easily earns a 10/10 and as such is the winner of the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2012. This means it is the epitome of film as entertainment. Three movies, with an overall rating of 33/30, I'd say Nolan has made his mark and it is one that surely will not be challenged for quite some time.But while it accomplishes all these things and does so in style, it's not what one expects from a Batman movie. Our hero is tarnished, worn out, his life destroyed, his fortune lost and his friends and family alienated. He has no option but to pass the torch. It's an uncomfortable way to end a Batman story.THE RATING FOR THE DARK KNIGHT RISES = A -30-",10,3,9,19 July 2012
