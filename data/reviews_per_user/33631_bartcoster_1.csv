Blade Runner 2049," How science fiction movies should be
","I think this is one of the few times in movie history when scifi is not an excuse to make the action scenes really cool. It actually serves a purpose, to raise interesting questions, such as: what does it mean to be human? There is action in this movie, but it is certainly not the main part of the movie (but it IS done quite well). I would have given it a 10, if not for the annoying and intrusive product placement.
