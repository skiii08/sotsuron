Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Are you braindead?..this movie rocks!
","It seems either you hate this movie, or you love it. I think it all boils down to what you expect when watching it. If you expect a Star Wars movie with its action sequences, light saber battles, epic storyline, slow story-advancing moments and a mighty John Williams soundtrack, this is gonna be the movie of the year. But if you expect the second coming, the answer to everything, and a divine experience that will change your life, don't look for it in a movie theater, cause you just won't find it there, not with this movie, not ever.Phantom Menace rocks as a movie, but fails as a miracle.",10,4,8,10 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Excellent...I don't get it..what's there not to like??
","I have yet to be let down by a Star Wars movie. I thought Phantom Menaced rocked, and I think this one rocks as well. What's there not to like? Anakin is portrayed elegantly as the arrogant, inpatient student who has far to much power for his own good. Obi-Wan is the wiser Jedi Knight who struggles to keep his student in leash. Jango Fett is totally awesome and by the end of the movie you totally believe that Boba would follow in his footsteps. Mace Windu finally gets to show why he's a Jedi Master, and Yoda..you just have to see for yourself. There are just so many cool scenes in this movie I don't have time to list them all. And you gotta love the details put into this one, like how Palpatine's skin is a lot paler than Ep1 and his half-built HQ looks like the one seen in the TIE Fighter PC game. Again...what's there not to like?",10,0,1,13 October 2002
