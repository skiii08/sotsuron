The Blair Witch Project," One word - 'Huh?'
","Well all I can say is that I waited for this to come to pay per view. I should have kept waiting. BORING. And the end. Ok. Did they just get tired of shooting and say, let's end it here? I just sat there and said, 'huh?' Is that it? I was left waiting for the scary part to happen. Maybe it came after the credits. I hope so, cause I didn't see it in the movie.",Null,1,2,10 December 1999
