United 93," Greengrass takes you for a ride on United 93
","From the first scene to the last, Paul Greengrass is faithful to his minimalist presentation of United flight 93. He avoided every wrong turn and I left the theater having flown on United 93 and amazed that I was still alive. There were many brilliant methods built into the making of the movie. To name just three: combining actors with real characters portraying themselves, employing a close-as-possible real-time time-line (Real-time Terror, 01 April 2006, Film Journal) and keeping the actors portraying the terrorists apart from the rest of the cast during rehearsals and until filming (Interview with Lloyd Levin, 28 April 2006, The Michael Medved Show). For those who think the movie comes too soon, the passing of time will not grant you more comfort to watch this film. The ending won't change.",10,2,6,29 April 2006
