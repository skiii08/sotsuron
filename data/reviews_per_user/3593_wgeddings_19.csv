Iron Man 3," Reviewers miss the point. This really is a great movie!
","I was stunned to see all the negative reviews for this movie. I avoided the reviews and spoilers and couldn't wait to see it since I have loved the Marvel movies so far and knew they were starting 'phase 2'. This movie really plays well off of the events in the Avengers without really relying on that movie. Tony has anxiety worrying he might fail, worrying that he is not able to protect Pepper now that he has someone he cares for more than himself and basically afraid that he cannot be good enough. Big difference from the swaggering Tony but he tries to keep up the swagger act. Normally previews spoil surprises in the movie but I was very happy that here, the scenes shown in the previews were good and in the movie but in the course of the movie they actually played out differently than you would guess from the previews. For example, in the trailers/previews I thought several sequences took place well outside of the US but that was not the case. The previews did not spoil anything. The plot was clear and fun. It took turns and was interesting. I have no idea how others think it was stupid and wonder if they actually saw the movie. People complain about the child and call him a sidekick or make fun of the hostage part. I found him to be a great addition and an effective way to further the story. The 'hostage' thing with the kid was very minor and furthered the story in important ways. Far from being a silly plot device, I found it to be a smooth addition. As for the comments about the Mandarin, things are not always what they appear. The movie was pretty clear about that over and over yet the plot twist involving him is something the naysayers take on faith. Marvel is starting phase 2 with this movie. Would the Mandarin twist fit into that or do you think there might be a lot more to it than was clearly apparent? Would Marvel have referred to him in the prior movies and put so much into the 'ten rings' only to have it end like this? Viewers should ask themselves if Marvel would so misinterpret one of their major villains or would they just make people think that had to reveal more in a later movie?As you watch the effects of the Extremis drug, see if your mind immediately goes to the Red Hulk? Could the Extremis effect be a springboard for characters in later movies? Better yet, how can it not? I believe Marvel has shown that if we trust them a little, that trust will pay off. The naysayers are like fans who see the other team score first and just leave convinced that their team has lost. Yes, parts of the movie can be viewed as odd but don't most stories rely on creating a challenge for the heroes? I believe this is what we see here. It is a great movie that leaves some odd questions but I believe they will be answered soon enough",10,8,20,4 May 2013
The Hunger Games," Did not live up to the hype
","Maybe it was just that my expectations were too high but I was disappointed. The story was not all that novel but since the main audience for the book was young adult, it probably was new to them. For the movie it may be the same. The authoritarian nature of Animal Farm and Fahrenheit 451 as well as others and the gaming best done in The Running Man. I have not read the book but my daughter did and explained many things the movie glossed over or omitted. I believe reading the book before watching might have made some things better. The acting overall was nothing special and I hated that Elizabeth Banks was almost unrecognizable under all her make up. Lenny Kravitz was the exception and did great in his role. The use of shaky cam and close ups during fight scenes was distracting and a trend I intensely dislike. The costumes and colors were evidence that apparently in the future leisure suits would have returned as all the rage. I wish I had waited to watch this on DVD",6,2,6,7 April 2012
Spider-Man 2," As good as it could be - I'm satisfied
","Like many other people (and you if you are reading this), I read a lot about Spiderman 2 before I went to see it.  I had heard so much hype about how it was the best comic movie and was even better than the first Spiderman (which I thoroughly enjoyed).  Thankfully, there were some calming notes too about not expecting too much so I was trying to damp down my excitement.  I had heard a few comments about pacing complaints and sappy speeches, etc. 
Let me start by saying that I was an avid comic collector in the late 70's and early 80s.  Since then I have not kept up with comic books but I have always loved those heroes and been anxious for the movies.  Batman and Superman movies got really bad, even for me, so I was thrilled when the first Spiderman came out and was so true to the legend (organic webshooters notwithstanding and acceptable).  THAT was what a comic movie should be! Then the rollercoaster of Daredevil (so-so), X2 (real good), Hulk (what were they smoking?), Hellboy (entertaining), LXG (okay) and such showed a tendency to want to change from the comic formula.  Comics ARE sappy.  They have speeches.  They have to tell a story in an oddly paced type of way. When the action happens, it has to be dramatic.  When characters are just interacting without action, you have to make it a little sappy to get the points across quickly.  So I prefer a comic movie similar to that.
Spidey2 is like that.  The pacing was great as far as I am concerned.  The action was indeed very incredible although I was a little disappointed the 'big' fight comes in an early meeting between Spidey & Doc Ock rather than in their final meeting.  I cannot imagine anyone playing a better Spiderman/Peter Parker than Tobey M.  Even though he has some scenes as Spidey without his mask (thus showing his face), he conveys the right feelings and is just right as either character.  I cannot imagine anyone better at Doc Ock than Alfred Molina.  He just nails it and the tentacles are so realistic and sinister (as well as the 'fact' that the tentacles each have AI so after the accident, they twist and influence Doc's own thoughts) that it was believable.  In the comics and cartoons, I never liked the tentacles as much as I liked them in this movie.  And as for J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, it is impossible to overstate who incredible he is in making that character come to life.  Finally, I am not a big Sam Raimi fan (don't care either way about him) but in both Spidey movies, he has stayed close to the comic, filmed it like a comic come to life and in my book that makes him incredible.  Now, my concerns or negative comments.  I think Spidey was a little too free with revealing his secret identity in this one.  My other disappointment was the emphasis on Harry and his discovery at the end.  No shock since it has been mentioned and spoiled a lot but I find it hard to believe that they would have him as the villian in the next film.  Awfully early to start repeating.  At least there is a chance Doc Ock can come back since it did not show him dead.  I won't mention what it did show.  Also, I was surprised that Aunt May did not have a heart-attack.  She had one practically every storyline in the comics and it got to be almost a tired jokes.  In this movie, she was very good and showed both frailty and strength in just the right measure I thought. Well, as you can guess, I did thoroughly enjoy the movie and rated it accordingly.  I do believe it was as good as the original and I only wish all comic book movies were made like this.  Maybe then, we would not have to sit through movies like the Hulk and such where they 're-invent' away everything that makes it a good story or focus on the love stories, social issues, etc. rather than treat it like a comic book story.  Comic book characters are popular for a reason, don't monkey with it.  Lance Armstrong rides a bicycle and, like in the commercials, to see him in a boxing ring would be silly.  I wish filmmakers would remember that and keep comic book movies like comic book stories. In the words of Stan 'The Man' Lee - Nuff Said.",10,0,0,1 July 2004
Watchmen," Great work and fast pace but be prepared to be unsure
","I am a sci-fi geek but never read the Watchmen graphic novel (GN) until I saw the trailer at the start of Dark Knight. I read a summary of the GN on wikipedia so I had a general idea what was going to happen and when I did read the GN, that foreknowledge made the GN even better, in my opinion. I remember at various chapters, I would pause and just have to 'digest' what I had read and the thoughts, ideas and concepts it involved. Especially thoughts of what makes a hero and what makes a villain. My point is that at the end of the GN, I knew I liked it but it would take a bit of pondering to really fully enjoy the experience of reading it. That is a rare and good feeling I think.The movie delivers that same feeling. Having read the GN, I knew what was coming, who various characters were, who would do what and it really did not lessen my enjoyment of the movie. I was amazed and impressed at how true to the GN the movie was. Everything is not exact but many minor differences are perfectly fine and fit the overall theme of the movie. Many other things are part of deleted scenes or stuff involving the 'Tales of the Black Freighter' comic which eventually will all be on a DVD in an ultimate cut that will last almost 3.5 hours. I was fine with that and the movie did not suffer with those elements deleted. It will be a great movie with them too but I understood the need for some deletions and agree with what was shown. After the movie, some applauded but many, like me, were quiet. Just as when I finished the GN, I knew I liked it but I also knew I would have to digest it a bit. I look forward to that.My son was with me and he had not read the GN so I was anxious to discuss many parts of it with him to see if he was confused. He said he liked it and in our discussions, it was obvious he followed the movie and the moral dilemmas it raises. The 2.6 hours passes very quickly.I cannot imagine any better adaptation of the GN. The casting was great but I agree with many other comments about the poor music in the film. Sometimes, it really distracted. Worst of all, the Smashing Pumpkins song 'Beginning is the end of the beginning' that was so wonderful in the first trailer was not featured in the actual movie. I really missed that.I strongly encourage you to see this movie, whether you have read spoilers, wikipedia, the graphic novel or have no idea what it is about. The best advice I can give though is to have someone with you because after it is over, you are going to want to discuss it to help you get your thoughts around some of the concepts.",10,1,6,6 March 2009
Man of Steel," Awful DC fluff
","I love most superhero movies. Movies done by Marvel has shown universal quality. DC movies were getting better and I liked Green Lantern, Dark Knight and Batman Begins. I really wanted to like this movie but it has several gaping holes that I just could not tolerate. There are spoilers so stop reading if you have not seen it. You were warned but there is no way for me to really comment on the problems without these points. First, the good stuff. I liked the overall story. I liked the actors for roles (although Lois Lane should have black hair but Amy Adams is hot so I can tolerate that). The 'fathers' (Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner) did very good and I liked Cavill as Superman. Costume was good. I liked that the Zod followers did not instantly have all of Superman's powers since he had had to learn to control the powers and taken years to master them. That felt right. With so much going for it, the problems had to be big and they were to me. First, Superman does not kill. EVER. I collected comics growing up and Superman was one of my favorites. Many issues revolved around him having to solve the problem without killing. It was one of his constants. Maybe the recent issues have changed him since i do not still collect and read the comics but for Superman to kill or knowingly let someone die is anathema. The scene with Jonathan Kent, I could handle because he was obeying his father. The scene with Zod I could not. Superman would have found another way. Period. Zod brings up another point. This is a GENERAL who was genetically engineered to be an ideal warrior and who trained his entire life. However, he spends the movie getting his butt kicked. First, a scientist kicks his butt handily. Maybe Jor-el's armor had enhancements or something so I will give that an 'eh' but then Kal-El whups him. Twice. Zod should have been able to eat Navy SEALs for breakfast but he cannot handle a scientist or farm boy? His second in command was a terrific fighter so it surprises me she did not kill him long ago if that is the best he can do. The actor playing him did well but c'mon, that is not a Zod that is a credible warrior. The movie cuts back and forth in flashbacks that were distracting rather than better in my opinion. The flashbacks were good but I wonder how the movie would have been if shown in a more linear fashion. Still, that is a personal preference and no reason to dislike the movie. The fight scenes seemed to go on forever and to be basically the idea that if they blow up and destroy enough stuff, everyone will forget the lame action. Remember in the old TV show how bad guys would empty their gun on Superman then throw the gun at him? I thought was going to happen at one point (which would have been funny) but that is how the fight scenes were. Who would think 'Well, I hit him with a steel beam and it did nothing so maybe if I slam him into concrete? Hmm, still nothing, I guess I should throw him into the concrete building? Hmm, still nothing, maybe I should drop the concrete on him?' At some point they should have realized 'HE IS INVULNERABLE, Concrete is not going to work'. Instead they level building after building after building. How many died in the buildings falling? Remember the Pixar movie 'The Incredibles' where superheroes were outlawed because of the amount of property damage they caused. Maybe this was intended as a prequel for that movie. Time after time in the movie an illogical or unrealistic (yes, I know it is a comic book movie but it can still have realism) event would take me out of the story. A movie that cannot keep me in it or that has fight sequences with such vast destruction which go on so long that I am just bored looking at the obvious CGI is a movie I wish I could have avoided. Most of all though, a movie that has Superman kill is not a Superman movie.",2,9,21,17 June 2013
District 9," Awful movie and I am disappointed
","This movie sounded good in theory. It sounded good in reviews. I love science fiction so the idea of aliens being stranded on earth and forced to live in ghettos seemed very interesting. I used to love the movie and television series Alien Nation, which had a similar theme. I was pumped and excited to see this movie. Sadly, it left the regular theater here before I got to see it so I had to wait for it to come to the $1.99 theater. At least that is good news because I only wasted $1.99 (and the required $9 for popcorn and a drink...).What is good? The special effects are very good and the action sequences are well done. I dislike an action sequence with too many fast cuts or too many close up shots of the hero or villain. While this had a very little of both, overall the sequences were filmed from the vantage point I would want to see. The basic plot was also good and interesting. The CGI work on the aliens was very good and they seemed more like actual characters than just cartoons.What is not so good? First and foremost, the accents. I realize this was supposed to be South Africa and it would be silly to have them speaking American English but the idioms and fast speaking was almost unintelligible at times. A few idioms were easy enough to figure out but many meant nothing to me. I think the acting was probably pretty good but it is hard to say since I did not understand a lot of what was being said. I know, that is how things are in a foreign film but this was not supposed to be a foreign film and difficult to understand English (at least to an American) is why I do not see foreign films. It was extremely distracting. I also did not expect that all aliens would be unable to speak English so I would have to read a lot of subtitles. I can believe that humans and aliens would learn one another languages even if they did not speak each others but most of the humans seemed to be awfully capable of understanding the aliens and when I figure that we humans have a lot of trouble understanding one another's language (or even the language of other English speakers), I just feel like that level of understanding was a bit too much. Yeah, complaining of linguistics in a movie with space aliens sounds odd but that is what I thought.This is definitely a movie I would have preferred to wait for the DVD version. First, I would have had subtitles to be sure I understand all that was being said and second, I would have saved a lot of money on just renting it. As it is, I would definitely not recommend this movie.",2,6,15,23 October 2009
Batman Begins," FINALLY, a DC Comic movie that gets it right!
","I was a comic collector as a child and young adult so I obviously love comic book movies. The Superman movies were okay and the Batman movies were also barely okay. They emphasized the things that made them non-comic book and took away many of the comic book elements. When Marvel started getting great movies with X-Men and Spiderman, I saw that someone finally had learned to do it right. Of course there are some misses (Elektra) but overall, I have come to expect more of Marvel comic book movies than anything from DC (the company which owned Superman, Batman, Justice League, etc.).This movie really goes back to the comic book roots. Forget the other Batman movies, they have nothing to do with this one. In this Batman, you see how Bruce becomes a hero and why he chose Batman. The portrayal of Gotham and of Thomas Wayne (Bruce's father) help to flesh things out more like the way a comic story would than 'character development' in a movie fashion. The league of shadows and the Scarecrow all flow with the story rather than serve as elements inserted as generic villains of the week.I completely enjoyed this movie and although some elements are different from the comic book, they are true to the spirit of the books and that is what counts (like Spiderman being able to shoot webbing without webshooters was still faithful to the idea of the comic). I hope you will give it a try and support Hollywood making movie actually from comic books rather than just movies with titles or characters from comic books.",10,3,6,17 June 2005
28 Days Later...," Felt like a rerun - tired story, slow moving
","I was expecting something more than this.  This reminded me of a bad TV episode of something where it is the same old plot and you already know what is going to happen before it does.  The movie started good and the idea of the 'rage virus' is good.  When the guy woke up and was all alone, it was interesting.  But then I think the filmmakers must have realized they were failing to follow the tried and true and oft repeated so went with a substandard telling of the zombies and last men on earth storyline.  Even the encounter with the troops was tired and predictable from the start. 
Perhaps this movie had too much hype but any movie that I end up watching in fast forward is one that I cannot recommend.  It was boring and that is one of the worst things I think you can say about a movie.",2,2,3,8 April 2004
Ghost Rider," More than good enough to see - ignore the bad reviews
","Sometimes, I think critics and such miss the point of a comic book movie. A comic book movie is not about romance, or exploration of self or moral sermons or parodies of real life. Comic books are about imagination and they move fast while taking some things for granted to let you work out on your own. A comic book movie should be similar in my opinion. To me, Spiderman is the best comic book movie of all so I will compare to that a lot. The Dolph Lundgren Punisher (not to be confused with the more recent far superior Thomas Jane Punisher) was one of the worst.What makes them different? In Spiderman, things happened and people just accepted them and it moved to the next frame. Some wonder but not a lot of long speeches and introspection. Oh, you can shoot webs and stick to buildings, cool. In the DL Punisher, everything had to be discussed and thought out and the motivations pointed out, etc. Leave aside that DL's acting was bad and the other factors, it made for a boring slow story that even the critics hated. Spiderman snapped because it kept moving, made it points and left some things for people to just imagine or figure out on their own. Spend several scenes on making up believe that Uncle Ben loved Peter or just have Peter say it and assume we will take it at face value. You go with making the statement and keeping the movie moving. That is what a comic book would do. They would not spend an issue trying to develop a issue or emotion usually, just say it and then let it be motivation for the real story.Well, that is a lot of how Ghost Rider (GR) is. Critics complain because too much is just assumed. Johnny Blaze gets bad news about his father yet barely reacts other than going to work on his bike. Johnny makes a deal with the devil and his dad is miraculously healed only to have an accident. It all happens quickly and is more of a matter of fact type situation without prolonged examination about the emotions. That is what it should be! A comic book would keep moving and so should (and does) this movie. No wondering that there is a devil, that the devil wants to make deals, etc. It just is what it is and the story keeps going. Just like a comic book.Having said all of that, I actually liked this movie. I did not plan to like it but it was a lot like the Thomas Jane Punisher. It was clear, superficial and stayed in line with most of the comic book. Sure, in the comic there is more of the tortured soul but there was just not enough time for that in the movie so they fineesed it. There was a lot of flack about how in the Spiderman movie, Spidey's web was natural whereas in the comic it is a webshooter he made which showcased his incredible science talent. That is an important point in the comics because Spidey relies on his brain as much as his brawn usually but the movie saw that the time it would take to highlight the creation of the webshooter was just not worth the trade-off so ditched it in favor of natural ones. It maintained the crucial part (webshooter) while keeping the story moving and that is what GR does in many points. I would like to have seen more development of how he struggled with the curse, with having to try to gain control of the demon aspect and how if he relies on his power too much, the demon part gains strength but that will hopefully be for a sequel to explore. With so much to cover and only 1 movie to do it, many things have to be glossed over.The visual effects are not incredible but they are perfectly acceptable. I did not like the thought of Nicholas Cage in the movie but he did fine. There are complaints about Eva Mendes doing poor acting but she was not hired to act in this one. She is eye candy and she does that really well just as the female love interest in a comic book would do. This is not Cannes and this film is not trying for an Oscar or critical acclaim. I would not want to see such a movie anyway. I wanted to see the Ghost Rider like I remembered reading when I was growing up in the 70s. I wanted the cool motorcycle (really a chopper). I got that. I got the visual effects I wanted and the story that made me remember the comic books. I was not inspired to save the world, to protest oil drilling or to volunteer for political duty but that is NOT what a movie like this is about. This is about the wonder of a comic book and the critics seem to be unable to understand that. I have it an 8 out of 10 only because it might have had some better scenes but I feel like I got my money's worth and to me, that is the real merit of any movie.See this movie if you liked comic books. If you want art, go see Babel or The Queen or whatever and save yourself the frustration but leave the fun mindless movies to those of us who do enjoy them.",8,21,37,19 February 2007
Hellboy," It entertained and what more can you ask
","I knew nothing of Hellboy, let me say that first.  I like comic books and used to collect them.  I love movies.  So when a comic book is made into a movie, I get excited and can't wait to see it and then usually end up with something like the first Punisher movie (Dolph Lundgren) or other movies where the director/writer/actor 'reinvent' the character and such to the point that it is really not like the comic at all and they forget to add some action.Even knowing nothing of Hellboy, my son wanted to see it so we went.  I understood what was going on and the characters right away.  I would like to have had more info about Hellboy's powers, so to speak, but it was not a problem.  Just as in a good comic, you understand the character's motivation and desire, who is good and who is evil (thankfully use of the Nazi's helps that a bit) and how it will likely end (after all, you always knew they were not going to kill Superman or Spiderman but that did not make the story any less fun).  No boring backstory, unneeded love stories or special effects for the sake of special effects.My 12 year old son really enjoyed the movie and thought it was great. Although we had the usual group of rude/loud people in the theater, I cannot hold that against the film and I have no problems recommending it.  To me, Spiderman (the movie) is a 10.  Daredevil was about a 5.  X-men 2 was an 8. Hopefully that gives you an idea of how I see things so you can make your own decision.",8,0,0,2 April 2004
The Incredibles," You should not miss this movie
","This movie is not what the previews and hype make it appear. It is not as funny (usually) as Toy Story or some of the others. It is not as 'kid-ready' as the others. It has a real story. I read an interview with the Pixar people where they said they did not want to keep making the same movies with different characters. They wanted each movie to be really different. This movie is that certainly. There is funny stuff in the movie but pretty soon, they do not seem like cartoon characters any more. They seem more like the comic book superheros.I am a Plaintiff's lawyer but even I found it humorous that lawsuits drove the superheroes into hiding. Sad commentary but pretty humorous. The movie is really about how those superheroes would fare, and cope with, no longer saving the day. How do their children cope with having super powers they have to hide completely? As Mr. Incredible hits mid-life, and no longer looks or feels Incredible, what does he do? It would be wrong not to mention the son (Dash), who has superspeed and the fun he has in school with it. Who among us who ever read comic books or watched cartoons did not dream of having superspeed and doing the stuff he does? I have heard people complain that the Incredibles are a lame knock-off of the Fantastic Four. Well, while it is true there are similar powers, this is really nothing like the Fantastic Four and it really does not attempt to be. If you are among those who hate the movie for this reason, you ought to find some better reason because the whole comparison to the Fantastic Four is pretty far out there. This is a movie you should feel taking your children to see. It is also one that will keep the adults' attention. This is not one of my all time favorite movies, but it was a very good movie, presented in a very interesting way and something I enjoyed seeing. As I say in many of my reviews, if you enjoy the movie, it has done its job. Don't miss this one.",10,0,2,6 November 2004
I Am Legend," Ho-Hum story ruined by one gaping plot hole
","This was a run of the mill standard science fiction story that any fan of sci-fi has probably already heard or read several times. As far as the story goes, there was nothing really new or interesting about the tale, except one glaring fatal flaw. The photography was good and the special effects were acceptable but nothing earth shattering. How many times have we seen a devastated earth, or even just devastated New York City? If the filmmakers were expecting a 'Wow, he is growing corn in Central Park' they better hope that some people have never paid attention to science fiction or the stacks of movies that have similar things.As for the acting, once again it was acceptable. Will Smith works hard in his role and is believable (glaring error notwithstanding). He has continued to develop as an actor but, once again, the whole 'last man on earth' scenario has been done numerous times before so it is not breaking any new ground. His attachments to store dummies and a video store are humorous and consistent. However, his logical attitude and believability is what makes the glaring error such a vast glaring error that destroyed the film for me.SPOILER ALERT  The Glaring Error  Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a scientist and believes he may be the sole sane survivor of the plague he has dedicated his life to stopping. He maintains his sanity and drive, in large part, by recording everything and focusing on the details of life and survival. This is in his continued efforts to cure the plague and in his daily life. He needs a 'human' subject to test a cure on so sets out to capture a DarkSeeker (infected humans). He sets a trap and captures one, a female, but a male one I will call Alpha almost braves the sunlight to confront him (sunlight being toxic to DarkSeekers). He even comments on this highly unusual behavior in his notes and hypothesizes that lack of food is causing them to override their survival instincts and that all traces of humanity appear to be gone. All fine so far.Later, Neville is caught in a trap almost exactly like the trap he set for the DarkSeeker. The bait is one of his store dummy friends. Despite this obvious use of tools and pre-planning and coordination, he never asks such a thing is possible for just animals. Even when Alpha appears and releases some infected dogs into the dimming sunlight, Neville makes no connection and never comments on it in his records or otherwise that we are shown. Neville goes out at night and is attacked by DarkSeekers in an animalistic fashion. Suddenly, Alpha shows up and the attack becomes coordinated and logical. Neville fails to notice the difference. The DarkSeekers attempt to attack his home and it is a haphazard rush toward the house until, you guessed it, Alpha shows up and things become coordinated and the DarkSeekers begin to be able to brave hazards like fire. Still, no apparent recognition of this by Neville.I could not conceive that a scientist so dedicated to finding cures and links between things, and so dedicated to take notes and making observations, would completely overlook the role of Alpha and the change in behavior. Perhaps there are deleted scenes which show him realizing it but if so, shame on the movie makers for taking that out. Neville was a believable character until he suddenly and inexplicably completely ignores this obvious and important bit of information. This omission is what changed an otherwise acceptable sci-fi tale into something I have to rate so low.",4,6,8,2 January 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not a very good movie
","I normally love sequels and love movies based on video games or comics when they are done right. They should be able to get continuing viewers as well as new viewers involved with the story and up to speed quickly then move ahead. This movie does neither of those. The movie starts out pretty good but then it becomes very confusing, very quickly. Characters are introduced with no explanation and often with no rationale. Jill Valentine is a character who seems to have been introduced solely to give another sexy woman a reason to strut around in a very skimpy dress (not that I am complaining). I gathered she was an off duty cop but why would she strap her guns on and put on her boots but not take time to put on a shirt or pants? Wouldn't that shoulder holster start to chafe bare shoulders? How did she know to immediately start shooting zombies in the head? Maybe there was something in the original but I sure don't remember it or remember her character. Alice is yet another example of the movie makers trying to find ways to put her in skimpy outfits then trying to come up with a reason. They did not try very hard to get a reason. She is shown nearly nude or nude more times than is necessary (again, not that I am complaining - though I will admit that her nude is not as good as skimpy clothed in the right clothes..). The camera work also distracted more than added to the movie. I do not understand the overwhelming desire of so many directors to shoot with handhelds and use jerky pictures. It makes me dizzy and almost always just confuses the scene. If confusion were the real desire, maybe it would be okay but when you have paid for lots of special effects, you want the audience to see them I would assume. Overall, the film is mostly a few thoughts that are pieced together with the flimsiest of threads. There is no explanation for why Raccoon City has a wall all the way around it. The end of the movie is an obvious attempt to set up another sequel but that is a sequel I hope is never made if they cannot do a better job than this one.",2,2,6,27 September 2004
Logan," Good acting and potential that is wasted
","I wanted to like this movie but the longer it went, the more I disliked it. I can only think how much better this movie would have been if Marvel had made it and done the story right. The good is that the acting is very good and Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart deliver great performances as you would expect from them. Stephen Merchant was great as Caliban. Dafne Keen was the true find as she did an outstanding job as Laura (X-23). Not speaking for most of the film means she had to rely on facial expression and looks and she did them with a lot of skill. Whether it was her or just great direction, the point is that she executes her role wonderfully. She has very expressive eyes and at times reminded me of a very young Sandra Bullock. I hope she has a long career. The bad is the typical problem when Marvel isn't making the movie. Apparently the desire is to make superhero movies where the superheros detest their powers and stay far away from lame things like costumes (ie what fan like). So of course there are no costumes in this and there is a lot of complaining about having fantastic powers and everyone seems to determined use kung fu rather than actually use those powers. At several points, it seemed that someone in Hollywood got an idea and insisted that it be included (hey let's involve border crossings, hey we need to say something about big corporations, hey let's complain about self-driving cars, etc. etc.) which all just muddle the story and add nothing in my opinion. Although his acting was as good as always, I found Prof. X a distraction in the movie and was disappointed with his storyline. Others may disagree. This movie is rated R. There are some bloody scenes but there are a lot of F-Bombs. Despite the rating, we had a 9 year old Wolverine fan sitting behind us constantly asking his parent what this or that means. With Wolverine being such a child-friendly character in comics and cartoons, making an R rated version was a pretty bad idea since a lot of kids are going to want to see it and give their parents plenty to have to explain. Deadpool could do it since Deadpool is not that common with kids. In fact, the best part of the movie was the preview (kind of preview) for the upcoming Deadpool sequel. This was the 3rd movie I have seen recently in the theaters where the audience was disruptive. Talking, cell phones, etc. (one guy even taking a phone call during the film!) made it a bad experience. I love seeing movies in a theater but if people cannot learn that when in a theater they are NOT in their own den watching Netflix, I will have to seriously rethink it. Ticket prices keep going up and up and highly disruptive customers (forget poor films) make a good explanation for why people are staying away from theaters.",1,25,59,5 March 2017
Avatar," Definitely different, in a good way, and 3D not as bad as I thought
","Let me first say that I am not a fan of 3D. My vision is good but I do not have good depth perception so 3D things usually seem out of focus and annoying to me. The old red/blue glasses or even the gray ones at Disneyworld and such are distracting and annoying so I have avoided most 3D things. I really wanted to see Avatar though so I braved it. I am happy to say that the 3D was MUCH better than I thought. There are no things coming at you or cheap tricks about it and it really did make things seem deeper and more alive. The glasses were much better than I had thought and I did not find them distracting. If other 3D movies are done even partly as well as this, I will definitely see 3D again.Now, as to the movie itself, I had to keep reminding myself that all that I was watching was computer animation. It is extremely easy to believe that it is real. It does not look like a video game or any animation I have ever seen before. Wow does not cover it. As I have seen new things in movies (whether Star Wars, superman flying, etc.) that marked advances in technology, I have always been amazed and this was no exception. It is easy to believe the things you see in the movie and that helps keep you in the story and entertained. Cheap FX can ruin a good movie or too much FX can overwhelm a movie. In this one, the FX are just there and are outstanding while a good story is told.The story is a rather old one and not too unique. As you can tell from the plot summaries, it is similar to the US with the American Indiains or many other incidents of one culture encountering another who has a resource the first culture needs. So the story itself is acceptable but it is the manner of telling the story and developing it that makes this movie rate a 10 to me.It is hard to comment on much without seeming to spoil something. I can say that the movie initially feels like you came in late and missed the first few chapters of a book or 10 minutes of the movie but it is okay because they do quickly fill in the blanks. I found myself leaving the theater wishing there was more to see and wanting to see more about the world of Pandora. One of my favorite things is that they took the time to explain why the aliens can speak and understand English (a common thing in most movies that usually gets overlooked) and it is just a sign of how careful James Cameron was with the elements of this movie.It is a definite Must See and one I highly recommend seeing in the theater since you will miss a great deal not seeing this on the big screen. I now wish I had an IMAX near me to try to see it in IMAX.",10,3,6,19 December 2009
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Disappointing considering the rave reviews..
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  I loved Elf and Old School.  I enjoy movies like EuroTrip and Bad Santa as well as more mainstream comedies (I mention this so you know that I do like comedies).  I was excited when I saw the cast list and then when I started reading all of the rave reviews, I was really excited to see this movie!  I even waited a bit so my wife and 2 children could go too since everyone said it was a consistent laugh fit.  Well, they were apparently watching a different movie. Ferrell is good but not great.  Steve Carrell is a scene-stealer as always. The rest of the cast is very hit or miss (except Fred Willard on the phone about his son) and the jokes just aren't there. I thought that maybe I was just too excited about seeing it but the rest of my family had not been as excited and shared the same impressions.  There were a few interesting scenes (one with 'sex panther' cologne and one involving 'pants tents' that I am amazed I have never seen used before to that extent) that really did make me chuckle but they were few and far between.  Much of it, such as a news team 'rumble' was just weird and never really got funny.  I have re-read some of the reviews and just do not understand why they saw it so differently from us.  One small defect in our viewing was that the sound and the picture were just slightly out of sync (words did not match the mouth movements) but it was barely noticeable and I do not believe it really effected my opinion.  I wish I had not taken my children (13 yrs old) to it due to a few comments and scenes but if it had been really funny, I would have overlooked that. 
You will have to judge for yourself but I urge you to not just assume it is going to be the great movie others are claiming it is.",3,1,2,22 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Overall good but beware of the hype (minor spoilers below)
","I have been anxiously waiting for this movie. I know a bunch of people have commented on it so I will try to be brief and will assume you have read many other reviews. Loved the Original Trilogy (OT) and thought Episode 1 was fair and Episode 2 was acceptable. I had read all the critics and prior nay-sayers carrying on about how great this movie was and I really wanted it to be incredible. Unfortunately, I believe it is a victim of its own critic praises. The praise built my expectations up so high that it would have been hard to really reach it. So, I saw this opening day in a pretty good theater and was expecting the sun, moon and stars.I was disappointed. Now, having said that, it was still the best of the prequels and was almost as good as some of the OTs. The movie really did tie together the threads and help make everything more sensible. I read a quote from George Lucas where he admitted that of the original back story he did for the OT, Episode 1 and 2 of the prequels together had about 40% of it and Episode 3 has about 60% of it. So he always knew that the other 2 were padded a lot in order to make them into 2 separate movies. Think 20-20-60 and you have a pretty good comparison for this movie.Palpatine was wonderful and I cannot believe how lucky they were to have cast that guy way back in Return of the Jedi. Getting to see the Emperor really face foes, with lightsaber and force, was a treat. I understand more about why Anakin turned to the Dark Side and contrary to most other reviews, I thought it made sense.SPOILER - others say it was because the Emperor tricked him but I believe it was pretty clear that he was determined to keep Padme from dying and let himself be led down that path because of his love for her. The Ends Justify the Means at its purest example. It is also good to view General Greivious as a precursor to the 'more machine than man' Darth Vader. I always used to wonder why Obi Won and Yoda never fought back as I watched them in OT and now I know the answers.Overall, it is a good movie and I gave it an 8. Had I not read so many glowing reviews, I probably would have enjoyed it more. I hope you like it. My 13 year old son thought it was incredible.",8,3,6,21 May 2005
Iron Man," One of the better Superhero movies
","I always liked Iron Man growing up but I thought it was ripe for having 'Hollywood types' mess it up. I am very happy that this movie was not messed up and it delivered on all counts as far as I am concerned. It did not have a lot of WOW or incredible stuff but it surely met my expectations and with the movies I have been seeing lately, that is a pretty good accomplishment.Some Superhero movies were terrific and were like watching a comic book. Spiderman had to be the best but Batman Begins was also extremely good. On the other end, you have things like Electra, Superman Returns, Ang Lee's Hulk and the other ones that seem to forget they are about a comic book character so we do not need tons of backstory. Say someone is self-centered and maybe one scene with it and it becomes a given. Don't spend valuable screen time showing us over and over or writing lengthy speeches. Film it like a comic book.Here Robert Downey Jr. shows again that he is one of the most talented actors around and I could not imagine anyone else playing Tony Stark better. Tony's selfishness and genius combined with his desire to take nothing seriously but everything for granted just shines through. I understand that much of the dialogue was ad-libbed and if so, they did a really good job of being smart and sassy. One of the toughest things in a superhero movie is the villain because with the first movie, you have to have a villain that is quick and easy to get into action since most of your time is taken with the origin story. Superman movies keep trying to involve Lex Luthor and he is a complex villain that just begs for lots of screen time. Spiderman did great with Green Goblin and Batman Begins was brilliant to use 2 lesser known villains. Here, the Iron Monger is certainly not one of Iron Man's most notable foes but, as in Batman Begins, his motivation and story intertwines so well with the hero that you are not losing any story telling time. He was the perfect villain with the perfect motivation for this movie. A villain like Mandarin would be great but that is for a later movie where there is time to tell more of the villains story and set up more things. Here, we get lots of how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man and changes his outlook and how he developed that marvelous armor.As with most movies I have seen in the theaters lately, there were the annoying people talking to the screen and one another throughout the movie. If there is anything that will kill the cineplex, it not going to be DVDs and home theaters, it will be these inconsiderate fellow patrons who cannot understand that they are not sitting in their living room. Combine that with the skyrocketing cost of tickets and concessions and even I am starting to prefer to watch movies at home. This is one movie though that really benefits from the large screen though because for Iron Man, you need big sound and big pictures. As it should be.Go see this one.",9,2,5,4 May 2008
300," Great movie and exactly what it claims to be
","I do not think this is a spoiler but, shock of shocks, this movie is not intended to educate viewers as to the reality of Ancient Greece, Persia, the real Xerxes, real Spartans, real battle outfits and tactics or darn near anything else. The list of historical inaccuracies are legion (to coin the phrase) but the big point that critics and others seem to miss is that this movie is not intended to be a historical documentary. If you wish to see this movie for its historical value and commentary, you should really reconsider your approach to movies. Seriously.What this movie is a movie adaption of a comic book (aka graphic novel). That is what it wants to be and, as far as I am concerned, what it achieves in spades. I felt like I was reading a comic book. There was minimal character development and background because you do not need such. This is the Queen. She is married to the King. Nuff Said. No need for an exposition on her upbringing or heritage or motivations or anything else. She is the Queen, now on with the story.I have read reviews where people try to equate parts of this movie with the Irag situation or with many other modern day events but, again, they are missing the point. This is not a movie intended to an allegory for modern time or to comment on society. It is a COMIC BOOK movie. It is meant for the toughest purpose of all (in my opinion), to entertain. To make you relax, thrill and enjoy the story, scenes and images for a time. To throw other thoughts away and, for a time, become part of the fictional Sparta facing a fictional Horde. No lessons, no deep morals, just relax and enjoy the ride.When you do that, you will love this movie. There are tons of inaccuracies and tons of politically incorrect ideas in the movie but why are you looking for such in a COMIC BOOK movie? My 15 year old son loved it and says it is his favorite movie. Maybe partly because of the semi-naked women (who are not important to the movie but will surely draw more teen boys) but because it was simple and fun. You want history and knowledge, avoid this movie. You want to relax, enjoy a good story and just have fun, do not miss this movie.",10,5,15,25 March 2007
