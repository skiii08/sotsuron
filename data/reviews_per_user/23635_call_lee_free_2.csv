The Avengers," A Very Artistic Cinematic Masterpiece!!
","um... yeah this movie sucks. Probably the worst superhero movie ever made..... Bazinga! I'm just joking. Its sarcasm. This movie is the total package. The entertainment value of this film is just through the roof. From the beginning you are instantly hooked. When I first watched the trailer, I knew this movie would be awesome! It did not fail to deliver. Packs an epic punch when you watch this. For the record, I have not seen the other 'Hulk' films because 1) He really isn't a favorite character of mine and 2) The CG look of the Hulk just didn't appeal to me. You watch the Hulk in this film and your like 'Whoa!' Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk was just pure genius. Each superhero gets equal screen time. No one is above anyone and I actually preferred that. This film is full of star power and I'm glad everyone got their share. I am a visual effects artist and the effects for this film was just pure bred artistic masterpiece. I thought that Transformers 3 was just awesome in terms of the the visual effects, but The Avengers is just superb!! The plot and character development is great! Everyone should see this movie even if you aren't a comic book fan. Its pure entertainment value. My rating is 12/10 and I'm going to see this film again and again!",10,1,5,4 May 2012
Godzilla," Awesome movie!!
","I will admit, I have never watched the older Godzilla movies before until I watched Final Wars a few days before this movie came out. Loved Final Wars and it was a good film to get my feet wet so to speak in terms of being introduced into the Godzilla universe. I know I need to watch the 1954 original which I plan to do here real soon. I was told to avoid the 1998 version which I saw a video clip of the ending of Godzilla 98. Pretty much that Godzilla looked like a roided up T-Rex from Jurassic Park. Not impressed. So I go into this movie after viewing trailers for it and I was getting excited. had a feeling that this was going to be a kick ass monster movie and it is. I watched this in iMax 3D and holy crap on a cracker..... utterly impressed! Love this movie and I am puzzled as to why its getting a 7.3 on here??? I guess you can't please everyone but man, this is just awesome!! Its great fun, has a great story line and the performances are really good. I high;y recommend watching this movie but please, don't go into it looking for something like Shutter Island or whatever. Its a go out and have fun type movie, peeps :)",10,5,11,24 May 2014
