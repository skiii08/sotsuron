Blade Runner 2049," balancing between amateur and acceptable
","This is frustrating seeing audience lowered its expectations so much because of many sequels trying hard 'not to ruin' the original. This can only increase chances of ruining it.While this sequel did not ruin it, it just blade runner another watchable movie. Over-explaining is what you'll get watching the movie. The main character, his reactions, the plot, the philosophy behind the bad guy. Everything is over explained. You expect the characters to be more developed but they're cut down and become source of frustration. The bad guy could've been a faceless CEO it would've been better than raising expectations and failing flat (like his female agent).Spoiler:The blade runner boss is completely off. Idiot enough to get killed while she seen it coming or believe his agent saying: it's done. No need for more proof.The female chief of the revolutionaries (and the whole revolution plan is unnecessary) it's just there to make things like leveling up to the whole nation of replicants (followingthe perfect recipe for screen writing)The design: beautiful exteriors, empty interiors. Mixing clean and minimal design with dirty and cluttered look of the original blade runner. Pointless ! it breaks the movie and don't enhance the story since it has no logic. If they wanted to make the bad guy's company look minimalist , why make it all stone wall with empty furniture ?The good scenes are overlooked (like the final one) and some scene are completely unnecessary.Slow pace of the movie is way behind the original who wasn't that slowDirectors should experiment in their shorts not in big budget movies wasting the talent of their team",3,5,11,13 October 2017
