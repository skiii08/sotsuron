United 93," That Trieste Dunn.......
",Is bloody gorgeous!!.Was watching the DVD today and am not afraid to admit a few tears did drop.A very emotional film. The jargon got a bit confusing at times but I feel we get the jist of it.Having just watched this film and the world trade centre in the cinema I think this film is better and more emotive - well to me it is anyway. I'd liked to have heard in the DVD bonus extras what the actors who played the terrorists felt and how they dealt with the emotion and what went through their minds in acting out what those terrorists did.Also did I mention that Trieste Dunn is bloody gorgeous!! :D,Null,0,2,11 January 2007
