Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Waste of Time
","I, like many other people on this website, watch movies with higher ratings because they seem like must see movies. The truth is this movie is different. I could see how someone would like it because it is a film that is different than anything I've ever seen. That aside, this movie was absolutely terrible. I've seen many drug type movies, mostly trafficking and distribution of drugs, and this is a very different viewpoint. I'm not going to ramble about how unique the film is, its unique and there's a reason there aren't many movies like this. The acting was terrible, there really was no plot, it was a journey through a worthless group of peoples lives. Confusing, plot less, and random. 2/10. The music was the only good thing about the movie.",2,2,5,21 June 2008
Pi," Very Odd, Pretty Entertaining
","This film was uniquely produced, definitely one of a kind.The audio is intricate, video is black and white and it definitely adds to the character perception. You feel what Max feels, see what he sees, and hear what he hears. I usually don't go for sci-fi or movies that are way out there, but this one grabbed my attention, and I enjoyed it much more than Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. He uses a chaotic style of filming, audio, and acting which makes Max's character realistic and believable.The storyline was a bit odd, but well constructed.Entertaining, Unique, and Well filmed.",7,0,1,15 July 2008
