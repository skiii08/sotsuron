50 First Dates," Better than usual Sandler fare
","50 First Dates is a nice compromise for Adam Sandler. After Punch-Drunk Love, many hoped he would stick to dramatic roles, yet at the same time, legions of fans chanted that a foolish idea like that was 'Borophyll'. Thus, as a kind of compromise for both camps- we have 50 First Dates.The film tells the story of Henry Roth, a Hawaiian native with a massive fear of commitment. One day, Henry meets Lucy at a local pancake house, and after falling for her- soon realizes something is amiss. The rest of the film chronicles Henry's repeated attempts to woo Lucy- and once he gets her- his attempts to remind her how much she really loves him.Sandler is back to classic Happy Gilmore comedy form here. But he seems to have matured quite a bit. He actually seems to show a real love for Barrymore- and the two have undeniable chemistry on screen (even if the scenes with kissing in the rain are a little cliché). Having harnessed the anger of his early career, Sandler has finally made himself out to be one who is able to accomplish more than pee and fart jokes.Overall, 50 First dates is nothing special. it won't attract droves of prepubescents to their local Blockbusters, and it won't attract critical acclaim like a film by P.T. Anderson. But it is fun and sweet, and It makes work for Adam Sandler's friends.And isn't that what a movies are all about?-6/10Line of the Movie: 'You were going for a feelski!'Look of the Movie: Sean Astin when his...problem is revealed in front of his dad and sister.",5,0,0,22 June 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The sun also rises...
","Thank you Mike and CharlieEternal Sunshine, hands down, is the best film of early 2004. Filled with a brilliant script, visionary directing, some of the best editing seen in years, and performances that burst off the screen, Eternal Sunshine brings a new layer to the careers of all those involved.A good film should pose a question, answer it, and leave room for viewer interpretation. In ESOTSM, the question is: What's the most important part of a relationship-where it takes us, or the memories we obtain while we get there?The film tells the story of Joel Barish (Carrey) a businessman who one day takes an impulsive up the coast. On the train, He meets Clemintine (Winslet). The two connect, but we soon realize that there's more to them than we thought. For the next two hours, Kaufman and Gondry take us on a trip through Barish's mind. SHowing us the fall and rise of the two's relationship, and forcing the views to wonder if this was the best thing that Joel could of done-as he desperately clings to past memories.Though the plot is convoluted, it's the performances of the actors that keep your eyes glued to the screen. Carrey channels the zaniness of his early career into the quiet, contained Joel- bringing a depth to the character that few others could (Think Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love, but with more emotion) If the Academy passes him up for this as they did for Man on the Moon and The Truman Show, I'm gonna have issues with AMPAS. Likewise, Winslet serves as the perfect foil for Joel, acting as the crazy random connection that we all wish we'd make at some point. She brings out the bestin all those around her at all times during the film.In addition to those two, everyone else with their name above the title on the poster puts in a stellar performance. Elijah Wood is just creepy enough to make us like him, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson force the audience to think about the other side of the procedure, and Kirsten Dunst puts Mary-Jane to shame as a girl with more to her than you could ever expect.All this is conducted beautifully by Gondry, who faced with a Kaufman Script, seemingly pulled it straight out of Charlie's messed up head. Shots exist that shouldn't, and all that acting prowess had to come from somewhere. Extra points for the dissolving bookstore and the scene with Joel bathing in the sink.All told, Eternal Sunshine is a film that all should see. It's not a film about love, it's a film about remembering- something that so few of us do anymore-10/10Look of the Film- Joel as a child from under the table.Line of the Film-'But you will! But you will, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped, because that's what happens with me!' 'Okay.'",10,0,1,20 June 2004
The Terminal," Dim the lights, cue the music, and feel good about Eastern Europe
","The new Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg collaboration 'The Terminal' is everything that you'd expect from these two. A straightforward plot, a clear cut hero's, villains, and conflicts, an an ending that doesn't fall into cliché, but isn't enough to run to the cinema for. What saves the film from mediocrity, though, is another virtuoso performance by Hanks and good supporting turns by Zeta-Jones and Tucci.In a nutshell, The Terminal is the story of Viktor Navorski. A man who, after his fictitious country is overthrown in a military coup, is forced to live in an airport terminal by the methodically by-the-book Frank Dixon (Tucci). As Navorski tries to escape from the terminal, he makes friends both of those inside the terminal and of those passing through (Zeta-Jones), all the while proving to everyone around him that compassion is reason enough to travel around the world.Hanks has been a mixed bag with his accents, but his Eastern European as done by Navorski will certainly garner him another Oscar nomination.Spielberg doesn't do anything spectacular here, but he manages to give the terminal a life of itself. From the running shops to the pictures of Viktor's hand prints after a touching scene, Spielberg once again immerses the viewer in a world that makes them wantto pay attention. His standard work, but his standard would be the best of other's careers.All in all, The Terminal is a nice break from summer explos-athons, but it's nothing to write home about- 6/10Line of the Film- 'He really loves that goat.'-NavorskiLook of the Film- Navorski as he closes the Planters can at the end of the film.",6,1,2,20 June 2004
