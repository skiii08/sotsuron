Mission: Impossible III," A Second-Rate Bond Movie At Best
","Mainland China as a location. Cardboard cut-out villain. Yep, we've seen it all before ten years ago and it was better then too. There just doesn't seem to be the level of realism in Impossible Mission films that comes anywhere near the Bond movies. The plot line is so hackneyed and old to beggar belief. The only new addition is using surgical implants to demand co-operation which was ruined when the team ran their ops against the bad guys KNOWING they were at risk with no protection against same. Don't get me wrong, i will happily watch far-fetched scenario's all day as long as they have that one magic ingredient ENTERTAINMENT value. But the failure to entertain just makes watching painful followed by intense irritability.I've seen Hollywood try spy movies before and the best I can say is they are a mixed-bag with a good nine tenths fertiliser. Exceptions being True Lies and Three Days Of The Condor. Examples such as The Ipcress File, Ice Station Zebra,The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Michael Caine's 'Harry Palmer' films were all non Hollywood. If Hollywood IS going to attempt the spy genre I wish they'd do their homework. I have to say how disappointed I was with Mr Abrams's work, I had hoped for something special after LOST and ALIAS.You have been disavowed JJ.",2,18,34,9 May 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Yawn After Tomorrow
","From the start of the movie you get what seems to be a series of stitched-together special effects scenes, a poorly-directed backdrop of events which include a couple of human interest stories portrayed by actors with the range of a rock. The actors themselves seem to be sleep-walking through their dialogue, its odd, as though the director had deliberately directed the cast to imagine themselves cardboard-cut-outs and respond accordingly.All in all, two out of 10.(The two is for the quality of the SFX)SP",Null,0,0,28 May 2004
The Transporter," Slick (as oil)
","A great platform for Jason Statham. I love Luc Besson's films anyway, and looked forward to this with interest. My first reaction when I heard 'Frank's speech was one of incredulity. They gave the lead actor this ghey american accent, its AWFUL. Its a real shame, as originally the role called for a ex-SAS freelancer, why they just couldn't leave it like that who knows? Maybe its to do with the fact it's a French production and they couldn't stand the idea of a strong British actor in a lead role in a French film...? Anyway, apart from that it's very very good. Funny as fewk, its so true to life, how extremely violent situations can lead to bizarre yet hilarious conclusions (i have some personal experience of that.) The action sequences are some of the best I've seen, esp the oil and axe scenes,leading me to suspect that Stratham may be in the line-up as the next Bond. However, both the lead protagonist and the female leads father are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, a little more time should have gone into casting them methinks.... All in all a great night out or to you dvdr types a great night IN ;-) I thoroughly recommend this film; expect laughs, gasps and phews as 'Frank' takes us on the 'ride' of our lives!",8,0,0,9 February 2003
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Marxist Revisionism At It's Best
","Shockingly poor with an almost child-like interpretation of historical events seen through the eyes of a dedicated Marxist. The British Army, storm troopers, forces of darkness while the IRA are a happy go lucky bunch of folk-singers, democrats and human rights activists. Honestly, I have never seen such nonsense in my entire life, it's so ridiculous it'd be funny if it wasn't for the damage it causes promoting the idea that was how the British behaved, when reality couldn't be more different.The IRA weren't the courageous freedom-loving heroes some would like to portray them as, no, instead they were murderous thugs intent on suppressing by knee-capping and murder anyone including women and children who stood in their way. They run the drugs and every other level of criminality in both Ireland and Northern Ireland supported financially by America who stood and smiled as innocent men, women and children were blown to pieces by these 'heroes'.What a political dinosaur you are Ken Loach, simplistic, naive and dangerous in your attempt as historical revisionism seen through the eyes of a dedicated Marxist, with your self-loathing channelled against your country as though the fault lies with it and not with you.",1,3,12,6 January 2015
