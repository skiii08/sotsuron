The Rock," Welcome to the Rock...
","The Rock is a movie where old meets new.It combines two great actors of our time, Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage. Connery was already cool as Bond, but now that he's old and angry he's even cooler. Nicholas Cage is one of those actors that you instantly feel sorry for when something bad happens to their character. I don't know why, maybe it's that face of his.Plot-wise the Rock has a nice twist near the end and over-all it is very rough but not too icky. One problem that this movie definitely has is the fact that some action-scenes were filmed a little 'conservatively', such as Connery's car-chase and the part where Cage gets chased by the marines. You never get a clear idea where either of these scenes are going because they're made up of such tight close-ups and often the camera is pointing in the direction of where they're coming from rather than where they're going.Also I question the use of the soundtrack near the beginning when the marines steal the missiles as it sounded a tad too patriotic (since these are technically the bad-guys).Even with these little flaws the movie is exciting, funny and quite impressive all-around.",8,1,2,5 December 2005
Scarface," The definitive Crime Film trilogy...
","The Godfather, Scarface and GoodFellas create the definitive trilogy of crime-films with each taking a different perspective into the lives of the criminals. Scarface is once again a story of how a criminal's rise and fall but decisively different and more larger than life than in other crime films.Scarface is a very psychological film as it effectively shows the breakdown of Tony Montana's character. The film is also possibly more dark than either Godfather or GoodFellas which is why it also stands on its own in the are of emotional drama. With all the darkness the comedy of the film luckily helps it to stand on its own and not become a barrage of gunfights and gore.The only possible criticism that could be directed at the film might be the over-all structure of the story which is surprisingly straight-forward. By the end you can pretty much tell what's gonna happen. As a consequence the ending may be something of a let down, but on the other hand the final scenes of the movie are also some of my favorites so it creates a bit of an odd mixture.Sure enough, Scarface is a film to be reckoned with and an excellent piece of cinema.",9,0,1,30 August 2007
Alien 3," Back to Basics
","Alien 3 cuts back from the larger and more action-driven approach of Aliens in order to show a movie that's more down-to-earth and back-to-roots horror film. The film succeeds in a way but unfortunately loses a bit of its appeal in the process.Visually the film stands out from the rest of the Alien films with its grimy industrial look. The prison setting gives the film a feeling of isolation akin to the first movie. There's only one alien, just as in the first movie, and the humans this time are all but defenseless against it, as in the first movie. However, after being exposed to numerous aliens in the last movie the threat feels underwhelming and the concept a little bit of a rehash.However, Alien 3 has a distinctly reflective feel to it and the acting performances are far more memorable than in the first movie and the film also has a bit more entertainment value. Still, the final confrontation with the creature lacks the impact of the other movies. Thankfully the iconic final scene of the film salvages the rather underwhelming ending to some degree.Alien 3 is definitely on par with the first film of the series but lacks a lot of the entertainment value that would make it surpass the original.",7,1,1,16 August 2009
The Incredible Hulk," More of the same...
","The Incredible Hulk is a dumbed down version of the Hulk character and story and simply pales to the Ang Lee movie not only in casting, performances, seriousness and writing but generally by being just another run-of-the-mill action movie. Having said that, the movie is actually rather entertaining.The first third of the movie is probably the best and even though it is a very distant nod to how the first movie ended I'm happy that Banner's escape to South America was referenced at least a little bit. The continuous references to the comics and ultimately the future Avengers Film, as well as moments of comic relief keep the movie fresh and going but it's hard to look at the film as anything more than a big budget blow out to get Hulk fighting another monster.My problem with this film is the same as with Iron Man, the film deteriorates into a big over-blown CGI battle rather than trying to actually tell a good story. Unlike in Iron Man, this movie doesn't even have a secondary plot theme to keep it afloat which only manages to enhance it's rather meaningless existence.Still, this is a fun action movie and I'm sure the sequel might actually be just as good. Here's hoping that the Hulk's next big screen appearance will have a little more weight to it.",7,4,8,14 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An Excellent Space Opera
","People who hate Jar Jar and Ewoks gotta stop taking the Star Wars so seriously. They simply embody the element of comedy that has always been present in the films. I personally was never bothered by Jar Jar's presence in this film, since he is clearly a better actor than Natalie Portman.Okay, why I like this film so much? Because it's a fun space-adventure with colorful characters and great action-sequences. So, maybe George Lucas can't direct, the visuals are still great and what really makes this movie worth-while for me, personally, is the last light-saber fight and Duel of the Fates.If you want a fun adventurous film, this is it.",10,1,2,2 December 2005
Star Trek," 'Where no-one has gone before.'
","Without speculating the long lasting effects of this movie on the franchise's continuity, Star Trek is a brilliant movie. It offers a brilliant fresh look on the franchise while retaining enough classic elements to keep you locked in and involved with the characters.One of the things which Star Trek does well is tell a dramatic story. Upto the point where Spock's mother dies the film feels rather well setup but after continuity becomes disrupted you're left in the dark as to how the movie ends. This shock value undoubtedly wears off on later viewings but keeps you involved none the less.The great thing about the film is how it allows all the classic Trek-figures to don the spotlight. Uhura undoubtedly less than the guys though her involvement with Kirk and Spock does make for interesting viewing. Hands down my favorite performance came from Karl Urban as McCoy and it really felt as if DeForrest Kelley had come back from the dead. In fact all of the new actors inhabit the base-traits of their predecessors well and there is no lack of continuity experienced in the new cast, even with more outlandish casting decisions as Simon Pegg.The only thing that's disappointing about the movie is it's emphasis on action, which is based definitely more on film marketing than cinematic artistic merit. The shaky camera-work seems most out of place for a Star Trek film but this new bold direction for the franchise only serves to launch what I believe to be a new series of films.In all Star Trek leaves you with a great feeling that the movie has taken you through a great journey. I hope that the sequels will keep building more on the characters and that this New-Old Trek series will have a good run.Live long and prosper.",9,4,14,8 May 2009
Alien: Resurrection," Ripley's Saga Ends
",Alien Resurrection brings back the action of Aliens and combines it with the grimy goriness of Alien 3 to provide a film that is creepy and entertaining at the same time. The film's strength involve a number of interesting ways to reinvent the Aliens and a memorable cast of actors.The film really seems to bring the Alien-franchise's more sensual aspects to life with the resurrected Ripley. The film also has many great confrontations with the Aliens and the final act of the film provides one of the strangest and most rewarding finishes of any of the Alien films.The film's only real weakness is that it doesn't quite match the emotional conviction of Aliens and the story is more of a wrap up then a stand-alone chapter. Riddick and the Aliens make a grand exit with this film which is interesting enough to keep the audience invested and entertaining enough to avoid a dragging pace which the first and third film suffered from.,8,1,1,17 August 2009
Shaun of the Dead," A most impressive film...
","I'm not really a fan of zombie films but it recently seems like they've kinda ganged up on me. Shaun of the Dead is therefore a nice breath of fresh air in a genre that has become quite repetitive and self-referencing. What the film does is combine light-hearted comedy but is also a good zombie-film on the side.The film's definite high-points are its depiction of how people deal with a problem of such a bizarre nature. The human drama in all its cheesiness provides the perfect outlet for the films dark comedy which in turn keeps the film from becoming too serious even during more emotional moments (such as Philip and Mom's deaths).The film also doesn't fail to see to the needs of zombie fans and actually contains quite a bit of gore. Though it is rather bleak and gory a film, deep down it is actually a romantic comedy.Shaun of the Dead is the quintessential date movie...",9,1,3,30 August 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The Pirates Return
","I was feeling rather uneasy walking to the theatre and realising this film was going to end with a cliffhanger and lead straight into the next one. Well, fortunately the film was very entertaining and somewhat different (is it me, or are the characters just a little more wet in this one).The common problem with sequels is that they try to outdo the first one. This is why I still like the first one better, since it felt like a smaller movie. Regardless, I definitely enjoyed the slapstick humour of the first third mainly because they didn't make such a big deal out of it. Just give the people what they want to see in an action film. Funny/crazy stunts.Constant references to the previous film were okay and I was truly surprised at the amount of characters that came back for this film. The ending was a particularly nice surprise. In all the films only weakness is the fact that there is so much going on it makes the film feel rather long and the plot rather messy. Regardless we get to the end and enjoy it.Not quite as good as its predecessor but a good film none the less.",8,1,3,18 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirates! What's not to love?
","I guess I am a bit of a nut when it comes to pirates, but there simply aren't enough films that depict this brilliantly caricatured era.Pirates of the Carribbean adds to the mix a tad of supernatural elements and makes a very standard plot into a fun adventure by adding several memorable characters. The special-effects add to the feeling of the film, but at no point does the film become too big. There's no plot to conquer the world. Everything in the film is very down to earth and personal.Johnny Depp naturally adds to the film with his brilliant performance as Jack Sparrow, possibly one of the most original characters I've seen in a long while. He's become one of my favorites alongside such figures as Darth Vader, Bond and Riddick.A very nicely done adventure. Brilliant movie!",10,6,11,18 July 2006
Spider-Man 2," Enter Dr. Octopus!
","I have never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man movie, but I have to agree that its sequels, especially 'Spider-Man 3' have finally won me over. I've been a Spider-Man fan for a rather long time, but the Green Goblin has always been, to me at least, the lamest villains in Spider-Man's villains galore. Dr. Octopus isn't really the coolest one in the bunch either, but growing up I kinda liked him and his movie incarnation presented a nice multi-level character.The second Spider-Man has the convincing CGI effects but is also miles more interesting and comedy-packed than its predecessor, which is why I liked it so much. Though some parts of it are borderline cheesy there's enough to keep the film grounded.Only the middle-part of the film seemed horridly stretched out and a little boring though its nice to present Spider-Man having problems. I also wasn't irked by the revelation of his identity to a number of individuals, but in some places the film just seemed to lose its pace at times.However, the film undoubtedly has all the right ingredients of a great film. It doesn't compare to Spider-Man 3 in terms of plot, but it definitely has a memorable cast and is in most ways superior to the first one. Definitely recommendable.",8,3,3,19 May 2007
The Fifth Element," Science Fiction at its most satisfying
","The Fifth Element shows that a bond between comedy and serious dramatic science fiction can work miracles, as can a marriage of action and comedy (as shown by the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie 'True Lies'). The Fifth Element is witty, smooth and impressive all at the same time.The film's wide array of characters colour the science fiction adventure with some stereotypes, but also some genuinely interesting characters who turn the film into a comic-book type affair which is only enhanced by the scenes of multiple events occurring simultaneously.Despite the fact that costumes, sets and CGI work in a balanced union the film still does suffer from an occasional rigidness in some of its spliced editing, especially during the beginning. As the film goes on, however, this works in the films favour.Luc Besson shows what comes of a standard sci-fi action-flick once you add a hint of character and colour.",9,1,3,29 June 2008
Batman Returns," Two words: Christopher Walken
","Batman Returns is still considered by some to be the very best Batman film. I heavily disagree even if it is slightly better than its predecessor. The film is also considered the darkest in the series, even though others claim it to be quite campy. Both sides are right to a degree.Once again, the thing I hate about Burton's Batman films is very evident. Burton once more fails to create an illusion of space with every scene obviously taking place on a stage. Keaton puts his best foot forward as the dark knight, but you can't blame me for thinking that Val Kilmer and George Clooney both looked better as Batman.While the film certainly is dark thematically, there is a bunch of really goofy scenes that make it a rather weird mix. I had no problem with the Penguin, but I never enjoyed the film's portrayal of Catwoman. In the comics she's sophisticated and hot. Here she comes of as psychotic and kinda unsanitary.Even with its faults the film is quite amusing, and you can't really hate a film that has Christopher Walken in it. The guy can be funny, even when wearing a ridiculous wig.",8,0,1,20 July 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Walking a fine line
","The Wolverine movie tries to balance itself at being a serious telling of the character's origin story and a fun summer block buster at the same time. While the film definitely succeeds on both fronts it doesn't quite match the seriousness and intent of the first three movies.The exploration in to Wolverine and Sabertooth's relationship is one of the more rewarding experiences out of the film from a story point of view as well as seeing the origins of the character's name and the ultimate decision to have his skeleton covered by nigh-indestructible metal. All of the back-story works well but the scene where Logan finally loses his memory felt like a bit of an anti-climax especially after the shocking plot-twist concerning Kayla.The action scenes are once again brilliant and the element of comedy is very welcome in the film. I also have to admit to liking all the new mutant characters, no matter how briefly they appear. Wade Wilson was fun and Deadpool provides the coolest part of the film's latter half (and making me wish that Baraka from the second Mortal Kombat film would have looked more like him). But while the more entertaining parts of the film are handled even-handedly with the story-drive ones they unfortunately do undermine the film just a tad bit.Typical fan complaints aside, Wolverine is a good action film and a well-handled retelling of the character's origin story but not a film that can match the message of the first three X-Men films.",7,3,7,3 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Okay action flick, but less than I expected...
","With Terminator Salvation the film franchise now moves away from time-travel to deal with the battle with the machines from the more relevant viewpoint. While the post-apocalyptic world of the fourth Terminator movie has its charm it wears out quickly after which we're left with a very standard type of action movie.The character of Marcus Wright was clearly the focus of the film and while he was interesting enough on his own as the film reaches its final act it begins to dawn that he is in the movie to serve a very obvious purpose. Neither John Connor nor Kyle Reese stand out as great characters. Christian Bale and Anton Yelchin have faces fit for big action-movies but as characters they unfortunately fall to the sidelines.Aside the action-scenes the most fun I had while watching the movie was spotting references to the old Terminator movies. The problem with this is also the main problem of the film itself, it's not the first tree movies. I'm a fan of the first one so it's hard to be objective but certainly this movie didn't exceed its excellence. The second one isn't my favorite but I thought it and the third movie out shined this one for over-all entertainment value.Terminator Salvation is definitely a good movie on its own but as a continuation of the legacy of the Terminator film-series it falls short of its predecessors and becomes just another chapter, not an epic.",6,0,1,8 June 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Surprisingly good!
","POTC 3 was pretty much what I expected, not nearly as good as the first film, but definitely better than the second. In all, despite its length, a brilliant movie altogether.POTC 3 has many things worthwhile about it. The cast which brings back Geoffrey Rush is just as memorable as before, but now the characters of all the characters are explored more deeply. This is a nice little improvement over the last film which seemed to be carried, more or less, by mere action-sequences.Variety in locations was also nice and the comedy is even sharper than before. I especially loved the bickering between Sparrow and Barbossa. Seeing Keith Richards was also impressive, though his role in the film wasn't at all what I was expecting. The multi-level story doesn't become convoluted even though it is a little heavy-handed at times.The one part of the movie that really got me by surprise was Jack's delirious visions in Davy Jones' Locker which can be considered almost borderline artistic.The only reason why I don't think it lives up to the first one is simply because I loved the more grounded feel of the first film. I doubt any future installments (given there will be any more) can ever really compete with the first one. Those of you, who've seen Dead Man's Chest, this film is a must-see and for POTC-fans it's going to be a blast.An excellent movie all around.",9,1,3,3 June 2007
X-Men," X-Men
","I am in no way a comic-book fan, but X-Men is one of my favorite comics and the movie adaption was incredibly well made.What this film did right was to capture the essence of the original comic, much like Hulk. The maker's already set the mood right with the shot of the concentration camp at the beginning and the film retains this tone all-through-out.The film also has a brilliant cast, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart pull off their roles as the two best recognised figures in the X-Men and Marvel universe. Undoubtedly the actor who always makes my day is Hugh Jackman, who is just perfect for the role of Wolverine. As such it's rather a pity that some of the other characters have a harder time standing out, but ones that definitely do are Rogue and Mystique.The film is not unfortunately flawless. Despite it's brilliant execution I always felt that the film lacked a certain amount of drama. Even though it is an excellent film, I still think that Hulk pulled it off better.",9,0,0,22 July 2006
Spider-Man 3," Notable improvement
","Having only seen the first one I can say for certain that Spider-Man 3 was a notable improvement. It finally takes on some of the traits more common with the comic-book and combines this with a plot that has both shades of comedy and tragedy.Spider-Man still lacks his internal monologues, but his musings at the beginning and the end of the movie were still a nice addition. Also, the plot and its many sides are what make this movie superior to the first. We get an entire story-arc's worth of plot in one film, rather than having to buy anywhere between 2-20 issues of any Marvel comic book.The film also gave me new respect for the Sand Man which I had previously considered to be one of the lamer villains in the Spider-Man roster. Harry's role is also wonderfully diverse this time and Eddie Brock also known as Venom is also very convincing.Aside this the plot is very dark at times such as when Spider-Man begins to succumb to his darker side with his second encounter with Sandman. On the other hand great comedy is spread throughout, such as the kid in the Spider-kiss scene, Jameson's buzzer and better yet, Parker's ego-trip after exposing Brock.The only slight point of criticism is probably that as a villain, Venom didn't get to shine a lot, but his story-arc was also handled extremely well so his ultimate fate was only minor hinderer to the viewing experience.Also the ending was wonderfully whole.",9,4,8,18 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Best of both previous films...
","Resident Evil: Extinction is all that I hoped and feared it would be. Like 'At World's End' and Terminator 3 it is an improvement over its immediate predecessor but doesn't challenge the original in it's design. One thing I was happy to see is that the film seems to combine the best elements of its two predecessors.The film has a real feel of expansion. It feels like a natural continuation of the plot and it also manages to stand out in ways that its predecessor quite didn't. The amount of memorable scenes is admirable, the surprising opening, the zombie crows, the truck-explosion and the showdown between Isaacs and Alice. I'm also happy to see more characters from the games making the jump to the silver-screen, though admittedly Claire comes off as being more of a short-hand replacement for Jill from the last film. Lots of tragic stuff happens and emotionally the movie remains satisfyingly between dark and a slight shade of hope.The way the film seems to land itself between the last two is in a few noticeable elements. Like Apocalypse, the film has a strong and a varied cast of characters and plenty of exciting action-sequences. Like the first movie, it's pleasing to the eyes and the soundtrack has also changed to the electro-rock similar to the first film. These all make the movie at least an enjoyable audio-visual experience.One major point of criticism I can think of is the redneck scene which seemed to simply be an excuse to reintroduce the dogs and didn't really move the plot along. However, what bothers me most about this movie is the ending. I had been hoping for some closure for the franchise, but not only does the plot branch out further, it does so by splitting in two halves, Alice and Claire's. This on one hand makes me want to hope that they fill in the gaps so that we will see what becomes of Claire and yet at the same time I'm worried the Alice-story is gonna be taken too far.Also, I like trilogies much better than tetralogies.",8,0,3,9 December 2007
The Terminator," Brilliant Movie, Excellent Soundtrack
","Arnold Schwartzenegger's claim to fame differs from most B-movies that it has aged extremely well. James Cameron's haunting cinematography, great actor performances and above all, a brilliant baddie make this a memorable film. Arnold Schwarzenegger almost doesn't feel human anyway, so in this movie he's perhaps showing off a characteristic that you don't find in just any actor.What still makes this movie extremely worth-while too is the excellent soundtrack. Though done entirely on a synthesizer, it sounds brilliant and fits the action like a glove. Big props to Brad Fiedel. Also, unlike some other typically violent movies, this one keeps everything fresh and doesn't become boring or repetitive. The relentless grind of the Terminator's hunt gives the film a truly successful feeling of suspense.A unique film and a stand-out product of the 1980s.",9,0,1,3 December 2005
Silent Hill," It's a new favourite!
","Though having not played the games I could say that Silent Hill was everything I hoped for. It was creepy, cool, dark and just bizarre. I actually went to see this film for the creatures and I was definitely not disappointed. There's something so utterly sick about the monsters of Silent Hill that makes me all giddy inside.Also, the film makers made a move that has unfortunately not been done enough in other video game movies in my view, which was using the games' soundtracks. The music in this movie is simply brilliant.Having said this all the only real disappointments for me were Sean Bean's character who didn't get to do much during the entire film and the ending which was too ambiguous in my view and didn't have the level of closure I had hoped for.Regardless, this is a brilliant video game movie, and probably the first one to have taken a major leap in its plot writing.",9,2,4,12 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Best Star Wars Movie, ever...
","Return of the Jedi has everything. Good acting, brilliant visual effects, a dark story but light-humor at the same time. Better yet, this is the type of end to a trilogy that I always enjoy. Though I was saddened to see that the Ewok Celebration got cut in later versions of the film, it is still the greatest Star Wars movie in the series.Particularly the last fight between Vader and Luke is one of my favorites in the series and though it is not nearly as intense as the fights of the prequel-trilogy its story-significance gives it a type of status that just turns it in to an instant golden memory.Also the very melancholic elements near the end make the movie an almost spiritual experience for me.And a few words to people who don't like Ewoks. You take the series too seriously. Get over your hatred for cute and cuddly aliens and start worrying about something real, like the green-house effect.A Great Ending to a Great Series of Films.",10,1,3,2 December 2005
Alien," 'In space no-one can...' etc.
","The originator of the Alien film franchise has aged well for a science fiction horror tale. Ridley Scott's knack for making visually impressive films really shows and the world owes him and H. R. Giger for creating one of the most memorable monsters in film history.Having said that, Scott's film has never been my favorite of the franchise. The opening is as impressively artistic as it is, regrettably, boring. The cast minus Ian Holm and Sigorney Weaver all lack the much needed element of personality and Scott's loose directorial approach makes the dialogue sound really indifferent. The intensity does begin to pick up after the first act but at no point do the actors really stand out in my view. Even John Hart only stands out because of the chest-burster scene.The film however has enough memorable scares and moments that it does keep you entertained. However, in the areas of narrative, direction and pacing I feel this movie is the least powerful in the franchise.",7,1,3,13 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A great-looking but ultimately pointless film
","Rewritten on December 30th -06.Attack of the Clones is the weakest film in the Star Wars saga of George Lucas. The problem with any middle-chapter in a trilogy is that it has no beginning nor an ending. Whereas Empire compensated by having interesting environments and humour, Episode II is not so lucky.Out of the the four films directed by Lucas, this has the worst acting out of all of them. Hayden Christensen is extremely stiff and can't seem to deliver lines with passion or even the appropriate level of intensity. Natalie Portman begins to suffer from the over-acting syndrome which was most prominent in Episode III, but here she also has difficulty sounding credible.My favorite character in the prequel trilogy has always been Obi-Wan, played by Ewan McGregor, but I always felt that Lucas attempted too hard to emphasize the tense relationship between him and Anakin and this hurts the film again. Additionally, Jango Fett never manages to capture the mystery of his son, Boba.The film is visually impressive, sounds brilliant and even has a nice plot, but its blown flat in places by bad acting and in others by generally nonsensical elements. Though it was funny the first time I saw it, Yoda's lightsabre fight with Dooku did not enhance the film nor did it advance the plot in any way.And though we see C-3PO and R2D2 working together as a comic-duo for the first time (chronologically) there isn't enough witty dialogue to save the film.Resultedly, the weakest film in the series.",7,0,1,2 December 2005
Predator," God bless Arnold Schwarzenegger
","As I've said before, nobody goes to see a Schwarzenegger film for good pronunciation. It's really a shame the governator is no longer doing movies since his ultimate coolness factor makes any film he's in worth watching, no matter how bad.The Predator is a cute concept, but unfortunately it is less a science fiction movie and more of a Schwarzenegger movie. The opening is rather standard for action-films of the time and undoubtedly everything could have been a little cleaner. What the movie eventually amounts to is the final act and I thoroughly enjoyed the showdown between Arnold and the Predator.Sadly, what potential the movie could have had is slightly lost to its somewhat shoddy production, but it is an exciting and an interesting action movie, though far from the best of them. Even so the movie still has Schwarzenegger, guns, profanity, explosions and a guy in a monster suit.",7,0,1,19 July 2007
Watchmen," A mental exercise
","Watchmen is not like your typical comic-book movie. Rather than trying to tell a story, it's more of a speculative work that takes the form of a comic book and flips it into a twisted parody and a simultaneous mental exercise for the audience. It's parallels to other better known comics and their characters are perhaps pointless and it's hard to write a review of the film without attempting at least convey the philosophical edge this movie has over most of the competition.One thing which shines through the adaptation of comic to film is that it feels almost like it's trying a little too hard to be a movie. The film suffers from being too wordy and not utilizing a movie format for it's deep philosophical probing of the human mind. It does get its commentary on nuclear warfare and humanity's inhumane nature across with the bluntness of a sledgehammer for which the film really can't be criticized since that is obviously the whole point of the movie.The thing which Watchmen really needs and consequently lacks however is an interesting visual narrative. Things progress simply because they seem to need to do so and yet in such highly reality-based comic book setting the progress feels a little forced. Yet it feels like it drags on a bit, especially in the beginning, the problem may however be that the film simply doesn't confine to the basic structure of a movie and that's why it feels a little awkward. 90% of the whole movie is setup for a climax that isn't really all that climactic.It's a little hard for me to put this movie in frank comparison with other Super Hero movies because it clearly plays with its own set of rules. Really all I can offer is my humble opinion, it's a good film with a deep psychological plot which none-the-less irks me in its attempts at being cinematic.",8,1,6,6 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beginning to a Great Fantasy Epic
","'The Fellowship of the Ring' is an excellent movie. Very charming and personified. The story at this point in the film seems well organised as opposed to the later 'Return of the King' where the characters seem to get lost due to the size of the film.Undoubtedly there were a lot of deviations from the source material, but I think that only helped the movie gain more momentum which I feel is very important in any film-adaption. Jackson has a way of inserting funny little moments that also make the movie all the more memorable and already the action-scenes are very convincing although 'The Two Towers' is undoubtedly the real action-packed section of the film-trilogy.If there's anything I don't like about this film is that the opening seemed to glance over many of the events quite quickly. Of course this was used as an excuse to return to these events later in the film and the series, but in comparison I had always liked Bakshi's LotR opening a lot better.Regardless, this is a fantastic film.",9,2,3,3 December 2005
Pitch Black," You're not afraid of the dark, are you?
","There isn't much that I can say about Pitch Black that hasn't already been said: it's dark, low-budget and brilliant.Riddick is one of my favorite characters in cinema, alongside Darth Vader, Bond and Jack Sparrow. Vin Diesel has a type of menacing presence that only very few actors can achieve. The over-all grading of the film also gives us a nice and unsettling atmosphere, and a little bit of dark irony keeps the film alive.I guess it's a bit of a bummer that I saw Chronicles before Pitch Black since I already knew the outcome, but as a science-fiction suspense film (I don't like the term 'horror') it is a major success as well as a bit of an unconventional drama.",9,0,0,22 August 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," He's back!
","Terminator 3 was a positive surprise for me. It has all the essential hard-hitting action and narrative of the first two movies, but does away with the unnecessary emotionalism of the second. Terminator 3 is like T2 with more serious intent. I was particularly happy to see Arnold return to the role where he is ultimately at his best. Additionally the movie introduces a new cast of characters which manages to bring a truly more human element into the film. Additionally the action-sequences, while somewhat over-sized still keep you interested in the movie.What was also a noticeable improvement over the last film is the emphasis on the story which progresses in an admirable but not a hectic pace. Also comedy evens out the film so that it doesn't turn into a monotonous experience. The films visual effects are also magnificent.In some aspects the film will never be as classic as the Jim Cameron original. The soundtrack seems to have receded and I can't say I was attracted to the film's score. This is a bit of bummer since the film is otherwise so excellent. Particularly what I was happy with was the fact that we finally saw what the second movie should have shown us: Judgement Day. The film's climax is the ultimate pay-off to a fan such as me. Terminator 3 brings the glory back into the series even if it can never compete with the original.",9,2,3,9 December 2007
U-571," Brilliant War Drama
","Where U-571 lacks in historical accuracy it makes up with an incredibly believable cast and extremely well paced drama. The tension feels real as do many parts of the film, but it does not become too preachy or try to force ideals where they don't belong. It is also not overly patriotic which is a trait I enjoy in most war-films.The actors have great line delivery and the film never falls short even in its more action-based scenes.Before watching a movie like this you have to ask yourself if you're willing to believe what is happening in the movie. If you're not you shouldn't watch it. If you are, then you're in for a great experience.",10,1,9,24 December 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Iconic but over-rated...
","Terminator 2 is a film that I would like to like but can't. There are parts of it I genuinely enjoy but at the same time it doesn't have the appeal or seriousness of its predecessor or the inherent entertainment value of its immediate sequel.James Cameron's direction and visual style are what make the film look good. But as much as certain scenes from the film remind me of the first movie it never feels as good and dark as the first movie. The emphasis on even bigger action-scenes didn't impress me and only the T-1000 has stuck in my mind visually from this entry in the series.Arnold Schwarzenegger's role reversal from the previous movie is a refreshing touch but one that is undermined as the Terminator loses more and more of its cold and calculating robot mentality. Becoming a big buddy to the young John Connor is the reason why the ending of the film is so heart-breaking, but the change occurs in such a way that it feels like a very flippant change in direction from the first film.But maybe I'm too in love with the darkness of the first film and just a tad too sarcastic to enjoy the film's balance of action, narrative and drama. But for me the movie feels long, drawn out and not nearly as dramatic as the first or the third entry in the series. For entertainment value at least it beats the fourth easily but as iconic a film as it is to most people, for me it's just over-rated.",7,1,3,26 June 2009
Van Helsing," Almost like Castlevania
","Hugh Jackman is definitely the Clint Eastwood of our generation. On screen he has such a presence that the viewer can't be but fascinated and wonder what is he thinking right now. In this severely under-rated Monster-Fantasy-Adventure Jackman performs the role of vampire-hunter/monster-slayer Van Helsing.The movie appears to have various flares to it. From James Bond to Castlevania which is something I really enjoyed. As far as werewolves go, I thought the CG on most of the creatures was very well done as were the computer-effects in most parts of the movie. The additional comic elements also give the movie extra-life.Even so certain parts of the film were perhaps a bit goofy, but all in all this is a brilliant adventure. Long live Hugh Jackman!",8,2,4,3 December 2005
Spider-Man," Every web-slinger has his day.
","Spider-Man is so far my biggest disappointment when it comes to super-hero movies.Okay, the film had great action-scenes, special-effects and fairly good humour. Problem is that the whole film seemed too distanced from the original comic-book. I didn't mind Spider-Man's web being organic, what I had wanted was to actually hear Peter's internal monologue, similarly to the 90s Spider-Man cartoon and the original comics. It could have provided so much insight and second narrative type energy to the film. As is, it feels like the film-makers exiled me from Parker's mind.Another problem was the villain. Okay, it's true that Spider-Man doesn't exactly have the best villains-galore around, but the film-maker's attempt to actually make the Green Goblin cool just felt like a wasted effort. I just don't find the Green Goblin to be a particularly interesting villain.As such I really felt that this movie did not succeed in bringing the comic to the big screen, and I am only going to see another Spider-Man flick once they give me what I really want, which is Venom.",6,0,1,23 July 2006
Aliens," A Brilliant Space Adventure
","'Aliens' from James Cameron is his definite second-best film he produced in the 80s, second only to his true classic 'The Terminator'. This sequel is simply amazing in it that it manages to be far superior to its predecessor.The film is filled with Cameron's brilliant attention to detail when it comes to Science Fiction. He expands the concept of the Aliens far more and does it without any irky add ons. Additionally the film is filled with many brilliant memorable moments, backed by an excellent soundtrack and Cameron's nightmarish set-design.Sigorney Weaver and Michael Biehn are only two people in the extremely talented cast which is just quirky enough to be memorable, but not so much that it would distract the viewing experience. Add to this some of the best action-sequences ever put on film and you've got 'Aliens'.Recommendable for anyone with even the slightest interest in SciFi.",9,3,5,9 February 2007
Resident Evil," Different and very cool...
","Rewritten on: 10.9.06Let's get one thing straight. This film is not a horror-movie. Horror-movies are lame. Resident Evil is anything but lame.Almost everything about this movie is excellent. The atmosphere kicks ass and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The over-all feeling is rather abstract, but not so much that it would make the film difficult to follow.This film is also not a Zombie-movie in the traditional sense, but more like an action-thriller...with zombies. As far as movie-monsters go the Licker was a great piece of work, even if in the earlier scenes it was a little dumpy-looking. The only other notable point that I may criticize is that up to the halfway point of the film it perhaps attempted too many times to startle the viewers which seemed a little goofy.As a final note, the ending crawl is one of the best I've seen in any film to date. Even if the film's plot (which I felt was on par with the games) is nowhere near as good as in Silent Hill, this is still my personal favorite on the front of video-game films.",9,4,8,2 December 2005
Quantum of Solace," An over-all impressive film
","Daniel Craig continues to offer us more of his specific type of Bond. He's blunt and straight-forward, his witticisms aren't as colourful but he has a lot of heart. This movie ties up the loose ends from the previous one and in that manages to not only match its quality but also go beyond.The film has a feel of a good Bond film. The story has a global feel, but instead of being driven largely by action, Bond makes some smart choices and over-comes all odds with determination. This is one of the best aspects of this film since it seems to have a clear on-going narrative and the motives of the characters are much more clear this time around.It's also nice to see old faces returning. Olga Kurylenko performs well, although her performance may seem very familiar to those who've seen her in Hit-man and Max Payne. She none-the-less provides the film with a fairly sympathetic female lead. I was also happy to see the film have a little bit more levity to it which helps balance its more grittier and serious parts.Over-all, Quatum of Solace feels like a whole film. My biggest regret is that some of the action-scenes, while appropriately intense were a little difficult to follow due to violent camera-shaking. Beyond this minor flaw the film is a definite step up for Craig and the current Bond-series. I can't wait to see what's in store next.",9,3,7,7 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," The Ultimate Showdown
","Alien vs. Predator is precisely the kind of movie I had expected. It's gritty, action-packed and dark but filled to the brim with cool moments that make it fun to watch. As this is a Paul Anderson film the visuals and the sound have been done brilliantly but its also structured and paced in a very cool way.Actually I was a little concerned that the movie was a quite bit shorter than the other movies in the Alien-franchise, but the usual 90 minute-structure of Anderson's films is nice in that the movie never feels like it's dragging along. The film also has many humorous moments to keep it from becoming too serious.The only criticism I can point out is that the film does feel a little too much like a blast from the past. Alien and Predator were both more effective back in the days of Cameron and that's probably a feeling that isn't gonna go away no matter how much you like the film.All I can say is that Anderson did a great job in bringing the two franchises together and created a film that is fun to watch.",8,2,3,2 July 2007
Batman Begins," Big, Bad Bat is Back!
","Batman Begins seemed like a very unenthusiastic film at first, given that all the great Batman villains (the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman, Riddler, Two-Face and Mr. Freeze) had already had their moment in the spotlight. I initially thought very little of the Scarecrow. I was amazed at this film.Actually, I may had been blown away by the brilliant cast including such names as Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Michael Caine. Reagardless, Batman Begins was a big, dark film with lots of action and great characters.The feel is very different from the Burton-Schumacher Era, but that luckily only gives the film what it needs to stand out. A few scenes were a bit corny and did not quite match the over-all tone of the film, but otherwise, this is a brilliant return for the Dark Knight.",9,0,0,20 July 2006
Man on the Moon," Amazing Tale
","What's so great about Man on the Moon is that it shows that Carrie can make a movie that's both fun and serious. And this time it's not just playing a fun character in a serious film. Re-enactments of the scenes from Taxi were particularly memorable but everything else that made Andy Kaufman such a strange and interesting character is just as interesting. Whether you enjoy his bizarre antics or his unwillingness to become just another comedian, the film is bound to entertain you with its bizarreness and thoughtfulness.What makes the film stand out is its earthiness. This is an amazing story of an amazing man.",10,0,0,2 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," All around a strong film...
","I was very concerned that the latest addition to the X-Men movie series would be just a brain dead special-effects extravaganza. I have never been this happy about being wrong.What X-Men 3 offers is not just more impressive special-effects and a few new characters. The movie also has a story, a dramatic story and in many ways an ultimate story. Many things change in this film and it is all for the best. This shows that it's not the comic-book, but something much, much more. And as such the film impresses me to a degree equal with the first film where strong themes and actors come together.While all the characters don't get a whole lot of screen-time, most are established quite well and I was especially taken with Kelsey Grammar's performance.The only criticism that I think this film warrants that it perhaps downplayed Scott's death to a certain degree, or perhaps it just seems insignificant due to events elsewhere in the film. I have never been the Cyclops's biggest fan, but did feel a little sorry over this fact.None the less, a spectacular and strong addition to Marvel's impressive library of Comic Book Movies.",9,0,1,19 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," In spite of heavy deviations, a great movie...
","The Two Towers really feels like a Medieval action-movie. Though Jackson deviates a bit more from the source-material than in the last film, in some ways this manages to enhance the film. I for instance was not distracted by Gandalf exorcising Saruman out of Theoden and actually felt it was ten times a cooler moment than in the books.Viggo Mortensen aka Aragorn now really takes charge for the first time and truly shines as the hero of this film. Gollum's addition to the movie also makes it a lot more powerful (he's so creepy). Unlike some, I have always enjoyed Gimli's excellent comic-performance.This is a solid films from start to finish and in my view the best LotR film. It even manages to out-do the follow-up 'The Return of the King'.Jackson has created a truly great series of films.",10,0,0,3 December 2005
School of Rock," Heavy Metal and Little Kids
","Family comedies are not a genre I regularly watch and I had a lot of reservations to actually watch the School of Rock, even after I had bought the 'Tenacious D' album and been convinced by Black's musical talents and comical delivery. When compared for instance against the comical-portrayals of Martin Lawrence Black's has a lot less irks and his craziness is simply enjoyable, similarly to Jim Carrey.Plot-wise the movie is of course a bit of a stretch but the feeling is right and there's nothing horribly cheesy about it which makes it easy to watch even for a more mature viewer. I may be a bit biased given that I listen to so much Heavy Metal, but I did think that the musical input of Black and the Kids was pretty damn good.The film is of high quality and very enjoyable, though I think they could have had a better ending.",8,1,2,13 August 2006
Gran Torino," Coolness factor: Through The Roof
",Clint Eastwood delivers another film with a sympathetic storyline about real human-values that is brought to life by interesting characters and a frank attitude towards the Bullshit of Life.This is a movie that delivers on many levels. It's mundane suburban-American setting with a war-time history background gives the movie a firm background. It's this relative mundaneness that helps maintain a realistic and natural habitat for the film's characters. The multi-cultural aspect of the film is also handled with a nice but not overt fish-out-of-water scenario.Walt's character delivers the rest to make the movie whole. A seemingly racist but at heart just a simple and frank character who has an edge to him and fights for what he sees is right. His interaction with Thao and Sue creates the film's warmth and his encounters with the gang-members provide Eastwood with a chance to play his grittier side.The great thing about the movie is that it doesn't put itself decisively on anyone's side except that of the common man who wants to get on with life. The film's climax is perhaps a little predictable and its only weakness but the conclusion leaves the viewer with a good feeling once the credits start to roll.,9,1,5,10 April 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A fun sequel
","The second Fantastic Four movie is all-around a fun action-packed adventure flick but not a substantial improvement over the last film. What's very prominent in this film (more than perhaps in any other Marvel Film) is the element of campy comedy which undoubtedly is what keeps the film afloat through it's less action-packed segments.All in all, it's nice to see the movie carries the torch of the previous one rather valiantly though you are left with a feeling that they could have done more to spice up the film. In all characterizations were okay and it's also nice to see some more character development for Johnny but the rest of the team weren't as prominent for some reason.The action is great, the comedy is nice and the plot and cast are solid. On all accounts 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a good (but not great) comic-book movie.",8,1,3,23 August 2007
Transformers," More than meets the eye...
","Transformers is a movie that makes you go 'WHOA!' when you first see it. When you calm down from the high you come to realise that in the end 'it is just an action movie'. But a very good action movie none the less.Fans of the toy-line and cartoons series should be proud. Michael Bay has brought us a formidable adaption with the best CGI money can buy and crunched out a story that isn't too corny for the average viewer and which also combines great action and special effects with tons of silly humour which prevents the film, in all its massiveness, from becoming horrifically dull.The film also has a well executed human-story, but by the end of it you kinda realise that this stuff was really intended for the kids. None the less, Transformers is a formidable piece of cinema, not a life-changing movie, but one that both kids and parents ought to like.Transformers have arrived.",7,0,4,8 July 2007
Event Horizon," The Hell from Space
","Not being the biggest fan of horror-films I must admit that Event Horizon is an extremely competent production in spite of its unsightly gore. The characters and the concept of space travel, which is interestingly rather accurate, give the film a much needed grounding before the real horror elements start to kick in.This movie can be considered a lot of things... 'Hellraiser in Space', 'The Shining in Space' but ultimately it borrows from so many sources that it's impossible to name any single source. In this pieced-together fashion the film works the same way casting actors of various types works well. Fisburne and Sam Neill are the dramatic heart of the film and Anderson's regular, Jason Isaacs, gives a typically strong performance.However, the film does use plenty of conventional horror-film elements and some of these are rather distracting. The ending for instance may not necessarily lack closure, but it may not be the type of closure I was looking for.All in all, however, a film worth seeing.",8,0,1,23 February 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Watchable Sequel, RE 4 life
","Rewritten on: 10.9.06 As far as sequels go, RE: Apocalypse does not quite live up to its predecessor but definitely makes the effort to tell a story in an exciting way. I may sound rather ignorant saying this, but I do consider action a rather safe genre. Remember that this is not a horror-film nor really a zombie-film but an action film...with zombies.Where the plot may be lacking it rather well mirrors that of the games. The main-reason I like this movie is the characters. The over-all look of the film is also something I enjoyed though it wasn't quite as impressive as the cold visual appearance of the first film. Musically the film unfortunately did not have the same level of electronic ominous presence as the first.One of my favorite elements in this film is Nememsis. He has a bizarrely demanding presence. I also thought it was kinda cute how they tied up the loose end from the last film with him.While it is nowhere as good as its predecessor the film is definitely watchable, its stunts and visual effects work brilliantly and the movie assures that the viewer will never have a dull moment.Hardcore RE fans however, don't bother.",7,0,1,2 December 2005
The Dark Knight," A Strong Film (that leaves you with a hint of dissatisfaction)
","After Batman Begins rebooted the film-series with a dark, stylistic and very okay style The Dark Knight attempts to match it and go further. While the film has many strong themes about sanity, loss and corruption it somehow doesn't bring them all together as well as the first film but still manages to keep the film afloat. But for some the movie may be even a little too twisted.One thing which this film pulls off well is plot-twists. Tons of them. It seems like the film-makers wanted to avoid the obvious to an almost ridiculous degree. While I commend their efforts it makes the film extremely treacherous to watch the first time because quite frankly a lot of stuff comes in from the left field. Some of the twists work, others don't, at times the film seems to have too many badguys since you can never quite remember if Batman is fighting the Joker or the mobsters.What can I say about the performances. All the returning cast-members were still great. I'll be a little disappointed if I don't see Morgan Freeman in the next film as he somehow has left his essence into both of the Batman films. Two-Face was a bit of a surprise and I hadn't expected to play a role in this film. However, I was definitely not let down by his character and his scenes were probably the ones I enjoyed the most.Heath Ledger as Joker is alright, but I have to say I was a little disappointed that he didn't steal the scene at every turn. Instead the thing which his portrayal of the character seemed to do most was jump up from behind someone while pointing a gun. But once he gets into the mania of things Ledger does perform well, but this Joker just doesn't stand out well enough after Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and Mark Hamill have already given us such memorable interpretations of the character.Over all The Dark Knight wasn't the Batman film I had hoped for, but it was a strong film none the less. The one thing I was most happy with was that I got to see the Bat-signal smashed (because aside the Bat-hotline from the 60s show, its about the silliest and most redundant aspect of the Batman Universe in my view).",8,2,5,30 July 2008
Taken," Over the top, but excellent...
","While watching Taken I was reminded of several other 'Lost Child' films and surprisingly the one which first came to mind was Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando. Specifically this movie is what that movie should have been like. Liam Neeson outshines Arnold with a witty and far more sympathetic and charismatic character portrayal.The film's plot is simple but has enough twists and texture to make it into a fulfilling experience. The film takes many turns and even goes on the verge of moral ambiguity but Neeson's charisma pulls the film through even its more preposterous segments.However, it's perhaps of the film's over-the-top nature why it will never reach the same classic and timeless status as Flightplan or Frantic. The film stands out well for its relative grittiness but also suffers slightly from it. The film is a pleasure to watch especially since it offers so many memorable moments and for once an appropriately up-lifting closure.",8,5,7,15 January 2009
Psycho," A great chiller
","Psycho combines the intensity of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller with the creepiness of a slasher film. The combination works well to provide a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but which still has the stillness and conventional look of an old movie.The plot is very simple but provides a frame for an interesting narrative. Hitchcock's excellent photography makes this movie stand out and the casting is spot on with all the characters appearing distinct. I also appreciate that there is not so much over-acting which tends to be the case with many older films and it helps to bring the film a type of soberness but thankfully it doesn't suck the life out of the film like it does with many other films.The film does have a few weaknesses, I've always had a sense that Norman is not as innocent as he appears and the film goes perhaps into too much detail on how he covers up for the murder. The film could have done with less. Also, the psychiatrist at the end hams up the tone of the film just a tad too much and is one of the few things about the film I've never enjoyed.However, over-all Psycho lasts the test of time.",8,0,0,19 August 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A well-paced action romp
","Transformers 2 succeeds in what every sequel should strive to achieve. The film is just as silly and entertaining as its predecessor. Sadly, it also falls victim to the obvious problem of sequels that follow their predecessors exactly, it doesn't manage to exceed or stand apart from its predecessor enough to be considered the better movie.The film has a good structure and manages to pace action, (over) dramatic story-telling and comedy incredibly well. This is evidenced by the fact that while the movie is considerably longer than the first it doesn't feel like the movie is dragging on. The moments of levity and humorous voice-acting from the Transformers cast are what keep the film from becoming too monotonous to bare.The film has its weaknesses though. Sometimes the comedy crosses the line between being appropriate and being just too much the focus of a scene. The action-scenes are still preposterously huge and difficult to follow. While we get to see new Autobots they are mostly kept to the sidelines and don't have a chance to show a lot of personality. The Decepticons are all gray in colour except the most humongous of them, and mainly they seem animal shaped for no apparent reason.The biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't bring anything new to the mix. The cast is almost entirely the same. The novelty of the first film is now replaced with the story of the Decepticons arriving in Earth long before the two films' events. And despite all the fan outcry we still don't hear the Transformers Theme Song.But in every area the film succeeds in mirroring its predecessor and is by all accounts a good movie if not a stand-out film.",7,28,51,30 June 2009
Con Air," 'One move and the bunny gets it!'
","This was a bizarre experience. I've seen this movie a few times before, but only now after having played GTA: San Andreas did this movie hit me in a way unlike before. This is 'the film' that GTA ripped off, but in context I think the game had a better plot.The cast is just classic, but the problem is that this film confines a little too heavily into its Jerry Bruckheimer -formula and turns into a rather standard action-film. That is not to say the movie isn't fun to watch or that the stunts or special-effects aren't high quality. Story-content wise it's a bit of a let down.This film can be recommended to those who love a good dose of action. If you're looking for something deep, look somewhere else.",7,0,1,27 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A fun movie for the fans
","In Episode III Lucas worked most of the irks out of his direction (or the lack there of) and Ewan McGregor finally got a beard which demands respect.Though many would tell you this movie is the best in the prequel-trilogy I have to say that I would rather watch the colorful adventure of Episode I than this overly dark creation. Christensen's performance is now a little better than in the last film, but that might be just his hair-style.Visually this is extremely impressive and I found myself enjoying all the references to the original trilogy so much that it really made the movie all the more enjoyable. However, for non-fans this film might seem very distant. Sure, there's a kick-ass fight-scene in the end but there are also other things to like about this film. Particularly the Frankensteinism of Darth Vader's awakening scene.Episode III however offers little to anyone who is unfamiliar with the rest of the saga. This is a competent entry into the last trilogy but not a stand-out movie by any measure.",9,1,4,2 December 2005
Halloween," Stylish Horror
","Though Halloween can be said to be the grand-daddy of the modern teen-slasher, its actually its lack of gore and an emphasis on stylish, cinematic execution that makes it stand out. John Carpenter's cinematography and music make this movie just a pleasure to watch.Jamie Lee Curtis stands out as young actress who really can act. Her character seems real and the sympathy for her character is only enhanced by the light-hearted comedy in her interaction with the film's two main child-actors. It's a cheap trick, but it works. Her line delivery definitely deserves credit as many old horror-films of the 70s are rather notorious for featuring young incapable actors which really just makes you want them to get killed even more.Donald Pleasence, who has earned my interest for his performance in the George Lucas art-piece THX-1138, is the film's true male-lead and adds a gravitas to the film. Between him, Curtis and the masked Shape lies the dramatic core of the film which keeps you watching even when you can already begin to suspect the ending.The only thing this movie lacks is a finishing touch with some profound meaning knitted into the film's slasher-formula. The sequels obviously tried to build on this (some more successfully than others), but even with the slight void Halloween just stands out in the field of slasher-films by being a stylish film.",8,0,1,2 October 2008
Iron Man," A fun and serious film
","Iron Man has a nice contrast for an action movie. It has a gritty theme to it which is derived from real life and yet it's able to hyper it up without becoming totally unappreciative. The performances, special-effects and cinematography of the film all work for the comic-book movie.The only problem I see with the film is that it fails to set itself firmly apart from the rest of the Marvel Mythos Films. It has its own cast of characters but they all appear to be hand-me-downs from the rest of the Marvel films in some ways. The climactic clash in the latter half of the film also felt predictably obvious. We already have the X-Men and Spider-Man movie franchises to offer us the big duke-it-out fights and I just wish they could have come up with something more original for Iron Man.Altogether Tony Stark has never been one of my favorite comic-book characters, but the movie version of Iron Man is none the less worthy of watching. I'll also probably want to see the sequel but it just fades in many ways when compared to the other Marvel Features.",8,1,3,4 May 2008
Blade Runner," A beautiful but hollow picture...
","Whereas most science fiction films often have trouble creating believable settings for their stories, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is something of an opposite. Visually it's a beautiful piece of cinema, but the plot and characters all seem to lack any kind of emotion.Add this to the film's rather relaxed pace and you have a film where after the first 15 minutes of watching special-effects you star peaking at your watch to see how much longer is it gonna take until something happens. The problem of the plot isn't so much that it doesn't work, but it's execution is just so miss-mashed with everything else in the film that it becomes tiresome to follow.The fact that everything about the film would make you wanna believe it's an action-movie doesn't help either. In the end the film is astonishingly beautiful science-fiction drama with a plot you couldn't care less about.Both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford have seen better days.",5,2,8,2 July 2007
Casino Royale," Strong opening for Graig
","Casino Royale is a Bond-film with all the right ingredients. Big actions sequences and clever dialogue. Additionally it manages to be different from previous Bond-films and manages to turn certain conventions on their ears with style. The films attempt at being darker is successful without the film becoming hopelessly bleak.Graig is also a very good Bond. He's charismatic and brooding like Timothy Dalton, but can still deliver Bond's typical witticisms naturally. He's still a bit of a tough case and not quite as clean as Connery or Brosnan, but definitely the type of Bond that the audience identifies with.Additionally the film manages to (re)start Bond's tale in a way that isn't too cheesy, though I undoubtedly did miss Q and Moneypenny. With all his got, Graig still does a good job.The only point of criticism is the slightly misleading parts of the film where the viewer thinks the movie is ending while in truth it is only entering its final act. This makes the film feel a little long. Still this is balanced out by the quirks of a fairly fresh 00-agent who still makes mistakes and pays a price for them.Regardless, this Bond-film had the most satisfying open-endings I have ever seen. I wait eagerly for what's in store for us in the next one.",8,0,2,3 December 2006
X2: X-Men United," The middle part of a Trilogy
","'X2' did not make a very strong impression on me, but like the middle parts of many movie trilogies (Star Wars I-III & IV-VI, Godfather) its significance only becomes apparent once you've seen all three films. In this sense X2 falls perhaps slightly short of its immediate predecessor and successor but is still an impressive movie.Everything is done professionally from the production side and the characters and their personal stories do colour the main plot nicely. In all it, however, doesn't feel as definitive a movie as it's predecessor and many of the events herein are only really setting up the third film.None the less, the film is impressive with its depictions of the characters and all around opening the X-Men Universe further to the cinema-screen. It's not as exciting as the other movies but a fair effort none the less.",8,0,0,19 July 2007
Rear Window," Simple but simply brilliant
","The concept of the Rear Window is so quaint its positively humbling. The idea of setting an entire film in just one location would seem like a major faux pas in a thriller film. However, the approach is justified, the viewer is subjected to the main character's point of view of the events which at the same time creates a small element of doubt as to what the viewer is seeing is really happening.The acting performances are old school, but they serve the style of the film and help it stay interesting. Hitchcock's films tend to have very good dialogue and I like listening to it.What surprises me about the film is how dark it is in spite of seeming so innocent. It has the elements of a great detective story but with a detective who can't leave the room. The one small special-effect moment at the end is probably the only part of the film that doesn't fully work but even it is a minor flaw in an otherwise marvelous movie which still holds up.",9,0,1,19 August 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Jackson's Trilogy Ends
","Jackson's adaption of the Lord of the Rings has been an excellent series of movies and my expectations were rather high for the third part. This is where the biggest weakness in Jackson's films strikes back. After sitting through two movies that were nearly 3 hours, I have to watch one more that is more than 3 hours. It's times like these that I wish that Jackson could've given me a break. And that's just the regular version, I have no desire to see the 'full-cut' of this picture.While 'Fellowship of the Ring' was quite charming and 'The Two Towers' a great action-packed film, Return of the King seems just a tad over-blown. Sure, there was a lot of warring in the book too, but this movie never stood out from the other two in any particular way. Though it has those nice little Jackson-moments, they tend to get lost in a film as big as this. I was also a little disappointed that some aspects of the plot (mainly Saruman's fate) are never really discussed.Once we get pass these I have to admit that many parts of the movie were most impressive and it is a great film and a must-see if you've already seen the first two.Regardless, I still feel it falls short of the first two.",8,0,1,2 December 2005
The Matrix," An Intriguing Film
","Watching 'The Matrix' for the first time is one of those occasions that really makes you go WTF! An intriguing and a rarely used concept is translated successfully to the screen. Far from being a brainless action- and effects-fest the film has a deep psychology behind it and the result is simply astonishing.The only problem with the film is that it is at its best when watched for the first time. After that the film kinda loses the intrigue it originally had and this may explain the rather lukewarm response of the film's sequels.As a cinematographic experiment the film is absolutely fantastic, keeping the viewer glued to their seat with an interesting but not at all complicated idea. After that one may only wish to see the film again for its groundbreaking special-effects.",8,0,1,15 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Low Budget Sci-fi at its best
","Lucas may not be a good director but Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are excellent actors so it doesn't really matter when you start watching this extremely amusing piece of cinema history. Part of the charm is probably the fact that it looks so cheap. You wouldn't imagine seeing claymation in a Star Wars films for instance. All the same, the films dwelling nature-shots are stunnig and ahead of their time.Though we only get one pretty uneventful lightsaber fight there is enough in the movie to digest that it doesn't start bugging you. Little errors in the worlds design (Latin lettering and such) don't derail the movie too much and in fact give it a kind of camp value.What's great is that you can watch this film as a single-parter, very much like Episode I without having to worry about potential plot-holes and some such.A very enjoyable film. Worth seeing.",8,1,2,2 December 2005
Fantastic Four," Fantastic!
","I like Fantastic Four, but the reasons are very different to why I like for instance X-Men, Hulk and Batman Begins (the latter two are in my view not even super-hero movies even though they get called that). What I like about Fantastic Four is that it acknowledges its rather goofy roots. We have a large guy made of rubble and we have a guy who stretches. Campy hilarity is bound to ensue so we might as well go with it.In spite of the comical elements the film luckily manages to touch upon the more serious themes and I personally thought Victor Von Doom kicked ass, because he wasn't being such a pompous villain. Fantastic Four is a breath of fresh air in the imperfect heroes category and a brilliantly funny film. It did have a few rushed elements, at the end we never quite got what was going on with Ben and Reed's machine. The important thing is that we got to hear those three wonderful words: 'Don't do Drugs!'... just kidding:IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!",8,0,1,22 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," To the Hoth System!
","Episode VI is a very mixed movie. I think it gets more appraisal than it deserves (though I admit that the acting is much better this time around). The movie also has a type of darkness that makes it different from the first.My problem with this film is very much the same as with Episode II. It always felt like 'Return of the Jedi: Part I' rather than its own movie. True it has great moments and surpasses Episode II in the amount of variety (Ep. II always looked very plain for some reason) but an open ending in films is something I look at with some reserve (except with Resident Evil).The good thing is that RotJ picks up soon after and we get a brilliant closure. Not the greatest film in my view, but a good film none the less.",8,1,2,2 December 2005
Goodfellas," A very good mobster film...
","'GoodFellas' is an interesting piece. It has the mobster-romance of Godfather and the gritty reality of Scarface all in one. Yet, it is perhaps less than the sum of all its parts. Mob-films aren't typically cheery or uplifting but keeping a safe-zone where the audience isn't too bothered by all the evil things going on screen is something I really missed and something which I think The Godfather succeeded much better in accomplishing.On its own the film is none the less fantastic. It feels like a twisted kind of reality where you're not exactly sure what's real and what's not. Perhaps I get a little squeamish when drugs become an element in the story but that might be just me. There is a great deal of irony in the film but it lacks the likability of The Godfather. On the whole that might not be a fair comparison as Coppola's films made up a saga where as this had to wrap the mobster tale in one movie. It's definitely a great film for fans of mobster films, but not a master-piece and way too gory and bleak. On the whole I thought the performances were, none-the-less, great. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci are amongst my favorite actors and each deliver a brilliant character to the screen.",8,1,3,10 August 2007
The Birds," A strange tale
","The Birds is an early example of great special-effects work combined with a good story. Hitchcock's suspenseful cinematography adds to the mix and the ambiguous ending is the cherry on top.Like many Hitchcock films the characters are played naturalistic which makes them interesting to the viewer. While there's quite a bit of dialogue most of it is well written and keeps the viewer invested in the film during its more quiet parts. The characters and their motivations are interesting as well.However, where the film stands out are its special-effects. With relatively simple technology Hitchcock brings the bird attacks to reality in a compelling way. The silent crows waiting for the school children is a creepy image that stays in your head. The sparrows coming down the chimney is an impressive effect and the seagulls wrecking havoc on the town are menacing in their chaos.Over-all the film's only weakness is that the pacing doesn't work quite well and the lack of dramatic music also takes away a little bit of the excitement. None the less, The Birds is still an effective picture.",8,3,5,19 August 2009
The Godfather," The quintessential mobster film
","The Godfather is a movie about gangsters. But more importantly, it's a film about gangsters that are also real people, with real relatives and family. The Godfather has all the makings of brilliant movie.The casting is classic with Marlon Brando's unforgettable interpretation of Vito Corleone and the level-headed and dark character of Michael, played by Al Pacino also in the film's two sequels. Aside from great characters the story, pacing and structure of the film has been designed in a way, that even after 2 hours of watching the same movie you still don't feel exhausted like you would with the 2+ hour epics of Peter Jackson.The movie is also incorrectly said to be dark and gory. Certainly the darkness is warranted, but the gore is set in the film rather sparingly and I would reckon the gore in the two later films much more disturbing, even if it's not as extensive. The violence is here to remind of us of the gritty reality of the film's world and it works in a same way as the great family-celebrations bring out the happier and lighter side of the life of a gangster.On all levels The Godfather is a brilliant picture. It's brilliantly acted, cast, directed and written. It is a movie with an old-timesy feel that feels fresh each time you watch it.",10,1,3,2 July 2007
