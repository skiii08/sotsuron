3:10 to Yuma," Bale and Crowe are awesome in this movie.
","3:10 to Yuma is a very good western film. It is high on themes and high on chase sequences and shootouts. The story concerns a small-time rancher who agrees to escort a captured outlaw to court in Yuma. Both the principal actors Christian Bale and Russell Crowe play off each other really well and in the end they have mutual respect for one another. Ben Foster, Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol are good support. James Mangold has a unique style- all his films the character development trumps action and 3:10 to Yuma has just that. Of course the action- especially the last 30 minutes is amazing. 8/10 (Bale and Crowe are awesome in this movie).",Null,1,2,15 November 2018
Aliens," A worthy sequel to Alien.
",Sequel to Scott's horror sci-fi masterpiece Alien is James Cameron's Aliens- a very well made 2nd chapter in the Alien saga which replaces creepy horror with all out action involving marines and machine guns. At the end of Alien Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was found floating in a pod. Upon her rescue by Weyland Yutani(the corporation that screwed her and her fellow crew members in Alien) she is told that there is already a terraforming colony on LV214(the space jockey planet) but contact has been lost for some time. She involuntarily agrees to join the team to go have a look. What follows is a fight to death between a bunch of marines and the evil Xenomorphs. Aliens is different in style and tone to Alien and that's a great thing. One of the few sequels that work so well.,Null,0,2,29 July 2018
When Harry Met Sally...," One of the greatest romantic comedies ever made.
","When Harry met Sally was a massive critical and box office success when it was released. This is a witty comedy set in the big apple and both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are in fantastic touch. They were both huge stars at the time and the respective king and queen of comedy, unarguably. The reason the film was so successful is because it taps into the omnipresent societal dilemma: Can a man and woman simply be friends and nothing more. Nora Ephron's screenplay is one of the finest examples of a funny screenplay and Rob Reiner is a master filmmaker who is in sublime touch here. If there is one comedy drama I would recommend you watch it is when harry met sally.",Null,2,3,12 July 2018
War of the Worlds," Spielberg launches you in the midst of a Martian invasion.
",This is a great movie based on the famed HG Wells novel of the same name. A list actor teams up with A list director to make a good entertaining film that needs to be appreciated. The effects of the alien tripods are amazing especially the sound design- they evoke fear. The plotting and pacing is efficient which should be expected from Spielberg and the acting is good. You know how the film ends and yet this film keeps you engrossed. If you haven't read the famous novel I suggest you read it before seeing this film.,Null,0,0,21 August 2018
