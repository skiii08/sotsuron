Howl's Moving Castle," U.S. Release Announced
","My family and I really enjoyed this movie. We saw it here in Japan last November, and today marks the movie's 121st day in release here (as of March 20). They are still advertising it here on TV, and along with the local and international release viewer numbers, the ads now include in big bold letters at the end the U.S. release date of June 10. Ghibli (Miyazaki) fans will of course enjoy this one, but I would recommend it for anyone. It has elements from virtually every movie Ghibli has done thus far, and fans will enjoy noting where they've seen certain themes and characters before. But it has certain qualities all its own. Fans of Diana Wynne Jones book will find that it takes a lot of liberties with the story. Not having read the book, I can't say too much on this, but I think those fans will still enjoy the movie a lot if they go in knowing that it is not a strict interpretation of the book.",10,2,3,19 March 2005
