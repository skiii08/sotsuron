The Blair Witch Project," I'm still convinced it's true!
","I, unlike most normal people went into this movie blind as to what it was even about. I had no clue what to expect. In fact, from the beginning of the movie to the end, I believed that what I was seeing on the screen was real. For this reason, I was pretty freaked out. I'm not a person that's easily fooled, but I definitely got taken for a ride on this one. I don't regret for one minute that I thought the whole story line was true film footage from a true documentary. It enhanced my fear and made me feel for the characters. This film could be compared to camping in the woods what Jaws was to swimming in the ocean! I'm impressed!",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
