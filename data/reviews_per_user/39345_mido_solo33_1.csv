Lucky Number Slevin," Over Amazing To Do This Movie On This Shape..... Great Director!!!!
","i really feel happiness to write ties comment on this great movie i love all movie that contain suspense and limited action and respect the movies that shows kinds of strange crime also i admire Director Paul McGuigan to make fantastic movie like this and arrange the events on this beautiful shape , trick me in slevin ..... But did you believe that slevin behind all of this terrible events sure this is the director skill and i thank him for carving out this suspenseful and well-sewn together crime-thriller Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are good, but the Man has to be Josh Harnett. He was good. wont give any thing away about the story.. just watch it and let the Film do the talking, Fans of the Gangster genre will love it!!.",8,0,3,19 September 2008
