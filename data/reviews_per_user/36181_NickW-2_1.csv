The Blair Witch Project," The most eerily disturbing film I've seen in a long while.
","I was just as skeptical about all the hype as many other people--I don't usually put much stock in critics these days.  However, this film very pleasantly surprised me on all levels, especially the acting and almost claustrophobic atmosphere.  First, I want to reiterate one crucial point many here have already stated:  imagination is required!  Granted, I was never utterly terrified or scared out of my wits during this film--I didn't ever jump out of my seat due to sudden fright or surprise (until the very end, anyway).  However, that was the whole idea: to create that uniquely chilling, unsettled feeling in your mind which stays with you throughout the entire film rather than for temporary, cheap shock value.  A lot of reviewers here have said they were disappointed they didn't get to actually see anything; however, I have to ask what exactly were they expecting?! This was never meant to be some big-budget, gore-fest ('Scream') or flashy visual-effects extravaganza ('The Haunting'); it was meant to play on those most basic and instinctual psychological fears which almost everyone feels at one time or another.  The film lets your imagination and emotions fill in the blanks, and this film accomplished that end brilliantly considering what they had to work with budget-wise.Even then, it wasn't so much the spooky sounds at night and various phenomenon they discover that disturbed me (though those scenes certainly sent chills down my spine).  Instead it was watching these three characters cope with an extreme situation, terrified out of their minds, and losing hope bit by bit (as does the audience) that they will make it out of their situation alive.  For the last half-hour or so, my heart was beating a mile-minute because I had become so engrossed in the interactions of these characters and what their eventual fates would be.  This aspect of the film is what really made it worthwhile for me.  The claim I've read so often that their behavior in that situation was unrealistic simply baffles me.  It seemed to me their emotions and reactions were perfectly on target considering their situation, despite whatever overacting there may have been at times.  Of course, anyone who picks at such a trivial thing as whether or not they would have kept filming during all this obviously wasn't very interested in the characters or plot to begin with--it's called 'suspension of disbelief'!  Anyway, the acting was, for the most part, excellent, especially Heather and Mike.  I did feel that they went a tad overboard at times with the screaming and yelling, but it still remained well within the bounds of believability (especially after Mike's little revelation--wonderful twist:-)In conclusion, this film was a wonderfully creepy, involving ride which had me riveted from beginning to end (a couple more phrases for those who thought the beginning was boring:  'foreshadowing' and 'character development').  This is one of those rare movies that occupied my mind for days after I saw it and that I definetly plan on seeing again.  It's hard to pick any one moment which creeped me out the most, but I have to say the ending alone was worth the price of admission--that is one image which will never leave my mind!  While I found the apparent fates of these characters disturbing enough, I can understand why some complained that there wasn't any concrete pay-off.  However, I find it strangely fitting:  these three people set out to investigate and possibly reveal the Blair Witch, yet the ambiguous ending merely fuels the myths and legends they started out with.",Null,1,1,9 August 1999
