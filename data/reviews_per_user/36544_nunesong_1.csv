Blade Runner 2049," I don't know what to say
","Is it our culture that cant accept this kind of film? But this film is very awful according to me, the effect and CGI is all perfect but the story... NAHH bro... I don't know how the film can hit that number, you know 8.7 (when i saw it) . I assume that our people cant accept this kind of movie. Keep up the good work tho but i am not going to watch the second movie, if there is the second movie. Thanks.",3,13,28,7 October 2017
