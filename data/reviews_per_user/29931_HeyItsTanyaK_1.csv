Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I loved this movie.
","Okay, look...there are some people who are ratting on this movie, saying 'It wasn't bloody enough' or 'There was no action' or 'It was thrown together'. It's not any of these things.  It's a great film that made me sit at the edge of my seat the whole time.  It wasn't supposed to be as bloody.  That was the point.  It was a more emotional view on the characters that effed Thurman over the worst.  Vernita and O-Ren were only the first and second. Budd, Elle, and Bill did her in the worst, so there was more depth, more emotion.  I think it worked.  And I have to disagree with the Bill's death and how some think it was 'stupid'.  Pei Mei obviously thought that Beatrix was worthy of knowing the five pressure point heart exploding trick, not Bill.  That says a lot, since Bill was Beatrix's master before Pei Mei. And I thought it was great that she killed him with a trick that 'Pei Mei never told anyone'.  It showed him!  It was also a dignified way to die, because Bill is a dignified man.  Or so he lets us on to believe.Being a HUGE fan of Kill Bill Vol. 1, I was shocked by Vol. 2, but in a good way.  It was a great effort, and I hope that Tarantino will actually do the rumored 'Kill Bill Vol. 3'.  I will be there, first showing.",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
