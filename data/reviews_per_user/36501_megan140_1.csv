The Ring," One big let down
","The plot was predicable and dull. Not the movie you want to see if you want to go see if you expect something good. The acting was okay but I wouldn't recommend the movie to any horror fan. You could guess the ending when the movie first started and everything in between was just to fill space. Everyone may say that this movie is so scary and full of suspense but if you're a real movie goer this movie it tasteless and dull. The Ring is a colossal waste of time and satellite frequency. Some of the actors over played their parts and some sounded like they were reading lines. The movie would have been better if those actors wouldn't have been in it. Want to see something really horrifying? Go stick your head in the toilet. What you will see in there is more scary than anything you will find in this flick. Startling? Maybe. Scary? Nope, try a different movie.",1,0,2,9 February 2007
