Ghost," One of my best films
","Well what can i say, this film is one of my best ever films, if you love a good storyline and romance then this is the film for you. It has romance, love, humour, great acting and more.Top actors / actress's make this film the best, everyone in this film played their part well, very well. I don't really have a bad thing to say about this film, it is a film i could watch over and over, i have always liked it since the first day i saw it many years ago. I would definitely recommend this film to people who love a good romantic film with top acting. I wasn't sure whether this film should have got a 9 / 10 or a 10 / 10, i went with 10 / 10 as i can not fault it at all.",10,1,1,4 March 2014
Shaun of the Dead," One of the best comedy horrors!
","This film has everything. A bit of horror, comedy, gore, good acting. Usually when i watch a 'comedy horror' it doesn't make me laugh, it bores me, its stupid and bad acting. With this film it is not like that. It made me laugh a lot, it is a film i could watch over and over. If you are looking for a GOOD comedy horror then i would recommend this one over any others.A fun film to watch with friends or family, a film that i am sure most people will enjoy.Nick Frost and Simon Pegg both are great actors and play great roles in this film, they both know how a comedy should be. I can't really fault this film, it has everything a comedy horror should.9 out of 10",9,1,3,3 March 2014
Beauty and the Beast," Lovely
","A beautiful animated film. I think any child would love this, even all of the family maybe, it is such a good 'classic' animated film. Everyone will know the story, i remember watching it as a child and it being one of my all time favourite stories/animated films.A lovely 'love' story that is very touching.I would recommend to people mainly with children, i think they are more likely to enjoy this type of animated film (adults may like it too, whatever genre you are into).Worth a 7 out of 10 at least.",7,1,1,7 March 2014
The Prestige," Twist after twist.
","Well at first i wasn't sure about this film, i looked who was in it and thought 'great actors, ill give it a try' and i am so glad i did, it is by far one of my best films. It is just twist after twist after twist and the film shocks you all the way through. The film itself is very clever and well thought out.The actors play their part amazingly and perfectly. To be fair the film 'wowed' me, it really did, it was very interesting, had humour too, i was hooked, watching it from start to finish in amazement. I hope another film like this comes out soon, i really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who loves a film with lots of twists and great acting.9 - 10 / 10.",9,2,4,5 March 2014
Shutter Island," Still don't get the ending. lol
","This is a brilliant film.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio... a top actor, in fact one of the best actors out there, i love all of his work and this one was one of his best. He plays this role perfectly, i think he was the perfect actor for this film.The film has a great storyline/plot and all the way through it had me hooked, it was very interesting and sometimes creepy/strange at parts (not scary). The film itself was a little confusing at the end... the ending could have about 3 different meanings... it was hard to get my head around what the right answer was to the ending and i still am not 100% sure (you will understand when you have watched it if you haven't already) but don't be put off by this, the film is meant to be this way, it is a film that gets you thinking and is puzzling (mystery).Many people think they know what the ending means of this film, many say different things and believe they know what the ending means but i personally don't know the correct answer to this, so i suggest people decide what they want after watching and believe what you want i guess. It is a very good film.I would HIGHLY recommend this to people who love a good mystery film. Worth a 9 / 10 at least.",9,0,2,7 March 2014
Forrest Gump," One of the best movies ever
","Brilliant. Is there any part Tom Hanks can not play? i mean c'mon this man is amazing, every role he plays in any film is just spot on, perfect, he is a true actor and many should learn from him. This is how to act!.The actor himself is amazing but the film a fantastic, it has everything a film should... love/romance, humour, gore/blood (not much though, heartfelt scenes, friendship and more. This film never gets old, over the years i have watched this film a number of times and i still love it.Great storyline, great scenes, great actors, what more could you want in a film. The film is rather long but it never gets boring, it keeps you hooked right until the end. Personally one of my favourite films of all time.Well worth a 10 / 10.",10,1,1,5 March 2014
The Shining," A good CRAZY film
","I think the shining is a great film, it is always in the top 10 of people's lists of their favourite horror movies. It is not one of my best horror movies has i prefer something more upto date etc but it was a good one for an old movie and i think many people who haven't seen it yet would like it.The main character is great, the actor plays this part amazingly and perfectly. The film itself is quite crazy (as he becomes crazy), it does draw you in and i found myself wanting to watch it all the way to the very end.This film would be sure to scare those easily scared people out there and would be great for watching with friends or family (adults of course).I think it deserves a 7 / 10 at least.",7,1,2,5 March 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Such a GREAT film
","I really do love watching this film. Such great acting, great actors, a great actress and i just love the film altogether. I think this one is my best Terminator out of all of them. Each part is well played and the film never gets boring.I have watched this film many times over the years and it never gets old, it is still one of my favourite films to watch. It is just a cool film and i would recommend it. Maybe start from number one and watch them through, it is worth it but like i said i personally think number two is the better of them all.Well worth a 9 / 10.",9,1,1,5 March 2014
Batman Begins," One of the better Batman films.
","This is one of the better Batman films, starring top actors and starts showing more than it did in the other Batman films / programmes. It gives an overall cooler feel to Batman and makes it more interesting to watch.I have always been a fan (not a massive fan) of Batman films, 'Batman' has always been my best 'hero' out of all the 'heros'. It is about time Batman got better, cooler etc and since this one.. it has. The recent Batman films are a lot better but this one is still a great one and i would recommend to any Batman fans out there.Deserves a 7 or 8 out of 10.",7,0,1,7 March 2014
The Pianist," Sad but a good film
","When i watched this film for the first time it made me feel so sad, i did like it but then again at the same time i didn't, it was upsetting, very upsetting, but the acting etc was amazing, the film itself was amazing but just very upsetting. I only saw it once, i attempted to watch it again but i wasn't into it like the first time i saw it. I think it is a good film for people who don't get upset too easily, it is a heartbreaking film.The film makes you think and makes you feel sorry for the people that had to go through the same things as in this film. It was a film that shocked, upset but it did keep me hooked, wanting to watch to the very end.I think this film deserves a 7 - 8 out of 10 at least.",8,0,0,5 March 2014
School of Rock," Awesome
","Well what can i say, what a film. This film is a must see, it really made me laugh out loud, Jack Black starring in it was the best decision ever made, he is amazing and knows how to make people laugh without trying so hard. Amazing.This film has it all... humour, music, JACK BLACK... it is just an overall genius film, i love everything about it and Jack Black does have a good rock voice so he didn't seem out of place in this film. I think if they did do a remake it wouldn't be as good, i think this is a top film as it is and most people will definitely enjoy watching it.Definitely gets a 10 out of 10 from me. Some of Jack Black's best work.",10,3,4,6 March 2014
Moulin Rouge!," A great love story
","If you like romance and music then this is the film for you. You either love it or you hate it, i personally love it. It made me smile, it made me cry, i enjoyed the singing and the songs, i enjoyed the story. I thought each part was well acted. Ewan and Nicole are amazing anyway but in this film they show their acting skills and their singing skills, yes Nicole is a better singer than Ewan but they are still both good. I can't really fault the film much, bits where a bit too dramatic and far fetched but it made no difference to me as the storyline made up for it.I think 8 out of 10 is a good rating as there is always room for improvement but i would definitely recommend to people who like the typical romantic musical.",8,0,2,4 March 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This film is really good
","I have always been a fan of this film. I have watched it many time and it never gets old to me, it interests me and i really enjoy watching it. Quentin Tarantino films are the type you have to get used to, they do a lot of flashing back and forth but if you can handle that easy then it becomes enjoyable to watch.I think this one is the better one of the two, even though i did like kill Bill vol 2 but it just wasn't as good as this one.Another thing that was great about this film was that Quentin Tarantino didn't put himself into it. I mean yes he does some good films but he can not act for the life of him and should keep taking a back seat, films are better without him in them. Stick to doing what you do best, your films are GREAT but your acting isn't.I think this film deserves a 8 out of 10 at least.",8,1,4,7 March 2014
Paranormal Activity," Really?
","This review isn't meant to insult anyone etc, this is just my opinion on the film and what i truly thought.Well i personally don't know why people like this film as much as they say they do, i see a lot of people saying 'oh it was so scary'... really? If you find a cupboard opening scary then OK but personally it takes more to scare me. I went to the cinema to see this and women/girls where screaming at every bang, i felt like banging my head against the wall (i am female and didn't know what was so scary about the film). it isn't scary at all, it was jumpy at the most and that is only because the sound was so loud in the cinema. The film seemed to drag, the best part was the last 10 minutes i guess but still wasn't great to say i had just sat through a long part of nothing happening.I personally think this is a boring film, and the rest of the paranormal activity films are no better, they are all more or less the same, just a cupboard opening and a pan falling. I think this one (the first one) is the best of them all but it still is a waste of an hour or two in my mind. I think it could be made better if it didn't drag as much before something happening.I think it deserves a 3 out of 10.",3,1,2,5 March 2014
The Dark Knight," Alright.
","This film was alright, i always end up getting bored during this film though, it has quite a bit of action (i am not a big action fan), many will like that but i preferred The dark knight rises... but my partner liked this a lot, i think it might appeal to men more than women (because of the action in it).I must say the 'Joker' played by Heath was amazing, i think the acting was spot on. Joker has always been my favourite villain but Heath made him come alive even more.I would recommend this to people who are really into action type films and who don't mind long-ish films. I think it does deserve a 6 - 7 out of 10.",6,1,3,7 March 2014
Taken," Liam Neeson... so cool in this.
","I think this film is brilliant. I love it. It was interesting and enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The second Taken wasn't as good but this first one was a top film and the famous saying Liam says in the film is so cool and makes the character seem cooler.This film is brilliantly planned and the main actor... Liam.. is great at playing the part of a retired agent who is also a loving father. It is one of my best films. Usually with films like this i lose interest more or less half way through but this draws you in and makes you want to watch the film all the way through, it never got boring.This film definitely deserves a 9 out of 10.",9,7,10,7 March 2014
Pulp Fiction," Crazy But Good!
","I really enjoyed watching this film, it is quite random in parts and very 'risky' i guess you could say with there being drugs, sex, guns, crime, bad language etc but i personally really like it and can understand why it has an overall rating of 9.0.This is a film i could watch over and over, this film is packed full of some of the most famous top actors and actresses. I love it. Each person (actor/actress) played their part perfectly.If you love great acting, great scenes then i would recommend this film. Such a great film for adults. Well worth a 9 / 10.",9,0,1,5 March 2014
Titanic," 1 of the best films out there
","Titanic is brilliant. Every single actor knows how to act, i never saw 1 bad actor. I love everything about this film. 1 of Leo's better films i think and i would recommend to anyone that likes romance with great acting (also with top actors and actress's.Yes OK this is a very... very... very long film but it never gets boring, all way through the film is enjoyable. Most films rush into things and end up spoiling the results whereas this film builds up and knows how a good film should be. I have watched this film a number of times now and over the years it has always been a favourite of mine. I am sure if you took the time to watch this sometime you wouldn't be disappointed.",10,2,4,3 March 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Rather good.
","OK so i wouldn't say this is one of my best films. In Fact it is far from my best film but it is alright, rather good. A lot of people will not enjoy it for the reasons it involves drug taking, drinking, hard core partying, sex etc but if you can't take watching any of that then don't watch this film.I think Leonardo DiCaprio is great in this, he plays the part brilliantly. I wouldn't say it is his best film but it is still good and he is still good in it. His acting is good.I did enjoy watching this film but 1 thing i would say is that i found myself thinking 'when is this film going to end', it does go on far too long, cut 30 minutes/45 minutes off of the film and it would probably be OK, but it did keep me wanting to watch until the end though.It is one of those films you will either love or you will hate.",6,0,1,3 March 2014
The Green Mile," Good film
","I think this is a good film, i don't personally think it is as good as some people make out, it isn't my best ever film but like i said it is good. It has a good 'storyline' and the actors in it are amazing at playing their role, especially Tom Hanks, i mean is there any role he can't play?It is an enjoyable film to watch as it is interesting and does seem to draw you in. It didn't really bore me. I think many people will like this film. It did get upsetting at parts as it did have some sad scenes but that just added to the film, drew me in even more.I think it does deserve a 7 out of 10, nothing less.",7,0,1,7 March 2014
The Lion King," One of the best animation movies EVER!
","The lion king is and always has been 1 of my favourite animation films. Everything about it i love, just a great adventure/story, it does have its sad parts but they just make the film even better as it adds to it.I personally don't know anyone who doesn't like this, and i don't understand why people wouldn't like this, i can not fault it. This is a great family movie.I this this Lion king (the 1st one) is the best of them all so if you are going to give Lion king a try i would always recommend watching this one out of all of them. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,3 March 2014
Inception," Another great film
","Another brilliant film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is there any role he can't play perfectly?!.This film gets you thinking and is puzzling at parts but it makes the film great, it makes it different, i really enjoyed watching this and i thought some of the things that happened in the film was just amazing, very cool effects etc.I would definitely recommend to people who like a good mystery/action/adventure film with fantastic acting all way though. This film keeps you interested from the start to the very end.Well worth an 8 / 10 at least!.",8,0,1,4 March 2014
Taken 2," I prefer the first one.
","When i saw this film was coming out i was looking forward to watching it as the first one was so good but i was disappointed with this one, even though the plot etc is more or less the same it just doesn't have the same feel... the first Taken was cool, interesting and enjoyable to watch from start to finish but this one didn't have the same feel, it was a little boring.Liam Neeson was still good at playing his part but it was the 'plot' that was a little boring, as Liam was the one captured he didn't do much in the film apart from talking to his daughter on the phone a lot and i think the people that liked the first Taken would have loved to see Liam doing more, more fighting scenes etc but still like i said he was still good at playing his role, he is an overall great actor.I don't think this one is as good as the first one so that is why it only gets a 6 out of 10 from me but if another Taken comes out i will be sure to watch it, i just hope there is more to it this time.",6,0,0,7 March 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight... Rises
","I loved this film, the acting was perfect. Bane was so cool, the actor played his role brilliantly and made the film great. I wasn't expecting to like this film as much as i did, i mean i was hooked right to the very end, everything about the film was interesting. I think The dark knight rises is better than The dark night even though Joker is one of my favourite characters but i felt this one was more enjoyable to watch, it didn't bore me at all and it is a film i could watch again. The Dark Knight bored me and seemed to drag on but The Dark Knight Rises wasn't like that at all.I think this film deserves a 9 / 10 at least. I can not really think of anything wrong with the film, i can't fault it.",9,3,4,5 March 2014
Back to the Future," A must see.
","I remember watching this for the first time when i was younger and i liked it and after all these years i still love the film and the actors in it. Each person plays their part perfectly and this film never gets old. It is a brilliant all time classic and a must see if you haven't already.If you do watch Back to the future i would watch the first one and continue through to the last one, great actors/actresses in this film. I can't really see why anyone wouldn't like this film, it is a perfect family film. All of the back to the future films are great and enjoyable. They keep you wanting to watch all the way to the end, they are interesting in every way.This film is well worth a 9 - 10 / 10.",9,1,2,5 March 2014
Shark Tale," Good movie
","I personally think this is a good movie, yes there are better animated movies out there but i still think this movie deserves more than a 6.0 as an overall rating. It is a great family movie.I enjoyed this movie years ago and still enjoy watching it now, i think it is very funny for an animated movie, and i am sure many people will think the same. It has some great actors / actresses doing the voices for the characters. I would recommend this movie if you are a big animation fan. It has good music too. I also like the story line, sweet...Well worth a 7 / 10... maybe even more.",7,2,2,5 March 2014
The Wizard of Oz," Still like it to this day.
","I have always liked this film from being a child... not so long ago. I didn't realise how old this film was until now but i still like it. I think the actors / actress's in it were perfect at player each role. I think it is many people's childhood favourite. Great and fun musical with lots of different, fun characters. Great for children and adults, great family film. Never gets old. The songs and the singing fit well and the songs help you get more into the film, makes it more enjoyable to watch.If you are looking for a family movie for everyone to enjoy then i would say this is the film for you.I think this old time favourite deserves a 9 / 10.",9,4,6,5 March 2014
