Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wildly overpraised
","It seems to have become somewhat of a trait for Sacha Baron Cohen's creations to fall in their quest for big screen stardom. Ali G's limp 'Indahouse' followed the characters phenomenal TV success, ultimately failing as Cohen removed what is his greatest asset, the reactions of members of the public to his overblown stereotype. Having taken a bit of a lull from the limelight, Cohen returned with news of an upcoming big screen outing for his lesser known, but arguably even funnier creation 'Borat' the Kazakhstani news reporter. The swarm of media attention certainly built up a huge audience for the movie (and secured it as a financial success), but ultimately only enhanced it's failings by revealing what turned out to be among the funniest sketches again, and again, and again.Yet it all seemed so promising, far from a carbon copy of his previous venture with his other character. The trailers suggested a film crammed with hilarious candid camera gags as the hapless Kazakh fired his extreme views and racist jibes at members of the public, exposing the shocking cultural prejudice that exists in today's American society while simultaneously delivering gut crunching laughs. Finally Cohen playing to his strengths, surely the film is one big joyous extension of the razor sharp TV sketches? Unfortunately not, while efforts have been made to maintain the public reactions (which are at times as funny as ever) the attempted 'plot' is still present in full force. Not only do these scripted sequences fail as a whole, they also undermine the great public sketches that form the meat of the comedy. By inserting them into the story, with Borat's overweight producer never far behind, how 'real' the reactions are come into question. This is something that doesn't (and certainly shouldn't) occur to you in his TV work. Instead of monologue followed by sketch followed by monologue, we have a thoroughly unconvincing story that lessens the weight of the character.As a larger than life stereotype in the public domain, he is ceaselessly amusing. In the film it is almost as if Cohen is trying to emulate himself sometimes, subtlety lost in favour of cheap, obvious laughs that aren't particularly clever. Plain and simple, Cohen has overdone the character, simplifying him and losing something along the way. Even in publicity interviews it seems he is trying too hard (Wow-wah-wee-wah, High Five) Our awareness of his clever 'acting' is dulled, giving way to a scripted character that just isn't all that funny, at times even bordering on the offensive. Yes, most of us are aware that the comedy is without seriousness, yet you begin to wonder whether some people are laughing for all the wrong reasons. It is this that proves a little sad. Controversial as his methods are, Cohen is still trying to drive home a point about prejudice and cultural understanding. There are moments in this movie world where Cohen's signature becomes a little lost, some particularly cheap gags giving you the feeling that the racism is the joke and their necessity is called into question.How successfully Cohen's ulterior motive translates to modern audiences is debatable. Has the success not really been built on the hilarity of 'that Kazakh guy who hates Jews and women'? However it is not all bad, certain scenes showcase Cohen at his very best, with clever, biting satire, a reminder of why we really love Borat. Even some of the scripted scenes come off rather well, slapstick maybe, but successful none the less (the naked fighting scene is so wonderfully outrageous and distasteful that it forms perhaps the best scene in the entire film, the one moment where the scripted Borat meets the public reaction spectacle entirely successfully). Cohen is a talented comic, though it is clear that his true domain is in television. An improvement on 'Indahouse' most certainly, but in the end here lies a merely average comedy film in the place of a potentially outstanding one.",6,4,9,5 November 2006
The Prestige," Nolan deceives and delights once again.
","Christoper Nolan is a daring, confident and wholly respected director whose cult classic 'Memento' single handedly established his place in film history. Batman Begins multiplied his fan base, and fired him deep into mainstream recognition with its back to basics, brooding style. Nolan gave Batman the rebirth everyone desired and with it came one of the most widely praised comic book movies of all time. Before cracking on with The Dark Knight, Nolan returned to a project in the making for some time, co-written with his brother Jonathan. Entitled The Prestige the story follows the intense, dangerous rivalry between two turn of the century magicians, adapted from the book by Christopher Priest. After a return to conventional structure with Batman, The Prestige proves a welcome return to the 'What?, Where?, Why?' syndrome Memento fans embraced. While the timeframe is fractured, the viewer is not plagued with quite the same sense of disorientation; The Prestige is an accessible conundrum of clues and red herrings working together towards the inevitable final grand reveal.On the whole the film is a confident, superbly acted period drama with a unique style that ensures it never quite feels like one. The script is meticulously constructed to mirror the three so called acts of the magic trick, Michael Caine's narration is as warm and welcome as ever. The film does a wonderful job in the first half of conveying the joy (and danger) of the art of the magic trick, effortlessly drawing up a world of misdirection and intrigue as the two protagonists begin to build up a dangerously bitter rivalry, it soon becomes apparent that obsession is the key here. As Bale's Borden is coldly enveloped by his professional career, Jackman's Angier turns increasingly desperate to uncover the others secrets, we realise that this is a deadly, unforgiving pursuit that is quickly spiraling out of control. For the majority of the film we see little of the 'magic' that wows the theatre audience to whom the act is presented , everything is carefully constructed so our view of each trick is based on the mechanical means by which it is achieved. While you might expect the film to work on the principal of showing you the trick then stunning you with the explanation, this is not the case. Everything is on an emotional level, inside Borden and Angier's lives and minds; this is ultimately a psychological drama.The words 'Are you looking closely' open the film, good advice for a narrative so tightly convoluted; it is this that will divide audiences. Some will click into the right frame of mind and see the twists coming a mile off and may or may not be disappointed by them. Others will soon forget the warning and settle in for the ride, open to Nolan's misguidance. Either way the final revelations are not quite as ingenious as you might expect, they are certainly not completely unpredictable. Of course the important thing is, are they satisfying? It is a debatable issue, after the initial irritation upon recollection of the multitude of seemingly obvious clues littering the running time your mind may be divided upon how well you take the finale. One revelation even flips the whole genre of the piece on its head, sure to horrify some viewers and please others. This is an ambitious film unafraid of dividing audiences through some unconventional choices.One thing is clear, it is the themes and characters that will stay with you the longest, the multi-layered trickery Nolan reveals may be diverting but is certainly not the pictures crowing glory. As Angier drops down the hatch, for his drunken, vastly entertaining 'double' to rise the other side of the stage, the camera stays down below with the anguished Angier, desperate to crack the puzzle as the roar of applause is heard just out of his reach. It is a scene that perfectly encapsulates the dilemma he faces, driving him to ever more extreme methods in his obsessive quest to outdo Borden. Visually the film is nigh on flawless, not too ambitious but very distinct. The scenes where Angier visits the pioneering scientist Tesla (a distinctly odd, somewhat amusing performance from David Bowie) on his snowy mountain top are beautifully shot.In the end the two lead characters are so swallowed up in their own ambitions that it is difficult to identify or sympathise with either of them. This is perhaps the films biggest flaw, it is a little too weird, a little too cold. The unique atmosphere certainly secures its place in your memory for weeks to come, the mechanical approach fascinating, but ultimately a little unengaging. The true test will come upon multiple viewings. Will knowing the surprises detract from the mystery? Or will the fascinating psychoanalysis shine through to ensure the film holds up? Only in time can we conclude whether this ascends beyond intrigue towards classic Nolan.8/10",8,1,2,20 November 2006
Children of Men," Without doubt, Cuaron's masterpiece.
","Children Of Men represents a wonderful triumph in Cuaron's career, a milestone movie that secures his already well established place as one of the most talented directors currently in work. Based on PD James' novel, Children Of Men depicts a none too distant future (2021 is the given year) falling apart at the seams after a mystery infertility pandemic has eliminated any hope of mankind's future. It is a concept that is both simple and surprisingly effective, a vision that would startle the majority of people, the idea that such a simple unknown event would bring our arrogant, self important species endless development to a grinding halt within 80 or so years. It is this inevitable sense of hopelessness that leads to a horrifying interpretation of a species on the brink of extinction.The time of release could not be any more potent, Cuaron takes every opportunity to draw parallels with the current political and social climate, the grounding in a none too distant future ensures a frightening sense of familiarity making the events depicted all the more shocking and effective. Pretty much everything we see before our eyes is taken from somewhere from recent history or current events (segregation, refugees, concentration camps, terrorism), put all this into our familiar, peaceful England and it drives home a potent point. The global situation is pretty dire around the world and yet in a way we live in a bubble, insulated from the majority of horrors. Here is a story taking place in an England with that bubble burst, and it is certainly, worryingly very plausible.Opening with what is perhaps the greatest depiction of a downtown suicide bomb yet put onto film Children Of Men pulls no punches from the very first frame. It is the first of many flawless scenes of violence, comparable to those of Saving Private Ryan in their sheer intensity and the incredible impact of the sound design. The majority of the picture is filmed in an up close and personal manner, spinning around Clive Owen's Theo, giving the viewer an unprecedented feeling of being there, in the moment. This extends from the huge action set pieces right down to the smaller set pieces (such as the incredible, inventive car get away scene. filmed in on a farm in a beautiful early morning glow) Events happen just off camera as the bold tracking shots offer glances of a fully realised environment, a level of detail that achieves the difficult task of convincing the viewer that as soon as the camera is turned away the world depicted continues.Emotionally the film at first appears a little dry, as Theo bounces from one event to the next, but a subtle, gripping change occurs somewhere in the first third of the film drawing you in to it's vice like grip through a mixture of great writing and technical wizardry (particularly the striking shock value), as Theo crouches down in the woods, sobbing uncontrollably you realise that Cuaron has crossed the line, delivering a film that is absolutely blinding in it's impact and portrayal of a world crunching down around them. Oddly enough there is a reoccurring predictability to some of the events, yet the shock remains undiluted. This is an incredible achievement that is extremely hard to explain but can be accredited to the sheer skill put to use in portraying the events. Knowing something is coming does nothing to lessen the impact. At the same time many scenes satisfyingly avoid convention providing a truly varied experience that is both surprising and familiar. Clive Owen is wonderful in the lead role, dealing with the splattering of black comedy (another aspect that creates an entirely unique atmosphere) with ease. Michael Caine is equally brilliant as a weed smoking, Zen loving hippy, his sub plot as heartbreaking as anything in the film.The violence is absolutely shocking, it seems to be unexpected in a film of this nature, a fact that certainly plays in the Cuaron's favour. It is raw, disturbing, even choking at times delivered in moderation (certainly not excess) so as to maximise impact. Characters slip out of the narrative with little more than a backward glance, adding to the realistic feel, tying up loose plot ends is certainly not on Cuaron's agenda here. CGI is employed with utmost brilliance; you will most likely not even notice it is there, pointing to a future where CGI can have its uses. We may be put off by overuse of average CGI in current films, but when you are unaware of its use the problem diminishes. Saying a film had good CGI is all very well, but having it pass by unnoticed is a far greater credit.Perhaps the only fault is a lack of truly stretching the potential of the material in terms of political or social comment. Ultimately the messages conveyed through the material are simple and well worn, yes it fits in all the references but never really serves up anything new to say about them. However as a dystopian vision of the very near future Cuaron's film is a stunning, wholly immersive piece of work with an ending that is bleak, achingly sad and ambiguous. Children Of Men is sure to stand the test of time and become a modern classic.",9,4,9,1 October 2006
