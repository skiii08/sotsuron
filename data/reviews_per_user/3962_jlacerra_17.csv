Ali," Director KO's Movie
","If all I ever knew of Muhammad Ali came from this movie, I would think him a boring, womanizing, unremarkable Palooka.  Michael Mann manages the extremely difficult feat of making the dynamic and charismatic Ali an uninteresting void.  This movie pretends to look inside Ali, and it finds nothing there!  And apparently there was no life before Liston or after Foreman.The first third of the movie is really about Malcolm X.  The director makes him boring, too.  That I can live with, because X sort of came off that way. But his interaction with Ali could have been interesting, but is not in this flick.  Ali's courageous decision to refuse military service during the Viet Nam war is depicted here more as an act of racial petulance then of conviction. 
As to the players, well Smith is good.  With another director he might have won that Oscar.  Jamie Fox as Bundini Brown is an unsympathetic cardboard character.  Ron Silver suffers through playing Angelo Dundee as reduced to almost a non-speaking role (Wasn't Dundee even a factor in Ali's life?). The women are forgettable if not somewhat annoying.  Jon Voight IS Howard Cosell, and here the movie looks a bit deeper into their strange relationship.  The brief scenes with Cosell and a very short car ride with Joe Frazier are the high points of this overlong and dull movie which takes a legend and levels him to a not too interesting and not too bright human with all the personality of a can of paint.",Null,1,2,12 April 2004
Underworld," All In One Night!?!
","The idea that vampires and werewolves have been at war for almost 1000 years is the premise here.  Nobody wastes any acting skill on it.  The lead is Kate Beckinsomebody.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Snorebuckling Cruise
","I probably shouldn't be writing this, having only watched half the movie. It was so boring I had to either turn it off or succumb to slumber.  The only thing that captured me was Depp and his odd posture; is he supposed to be gay?  He is a somewhat magnetic presence, but is allowed to mumble his lines to the point that he seems dubbed.  The female lead, whose name escapes me, is about as interesting as a half brick. The whole thing is just too contrived.Perhaps it picks up in the second half.  Despite well staged action sequences and good production values, there is something repetitious and routine about the action.  You never for a moment lose sight of the fact that you are watching a movie, a Disney movie, much the same as the TV pap I loved every Sunday night as a child: The Disney Show (or whatever name it carried at the time).Anyway, since I rented this epic, I am going to try to finish it tomorrow. I hope my first impression, from the first nine hours, whoops, one hour plus, will be reversed.  If so, I hope I'll be allowed another comment.",Null,0,1,10 May 2004
Finding Nemo," Found
","I avoided this movie for a long time, thinking it was strictly for kids. Finally, my niece brought it home and I watched it.  It is strictly for kids.  Technically and visually, the movie is great.  Story-wise, it falls a bit short.  Still enjoyable to a limited degree.Spoiler Alert!They have worked into the plot three or four instances where we are supposed to think Nemo may be dead.  Marlon, too.  Gets Old!There is never any real meaning derived from Nemo's little handicap; it seems any feature associated with Disney must have this (Dumbo's ears, etc.).  There is little resolution at the end; nothing like Dorothy saying, 'There's no place like home', no 'Rosebud', Nemo goes back to Tara and continues at school with an irresponsible stingray teacher.Kudos for Ellen Degeneris.",7,1,1,29 December 2003
A Bridge Too Far," A panorama of war
","This film is a beautifully shot panorama of war, with all its confusion, referred to by military pros as 'friction'.  The acting is surprisingly good for a flick with so many stars and super-stars.It is not really anti-Brit, but is somewhat anti-Monty, personified by here through Gen. Browning.  In the action, the Brits come off rather heroically. The actors turn in good performances for the most part.  Hackman needs help with his Polish accent, Kemp is miscast (should have played a German), Gould is miscast, and Redford is good, but briefly used.This picture is right up there with the best of the war film classics such as the Longest Day, Tora Tora Tora, Patton, Saving Private Ryan, and a personal weird favorite of mine, Castle Keep.  Two thumbs way up!",10,5,8,18 November 2001
LÃ©on: The Professional," A Great But Weird Movie
","When I first saw this picture I was astonished by how good it is, and also by how weird it is (some might say surreal).  For Example:(And I hope none of these are SPOILERS):They seem to want you to think its New York, but it doesn't look or 'feel' like New York.It's implied that Leon is Italian, but he is obviously sooo French.$5,000 for a hit is ridiculously cheap.The sexual undercurrent between Leon and Matilda is hard to dismiss. (by the way, I've only seen this movie on Bravo, so I'm sure there were bigtime cuts; they have Oldman saying he's had enough of this 'Bull squash'!!)The issue of money brings up the whole Danny Aiello thing;  old pro Aiello plays his character excellently. But is Old Tony screwing Leon out of, a)the proper wages for his work, and b)the money he's 'holding'? Old Tony has never heard of the FDIC, claiming that banks always get robbed, but not Old Tony.The picture hits its low point with the pig oven-mit scene.  The rest is one wonderful roller-coaster rush to its fantastic (albeit inevitable) conclusion.    High marks to Reno, Aiello, Oldman, and especially Portman.  If there were a sequel, why not get Portman to play Matilda?",10,0,2,15 June 2003
American Beauty," A Truly Wonderful TV Movie of the week
","John Wayne always played John Wayne, Cary Grant always played Cary Grant. When they had the right vehicle, there was magic.  Well, Kevin Spacey almost always plays Kevin Spacey, and in this instance, his magic virtually carries the show.  Here Spacey appears as a disillusioned middle-aged middle class male who takes stock of his wasted life after developing an obsession for the sexy, if under-aged, best friend of his own fairly unpleasant and annoying daughter.  Mena Suvari does a great job as Angela, the the flirty object of Spacey's lust, deftly placing layers of character on what is at first glance a one-dimensional slut.Thora Birch is as resoundingly spoiled and hostile as teens with everything are supposed to be.  She falls for Ricky, the new neighbor boy from a military family in which every member, including him, is insane.  Wes Bentley does a chilling job as this repressed and measured psychopath.The film is beautifully filmed and scored, and well written, if just a bit too slowly paced.  Oddly, it seems to owe a great deal to 'The Ref'.The major bring-down here is the hammy, off the wall, and embarrassing performance of Annette Bening, one of Hollywood's most over-rated actresses. It is almost painful when she is on the screen, despoiling this otherwise excellent production.Remove a few seconds of nudity, sexual activity, and hard language, and you have a really wonderful TV Movie of the Week!",7,0,1,30 April 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Not quite my cup of T
","T2 has many things the original lacked.  Better special effects, a bit more character development, some neat plot twists, and a bit more teen appeal by having John Connor appear at age 15 or so.  Also, it probably had a much larger budget.  But somehow it just never captures my interest the way the original did.  No doubt that it's a good movie.  But just not AS good. Arnold did better as a baddie without lines.  Definitely worth seeing, but not quite up to the original.",7,7,10,26 July 2001
Face_Off," Everything Go Boom!
","This is a basically bad movie unless you just want to sit back and enjoy off the hook performances from Nick Cage and John Travolta.  Both stars were great, playing both parts.  The plot, simple-minded and unbelievable, tries hard to screw up their fun.  Apparently, the two main characters are indestructible; no matter what is done to them they survive in fighting trim.  Everyone else, well they are just a bunch of goonoid targets.Spoiler AlertThe movie begins with the murder of a child (a time honored movie no-no). We are shown major surgeries with no scars, no healing time or after effects. We are asked to accept that Nick and John have similar head types, body styles, shoe sizes, etc. We are treated to gun battles galore in which elite cops and FBI couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with multiple clips in their Uzis.  And wasn't that boat chase right out of James Bond?Despite all this, I enjoyed the picture because the two stars were great, having lots of fun with it, and were both on the screen almost all the time.",4,3,8,20 January 2004
Independence Day," Entirely Forgettable...
","I've seen this movie almost twice (fell asleep during the first try), and I still can't remember one plot element or character.  What I do remember are the incredibly disappointing cheesy special effects.  Is the White House really made of gasoline-soaked popsickle sticks?  And Bill Pullman as President of the United States? Puleeeeze!As far as the indignation of our friends in Europe about the overwhelmingly American emphasis in this film, you should all be relieved that they did not drag your countries through the mud of this piece of dung.The only thing that pleased me about this movie is that my fellow Philadelphian Will Smith probably made a load of money.",3,3,6,25 July 2001
Seabiscuit," Middle of the Track
","Seabiscuit is a movie about a famous horse.  For me, this is a handicap to be overcome, since I am not nuts about horses or horse movies.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one, mostly due to the efforts of Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper.  Bridges underplays the rich and basically decent Charles Howard just right:  the audience can forgive him his wealth, even in light of the depression all around him.  He is fair and reasonable, yet a risk taker and huckster.Cooper's character, trainer Tom Smith, is perhaps even more interesting. The stereotypical cowboy whose time has run out as the range became fenced and organized, Smith becomes a trainer who works primarily on instinct and his rapport with the animals.  The movie allows that instinct to err occasionally, bringing out the simple humanity of the man.Less interesting is Tobey MaGuire as jockey Red Pollack.  Born to a wealthy and cultured family gone bust, he is farmed out by his desperate parents who never return for him.  It is hard to tell if the problem here is Maguire or Pollack; either way, the character is not too likable (unless you're a horse, apparently).Production values are high in this period piece, and cinematography is excellent.**SPOILERS**Unfortunately, a few little things prevent  this good movie from being a great one:  The Depression documentary narration is cornily inspirational and out of place, too preachy.  Some during-race jockey banter is just silly!  And shots of Pollack cheering 'the Biscuit' from his hospital bed should have been omitted even if true; its just been done too often.One other sort of annoying aspect is the editing.  The movie tends to cut away from scenes just as the points are to be delivered, and the cutaway from the start of the 'Big Race' is just plain arrogant!Having said that, it was an enjoyable two and a half hours, and I'm glad I saw it.  I give it a vote of 7.",7,0,0,5 June 2004
The Longest Day," War's spectacle
","What a spectacle of man's ultimate and most dangerous endeavor.  Too many stars to mention.  This black and white pageant of war is an artful collage of the thousands of stories that are woven into the complex fabric of a great invasion.  The camera work is sometimes breathtaking.  The performances are surprisingly good.  Memorable scenes include paratroopers landing in the midst of a village involved in putting out an unrelated fire, and a running attack on a wharf area that has to be the best crane shot since Gone With the Wind!The picture also holds up historically (except for more recent history being a bit kinder to Rommel), showing the German side and point of view as well as the Allies'.  This motion picture is a must see for war film buffs, and should be required viewing for school kids.  And while it is teaching us a multitude of lessons, it manages to be deliciously entertaining.Two thumbs up!",10,1,4,4 August 2001
8 Mile," Life is a dumpster
","Well, Eminem looked in the dumpster that sits malodorously behind some trailer park and said, 'Yo, here's the makings of a movie like on my life, yo!'  So they took the rotting, dripping remnants of a bunch of real movies, added a past-its-date movie star (Kim Basinger), and, knowing a huge audience pre-existed for any Eminem offering, voila!I happen to be an Eminem music fan, but his first acting effort is flawed by a few things, some may be beyond his control:  The relentlessly depressing and muddled story of the existence of the main character, an actual lack of good rap,  a lack of any sympathetic character the viewer can care about, and direction that one can almost hear as 'now give us (him/her/it/them/me) a long angry glare, Marshall'.The parts they found to put this mess together were ripped from the rotting corpses of, 'Permanent Record', 'Rocky', 'Bye, Bye, Birdie', 'West Side Story', 'Flashdance', 'Karate Kid', 'Dirty Dancing', 'Sling Blade', 'Footloose' 'The Champ', etc.Despite all this, Mathers does show some potential as an actor.  With some training, practice, and a good director he may actually be able to turn in a decent performance.  He's a talented guy, once he gets his hand away from his groin.",2,0,1,1 February 2004
Quiz Show," The End of Innocence
","As a twelve year old growing up in Brooklyn, I did not even know the name of the show I was watching every week; to me it was just a vehicle to see if hero Charles Van Doren could hang in.  He was handsome, articulate, witty, and all the girls thought him incredibly attractive (although their pre-teen minds did not yet understand sexuality).  Growing up in a Jewish neighborhood as I did, Herb Stempel did not come off so nerdy as he looks now in retrospect.  When it came out that everyone had cheated, us kids felt not only betrayed, but sleazily cheated personally.  The girls felt somehow violated!Here Redford turns in an understated masterpiece.  He sets the stage and the standard, and gets fantastic performances from his actors:John Turturro as Stempel is excellent, but a fine job by Johann Carlo as his principled wife, which may be overlooked in such company, is the rock upon which his family can really rely.Ralph Fiennes, as the hapless Charles Van Doren, manages to get across his character's dilemma: a mere achiever in a family of ultra-achievers.  In any other family he'd have been prime, as a Van Doren he would always be an also-ran.  Many have pointed out the great job of Paul Scofield as Mark Van Doren, Charles' father.  He is the epitome of the WASP-intellectual padrone.  And he has our sympathy when his son so sorely disappoints him and disgraces the family.David Paymer is excellent and believable as Enright, the unsavory producer. He makes it almost seem disloyal not to cheat!Bit parts are all little plums: Martin Scorsese as Martin Rittenhouse, the Geritol exec, smugly contemptuous of the public and the government.  George Martin as the network president, clearly Jewish, and just as clearly a 'Teflon Don' in his own world.The scenes at the Van Doren estate are designed to convey investigator Goodwin's (Rob Morrow) culture shock and outsider status, and they represent the academic WASP world of the time accurately and wonderfully.All in all, a great movie.",10,49,53,24 April 2004
The Godfather: Part III," Not in the same class...
","This movie is not in the same class as the first two, and this is not because of poor Sophia Coppola, who actually does a decent job as a naive Mafia princess in denial.  One of the strengths of the first two movies is that they stuck to events that actually could have happened.  The helicopter machine-gunning of the penthouse meeting of Dons would never happen. Especially in Atlantic, where mobsters are at pains to be inconspicuous. The very public struggle of Michael for control of the Vatican-owned conglomerate would have been carried out by WASPy proxies, not a Corleone.George Hamilton is surprisingly good as the mob mouthpiece.  Diane Keaton is surprisingly irritating as the liberated Kay.  Eli Wallach is absolutely awful as the deceitfully fawning Don Altobello.  Coppola ought to be horse-whipped for allowing this veteran character actor to become a huge and unbelievable HAM in this picture.  Had there not been a I and II, this movie would have been mildly tolerable, but even the great performance by Pacino here cannot save this film from suffering severely by comparison to its two excellent ancestor films.",4,10,15,16 December 2001
The Green Mile," A one of a kind classic
","This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity.",10,219,275,17 June 2001
Gangs of New York," Who Cares?
","This excellently mounted and meticulously directed epic stumbles by breaking the first rule of movie story-telling: make the viewer care about the characters.  You don't care about these people any further than being truly relieved that they are all certainly dead by now.  DiCaprio is grossly miscast, as is Diaz.  Lewis tries very hard, and almost succeeds, at turning in a credible performance; but each time he becomes interesting, Scorcese cuts away to some inconsequential crap development back at some filthy dung pile that these folks see fit to fight over.Priest's son?  Bears examination, eh?  My over-riding thought as I watched this picture was, 'My God! What must these people have smelled like?'  I guess Scorcese did succeed in this amount of realism.",4,1,5,10 January 2004
