Howl's Moving Castle," Another Miyazaki classic!
","OK, you'll have to bear with me, this is my first movie review...Howl's Moving Castle continues Miyazaki's legacy of superb animation combined with an original, imaginative story. A wizard set in a future world of warring nations who uses magic to make his semi-industrial, semi-medieval castle move about on spindly legs? Brilliant! Whilst being a romance first and foremost, the film still contains elements of the comic and the sinister. Non-speaking characters such as the scarecrow and the dog are almost a given now in Miyazaki's films, whose actions bridge cultural differences when it comes to comedy, and we also see the return of the wrinkly old lady - another trademark of Miyazaki's recent films. The dark, mysterious side of Howl that the viewer learns of gradually through the film counter-balances the comedy well as to produce a film that has real feeling.Billy Crystal really hits the character of Calcifer spot-on in his voice-over, which makes a refreshing change for those of you who are not fans of Japanese films being re-voiced into English.Finally, although the film is a gem, I can't help feeling a little disappointed in the ending. I can't say too much about it, but it did leave me feeling that the genius Miyazaki is could have done better.",8,0,1,4 December 2005
