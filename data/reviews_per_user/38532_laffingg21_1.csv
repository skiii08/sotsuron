The King's Speech," Very Inpiring
","This is based on the true tale of King George VI (Colin Firth) and his struggle to overcome his stuttering to lift the spirits of his people through their time of war against Germany with his voice. King George is to prepare for his radio broadcast to the people. In his struggles, his wife Queen Elizabeth (Helena B. Carter) searches out of their royal territory to find a speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to do the job. While on his journey, his father dies and his brother Edward (Guy Pearce) takes his rightful place as King. Ultimately Edward is removed due to his marriage to an American divorc√©e. On Bertie's (King George) journey, he learns to let go of his emotions, speak with confidence, and find a friend.The theme of the film is a journey to overcome a challenge and a story about friendship between two uncommon ties. In a strange way this film reminds me of Finding Nemo. Both characters, the King and Marlin must step out of their comfort zone to achieve something. George must overcome his stuttering to be a great king. Marlin must overcome his fear of the ocean to find his son Nemo. Along the way, they become involved with two differing characters. Marlin meets Dory, an optimistic, sociable, and caring regal tang with short-term memory loss. George meets Lionel, a commoner and speech therapist with the advice of his wife. And although the pairs disagree at first, Lionel and Dori are able to help them through it, all the while becoming their life-long friends.The last scene of the film is especially overwhelming for the King's audience and himself. All the angles, cuts and music involved evoke a sense of triumph. The cuts of the film dances with King's George's voice and the sound of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, Movement II. The cuts and angle of this last scene gives us a fish eye view on George as he speaks to Lionel, and all the listeners. The angle also shows us George's point of view of Lionel and includes the microphone. All these combined shows us his struggle. The recording room is also dimly lit with only the natural light through the windows. It brings us more focus to their faces. Notice Lionel's outfit is black, while the king's is white to highlight him. His voice flows great with the music, with the highs and lows, all the while building us up to the beautiful end. King George is finally able to reach the end of this journey and make a great friend along the way.",Null,0,0,3 May 2011
