Hereditary," Are You Kidding Me?
","With all of the great reviews, I couldn't wait to watch this movie. However, like 'The Babadook,' this movie was a complete bomb. I rated it a '3,' and had it not been for the 'man on fire' scene (see teaser) - it would have been a '2.' Not good.",3,1,4,30 August 2019
The Babadook," Negative
","I know, I know - I'm not 'smart' enough to understand that quick shot of the sun represented a grilled cheese sandwich... LOL. Whatever.Any symbol, and/or allegory supposedly representing grief, fear, and loneliness within the film must 'work' to be successful. If 90% of viewers don't see it, or they do not find it entertaining or valuable when they do - then what's the point? I don't need a scarf wearer named Basil to blurt out the word 'metaphor' as if that automatically morphs a bad movie into a good one. In order for a movie like this to be worthwhile, it must be good both above AND below the surface. Unfortunately, this is neither. Instead it tricks the viewer into watching a movie about something they never intended to see.This movie is exactly what it is and nothing more. Don't let anyone shame you or call your intelligence into question if you found it, like I did, both annoying and silly. Don't argue! Just smile, hand them a clove cigarette, and call it a day.",3,2,9,17 February 2020
The Hateful Eight," Like A Bad Joke
","Random and outrages characters who bounce 'clever' lines back and forth like a ping-pong ball around the scene. Problem is that nothing is clever and none of it funny. Then, just as this fact starts to become realized, there's a disturbing act of violence meant to complement the joke. While it wakes you up - that isn't funny either. On and on it goes.Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece. But this is garbage. It's like a watching a former washed up Cy Young pitcher insist he's 'still got it.' You want him to be right but all he does is humiliate himself.",3,1,3,29 November 2019
Lost in Translation," What's Unsaid Speaks Volumes
","I'm just getting around to seeing this movie after accidentally watching 'Broken Flowers.' Murray's performance was so good that I sought out another and I'm so glad that I did. Although 17 years late, I know its probably a good thing because I might not have appreciated exactly how good this movie is if I had watched it back then.This is about a chance encounter resulting in an unexpected and very unlikely connection which leads to a much needed escape for both. In each other's company, the bond between them grows stronger although neither express exactly what it is they actually feel. It's just too soon and there will never be enough time to get there. So once the clock does stop ticking, the irony is that's exactly what they both regret the most. Strange isn't it? To purposely kill time only to wish one had it back? This resonates with those who've had such an experience while simultaneously drawing in those who haven't. It leaves one to ponder: Would it have been better if they never met?The absolute brilliance of the movie was never being able to hear what he whispered to her in the end. But whatever it was, we do know they felt the same way - don't we?",8,1,1,1 May 2020
Midsommar," I Was Almost 'That' Guy
","Knowing this was one of those psychological efforts, I paid close attention to every detail. If doing that doesn't make a movie enjoyable then this isn't for you. As it began to wind down I was thinking '5' in my head until the ending which completely kicked ass. On top of that, it wasn't until about the last 10 seconds that everything actually snapped into place.Whether you liked it or not, one thing is for absolute sure ... you'll be thinking about it well after it's over.",7,2,8,18 January 2020
Inception," Overcooked
","So complicated and stilted that it became boring and silly. A 'kick,' 'totem,' 'levels,' 'layers,' 'dreams within dreams within dreams' 'but that can't be done' 'so let's add another level' 'okay we can make that work' etc. etc. etc. Just a huge bs fest presented in a way that attempts to make the viewer feel like they are learning something important. This despite the fact it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. IDK, reviewers here seemed to love it so maybe it's just me.",4,2,6,1 January 2020
