Requiem for a Dream," You may not like it but...
","...you MUST see this film.Darren Aronofsky has much going for him. He has recently completed and released the critically acclaimed graphic novel entitled 'The Fountain', with a movie of the same name, starring Hugh Jackman, soon following, easily making it one of 2006's most anticipated films. His directorial debut was an acclaimed indie film called 'Pi'. The movie, shot for only $60,000 was a critical success and led to the next step; the masterpiece, Requiem for a Dream. Based on the book of the same name, this movie is a very grim, mature, and dark tale of the lives of those addicted to drugs. The addiction becomes more and more severe as the movie progresses, causing the downfall of each of the characters. They each become desperate and begin to not only become mentally unstable, but also financially, and securely unstable. There is no happy ending here, just a stone cold look at the reality of what one's life might succumb to if one were to become addicted. Requiem for a Dream was hard hitting for me; it changed my life. This movie is one of the few movies that I am able to look beyond the surface and really be affected by. It is not meant for pure entertainment, it is an artistic and original vision of addiction brought to us by the genius Darren Aronofsky. Although this movie is not for everyone, I would still absolutely recommend it to everyone. Not everyone will enjoy it, but as I said, this isn't a movie for pure entertainment. It's the harshness of reality.",10,2,4,28 December 2005
