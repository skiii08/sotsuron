Hereditary," Don't waste your time
","First of all, they barely uncover the family secrets. It was very boring in the beginning and got ridiculous at the end. The reviews were so good I thought this would be a good movie but feel I wasted a couple hours of my life. How does anyone like this movie? Toni Collette's acting was great but we never really know what the pluck was going on. Oh well.",1,1,4,5 September 2018
