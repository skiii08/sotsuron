Skyfall," Bond, James Bond
","I saw 'Skyfall' today WITHOUT reading a single review....very unusual for me. I usually read all of the reviews including other users who have also seen the movie. First of all, it is SOOOOOO much better than the last Bond film.......by a very large margin! The plot is a little hard to swallow but the action was fast and furious. The new 'Q' Ben Whishaw is not only very handsome but quite intelligent. Javier Bardem was a creepy, sick and twisted villain. The locations were per usual Bond films all over the world with standout action sequences. All in all, critics are wrong! If you like Bond this is a great Bond film and Daniel Craig is fast becoming my favorite Bond.",9,3,13,9 November 2012
Gravity," An Oscar contender in more than one category!
","I wasn't too sure about seeing this film, after all it looked kind of one dimensional for a sci-fi flick. Boy, was I wrong! The special effects are dazzling and awe inspiring and fabulous but, this is not just a special effects feast for the eyes....there is one heck of a good story here. You actually believe you are in space. The writing is phenomenal, the acting Oscar worthy. Sandra Bullock was amazing and the musical score was the perfect foil for the storyline. Even George Clooney was exceptional. This was a story of survival plain and simple but done with such mastery that it draws you in and you are there with Ryan Stone throughout the whole movie. You are invested in her fight. It was a simple story told by a master director. Hats off to Cueron and son! GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!",9,3,5,13 October 2013
World War Z," One of the best Zombie movies
","No, the movie did not follow the book and, if you expect it to you might be disappointed. I was NOT! I read the book, which was excellent and the movie didn't follow it but I enjoyed it anyway. It grabbed you and never let go. The action started about 15 minutes in and never let up! I jumped out of my seat several times. If you are expecting zombie gore like in The Walking Dead...you're not getting that either but you will get the crap scared out of you. If you expect shuffling zombies that you can outrun you're not getting that. What you get are quick as lightning biting things that are just plain evil looking and when they swarm you don't stand a snowballs chance in hell! I now know that there are 2 more movies planned and that explains the ending but I still enjoyed the roller coaster ride!",8,4,8,1 July 2013
Passengers," Love Story...in space????
","The critics are just wrong when it comes to Passengers. It's not action filled or has a plethora of alienswhat is does have is a unique love story and a moral dilemma. Of course it IS essentially a love story but it is set in space. Chris Pratt is Jim, one of the 5000 passengers on a giant spaceship traveling to a distant new colony that will take 120 years. His sleeping pod malfunctions and he wakes up 90 years too soon. He finds out that he can't go back into suspended animation.so what is he to do? I won't go into details so as not to spoil the story. What I will say is that the critics are wrong: go see for yourself. The visuals are stunning and the acting is quite awesome. Of course you have the gorgeous and talented Jennifer Lawrence and the always adorable Chris Pratt as the two leads.....and Michael Sheen as the bartender is quite entertaining! I really enjoyed this film and I would tell people to just take a chance and go see it.it's more than a love story. What would you do if you were in Jim's place?",7,0,2,2 January 2017
Life of Pi," Absolutely beautiful..................
","This is one of the most beautiful and powerful films I have seen this year. I have always admired Ang Lee and have seen several of his movies but, this one was so emotional and visually stunning. The director evoked every emotion from all of his characters, including the computer generated ones. The character of Pi as an adult and as a child is one of the most sensitive performances that I have ever seen....even the reporter, though a supporting character still makes you believe in God or some higher power. This is one film I will recommend to everyone and I will own this one as soon as it becomes available.....I am now reading the book because I was so taken with the movie!",9,2,5,11 December 2012
Doctor Strange," A lot of fun!
","First of all let me say I do NOT read the Marvel comics. Everything I know of the Marvel Universe is from the movies. I don't read The Walking Dead either but, I am a BIG fan of the TV series. I knew very little about the mysterious Doctor Strange but, the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch had me very very intrigued. Superheroes don't always leap off the page and rarely do they leap off the screen. My favorites happen to be Ironman, Thor and now Doctor Strange! Everyone said that they could see no one else play Ironman except Robert Downey, Jr....I happen to think Chris Hemsworths Thor is pretty damn awesome and now I find that I really love Doctor Strange! Of course the great storytelling and the brilliant cast didn't hurt! The special effects were, as usual totally mind blowing but, the actors were so compelling. Some of the best scenes were with Wong the librarian and Strange. If you want to bring a super hero to the big screen the number one thing you need to do is get TOP NOTCH actors in the roles and this one did. I am really looking forward to seeing Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange for many movies to come.....he may not get Oscar nods for this portrayal but I hope he makes a of of money and plays Doctor Strange for a very long time!",9,0,2,13 November 2016
American Sniper," American Sniper.....a must see
","It seems that lately there have been a lot of war movies and American Sniper is a war movie but, it is a current war movie. This is the story of the most lethal sniper in US history and a very truthful and brutal reality of what the war in the Middle East is all about. This movie was very hard to watch because we all remember 9-11 and the consequences following the attack. What we don't know is what our troops went through overseas to keep our liberty alive and well. Although I studied all of the wars in school not many folks my age know much about the wars and conflicts in the Middle East and it seems to me to be that these are the most brutal....not knowing who the enemy really is. You might be gunning down women and children who are carrying grenades and bombs to kill our troops. Snipers like Chris Kyle have the toughest job.....and they are American Heroes...have no doubt about that. Every American needs to see this movie and to have a new appreciation for our veterans and for those now serving to keep us safe.",8,6,18,25 January 2015
Man of Steel," Superman returns!
","I was prepared NOT to like this movie. The only reason I went to see it was because of Henry Cavill....he is HOT and I loved him in The Tudors! Turns out it was good, go figure! The plot was good, special effects was very good and the acting was really good. Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman was spot on...very emotional. You could see the conflict within him....when he had to kill Zod you could see he didn't really want to....Zod was a fellow Kryptonion after all and part of a long dead world Superman carries within him. I didn't like the shaky, hand-held documentary way it was filmed-it gave me a headache but, the way Clark picks his role in life as a reporter was very clever. The chemistry between Cavill and Adams really makes me look forward to the sequel! Hats off to Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan for re-booting Superman....it's a rarity to say this because I think Hollywood doing re-makes is getting old but this one was worth it!",8,1,4,14 July 2013
The Imitation Game," Should be the Oscar winner for best film of 2014
","I was like most of the people in the world; not really knowing anything about Alan Turing. I had heard the name in history classes from high school into college associated with the word Enigma. I knew, from history class, that Enigma was the code machine the Nazis used in WWII to thwart the Allies and keep their attacks a secret. I knew it had been broken but knew little about the man and the team that broke it. This film was like a fabulous history lesson...only I was there living it. If I didn't have any reason to like Benedict Cumberbatch before I have a reason to love him now. If he isn't nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role as Turing then I have no faith that the Academy will ever get anything right again. His performance brought me laughter, made me think and, ultimately brought me to tears. The whole world owes this tortured genius a debt of gratitude that we can never repay. If you haven't seen this movie please do; it is a history lesson you won't soon forget.",9,4,11,11 January 2015
The Conjuring," Genuinely scary!
","These days I am NOT a fan of the horror movie. Too many remakes and always a lot of blood and gore....really gross out scenes that are supposed to be scary. This is one breath of fresh air! A horror movie that relies on scares instead of gore. The acting was well above average for a horror movie and this movie had some genuine scares! There were some very scary scenes that relied upon darkness, creepy house sounds and genuine terror! A movie that did NOT rely upon gore and had a back story; truly a novel these days. Believe it as a based upon true events or not.... I loved it! The scares and the thrills are pretty darn good. It's nice to see a genuine horror movie that truly did scare the heck out of me and the rest of the audience! Go see it!",8,0,1,4 August 2013
Cloud Atlas," Could Atlas...brilliant!
","If you are looking for a visually beautiful, brilliantly conceived and directed version of a pretty obscure book this is the one. I had never heard of the book but the teasers about the movie intrigued me. I did some research and found that I really was interested, no, very curious to see this movie. The early reviews were not that great but I never listen to reviewers anyway! The trailers looked glorious! The film was visually stunning, the actors were all very good and the story lines all intertwined so magically I didn't realize that I sat for almost three hours! This film did not disappoint; I will own this one and will probably pay to see it again. It brought me to tears even though the reviews say there is never enough storyline to make you care about the characters.....you do care and the ending makes you smile and feel good.....we are all connected. It's true, we are.",9,3,10,31 October 2012
