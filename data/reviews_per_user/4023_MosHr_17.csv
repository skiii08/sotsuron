Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A trainwreck. Movie about buffoonery, not Sherlock Holmes. Should have called it buffoonic Captain Britannica
","There is an uneasy vibe one gets from the trailer of the new Sherlock Holmes movie, a vibe that the movie might suck and dear god does it suck and suck hard. Where do I start? The awful grating British accent of Downey which falls apart in that sped up, manic tone that Sherlock Holmes has throughout the movie or the super-hero Sherlock Holmes that can do the entire Jackie Chan routine in his head or that the entire plot is dumb as a rock, especially for a movie with the words Sherlock Holmes in its title.The movie does feel high budget. There are expensive looking shots and special effects that litter the movie as the Europe-trotting duo go on their adventure. However, the main theme of the movie is costumed buffoonery - Holmes disguises himself as a woman (for some weak plot points), Watson has a bachelor party, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson squabble like an old couple while we get bombarded with a bevy of unlikable buffoons like Holmes' brother and a squawky Prof Moriatry. All of this buffoonery going on in a paper thin plot, a plot that feels like its been lifted from Captain America; Germans and weapons. Captain American Britannica would be a more accurate title than Sherlock Holmes.There are bombings because it seems like they had a budget for a bomb exploding and wanted some costumed bomb explosions. The plot doesn't tell a story but more like puts all the set-pieces into a time line. This is a movie to avoid unless you can forget all the annoying problems with movie and go watch it for the explosions.",4,32,104,14 December 2011
Sucker Punch," Disappointing ... a torture porn action video-game movie
","First of all, let me say that this movie makes no sense. The movie plot is as explained in the trailer and very little more except that it adds a PG13 'I Spit On Your Grave' style torture and characters. As from the trailer, it's a quest for the four items; the fifth item being a mystery - each quest prompting a grand video-gamesque action sequences.The movie starts off fine, though without explaining much, and devolves so quickly into meaningless flashy sequences devoid of any tension or meaning that you catch yourself feeling jaded of hot chicks in skimpy clothes with machine guns fighting zombie Nazis. To compensate, the movie veers into cruelty, misery and sadistic sequences; a move that offers no payback or for that matter entertainment.The anachronistic mad-house or battlefield with music from the all the decades oozes style but the poor story really brings down the quality of the movie and is a huge disappointment and more than that, it's not even good entertainment.",5,16,36,24 March 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," The first great video game movie
","Resident Evil Afterlife manages the rare feat of seamlessly tying together a wide breath of movie styles; the zombie horror genre mixed with the monster movie genre to the slickness of the Matrix style environments and shootouts all encased in a disaster movie shell and characters. And, it's in 3d and if you've played resident evil 4 video game, there are a lot of derivations from the game that's sure to bring a few giddy moments. Best of all, every second is a total surprise and you'll have no idea where the movie is going and what is going to happen next. It never falls flat or meanders at any time. It is solid and punchy at every second. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's tearing the speakers right off the wall.This is a triumphant action horror movie that oozes with style that resident evil movies have made their own. The 3d aspect is also quite impressive but used mostly subtly rather than having things constantly hurled at your face. The zombies never leap at you or spring their tendrils at you but every scene with 3d has a subtle vibrancy to it and 3D effects are applied in the set piece fights very well. The plot probably has a few holes but the movie moves so fast that you barely have time to think about it or register it. Characters aren't that well flushed out but I suppose every second of character development is one less zombie killed.This is a great action horror movie and really recommended for people who found something to like in the older resident evil movies.",10,16,35,9 September 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Stylish, Atmospheric. But a little hollow and pointless
","'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is an incredible name for a spy book or a movie. Pity what lies underneath is an competent but average story. Starting with the school-boyish obsession with talking in code (where the title comes from) to the ho-hum Russian characterizations and overly stuffy and bureaucratic view of the British intelligence structure, 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' becomes as dramatic as a chess move with a dramatic name.While I was watching the movie, I caught myself thinking about different things, my thoughts wandering because there is just so much space between what goes on. As we get more characters and sub-characters, each one played by as recognizable an actor as the other, all the alluded bombast, gravity and grandeur of the espionage world just boils down to what seems like petty personal bickering. The old cold war character templates, the beautiful Russian girl and the sadist torturer, just feels tired and one-dimensional and personally, just reminds me of the moldy smell of old paperbacks more than anything. The huge hype around the movie got me to see this but while perhaps enjoyable in its atmosphere and music, it's probably the making of simple things overly complicated that made the movie feel hollow and pointless.",6,1,5,5 January 2012
The Expendables," The boys are back in town. Must see for 80s action fans but not a masterpiece
","The expendables feels more than an action movie featuring lots of action stars and as such, the end-result more than the sum of what each individual action star brings to the movie. It feels like a high-school reunion and a philosophical musings of what it means to be an action star. It takes it's time to carve out the habitat, the conversations; the little cracks in their façade that makes us love and cheer our action heroes. This isn't in the James Bond action hero mold with lavishness and sex thrown around, nor is it the losers style music video inspired color splattered offering of style. It feels gritty with history seething out of every line and every interaction. The expendables gather in something like warehouse converted to a machine shop like it's the living room of an aging group of friends. It's the world of soldiers turned mercenaries competing in a small world of like-minded mercenaries like it's some kind of competitive sport.On the other hand, it's infuriatingly full of clichés. Tough as nails protagonist but with a heart of gold, South American dictator tied to the drug trade with rouge CIA agents. The script really drops the ball big towards the end and jumbles up a good buildup. The action scenes sometimes suffer from portions where it's a blur of arms, legs, gunshots and explosions and nothing really is visible.So, all in all, it's a notable addition to the action genre. There are numerous explosions, high impact bullets that tear baddies apart and as you'd expect a good dose of hand to hand combat that some of the stars bring to the table. While the personalities and environment they create are truly awe inspiring, the story and lackluster finale really fizzles this out. However, in the end, the story which is bolted together from a staple of generic 80s non-offensive action plot devices is not the main attraction of the movie. It just provides a palette for all the actors to craft their art which is the highlight of the movie on which it delivers wonderfully.",7,5,22,10 August 2010
The Town," Definitely take a trip to The Town
","The Town takes us back to the lower class Irish Boston area backdrop from the Departed and puts it in a heist movie somewhat reminiscent of Point Break. The end result is a captivating and engrossing thriller that owes mostly to the interesting characters, action sequences and presentation than to the done to death heist movie Swiss cheese plot. We are asked again to sympathize with a bank robber Doug who's a heart of gold kind of guy that carries his automatic rifles to rob banks and to shoot at engine blocks of cop's cars. It's his last job before he puts the town in the rearview mirror with the girl he's fallen in love with.This is an excellent movie and I recommend to everyone to go see it.",9,4,10,13 September 2010
Tangled," Disney movie with the Pixar magic
","Tangled is the retelling of the fairy tale Rapunzel and has the typical Disney treatment. All the characters even look stock Disney except for one major difference, this movie is in 3D. And, boy what a difference that makes. Each character exhibits the entire spectrum of faces and emotions, the visuals are amazing and the use of lighting makes for some really astounding visuals.Who really steals the show is the horse Maximus. He doesn't say a word but he's funny, sympathetic, brave, noble and heroic all with just physical expressions. The other characters are equally well done. I really think this movie marks a significant achievement in Disney's animation and makes me excited about Disney movies in a long time. I highly recommend this movie to see the Disney magic done right.",10,44,61,22 October 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," An emphatic return with a darker story; great movie with lots in it for the adults as well
","The question that has been floating around about Kung Fu Panda 2 is if it is Shrek 2 or Toy Story 2 of animated sequels? Well, I'm happy to say it's Toy Story 2 kind of animated sequel - a genuine good movie that takes risks and succeeds rather than rehashing the first movie.Po isn't as much of a gastro-kung-fu fighter and fanboi from the first movie but has grown in his personality; he's less the Jack Black as a panda and more of a character that stands on it's own. However, Po is now the tragic hero in a Greek style prophecy which foretells of a warrior in black and white who would defeat a certain Lord Shen who has invented a new weapon that could spell the end of kung-fu. As Po learns that he is adopted, he struggles to find out about his past and the strange symbol from his nightmares. The heavy subject matter doesn't weight down the movie and is continually and cleverly able to escape into funny moments without losing gravitas. It successfully weaves the topics of fatherhood, friendship and family into a colorful story that even though we know how it will end, it gets there very very emphatically.I'm really glad that Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't go the route of being a purely children's movie and didn't go the route of being built on jokes of Po's eating and Po's weight. I suppose the fortune cookie philosophy of master Shifu is slightly missed but purely a small quibble in a good movie. As a final note, maybe it's because of my eyesight with a weaker left eye, I barely noticed the 3D at all. Highly recommended movie.",10,130,166,25 May 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A bit disappointing for someone who has read the book
","First of all, why does Daniel Craig keep his British accent while everyone else in the movie does a Swedish accent? This gives the movie an Englishman in Sweden feel, instead of a wholly Swedish story feel. Maybe Daniel Craig got dropped into the movie at the last minute and maybe for that reason also, he never manages to quite capture Blomkvist properly, he's not the tired, financially ruined reporter whose career has just been destroyed escaping his problems, but he comes off as an strong, athletic, physical presence, headstrong and determined.I admit that I finished reading the book right before seeing the movie and probably for that reason the movie felt more like a PBS re-enactment of the book rather than a feature film. The movie felt like it lacked style and when it did apply style, it felt grossly out of tone. For example, the James Bondesque opening 'immigrant song' sequence which seems hardly appropriate for a sleepy murder mystery that aims to explore themes of sexual sadism, Nazism, anti-Semitism etc.The original book is not without its faults, while brilliant in places the author filled in gaps with tripe. Nothing characterizes this more than Lisbeth which the author Larsson made into an Asperger's syndrome inflicted super-intelligent super-human. The movie version of Lisbeth is sexy and cool but cartoonish. There is no effort to elucidate Lisbeth and her actions, she just is cool and smart and that is all we get about her.Having read the book probably puts me in a different category than a large portion of the audience for the movie. While it's never possible to tell a 400-page plus novel in a three hour movie, I really wished for style and focus rather than a quick retelling of the story. It's disappointing that the movie just aims to tell the story rather than take risks and explore themes and ambiances while visually telling the story. Finally as a side note, for those who read the book, the movie version eliminates the Australian sheep station, which leads to a change in the tone of certain characters from the book.",6,11,25,20 December 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Simply amazing! Manages to be even better than the Lord of the Rings
","'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' takes us back to middle earth and this trip back is even better than what I remember of it. The scenes and locations are more detailed and nuanced, the characters presented with more depth and subtlety and the action more frenetic and grander. The movie is an amazing technical as well artistic achievement in all aspects and absolutely a must see movie.'The Hobbit' book is a simpler and shorter story than 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Being stretched out into three movies was expected to make it less epic and more mundane of a movie but that is absolutely not the case. Through sheer skill and artistry of movie storytelling, the plot feels absolutely epic and grand. While perhaps there is less at stake on middle earth than in 'Lord of the Rings', there are more dimensions to the characters: doubt, guilt, frailty and a little extra space for humor and wit, which all paints a more colorful story.At every turn, middle earth brims with overflowing wonder, magic and excitement. The technical wizardry and artistry to create the breath-taking visuals and actions are indescribably amazing and everything is given an extra little more than last time around for us to soak in the intricate details and designs. The dwarf city inside the mountain with its blustering industriousness and craftsmanship, the serene Rivendale, the rickety goblin kingdom all are presented with so much more substance and detail that even though they resemble previous 'Lord of the Rings' set-pieces, they feel completely new and refreshing. The technical prowess and skills of the visual effects department have gotten so much better and that indescribable feeling of awe I felt we had when I first experienced 'Lord of the Rings' set pieces like Moria and Gondor is still evoked watching these new set pieces. Plus, they have also vastly improved their handling of differences in heights of the characters and the interactions feel more natural and fluid. Everything feels like it has multiple layers and depth: from Bilbo's house and pantry to the dwarf and goblin kingdoms to all the skirmishes and battles. Middle earth as is presented here is as close to the perfect fantasy backdrop as it gets.The new cast seamlessly blend into the middle earth world. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage as Thorin make the characters their own. Freeman's initial bumbling English demeanor and then the growth to an adventurer is skillfully done. Armitage wonderfully projects royalty and authority while still being constrained of being a dwarf. Ian McKellen's return as the wizard Gandalf is a more playful and comedic return while Andy Serkis's Gollum is more vicious and expressive than I remember him to be (this possibly is also due to some animation improvements in Gollum as well). The rest of the dwarf company are too many to keep track of individually but as a group they provide for the expected dwarfian physical humor but also the gravity when needed of a people who have lost their home. This generation of middle earthians are all around as wonderful a group to get to know as the generation from the 'Lord of the Rings' movies.'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is simply amazing and is one the best movies ever made. With great storytelling, amazing visuals and very skillful acting, the movie grips you in a multiple of levels and never lets go. It is a movie to be seen as soon as humanly possible.",10,280,562,11 December 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission imbecile. A by the numbers movie with an uninspired plot.
","Here we go again, another spy thriller action movie that looks like it was half made for the car, cellphone and tourism companies, and half made for the superstars to generate talk in the celebrity shows and magazines about how athletic they are, how cool they are, how funny they are. What it certainly doesn't seem to be made for is an interesting plot or a story or anything resembling an opinion. The plot is so generic and predictable that I doubt anyone will remember any of it in a few month's time. It's a bean counter's action movie, utterly predictable and by the numbers, designed for star-power and product placement. It's more of an insult to the movie goer than entertainment.If you enjoyed the other Mission Impossible movies, you'll probably enjoy it too. If you didn't like the older mission impossible movies, don't go to this movie thinking that this one's different or you'll be sorely disappointed.",4,28,57,15 December 2011
Drive," Moody, stylish and quiet movie. Weak and unsatisfactory story.
","Driver is a story of an unnamed laconic protagonist - all action hero minus the one liners and more than that all the conversations kept to a bare minimum. In fact, the lack of responses and the silence between scenes of immense cartoonish violence drew laughter out of the audience; possibly because there is room left for reactions but we are given none, just swathes of silence. The story is perhaps secondary to the vibe and style deriving it's ingredients from mob logic of why all the cast dies or is slated to be killed.One thing that Driver doesn't strive towards is the standard action fare of Transporter series or the car-mod scene of Fast Furious movies. The few car chase scenes are well done, the highlight being the first one evading the police but really isn't enough of it to be a car chase fan's movie. Most drivings are like videos for pounding 80s-insipired synth-pop soundtrack. It dwells heavily on the brooding and moody ambiance that never leads to any sort of payoff.The biggest fault of the movie is that it doesn't tell a story, everybody does their thing and then it's over. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan look gorgeous all highlighted by the lingering and lengthy close-ups. Oscar Issac manages to exude an unlikeable vibe and Ron Perlman does his thing stealing a few scenes. The movie won't have everyone cheering in the theater but will leave audience with little bursts of uncomfortable laughter and then a vibe rather than a story when it ends.",6,11,38,9 September 2011
The Hangover Part II," An exact copy of the first Hangover in Bangkok with a displeasing undertone for Asians
","The movie needs no introduction nor a plot outline literally; it's basically a carbon copy of the first one and so instead of everyone screaming 'what's happening?', it's everyone screaming 'it happened again' and then basically everyone going through exactly the same motions.One thing this movie illustrates, albeit very unintentionally, is the pathetic state of the Asian-American influence on Hollywood and American entertainment industry. The subtext of the movie is the emasculation of the Asian male; the proud father whose daughter is taken almost against his will, a bright young man who is a brilliant musician and a aspiring surgeon has his finger chopped off and casually discarded, an Asian gangster whose penis is the size of a mushroom whose driving skills aren't that good to boot and worst of all Bangkok, whose most prominent resident is a transvestite. Poor Bangkok! Bangkok isn't the virile and threatening place that's been seen in many movies, it's just an 'Asiantown' to be conquered and beaten - words echoed by the characters themselves.Stu (Helms) is now marrying Lauren (Chung) however her father considers Stu to be boring as white rice. The father-in-law is half a dimensional character and rather sadly I can't think of a solid Asian actor who could give it more dimensionality. Lauren's brother Teddy is the apple of his father's eyes who is played an actor who is nothing short of a bobble-head who doesn't express a single emotion and goes through the movie with a contorted smile that he can't stifle. Ken Jeong gives a good performance playing a gangster who is unpredictable and out of control, but completely toothless, meek and nonthreatening; and ultimately discarded without a single thought. The movie tries to be about the empowering and masculinization of Stu and that there is a darkness inside him but it really is just thrown in there in the end and not a theme whatsoever. The three main actors Cooper, Galifianakis and Helms have since the last Hangover gone on to become big names and they do their thing.It's a cliché but the Hangover Bangkok edition could have been so much more. But, what it is that it's a slumming through Bangkok with the ugly American point of view, and a testament to the pathetic state of Asian-American actors, cultural icons and general influence on the entertainment industry.",4,36,94,24 May 2011
The Artist," Story of pride, fall, loyalty, love and redemption.
","As the movie started and the projected picture shortened to half the screen, became black and white, and did away with dialog, my biggest concern was if this is just a gimmick that would wear really really thin over the one and half hour movie runtime. Modern audiences are used to widescreen pictures, vibrant colors and booming sounds; could a hundred year old movie experience still captivate modern audiences? In short, yes.We are transported to the 20s Hollywood, pretty girls and dashing leading men filming stories of adventure and action. But, without sound and dialog, the actors use elaborate facial and physical cues to inform the audience of what's going on. And, throughout the movie that is all the actors use. With great skill, the actors take use through the gamut of emotions, happiness to personal hell, triumph to despair, love to heartbreak. Valentin, a star in the silent movie era, laughs at the advancement of technology of talkies at his own peril. His pride, his fall, his despair and his love are all communicated poignantly through this medium.The only major criticism that I have for the movie is the soundtrack. Rather than ebbing and flowing with the movie, the orchestral soundtrack feels somewhat robotic and dull.If you're intrigued by the idea of the movie, then I highly recommend you see the movie.",8,0,1,21 December 2011
Jack Reacher," All about the introduction of Jack Reacher; Lousy flimsy plot.
","'Jack Reacher' is all about the introduction of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher; he is presented here as a superman who can out-wit, out-fight, out-run and out-shoot anyone and everyone. While Tom Cruise does a decent job with Reacher, the main problem with the movie is that the overly elaborate plot setup at the beginning can only offer a minuscule payoff at the end. The plot splutters and whittles out to nothing in the end making the whole movie feel anti-climactic and pointless.The trailers for the movie are misleading. My first impression from the teaser was a Punisher sort of movie. My second impression, from the roars of the muscle car in the trailer, was one that of one of those Nic Cage action movies. It is neither. It's a stuffy cop/crime show movie at first and then a punch out, shoot out and car chase kind of action movie next (though its humble budget only allows for moderately wrecking of three cars with none exploding). Think 'Alex Cross' kind of movie. Jack Reacher is presented here as a sort of GI batman who is great at detective work, combat work and not bad at quick talking either; always there with a heavy punch or a witty comeback. The entire movie, plot and the characters just serve as the canvas to show off Jack Reacher's virtues. As Reacher says, 'he has nothing to lose or gain', and so the Reacher we meet at the beginning of the movie is the same Reacher at the end of the movie and so the whole movie feels like one long introduction to the amazing Mr. Reacher. In fact, Reacher is vastly over-developed; things like being off the grid and unable to be contacted, or being an ex-military investigator where his every suspect was a trained killer, are superfluous to the movie plot at hand and just there for the sake of making Reacher look more awesome. There is a passable low-budget detective action movie underneath all this. This detective story has the feel of an 80s action cop movie mixed in with the style of modern TV crime and legal drama but without any of the Mission Impossible style high budget action sequences. It's a pity the plot can't fully rise up to challenge Jack Reacher which might have made for a good movie. Although, there is engrossing half an hour in the middle of the movie when Reacher is searching for his assailants and the girl Sandy that shows a glimpse of what the movie could have been if the plot had been better.Overall, 'Jack Reacher' doesn't feel like a big action movie; the plot is small and riddled with logic holes and the story is driven by actions because it's the only way for the plot to move forward. But, the charisma of the stars pull this into something watchable. The cynic in me feels like this is a low-budget, low-risk test to see if 'Jack Reacher' can be made to a Mission Impossible like franchise rather than a real movie that stands on its own two feet.",6,13,32,20 December 2012
The Woman in Black," The Daniel Radcliffe Exploitation Show
","How much you will enjoy this movie will rest heavily on how much you would enjoy looking at Daniel Radcliffe for two hours. For the entirety of the movie, he is either on the screen or a few seconds away from being so. Daniel Radcliffe is a handsome man; great posture, very well-dressed and the sideburns give him a completely new look that is far and away from Harry Potter. But half an hour into the movie, I'm already sick of looking at him. If it was Emma Watson for two hours, then that'd probably be good entertainment for me but I suppose there are lots of movie goers who would prefer Daniel Radcliffe and this should prove good entertainment for them.The movie plot is a ghost story but really is an excuse to get Daniel Radcliffe alone inside a house where he cautiously walks from room to room with sudden jack in the boxes frights. We get long shots of him cautiously walking towards something and then BAM! something pops out and then we have another long shot of him reacting and adjusting. A large portion of the movie is spent simply looking at Radcliffe. I remember a few such movies where we spend half the movie looking at beautiful female leads but here looking at Radcliffe isn't as engaging for me.As a horror movie, it's around par or slightly below par. The low budget really shows through and the unimaginative use of the limited budget really makes the movie grind. The scares are cheap and as the movie goes on, it only increases in frequency rather than in scale and so, the movie really never takes off instead just plodding along. On the other hand, by not being one of those digital camera horror movies, it has some clear beautiful shots but again, somewhat wastes it by staying indoors and only using glimpses of the beautiful setting and outdoors of the location. However, in my book, its biggest fault is that it is simply without many new ideas, if follows the horror genre recipe to the tee and becomes rather predictable.The focus, the center, the star and the reason for the movie is Daniel Radcliffe and unfortunately, there is not much more. This is probably a good enough reason for a lot of movie goers. However, I found the movie dour, risk-averse and unimaginative.",5,21,63,1 February 2012
Footloose," Deep southern fried footloose
","The new footloose is a real hodgepodge; dancing, Southern culture, love story, family, church, tragedy all sort of power-blended into with the spices of music styles of blues, country, Jack White and the footloose theme song. While perhaps brilliant in small areas, it doesn't make for a good film.I don't know if it's because I'm a guy, I found Julianna Hough's character fascinating or maybe it's because it's something the director really knows how to do well. It's basically the same character as Christia Ricci's in Black Snake Moan. The themes are all there, young confused beautiful girl that's rebelling in sexuality but meets salvation from her troubles from a man who refuses the sexual advances for something more gentlemanly. Saying that, Justin Timberlake's acting and character in Black Snake Moan was one of the most atrocious things on a major movie. The new-comer dancing Kenny Wormald fares a lot better but doesn't manage to shine. Ren played by Kenny, never really exudes rebellion nor does the chemistry with Ariel (Hough) truly sizzle. He exudes the sinuous athleticism but rarely convinces as a public orator or as a rebel or a lover. Dennis Quaid doesn't look the part of a preacher and feels way too hip to be an antagonist to dancing.For a movie with dancers in the lead, the movie is quite restrained in the dancing department. It is almost stolen by Willart (Miles Teller) who does his amateurish renditions that almost outshine Ren. There is never a real sizzling dance between Ren and Ariel except for a short one in a drive in movie field that is never given the full treatment. Even the factory solo dancing isn't cathartic and explosive enough to awe. The soundtrack that mixes blues, country, rock and with a very little pop does give the movie a distinctive feel but really detracts from dancing since the choreographers don't really become inventive with the odd soundtrack. The angst, family drama and tragedy never seem to gel with the footloose skeleton borrowed from the original movie, nor does it really gel with the dancing.While the movie is truly Brewer's footloose, the movie would have greatly benefited from either more dancing or a more introspective study of catharsis through dance by a more charismatic lead. As it is, it's an odd movie - riding on the footloose name while trying to explore themes perhaps not quite suitable to a dance movie.",6,4,14,10 September 2011
