Raiders of the Lost Ark," if not the greatest movie ever it's a healthy second.
","Ever since the first time i have seen raiders of the lost ark (when i was about 5 years old) i have been in love with the Indiana Jones movies. Raiders was a movie i watched every day over and over again.  Although when i was 8 i liked Star Wars even more, all the star wars and Jones movies are now tied.  It is my opinion that Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the greatest movies ever made, and if it isn't it's without a doubt a healthy second.  Contains a great story, cast of characters, actors, and of course for you big action fans, great action scenes.",10,0,0,29 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Truly Amazing
","When the trailers for Attack of the Clones first started show up on hte internet, tv and movie theaters i was truly blown away.  Images of the new film had me psyched and ready to be thrilled in theaters.  My most common words about the trailers were, 'if the movie is half as good as these trailers make it look, it will be the first time i ever have a favorite star wars movie.' The movie delivered juut that.  Filled with a wide variety of action, adventure, romance and humor i found Attack of the Clones to be the best star wars movie to date.  I have been a fan since I was eight years old. Star Wars has always been viewed as one story by me, however i felt Attack of the Clones is that one chapter of a story that really sticks out and stays with you forever. Some people will say the dialog was corny, sappy or just bad however I felt the dialog was perfect for the movie.  Lucas was able to bring the worlds in this movie alive with the dialog and locations.  The movie brings you much deeper into the star wars story, with some huge twists and surprises (espcially one that involves a little green man and his lightsaber, :]). The acting in the movie was great for the most part I felt.  Hayden lets you see both sides of Anakin in this installment, as he slowy sinks more and more towards the dark side. Overall i rate this film a 10 out of 10, terrific acting, story, special effect, music, and action make this my favorite star wars film of them all.",10,0,0,17 May 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A movie worthy of the name Jones
","So far Indiana Jones last adventure.  i thought this Jones movie was fantastic, a big improvement from Temple of Doom.  Combined with a nice amount of comedy between Henry Jones JR (Indiana), and his father Henry Jones and a great amount of action equals one of the greatest movies of all time.  if you were a fan of Raiders and/or temple of doom, this movie is for you",9,0,0,3 January 2000
