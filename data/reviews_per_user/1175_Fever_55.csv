The Devil's Advocate," zowie
","This movie has a whole lot of nudity...and not much else. A good story line turns predictable and we just didn't need to see Keanu Reeve's butt. I think he's good looking, but we didn't need to go down that road. Al Pacino does a good job and there are some eye-catching effects, but as a whole, I thought the credits rolling with 'Paint It Black' playing was the best part of the movie.",6,1,3,11 August 1998
The Blair Witch Project," Am I supposed to be scared by this?
","I finally got around to seeing this movie and I have to say....huh? What was all the hype about? The premise about a documentary was interesting, but these kids were completely stupid. Losing the map, not knowing how to read a compass, and trekking in the woods at that time of year can only lead to disaster. Plus, knowing it was not real made that whole 'sticks hanging from the trees' thing totally unrealistic. Finally, that last scene had so many things wrong with it, I had to rewind it several times just to figure out what the heck was going on. Don't bother, there are several other horror movies out there that are much better.",Null,0,0,15 November 1999
The Ring," disturbing, but disappointing
","**possible spoilers**Much like 'The House on Haunted Hill' (remake), this movie has disturbing images, spooky face shots and 'speed film' images. Once the story finally explained itself, which took forever, the ending still didn't make sense. How was the tape shot? Why would she still kill people after being set free? Why was Aidan involved...is he clairvoyant? How did Rachael survive and Noah not? ugh. anyways, lots of scenes that leave nasty images in your mind and it definitely needed the 'R' rating. No way this is appropriate for pre-teens. Heck, I'm 30 and I could barely handle it.There are better psychological thrillers out there. Save your rental money.",Null,0,1,7 May 2003
Coraline," shockingly inappropriate
","I was expecting a lot of Tim Burton-style with a hint of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. What I got was a just plain nightmare. Shelling out the extra $3 to see it in 3D, I was overwhelmed with fast moving images and color layouts that looked like Picasso on acid. What bothered my daughter were the spooky images of the 'other' family's crossed out eyes. It ended up scaring her. What bothered me was those two weird sisters that did their little musical number with the fat one wearing little more than a thong and nipple flowers. I almost regurgitated my popcorn at that point. I know they tried to send the message of 'be careful what you wish for' and being happy with what you have, but this left me feeling nauseated, disappointed and wanting my money back.",2,1,9,6 March 2011
Alien: Resurrection," why, why, why
","The original was great, the second one was pretty cool. The third was a little unnecessary, but this was beyond pathetic. Same bloody scenes, same acid blood, blah, blah, blah. This is two hours of gore, bore and snore. Sigourney...the plot is dead...spare us please!",1,5,10,6 August 1998
The Hunger Games," the book was better
","**spoilers**I read the trilogy recently--it was phenomenal. Being excited for the movie, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Lost details and forgotten back stories are almost guaranteed. However, after seeing it, I honestly don't know how I feel about it. While it generally followed the book, a lot of things got lost in translation. Most of the cast was perfect: Katniss, Gale, Effie, Cinna, Cato, (the jury is still out on Harrelson as Haymitch). But Rue was terribly disappointing. She wasn't at all who I imagine, it was a terrible choice. As far as the details of the story, I found it funny how Katniss found water right away, never appeared hungry or thirsty and her injuries were more flesh wounds. Did anyone notice that she didn't lose her hearing after the explosion or Peeta didn't lose his leg? The Avox was never addressed... why? And what about the riots in District 11? What happened to the bread they gave Katniss? The muttations were disappointing too. The book described them as being morphed from dead tributes, an excellent twist; while the movie interpreted them as CGI-created wolf things. If you haven't read the book, go see it. If you've read the book, I'm afraid you'll be just as perplexed as I was. It was very similar to how I left 'New Moon'. That feeling of what? how could they forget so much? Just as the Twilight movies got better, hopefully these sequels will improve as well.",7,2,9,24 March 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," What more do you need
","I anxiously awaited the release of this movie and I absolutely loved it! After all, you've got Bruckheimer, Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp and ILM. What more do you need? Depp was perfect for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow and Knightly is so beautiful it's disgusting (Bloom is pretty yummy too!) True, it is a tad long, but lots of fun. Can't wait for the release on DVD.",Null,0,0,24 October 2003
Hostel," Yawn
","**mild spoilers** In the last few years, Hollywood has made lots and lots of horror movies. Unfortunately, they have been mostly gore and no scare. 'Hostel' was perfect example. There was plenty of gore, as well as nudity. The nudity wore me out after a while, but I'm a woman and boobs do nothing for me. When are these characters going to learn that backpacking Americans in creepy, back-road villages is just asking for trouble? It's not hard to guess who's the first to get killed and we feel nothing for these characters. Josh was the only normal guy, the other two were like little horny frat boys who had never seen a breast before--shesh. The torture scenes are very odd. We see very little, hear a lot and then it's over. What I didn't get was 'Igor' who was chopping up the body parts to toss in the fire--why did he chop them up? He could've just tossed them right in whole. Anyways, I digress. There was absolutely no fear factor. I never got scared, no 'jump out of your seat scenes' and nothing that made me cover my eyes. And trust me, I'm a horror flick wuss. I spent most of 'Silent Hill' in my husband's lap with my eyes closed. That movie scared the bejeezus out of me. I'm disappointed to hear that they made a second one--probably more of the same. And it's sad, Tarantino is a very talented guy, he can do much better than this. I'll pass on the sequel.",2,1,3,17 May 2007
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not for the faint of heart
","This movie had an 'R' rating for a good reason. Absolutely no one under 17 should be seeing this movie, shesh, there were scenes that made even me blush. But, it was absolutely the most hysterical thing I've ever seen. The scene with Bill Gates was definitely the best. It was the only time I've ever seen an entire theater burst into applause.If you are a fan of South Park, see this. If you have not watched the episodes or are not into it, don't start here. If you are over 30, you will hate it. The humor is sick, twisted and full of sexual references that will make even the most experienced person blush. If you are in need of some comic relief, this is it.",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
The Mummy," A great flick
","Despite the bad reviews I've read, this was a great movie. The effects were nifty, there was actually a story, and Brendan Fraser makes a great action hero who is to die for. See this movie if you are in the mood for a fantasy story with adventure and a few laughs.",9,0,0,8 May 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," very disappointing
","**SPOILERS** I couldn't wait to see the (hopefully) last installment of the 'Pirates' series. 'Curse of the Black Pearl' is probably one of my all-time favorite movies. I finally got a chance to see 'At World's End' and I left bewildered and disappointed. I liked the first one because the CGI's were well-placed, very convincing and didn't flood the movie. This time my head hurt from all the CGI's. The fighting scene near the end where they're intertwined in the swirling vortex dragged on, was one big special effect and didn't really make the movie any better. Here are a few other random questions about the movie:-Was it really necessary to kill Will and make him the captain of the Dutchman? I hated that! (remember, I'm the hopeless romantic) -What was the point of releasing Calypso? -3 hours long??? man, they could have easily shaved off 1/2 hour off the movie -How many times did Jones need to ask 'Do you fear death?' -The scene where we see Jack in the 'afterlife' dragged on...and on and on. Hallucinate, Lick the rock, throw the rock, pull the boat, hallucinate some more....enough already!!!!Anyways, I have to say I was very disappointed with 'At World's End'. I did stick around to see the 30 second 'extra clip' at the end of the credits. Yes, it was sweet, but it didn't make up for much. I really hope they don't make a 4th one.",3,0,4,26 June 2007
X-Men," One very cool movie
","I watched the cartoon many years ago and I've always been a little nervous about making a full version movie from a cartoon or video game, but this was done quite well. Though several characters were left out, the cast stayed true to the comic and cartoon. And of course, only Patrick Stewart could play Prof. X.The other point to make is Hugh Jackman. He did a remarkable job as Wolverine/Logan. This part was originally supposed to go to Dougray Scott, but Jackman was cast instead, and pulled it off. I just don't think a skinny Scottsman like Dougray could've done the same job. Jackman played Wolverine/Logan with perfect ruthlessness and anger, and added some mysterious 'je ne c'est quoi' that made you think about even after the movie was over.X-men is a fun summer flick with great special effects that isn't very deep or disturbing like so many recent movies. I can't wait for the second one.",Null,0,0,25 July 2000
Cloverfield," Freakish and terrifying
","I was a big fan of 'The Blair Witch Project'. The idea behind it was great and it was spooky as hell. This is very much along the same lines. In documentary-style filming, a group of 20-somethings live out a monster attack on Manhattan through the eyes of the camera holder. Trust me, it's freaky and made me sick to my stomach (pop some Dramamine before you watch this one). There was very little gore, but the effects and camera action make you feel like you're racing down the streets for your life. Though there's lots of unanswered questions like -what was it? -why did it attack? -did anyone survive? -what exactly happened to Marlena? blah blah blah, it was a very effective movie in basically scaring the crap out of you. The last scene is especially moving as you hear the infamous 'thud' of the camera, just like you do in 'Blair Witch'. This is a wild one.",7,0,1,9 May 2008
Silent Hill," A spooky, disturbing thriller
","My husband chose this movie as part of our 'date night'. It ended up working out well for him because I spent half the movie in his lap with my eyes closed. e-gad. Usually horror movies don't bother me. It's not the blood (heck, I'm in nursing school, I love to pick out the anatomical inaccuracies). What bothers me are the monsters that are grossly deformed and that lurch through dark hallways with eerie moaning. The monsters in this movie are highly disturbing--especially when a body who was previously tied up with barbed wired gets up, inverts his body and starts crawling around in unnatural positions. The visual effects are quite stunning. The scene where Rose is in the bathroom and everything starts 'peeling upwards' is really cool.What I can't figure out is the ending, which leads me to ask--and here is the spoiler-- was Rose dead the whole time? In the scene where she crashed her jeep we think she just hurt her head. She ends up running in a town where ash falls like snow and the original road that lead her in is broken off. When her husband arrives to look for her, the road is fine, sun is out and there's no ash. Then when she runs through the school hall, everything is blackened and dark, but her husband run through the same hallway that just looks old and deserted--then he 'senses' her. I didn't think much of it at the time. Yet in the end when she goes home, everything is grayish. Then we see the husband in the house, and everything is a normal color. hhhmmmmm, did she die when she hit her head? It makes sense because the cop could also be dead--remember she crashed her bike. Part of the girl's revenge was 'killing' those that burned her way back when, but because most everyone died in the city fire, those people were dead too. Part of 'killing' them was destroying their ghost or soul, or whatever you want to call it. Hhhhmmmmm, what do you think?",5,1,3,2 May 2006
Fargo," A brilliant picture
","I finally saw this movie just recently and I have to say that I was very impressed. First off, the North Dakota accents were so true to life it was scary. It had an original plot (so rare these days) and excellent actors to carry it out. While it was a little on the bloody side, it deserved the Oscars it received.",Null,0,0,29 March 2000
Léon: The Professional," One of the best
","This is one of Luc Besson's best. Well filmed and acted, this flick combines the best of European film makers (Luc Besson, Eric Serra) with American acting (Gary Oldman plays a great bad guy). If you liked 'The Fifth Element ', also directed by Luc Besson, you will like this one.",9,1,2,6 August 1998
The Village," weird...but very good
","There were such bad reviews of this movie, I had to see it. I've been a huge fan his work. This movie is very typical of his design--unexplained scenes, foreshadowing and the ending that doesn't really end. You'll notice as you watch this that some things just don't make sense but he does explain them all and the plot twist is a jaw dropper. The ending is also much like 'Signs'. It doesn't really end-- there's no last battle where the villain is defeated. The true nature of the story is revealed and the characters go on about their lives. I think that's why people were so disappointed. I do have to say I didn't like Sigourney Weaver in this. She's an excellent actress, but she just didn't fit the character. Phoenix was great as always.If you love 'Signs' or 'The Sixth Sense', you'll love this. The story is a little slow, but don't worry, everything is explained and though Phoenix's 'color' is never revealed, get ready for a few jump-out-of-your-seat scenes.",8,0,0,16 January 2005
Pitch Black," Same plot, different movie
","Sigh, recent horror movies have been rather disappointing, this is one in particular. Take the plot of just about any horror movie made, and just switch the actors and the title. Same old mysterious alien (which you never actually get a good look at), same predictable ending. My husband and I were even guessing as to which character was the next to get knocked off...and we were right each time!I wouldn't even bother with Pitch Black until it comes out on video.",Null,0,0,24 March 2000
The Hills Have Eyes," plenty graphic
","In my recent search to find a descent horror flick, 'The Hills Have Eyes' was my next choice. Being born and raised in New Mexico, I am always interested in movies that are either filmed there or claim to take place there. Now that I live in St. Louis, I am a big critic of 'New Mexico' movies. First off, the opening scene had me laughing hysterically. I love how they made the desert look more like Mars. It was obviously not filmed there. There are a lot of directing mistakes, mainly in geography. First off, there is no Hwy 88. I also know that parts of NM (like near Lordsburg and Alamogordo) look pretty desolate, but it's not as bad as shown in the movie. I'm also surprised how these 'creatures' keep sneaking up on the characters in the wide open desert. Here are a few more mistakes: there are no mosquitoes in NM--it's the desert--remember? Also, if it's supposed to be the middle of summer, why are they wearing pants and jackets when it would be 95-105 degrees outside? There was gore galore and a few 'jump out of your seat' scenes. I was a little weary to watch the scenes with the baby (being a mom, it was hard to think what they might have done to her). I also don't like how they portrayed the mom. Why do they always make them sound so stupid? ie- 'oh, honey it's probably just a coyote....' I think I'll wait until the second one comes out on DVD, but 'The Hills Have Eyes' is only slightly better than others in recent months.",2,1,1,26 May 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," You've gotta be kidding me
","**Warning** Contains spoilersI couldn't wait to see this movie and now that I did, I haven't been this disappointed in a really long time. There are numerous plot holes, time line contradictions and scenes where the special effects were clearly obvious. First of all, the movies takes place as if T2 never happened. The whole premise behind T2 was the creation of the machines based on finding the chip and the arm from T1. After their destruction, the movie should have ended. Now, the movie is based off a secret government agency creating machines that are now being taken over by a 'virus'. The worst part is, after all the effects, all the action and even the humor which could have saved the movie...judgment day still happens?!?!?!?Problem #1- in the movie, Sarah Connor dies in 1997. The problem with this is that T2 was based in 97 and she certainly didn't look like she was on her last leg. Problem #2- The TX was designed to terminate Connor's lieutenants, yet she magically runs into Connor in a situation too preposterous to believe. Lastly, when she does find him, she has numerous opportunities to kill him, but never does. Can't figure that one out. Problem #3- Clearly Connor survived judgment day, as did Brewster. So what was the point of getting them to the bomb shelter when they survived the attack in the first place? Why on Earth make judgment day still happen? My jaw literally hit the floor when the bombs went up and the screen went dark. I was so disappointed. What a waste of time, energy and money. If you haven't seen it, don't bother. If you have, my sympathies.",Null,0,0,17 August 2003
Wanted," crap from the start
","**possible spoilers** I'm always fascinated by recent Angelina Jolie movies. I could make a drinking game out of how many pouting-lip scenes there are. This movie starts out action-packed and never really stops. But soon, the CGIs get old, the slow shooting angles grow redundant and there are plenty of 'yeah right' scenes. After a while, the defiance of physics and medical reality bored me-- like the train that falls down a cliff several hundred feet with people walking away and later being shot, stabbed and blown up without feeling a thing. Oh, and by the way, did you know a bullet can travel in a circle going through several heads in the same spot no matter how tall they are without losing velocity? Yeah, whatever.",2,2,5,15 July 2009
Face_Off," great action flick
","When an actor can play both a bad guy and a good guy, and do it convincingly , that is called talent. Both Travolta and Cage do that very thing quite well here. Cage's evil nature and Travolta's good-heartedness are well acted. Then the plot twist will leave you seeing double, yet their characters remain convincing. A few glaring directing mistakes, but overall a great action flick.",Null,1,1,17 August 1998
Dark City," A true masterpiece
","I happened to see this movie because 'Lost in Space' was sold out. Man, am I glad I saw this one instead. It is an excellent movie. Well filmed and acted, with a brilliant story and stunning effects. This movie finally takes us back to when movies actually had a plot and entertained us. Critics called it 'a true sci-fi flick' and I couldn't agree more. Not sci -fi like T2 or Aliens, but sci-fi in expanding our imagination, our reality and our perceptions. People have got to see this one.",10,1,2,12 August 1998
The Exorcist," The scariest movie I've ever seen
","Next to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this is the most frightening movie I've ever seen. I saw it when I was 14 and I couldn't sleep or eat pea soup for a week. Some very vivid cinematography and graphic demonic imagery make this a movie not to watch alone in the dark. An excellent, but scary piece of movie making.",Null,2,3,17 August 1998
The Usual Suspects," One of my favorites
","This has to be one of my favorite movies around. The acting is superb, it's well filmed, and there's actually a plot...and a very thick one at that. This film keeps you guessing until the end. And once you reach the end, you'll never believe who the 'bad guy' was. I highly recommend this movie.",10,2,4,5 August 1998
District 9," the most worthless piece of crap I've ever seen
","Honestly, I really don't know what the big deal is with this movie. It was raved as inventive, well-filmed, great effects, blah blah blah. You have to be kidding me. Once again, we are taken through the documentary-style movie about aliens, this time adding their colonization and relocation. It's supposed to be an 'inside look' at what the agents go through and what happens to one agent in particular. Yet what we end up with is the same old, redone, repetitive yawns. Ten years ago when 'The Blair Witch Project' came out, it was revolutionary. But film after film later of the same thing, it gets old after a while. There's only so much of the jiggling camera I can take. The story got really old really fast and I just kept thinking it has to get better. But it never did. We actually left halfway into it, something I haven't done in at least a decade. Don't waste your time with this one. Garbage!",1,11,27,29 November 2009
Twilight," everyone just chill....
","Whenever a movie comes out, I'm always hysterical at how people over analyze, over criticize and just plain freak out. Mind you, I'm not the target audience for Twilight, but this movie was great (and I'm 35!) So here's my guideline: if you fall into one of the following categories, you should not see this movie:1. You didn't read the book 2. You're a man (the idea of monogamy and abstinence are probably shocking) 3. You don't like female directors (for some reason people tend to diss movies of female directors quicker) 4. You're expecting blood and nudityHowever, if you fall into one of these categories, you should see this movie:1. You read the book(s) 2. You're a hopeless romantic and/or you always secretly wished to be desired by someone dangerous or forbidden 3. You don't over analyze things and just enjoy movies for what they are 4. You know that the book is always betterDoes the movie do the book justice? of course not, they never do. You never get the same emotions out of a movie. But just as Interview with the Vampire was a better book and is still the best vampire movie out there, Twilight is an amazing read that makes a great flick. Considering the amount of really bad vampire movies made in the last 10 years (Van Helsing, Dracula 2000, John Carpenter's Vampires, etc.), this is a welcome change. I can't wait for 'New Moon'.",9,1,7,24 November 2008
28 Days Later...," ok, but with lots of questions
","**possible spoilers**My husband said I was reading too much into this movie, but as I watched it, questions just kept popping up. Where did this virus come from? Why didn't the infected kill each other? Why did they all die of starvation...did they not feel like eating? How could the virus get overseas if the infected killed everyone? and on and on. It's one of those movies like 'The Blair Witch Project'...if you know it's fake, it doesn't have the same appeal.Not the worst movies I've ever seen, but I thought '12 Monkeys' was a better movie with a lot less gore.",Null,0,1,5 December 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Deja vu all over again?
","What can we say but 'seen it!' This tired film is full of useless characters , repeat scenes and directing mistakes the size of Texas. The original 'Jurassic Park' was actually quite frightening in parts. But once you've seen the T-Rex screech and eat people, it gets old really fast. Plus, what is the deal with the T-Rex waltzing through the suburbs? The first flick made a definite statement about the T-Rex approaching. Now, the T-Rex can wander through suburbia in the middle of the night without a single person hearing him? whatever. Plus, Ian Malcolm's daughter had to be the worst excuse for a new sequel character. Please, do your brain a favor and just watch the original.",3,0,8,3 August 1998
The Number 23," freaky and cool
","The trouble with many actors that do only a particular type of film, is that once they go outside of their box, it's just too weird. This is true to Jim Carrey. We've become so accustomed to his comedy flicks that this throws us off guard. I kept waiting for him to crack jokes, but they never came. This is a true drama/thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.Carrey plays a man who starts reading a book that more and more sound like it was written just for him. Then strange occurrences of the number 23 keep popping up and the story gets weirder and weirder. But trust me, stick with it--the twist is a jaw dropper.I have to say it was a bit odd to see Carrey in the sex scenes-- I kept waiting for him to jump up and say 'ssssssmokin!!!' I thought overall it was a great movie.",8,94,131,6 September 2007
I Am Legend," Not another zombie movie
","I rented this, even though my husband said it was terrible. But, I insisted. At first, it had potential. It was interesting to see Smith's day-to-day basics. What would you do if you were the only person left? But the disappointment came when the storyline questions turned into gaping plot holes. So many questions came up.-You're telling me out of over 6 billion people, there is only one person who's immune, And a doctor at that? -These zombies have supposedly de-evolved to the point of ignoring basic instincts, yet they're smart enough to set a trap for Smith? -What I don't get about these zombies movies...if everyone's a zombie, what exactly to they feed on? -Anna shows up out of nowhere with one gun, no supplies, and with a kid??? BTW, how did she get to the island if it was quarantined? Her magic ferry? -Why did Smith not only have to blow himself up, but do it without giving Anna a single piece of research? Sure she gets the vial, but what good is it without his research? -Smith knows every detail about the disease and who it killed. Yet, this mysterious safe haven exists in the Vermont forest and he knows nothing about it? Anyways, you get the idea. Though Smith has an effective performance, the directing mistakes, plot holes and cheesy effects just don't do it justice. Skip it.",3,3,3,21 March 2008
The Game," one dark flick
","This is a dark movie with a sick and twisted plot--but stick with it to the very end and you will not be disappointed. The storyline is brilliant and the ending will blow you away. I was completely stunned. Even though it makes you think the writers have a sick sense of humor, this is one of the more original movies I've seen in a while. Definitely a must-see.",Null,1,2,11 August 1998
Gran Torino," powerful and compelling
","In recent months of boring and useless movies, 'Gran Torino' was a welcome change of pace. Clint Eastwood was amazing as always-- he should've won an Oscar for this role. Eastwood plays a man who recently lost his wife and struggles to find his own way alone and dealing with his 'immigrant' neighbors. His own well-meaning and loving, but ultimately selfish family try to help him through his loss, but end up being more obnoxious than useful (come on, a big button phone as a birthday present?) He then befriends his young next door neighbor as Eastwood becomes the unwilling hero of the neighborhood for standing up to a group of gang members. His stoic, old-school and unwaivering beliefs make Eastwood's character come off as cold and uncaring, but he ends up showing Toad (as he called him) more guidance and love than he did his own sons. Though Eastwood's comments about 'non-whites' are racist, they are incredibly funny and well-timed. Only someone that old could get away with comments like that. He reminded me much of my own grandfather whose racist statements left my jaw dropped at times. As Eastwood takes Toad under his wing, he teaches the young man about hard work, how to 'converse like a man' and even how to hit on women. He also befriends Toad's sister as she has a tongue as quick and obnoxious as Eastwood's. I won't give away the main events or the ending, but it is powerful and bittersweet. This was a very impressive movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.",9,1,10,18 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," you guys just need to calm down
","It's been hysterical to read such negative reviews the past few days. I am truly stunned when people write 'it's a chick flick' or 'it was made for Tweens'. One word--- duh! It would be the same if I watched 'Saw' then wrote a negative review because it was a horror flick. Please, please, do me a favor. If you have not read the books, DO NOT see this movie. Plain and simple. Let me break it down for you: 1. The books are always better than the movies. We've seen a hundred books become movies and are always shocked when they're not as good. Just as in 'Twilight', 'New Moon' skipped over a lot of things, and honestly a lot of important things that the book described. The sorrow and depression that Bella feels just isn't the same on screen. There was a lot about Jacob left out and their trip home from Italy was completely overlooked. The cliff jumping scene was particularly disappointing. Stephanie Meyer does such a great job of describing Bella's jump, Edward's reaction and her drowning, but the movie just couldn't do it justice. 2. This movie's target audience is girls ages 10-18. again, duh. If you're a guy, you are going to hate it. There's no sex scenes, no naked women, no explosions or bloody gore. Guys, just go with your girlfriend, see it and stop whining already. 3. This wasn't designed to be Oscar-worthy. It's a chick flick. With those simple thoughts in mind, please stop taking this movie so seriously. It's just entertainment and let me just give you a head's up, 'Eclipse' will be a romance movie. again, duh.",8,14,29,21 November 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Cute if you're ten
","Though I've never been a real big Fantastic Four fan, I thought I'd give this one a try. If I was ten, I would think this was the coolest thing ever: effects galore, thin plot and shallow characters, and of course, tna from Jessica. There's lots of unanswered questions of course, like where did the Silver Surfer come from? What was the deal with Dr. Doom, did he just splash in the river and the writers forgot about him? What was this 'evil'? I almost lost my lunch when I heard such original lines like 'I'd rather spend my last hours just holding Alicia.'.....acckkk! Someone wipe all this sap off my shoes. There's no chemistry between Reed and Sue and her pasty fake blonde hair got really annoying. And am I the only one that could have predicted Johnny's romance from a mile away? All in all, it was a typical sequel with lots of glitz and no substance. I really, really hope there's not a 3rd one.",3,1,3,8 October 2007
Transformers," freakin' awesome!
","I finally saw this movie after much anticipation. As a generation X'er, I remember watching the original and I couldn't wait to see this. I left the theater amazed and excited. I've been reading some of the bad reviews and I just can't understand why. Sure, it's very much a Michael Bay movie. If you don't like Michael Bay, you won't like this (duh!). But, the special effects are astounding, the action is constant, and the humor cracks me up. I am so glad Peter Cullen stayed as the voice of Optimus Prime. Hugo Weaving also did a great job of Megatron. His character was just too cool and the voice was convincing without thinking 'hey, it's the guy from 'The Matrix''. The humor was well placed without being hokey or forced. The effects blew me away--I keep asking myself 'how did they do that?' Sure it's got it's faults, but overall, it's an excellent summer flick. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.",9,0,1,15 August 2007
Saw II," The first was better
","I rented this movie the other night expecting much of the same from the 1st movie. And I was right. There were still the same death traps, the same kind of characters and the same plot twist. What I didn't expect was that I'd like the first one more. Most of the people who I talked to either liked 'Saw' so-so or not at all. But watching this one made the first one better. Though Cary Elwes's acting is dreadful in 'Saw', it had the ending that made your jaw drop. In this one, the acting was only slightly better, but the twist didn't quite have that same effect. I think it's the 'been there, done that' phenomenon. Hear me out on this one. Remember seeing the first 'Final Destination'? I loved the whole 'death's design' thing. And it scared the bejeezus out of me. The second one was pretty much the same, but it wasn't nearly as scary. I'm figuring the 3rd is really repetitive. It was the same with this movie. Once you saw the unique and frightening death traps of 'Saw', the ones in 'Saw II' just weren't as scary. Sure they were gory, but it didn't have the same fear factor. It was just watching the same movie over again. The twist was different, but was more 'oh, how interesting' rather than 'Oh man!!'. It's worth the 2 hours, but doesn't have the sequel worthiness of other horrors.",7,0,0,14 February 2006
Mission: Impossible II," Very John Woo
","MI2 was very John Woo-- lots of explosions, gunfire, wrap around slo-mo camera shots, and amazing feats of human strength. If you've never seen John Woo's work before, rent 'Broken Arrow' or 'Face Off'. Then you'll get the idea.Tom Cruise does a good job of avoiding bullets shot in the open, flipping in mid-air, walking through fire and looking cool in every shot. Dougray Scott does a surprisingly good job as the villain. The score is quite good and some of the explosions are rather nifty. However, the whole motorcycle scene when the two fly into each other at top speed, grab on and fall 30 feet, only to stand up and keep fighting was just too much for me.
All in all, a great mindless flick. If you want some fun with lots of eye candy, go see this.",Null,0,0,30 May 2000
Men in Black," What was all the hype for?
","I honestly don't know what all the hype was for. This was a terrible movie. There was absolutely no plot; even 'Twister' had a deeper story line. It is truly sad when we rely solely on special effects to entertain us. Yes it had some funny parts and some of the aliens were pretty cool, but 49 cents is all I'd pay to see this one. And of course, they're making a sequel. I can't even imagine what that'll be like.",3,8,20,13 August 1998
Pulp Fiction," bad, bad, bad
","Now I may be condemned for hating this movie, but I'm sorry, how much can we possibly glamorize drugs and smoking with no plot and bad directing. I turned it off halfway through it was so pointless. It's too bad these fine actors were thrown in this MTV-GenerationX-drugs-are-cool scenario. If you want to see a great modern flick, rent 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Reservoir Dogs'.",Null,2,4,20 August 1998
Titanic," a truly amazing movie
","It's sad to hear people whine about this movie saying that if it doesn't have good effects, it's a bad movie. Then they say it has weak acting and a predictible storyline. First of all: predictible story? Hello....people ?....did we all suddenly forget this was a real event? I actually had people get mad at me when I told them the ship sank. Then there's criticism of the bad effects. I personally have never been more convinced in seeing the ship break apart. You really feel like you are on the boat itself. The visual effects are truly stunning. And for those that are so concentrated on effects alone, I'd like to see them do better. This is a wonderful yet tragic love story with sub plots of societal segregation and female opression. Those that think on a higher plane and truly understand love, sacrifice and loss will like this movie. Those that criticize it forget that 1,500 people lost their lives in this tragedy, and I don't think the dead would give a darn about the effects or the acting.",Null,1,1,17 August 1998
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," amazing!!!!!!!
","I saw this yesterday (finally!) This is one heck of a sequel. I was absolutely amazed. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The good: the effects (zowie!), better jokes and Sam's mom was hysterical. The 'twins' also added some great humor. The bad: filming crews tend to forget that when they film with their backs to the sun, they can still be seen. In several scenes, you could see the film crew shadows. Also, in the opening scene, the action was so fast it was hard to tell who was who and it ended too quickly. The ending also screeched to a halt. It could have used a little more cool-down time. The ugly: I also took my two kids (8 and 6). There was, unfortunately, more language in this one and a lot more sexual jokes-- good thing the kids are too young to understand them. There was one scene that I had to cover their eyes because it was a little gross for them. But overall, they loved it.Then I started talking to some people and some are calling it racist. Personally, I have no idea where they're getting that from. But you'll always find people who complain no matter what. These are probably the same people that said 'The Lion King' was racist too. This is a perfect summer flick: amazing effects, well-timed humor and characters you could feel for. All in all, I loved it and I'll definitely see it again.",9,2,6,27 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Disturbing, but good
","When I was watching this movie, I had two feelings: panic and fear. The panic came from being a mom. I felt this once Cruise and his family crashed the minivan and were mobbed by the crowd. Once they got in and Dakota couldn't get out, that's when I felt panic. I couldn't imagine my daughter being stuck in a situation like that and me not being able to help her. I also felt panic at how the people responded in the movie. It showed what real savages humans can be in desperate situations. The men shooting each other to steal the minivan were insane, where exactly were they going? Put people in a group with strangers who are scared and hungry and pandemonium breaks out. I also felt fear. It was really scary to watch the tripods break out of the ground and start vaporizing people. What was even scarier was a thought on a slightly higher scale. We humans (especially Americans) think we are invincible. Yet even with all our weapons, technology and supposed 'superiority', these aliens were systematically eliminating the human race as easily as we step on ants. I really hope that if there are other species in this universe, they skip our pathetic planet. We are, to quote Star Trek TNG, 'a savage child race.' We can't even get along with each other, much less a different species. But, I digress. This was a movie with great special effects. Though I never saw the original, I thought I was very powerful and Dakota Fanning is amazing. She is as talented as she is cute. She deserves the most credit in the movie.",7,2,4,5 January 2006
Con Air," A Wild Ride
","This movie is about as 'manly' as they come, but it's still a great flick. This is for those who just want to enjoy a great action flick without having to think too much. Steve Buscemi gives a great performance as the psychotic Garland Greene. Lots of nifty explosions, and even though someone didn't know their Las Vegas geography very well, this is still a fun movie.",8,2,3,5 August 1998
Sherlock Holmes," Could have been so much more
","I finally got around to seeing this movie and what I was expecting far exceeded what was delivered. Downey had such potential to portray the brilliant Holmes, but he turned out to be a drunken, festering, mumbling, Johnny-Depp-like weirdo. I swear I couldn't understand half the movie. London ended up being a dreary urban slum and the movie focused less on deductions and clues, and more on karate chop action scenes and special effects. Jude Law was the only redeeming quality here. Sadly, I can't recommend this movie. And as usual, the original books are much better. btw, 'The Mummy' used the line 'death is only the beginning' over ten years ago.",3,2,4,9 April 2010
The Blind Side," great movie!
","I honestly don't know why people are dissing this movie. I finally got around to watching it and I was amazed, inspired, touched and hopeful. It's an inspiring story of a wealthy, Christian Memphis family who takes in a neglected teenager named Michael who has fallen through the cracks. He is shown unconditional love, support and faith and learns to be a part of a family and a community. This is a great family movie that I am proud to show my kids. It shows the unfortunate reality of racism, rednecks and assumptions. But it also shows the importance of acceptance (especially of those democrats...har har), family and dedication. People need to chill out and just enjoy this movie. So it doesn't have blood, boobs, car chases, explosions, or CGI. But this is a touching movie that I wish were the rule than the exception.",9,0,2,8 April 2010
Carrie," Still scary, 25 years later
","I've seen this movie now about 4 times and I'm still scared each time. Though I laugh and remember the nasty fashions of the 70s, the 'fear factor' is just as effective today as it was 25 years ago. I too, was dismayed at some of the other comments saying it didn't have enough gore. That isn't what necessarily makes a great movie. My feeling is that those who were born after this movie was released shouldn't be commenting on it--I think they just don't get it. The splatter movies of today often cannot compare to some of the classic horrors made 25 years ago such as 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Omen' and 'The Exorcist'. To this day, though, I still cannot watch the very last scene. The first time I flew out of my chair and now I have to turn away each time. This is a well-made classic horror flick.",Null,0,0,29 August 2001
Any Given Sunday," A great Oliver Stone flick
","This was a great movie....though it was a bit on the long side. About an hour could've been shaved off, but it was well filmed and perfectly casted. My body hurt just watching these players slam into each other. Al Pacino made the perfect coach and James Woods was cast as the jerk (as usual), but well suited. The only 'mistake' in the movie is that there is no way, even in a fictional football league, that Albuquerque, New Mexico would ever get a professional team. I'm from there and that just isn't possible.",Null,0,1,27 December 1999
Iron Man," Excellent movie!
","When I think of action heroes, I have to admit that Robert Downey Jr. would not be on my list. I thought he was still in jail/rehab for DWI's or something. But when an actor does a surprisingly good job, it makes the movie that much better. Much like Damon did for 'Bourne' and McGuire did for 'Spiderman', Downey delivers an excellent performance. The effects are well done without being overwhelming, there's a nice anti-war message without being hokey and though the potential romance is a little predictable, it's a great flick. It's not too violent for the kids and 7 and 4 year old loved it. Is this the turn-around Downey? I sure hope so. He's come a long way since 'Less Than Zero'. Way to go Downey!",9,1,3,4 May 2008
Speed," A great action movie
","This is a great movie that had all of us in the audience clinging to our chairs. Lots of action, suspense, and some great explosions. Even if you see it multiple times, the suspense is still there. My favorite lines: 'Jeez, Bob...What button did you push?' and 'Oh, darn...' And even though I've never seen these 'access panels' on a bus, it's still a must see.",8,1,2,13 August 1998
Final Destination," A great flick that messes with your head
","I'm usually not a big fan of recent 'teen movies', but this was quite good. On a deeper level, it makes you think about your beliefs in fate and if you can cheat death, is there really such a thing as fate? On a lighter level, it's a creepy flick with some real surprise scenes. The whole bus scene scared the hell out of me. Also, Tony Todd did a good job of playing Death. Only he could play a part so spooky. It is definitely worth seeing.",Null,0,0,24 March 2000
Thirteen Days," Finally a win for Costner
","It's really sad when I expect a certain actor's performance to be bad based on previous movies. Poor Kevin Costner just hasn't had many winners lately with lame movies like 'The Postman', 'A Perfect World', 'Waterworld' and 'Wyatt Earp.' But finally, Kevin has redeemed himself. And, he finally manages to nail down an accent (unlike 'Robin Hood'). Though these events were ten years before my time, it was a fascinating tale of a very nerve-racking fortnight. My parents told me stories of the empty supermarket aisles, hiding under school desks and the bomb shelters, but I never really understood the paranoia until I saw this movie. Now it makes sense. Well filmed and well acted--way to go, Kevin.",Null,0,0,27 August 2001
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," half good, half bad
","I read the book about six years before the movie came out. It is to this day the best book I have ever read. The movie adaptation wasn't bad. Brad Pitt was to die for (no pun intended) and made a fabulous Louis, and Antonio Banderas did a great job. But I'm sorry, Tom Cruise was a pathetic Lestat. His American-boy hot-rod attitude just didn't fit the role and the end with the Christian Slater thing just didn't click. The book was more descriptive and provided a better view of the vampire transformation.  My advice, read the book, see the movie, then make your judgement.",8,10,22,13 August 1998
Contact," a great movie
",This movie is a shining example of how fanaticism and extremism are equal to xenophobia. This movie point-blank asks the question 'Is there a God?'. It shows how the possibility of extra-terrestrial life can turn human beings into hethens. This movie challenges your beliefs and to think for one minute that there may be something greater in this world. It tells us to look to the starts and ask 'Are we alone?' and shows us how amongst our pursuit of wealth and power how very small humanity really is in the universe. This was a fascinating movie with great performances by Jodie Foster and James Wood. It presents both sides of the religious and scientific arguments with enraging statements and questions we cannot possibly answer. A great movie.,9,0,2,13 August 1998
V for Vendetta," Brilliant!!
","I've always been a fan of plot lines where an enigmatic masked man befriends a beautiful woman. Call it the hopeless romantic in me, but it's one of my favorites. The added bonus with this movie is the political overtones with religious zealot leaders who are determined to rule the world through fear and intimidation. Ever wonder why you always see religion followed by violence? This movie brilliantly shows how in times of desperation, we turn to any leader who's willing to come forth, and then become blind to his corruption. (sound familiar?) This movie also makes the conspiracy theory wheels turn in your mind. Does our government create disasters in order to gain political favor? Were some of our recent tragedies known about, or even worse, planned by our own government? V for Vendetta does exactly what it set out to do: get you thinking about political corruption, absolute power and religious abuse. Aside from the political message, there's also the romantic undertones. Mix some Phantom of the Opera with Beauty and the Beast and a dash of Stockholm Syndrome, then you've got the perfect pairing of Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. The only downside to the movie is the sound. Because V is always wearing a mask, it's very hard to hear what he is saying. Have the volume at the ready. Otherwise, I loved this movie!",9,2,6,23 September 2006
