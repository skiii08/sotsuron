The Benchwarmers," Amazing
",This movie was awesome I have no idea why the reviews are so bad for this movie. Honestley I've seen this movie like 50 times and it never gets old! Rob Dave and Jon had amazing chemistry in this movie. I hope they make a sequel. It was very funny and inspiring at the same time. People just hate on this movie because they hate the actors. The acting was good the jokes were hilarious and it was original. I grew up with this movie and in the future I will keep watching it. (not all the time obviously) Rob Scheider is a great actor and people don't give him enough credit for what he does. Same with David Spade hes hilarious and deserves more than he gets. The funny thing is that Adam Sandler made this movie and most people do not know that.,10,1,1,22 October 2015
