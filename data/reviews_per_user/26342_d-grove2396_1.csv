The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Poor movie for such an excellent book
","I read this book cover to cover without putting it down (not very impressive, its a small book), I loved it and as a result couldn't wait to see the movie that people have said such great things about.The book covers so much more than the movie and its not even a large book, 250 pages at most,surely enough to fit in to a two hour movie. But instead the movie misses out parts of the story that I found important. The characters Patrick and Sam in the book smoke all the time, and then slowly Charlie starts to smoke with them and then weed, not one cigarette is smoked in the movie. Then the movie decides not to include to include any of his relationships he has with any other character other than Sam. A few things that weren't mention or disappointed me:1. There is no mention of Charlie's relationship with his brother and how he taught him to fight and how the whole family admired him for being such a great football player.2. His sister, he see's struck in the face by her boyfriend, no mention of this at all. Also the following repercussions of this which results in her not being able to see the boyfriend, but she did it anyway.3. The rape he saw as a child, that for some reason he didn't think was wrong, which you later find out might have something to do with him being molested as a child.4. Charlie's teacher played by Paul Rudd calling him special and how he thinks he'd make a good writer. 5. Charlie cried in the book nearly ever 2 pages, not once in the movie.The character of Charlie just wasn't the same in the movie. In the book you think, why is he crying so much? What must he have been through in the past? 6. Charlie's relationship with Patrick and how he let Patrick kiss him, showing how his character just does what ever he thinks will make other people happy.7. His sisters abortion. 8. Emma Watson, the British actress and her awful American accent.I could go on, truth be told, the movie was okay I was just disappointed having read the book. My advice do one or the other.",6,3,6,13 February 2013
