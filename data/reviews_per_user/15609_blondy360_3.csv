National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Even better than the first!!
","The first National Treasure film was an entertaining, fun ride that kept you on your toes and laughing - nothing immensely spectacular, but fully enjoyable and something I wouldn't mind seeing repeatedly. Book of Secrets, however, left it far behind. I watched this with my parents and brother, and every one of us went into that theater with very little hope that this would turn out to be anything close to the first. But we were all blown away by the enhanced comedy and the new characters like Ben's mother (Helen Mirren) and Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris). The relationship between Ben's parents was hilarious and realistic despite their unrealistic surroundings. The scene when Ben pretends to be drunk in Buckingham Palace, though, was the absolute BEST!!!! And Riley is there as always with his infamous humor and sarcasm with every move he makes. I give Book of Secrets a 9/10 because the who was going to die at the end was quite predictable - but really, who else was there besides Mitch?",9,0,2,6 January 2008
The Polar Express," An entertaining and very enjoyable movie I'm sure my kids will enjoy one day.
","'The Polar Express' is a great accomplishment for Castle Rock and the Warner Bros. The animation and detail is incredible, the sound is perfect, and all the characters are realistic and believable (excepting, of course, Santa himself). My favorite character was the Hobo on the roof of the train - he was very funny and strange, and Tom Hanks was perfect for his voice. The soundtrack is beautiful and fits the story very well.As for the plot - Sure, they added a few characters and events to make it a better movie, but it really adds to the quality. The book is a classic, and this film honors it rather than ravaging it.The only reason I give it 9/10 rather than 10/10, is the know-it-all boy on the train. Everything about him is irritating, especially his voice, which sounds like it came out of South Park (one of the worst TV shows ever made), and doesn't even remotely sound like a child. And the worst part about him: he just won't shut up.Other than that, this movie is absolutely fantastic!! I recommend it to everyone.",9,0,2,4 January 2008
There Will Be Blood," Leaves you absolutely breathless!!!!
","I could go on and on and on forever about how good this movie is. The casting was absolutely perfect, the writing flawless, the cinematography beyond compare, the soundtrack engaging, and it all came together to deliver one of the few films that hook, grab, and pull you until you are watching everything so closely you feel as if you are right there with the characters. You gasp, you cry, you smile, you flinch, you jump, and your heart might even skip a beat or two.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview brilliantly - a frightening, truthful performance that leaves you shivering. Paul Dano is absolutely incredible as Eli Sunday, a young evangelic priest who is corrupted by the wealth of the oil business. His sermons were so intense and so real that I did in fact believe it was actually happening right in front of me for a few minutes. An amazing debut by Dillon Freasier as Plainview's son, H.W. Plainview - this kid is more than a natural; he was born for it.I'm going to stop now before I begin to rant. 'There Will Be Blood' is the best movie of the decade - period.15/10!!!",10,1,4,23 February 2008
