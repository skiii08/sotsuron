Black Swan," The experience of 'Black Swan'
","When you watch a movie like the Black swan writing something about the movie is an impulse, a requirement but most of all a medicine. You have to get rid of the feeling that nefarious, black winds of madness are suffocating you; the graphically presented notion that perfection is something formidable and lethal exactly because it applies to the non-human, to the godlike. That's why trying to embrace it by denying your originality, your fragile and yet uniquely powerful human nature turns you into a dark reflection of your fantasy and ambition. But the reason why the movie is a masterpiece is that, apart from being elevated by glorious performances and ingenious directing, it is based on an imaginatively conceived irony; the subtle, graceful and elegant swan transforms into a battlefield where the black and white facets of human nature fight in a sick way and where there is no place to hide, to protect because nothing is innocuous ; the white side, which is expected to denote purity and innocence, represents repressed feelings, no self-esteem and the mechanization of a person. Consequently, the black side is only a climax where the madness of white is combined with dark impulses and all-consuming fear leading to death, which in a pathetic way resembles salvation and dramatic completion of one's personality. Anyone with a preference for well-made movies regarding serious and challenging topics will benefit from this experience as it definitely deviates from our common perception of psychological thrillers.",8,0,0,26 August 2018
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby... Million Dollar Movie
","When one hears that the theme of a movie revolves around a woman trying to become a boxer he may think 'Hmm, that would be good to watch; it is probably another film about a badass girl overturning gender stereotypes'. Well, nothing actually prepares you for what you are about to experience.
'Million Dollar Baby' is about a woman named Maggie who wants to become a boxer and her relationship with her stone-faced trainer Freddie Dunn. Any other detail concerning the plot is unnecessary and will only prevent the viewer from delving into the world of these two extraordinary characters. And they are really something. Frankie is a living oxymoron, as his formidable, impenetrable form and laconic speech is juxtaposed with a great emotional depth. Maggie is a diamond in the rough who with dignity and passion literally fights her way to the world. I would, however be unjust not to mention Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, the gentle and unsuccessful boxer and current janitor to the gym Freddie owns, who works as a balancing element to the tension caused to the viewer by the explosive nature of the first two.
The setting, furthermore, embellishes in it's own way the cinematic experience. The scruffy gym, the adrenaline-filled rings and the hospital are colored in dull, cold colors, so as to work as a neutral setting for the colourful emotions depicted in the film-canvass; and the emotions presented are raw and violent in an overwhelming and almost intoxicating way. So much, that we are compelled to watch until the very end of the movie with only a few precious intervals of humor and nonchalance to comfort us.
It is true that 'Million Dollar Baby' is not an easy to film to watch. With it's intelligent depiction of pain, cruelty and injustice it is a reminder of the dark, and yet, realistic side of life that is often overlooked, as it's a hard pill to swallow. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a gem of modern filmmaking with mind-blowing performances, you are more than welcome to give it try. It will upset you, but it will be etched in your heart for a very long time.",9,0,1,20 February 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...' Ezekiel 25:17
","A yellow jumpsuit, a lethal Hattori-Hanzo sword and a charismatic blonde taking bloody vengeance? Yeah, you got it; it's the notorious 'Kill Bill', the same movie that, I am certain, got hundreds of na√Øve cinephiles running to the toilet to force the impression of the film out of their stomach. And yet, despite not being everyone's cup of tea, the 'Kill Bill' universe is meticulously constructed in such a unique way, that compels you to give it, the least, a try.
The story goes as such: A woman, and past member of the 'Deadly international viper assassination squad', is pregnant and ready to walk down the aisle. However, such a conspicuous past doesn't ensure much tranquility and that becomes evident by the surprise- arrival of the other members of the squad, to the Bride's wedding, who, with the aid of their machine guns, fill the chapel with rotting bodies and leave the blonde protagonist in a four year coma. The tale presents a dark twist when the physically and psychologically beaten Bride wakes up, only to find out that the fetus is missing. That's when things start to get bad, as the incensed Bride swears to revenge all the traitors responsible for this tragedy, wreaking bloody chaos in her passing. Sounds compelling enough?
No? Then let's talk about the heroine. The Bride, whose name we are constantly refused to, used to be one the most talented and dangerous members of her squad. She is a determined and unstoppable force of nature and her efficiency is combined with undeniable physical beauty; she is a carnivorous flower, perfectly fitting to the violent Tarantino world. And this world is violent and ruthless in every sense of the words; it is crystal clear not only in the characters behavior (are O-Ren Ishii, the icy and calculating killer, and Elle Driver, the one-eyed femme fatale, ringing any bells?), but also in the scenery. Tarantino uses bold colours, innumerable pounds of blood and even a nauseating anime sequence, to underline this exact cruelty and madness lurking deep in the human psyche; the film is a celebration of human instincts, in their most crude and therefore perilous form, embellished with carefully chosen pieces of music and 'subtle' references to the old-fashioned genre of '70s kung-fu movies.
If you are still nodding your head indifferently then don't bother to watch the movie and torment yourself for no good reason. Pick one of the thousand other movies waiting patiently in the shelves of video stores and leave 'Kill Bill' for another time. Maybe someday you will feel challenged enough to watch it.",9,1,2,27 January 2019
