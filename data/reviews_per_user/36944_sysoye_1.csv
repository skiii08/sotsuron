Blade Runner 2049," Absolute masterpiece!
","Just returned from the cinema and under fresh influence wanted to wrote few lines about the movie. With more than 60 watching of the first movie and countless hours of soundtrack studying I was very afraid of this sequel.The movie is absolute more than I expected to see. The atmosphere is identically deep, dark and wide as in the first movie. That was the main thing that i was afraid of being missing in this sequel. Even from the beginning you became aware that the movie is huge and deep. The real BR fans will know what am I talking about. Complete story is good shaped and slowly developed through entire length. It really gets you inside and overtakes your perception to the maximum. In moments I noticed that it got me as some sort of VR experience. Cant remember when for the last time I have watched every single frame of anything in cinema.From the technical aspect this is the most complex and most beautiful movie I have ever seen. As sound engineer I really must point onto most realistic surround i have heard in years. Everything, from vocals till sound effects is polished till the limits of present audio technologies.This movie will for sure reshape the actual SF community. In artistic as well as technical way.Strongly recommended for everyone, it is as far as I know the best sequel ever being made. Classis for new millennium.",10,3,12,5 October 2017
