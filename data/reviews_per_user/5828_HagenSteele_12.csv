Captain Phillips," Entertaining and fair take on an awful situation
","What I enjoyed........1. Acting - The cast did an excellent job all around, and I found it easy to suspend disbelief. Tom Hanks rocked, and the 'bad' guys did a great job of incorporating both, menace, and sympathy into their characters.2. Tone - The film did a good job of depicting an awful situation realistically. Often times a film can be either preachy, or propaganda, but this film showed the audience a view from both sides and allows the audience to be the judge. I appreciated that.All in all I think it's worthy of adding to a home collection.",8,0,2,5 December 2013
Gravity," Excellent visuals, however, atrocious depiction of astronauts sinks this one...
","As an adult audience member, when you see the portrayal of astronauts as idiots horsing around in space, it makes a film almost unwatchable. And that's exactly what this film did.Visually, the film was stunning, and the film crew can be proud. However, visuals alone can't make up for the way they depicted the actions of the characters. Hell, the audience wouldn't have done some of the things the characters did, and they aren't SUPPOSED to be trained astronauts.Worth a watch if you can get past the silliness, but I won't be watching it again.",6,3,4,8 December 2013
This Is the End," Crazy, brilliant, crass and crude, terrifying and hysterical...
","This film is NOT for everyone.It's like ghost busters on steroids, with a bad attitude.This film takes risks that other films refuse to take. It can be raunchy, crude, NOT for the squeamish or sensitive, and absolutely hysterical. This film will challenge your comedic sensibilities, and while the jokes and gags don't always work, they hit far more often than they miss, and they hit HARD.Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride and the entire cast, should pat themselves on the back for a job well done. This movie, and this comedy crew, took a LOT of comedic risks throughout the film, and in most cases, those risks are rewarded with some big laughs.Concerns of self indulgent narcissism on the part of the cast did NOT pan out on the screen. I never got the vibe that the cast was doing anything other than trying to sincerely put on the best comedic performance that they could. Danny McBride deserves an Oscar for his performance. Period. NOBODY can do the crazy things he does, or deliver the crazy lines he does, with such commitment and conviction. He boldly goes where comedians fear to travel, and he somehow manages to make you laugh at things you wouldn't laugh at had it been another comedian. In this film, he makes 'Kenny Powers' seem tame.Craig Robinson, Seth Rogen, and James Franco, all deliver some serious laughs. Jonah Hill nails his part with a sledgehammer.I found that this movie was able to change tones and make transitions from one genre to another the way few movies can. The film FEELS like a comedy, and then it interjects horror aspects way beyond the typical 'comedy/horror' film so as to lose any semblance of 'comedy', and it becomes legitimately 'horrifying'. Then, it transitions back to 'comedy' with something truly gut-bustingly funny. This film is like a roller coaster.This film goes too far. Too often. However, you can't get the kind of payoffs these boys get UNLESS you are willing to step across a few lines. These boys leap across those lines, and the rewards were well worth the risk.If you enjoy having your sensibilities challenged, and laughing hysterically, this film WILL deliver. Just don't be surprised when you find yourself laughing at things you thought you normally wouldn't. Like, say, a giant demon creature with a giant smoldering.....well, just see for yourself.9 of 10 stars.",9,3,8,3 July 2013
World War Z," Formulaic action film akin to 28 days later...
","The majority of zombie films usually end up being pretty awful, and IF this film were ACTUALLY a zombie film, it too, would be awful.However, this is NOT a zombie film.This is an action film. An action film that looks like they spent 200 million dollars to make. That's not a bad thing, for the most part.There's plenty of car chase scenes, explosions, crashes, frantic running, 'Hollywood' gun play, and the usual mix of typical 'Hollywood' action movie eye candy. It's obvious that the action scenes were the main effort of this film project, and some folks won't have a problem with that.For those that prefer a bigger emphasis on story and character, this film doesn't have much to offer. Nor does it offer any of the eerie and macabre tones zombie fans enjoy. As a matter of fact, this film doesn't even HAVE zombies. The creatures in this film are more like....Olympic athletes.....on a bad 'bath salts' trip.Seriously.They run faster than any human, jump further and higher, and could have been substituted by say, rabid dogs, or wolves, or any other fast predatorial beast. If you enjoyed films like 28 days later, than you'll probably enjoy this film.If you are looking for a zombie film, this film won't cut it, however, it holds its own as an action flick.7 of 10 stars as an action film.4 of 10 stars as a zombie film.",7,0,3,12 July 2013
The Prestige," Pretty entertaining and worth a watch.
","This film is a revenge film and deals with two professional magicians that share a tarnished history.I enjoyed watching the story unfold, and while it was predictable at times, I thought the cast made up for some of the weaker plot issues.The only major issue I had was the strange time line used by the film. The film frequently transitions from present time, to the past, and to different locations, and the transitions are not the smoothest. At times, I found that it was a bit challenging to recognize these transitions, and while you will figure it out eventually, this confusion took away from the film as a whole.Definitely worthy of a watch, and while it's not one of the greatest films you'll see, it certainly won't be the worst either.7 of 10 stars for: Good actors, good production values, and a decent story.",7,0,0,12 April 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tinker, Tailor, Soldier.....Meh.....
","Wait and rent this one, or watch it on a cable channel.Dry.Very dry.Yes, even boring, and probably confusing.Unless the viewer is familiar with either the book or the T.V. series, I can see them easily getting lost in the plot of this adaptation. The manner in which the flash back sequences were incorporated in this film are not very effective, and rather than answer questions a viewer may have, they create more questions. Key points were not especially emphasized, and could easily be lost on the viewer. More than once, I found myself wondering what exactly was going on, and I was familiar with the story before hand.Yet another film that wastes the talent of some fine actors, and fails to live up to its potential.",5,2,6,11 January 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Enjoyed this much more than I expected. Jackson wins me over again.
","FIRST.....I've never read any of the Tolkien books. /shrugNever have. SECOND....When it comes to this film, and the three earlier LOTR films, methinks that's a good thing.I had no desire to see the first LOTR films, but after friends popped in a DVD, I was pretty impressed, as they truly are epic films. I felt much the same about this film, and like the LOTR films, I found myself pleasantly surprised.This is a GREAT film. Period. The characters are well acted, the costumes, sets, and props are among THE highest quality of ANY film, the visuals and effects are excellent, and the story is compelling.I found this to be a FUN film to watch. The dwarfs are well played, and while they do have fun with the characters, they come off as serious characters that can appeal to adults as much as they can to younger viewers.While I initially was hesitant to give this one a chance, I'm glad I did, and look forward to further releases.An epic film worthy of an epic tale.9 of 10 stars",9,1,3,27 July 2013
Django Unchained," ANOTHER solid Tarantino film
","This film is NOT for the squeamish.However, you can say that about any Tarantino film.This film incites a roller-coaster of emotions from disgust and terror up to absolute joy and satisfaction. The subject matter is dark, and the execution is dark.AND graphic.And I would expect NOTHING less from Quentin Tarantino.The actors are AWESOME.From the lead characters, all the way down to the smallest supporting roles, Tarantino knows how to choose actors, and knows how to get great performances out of them for his films.The visuals are AWESOME.The look of this film takes me back to the films from the 60's and 70's. Very stylish, and uniquely Tarantino.While Tarantino films may not be for everyone, due to his graphic portrayals of human nature, those who appreciate his work should find this as worthy as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, or Inglorious Bastards.Well played Mr. T.Well played indeed.9 of 10 stars",9,2,7,19 June 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun movie and WAY better than I thought it would be...
","This film is a lot of fun to watch.The effects are great, the costumes and props are great, and the actors do an excellent job with their characters. Top it all off with a kick ass sound track, and it is by far among THE best films made in the genre, and among the best put out this year.Far too often these days, films are released that are just not enjoyable due to the formulaic approach used by Hollywood. Well, there IS some 'formula' involved in the film, and they try to exploit the whole 'grrll power!!' scene where females are fighting....which just looks ridiculous, but the film more than makes up for any minor flaws by simply being more fun to watch than to pick at. Highly recommend giving this one a watch.9 of 10 stars.",9,3,7,11 November 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Doctorate level concept + 6th grade level execution = FAIL
","Abandon hope, all ye that fear SPOILERS! SPOILERS BELOW!!! YE HAVE BEEN WARNED! AAaarrggg.....Bottom line up front: I found this movie to be EXTREMELY stupid and, frankly, insulting to the intelligence of ANY audience above the age of say....12.Right off the bat, the film insults the audience by asking us to believe that:1) Super high speed CIA operatives handle the conduct of covert prisoner exchange and transportation the same way they would a flubbed fast food order in a drive through.'Dude....I didn't order onion rings, did you? No? Oh well, we're good, let's roll.'2) Criminal 'masterminds' are stupid enough to try capturing AN AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT using another AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT by lowering hijackers on ropes/cable from AN AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT.Seriously? Come on man! That was a RIDICULOUS premise, and the effect LOOKED as stupid as the idea! Writer: 'O.K., and then they'll lower themselves down to the plane WHILE IT'S IN FLIGHT...yea! That's it! That's believable!' No. It's not. It's a stupid idea, and it LOOKED stupid in the film.ALL THAT STUPID before the movie even gets started....But the stupid never stops. It just keeps going, and gets WORSE.<ul><li>The Batman gets into a fight and sustains a debilitating back injury that can only be corrected through....prisoner medicine, ropes, push ups and sit ups!!!????? - An ENTIRE POLICE FORCE is stupid enough to be trapped in a sewer system. ALL of them.... WTF? - An ENTIRE POLICE FORCE is stupid enough to use civil war tactics, ie charge as a mob, against an entrenched force using automatic weapons.</li></ul><ul><li>A federal government is willing to just write off a large metropolitan city.</li></ul><ul><li>People can't manage to get into, or out of, a city undetected. Right.</li></ul>There's just too much stupid to list in this film.We are ALL willing to suspend our disbelief in a film, and that's one of the reasons we go to films. However, the film maker has to put some effort into it to make it look plausible, otherwise, it just looks stupid, and becomes irritating rather than enjoyable. This film seems to have taken a bunch of shortcuts that turned what could have been a good movie, into an irritating farce.If a 6th grader was told to write a superhero script, I would imagine it would be very similar to this movie.4 of 10 stars.",4,4,9,26 August 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Not perfect, but close. THIS is what movies are SUPPOSED to be like....
","This is a well executed film about young love and innocence, with just enough humor to keep it balanced.These stories have been done SO often, and poorly IMO, that my expectations were not very high. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this film, despite my initial skepticism.First, the cast...This is what lead me to see the film, as the cast is filled with veteran actors who, IMO, have played some of THE best characters on film in the past 40 years. The talent is diverse, and DEEP, in this film, and it showed. Our veteran actors don't disappoint, and their performances reminded me of WHY I enjoy their work so much.The younger cast members held their own with the vets, and it was very easy to cheer them on throughout their adventures. Their performance was natural, completely believable, and entertaining to watch.Second, the story....There have been countless films about 'young love', and what youth will do to pursue it, regardless of obstacles. The approach used in this film was unique, well thought out, and executed effectively in a very entertaining manner. I am not opposed to seeing the ugly nature of man and society portrayed on the screen, however, it's nice to see a well done film about some of the more innocent aspects of our behavior and society. This film delivers, and was like a breath of fresh air instead of the stagnant sex and violence filled poison that Hollywood usually produces. This film reminded me of some of the silly things I did at that age for the attention of my lady loves.Bottom line: This film is an excellent opportunity to enjoy some of the finest actors in film perform a story that we are all familiar with, and have more than likely experienced ourselves.Great film.Not perfect, but about as close as you can be...9 of 10 stars.",9,2,5,24 September 2012
Cloud Atlas," Solid performances, and visuals, pull this one through...
","I enjoyed watching this film, despite the fact that the premise was lost on me due to not picking up on the clues given by the film makers. I found myself caught up in the performances of the actors, and in examining the worlds created for them, rather than focusing in on the clues given that would tie the whole thing together. In a sense, I was lost until the end of the film./shrugUSUALLY, I have ZERO tolerance for films that seem to lack a cohesive story. This film is different.I found myself thoroughly enjoying the cast as they played a multitude of different parts. From the veteran actors to the new recruits, the cast should all be proud of the work they did for this film.The film did an excellent job of providing the environment for each character. From a futuristic 'utopia', to a Victorian era sailing ship, I enjoyed seeing the contrast and attention to detail put into the scenery.The only gripe I had with this film is the story editing. I understand the intent of the film makers, however, I DID find the story hard to track. There is a fine line in story telling between being cleverly subtle, and seemingly vague. The approach the film makers took seemed to be more on the vague side, which didn't work as well for me.Maybe you'll figure it out easier than I did.Regardless, I enjoyed this film and definitely believe it's worth adding to any collection.7 of 10 stars.",7,0,1,1 July 2013
