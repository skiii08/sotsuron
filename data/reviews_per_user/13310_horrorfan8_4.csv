Angels & Demons," An OK movie...MIGHT be better if you read the book
","I saw this movie at a midnight screening at a local theater late Thursday Night. I never read the book 'Angels & Demons' or 'The Da Vinci Code'. I have to say, this movie was okay at best, but it might have been better if I read the books. The movie keeps your attention a little in the beginning, and in the middle. But in the end, it just drags on and on. You think that at one point it will end, but it doesn't. It just keeps going and going and going until it FINALLY stops. Maybe I was tired waiting for it to be over to go home? I don't know. But, the ending did kind of drag a bit. Sort of a let-down. However, I do give this movie a high rating, because it still is a good film and it makes you want to know what will happen. Will the Vatican be saved? Or will it be destroyed by light? Go see 'Angels & Demons' if you want to find out! Tom Hanks plays a very good professor character that knows what's happening at every moment. Good acting, okay writing, okay movie.7/10.",7,4,9,15 May 2009
Orphan," 'Orphan' is filled with adopted terror!
","Alright, the Summary title was a joke, if you have a problem with it, too bad. I went to see 'Orphan' on the Saturday after it came out. The crowd was actually big, and they seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. Esther, played by Isabelle Fuhram did an amazing job playing Esther. She was dark, sinister, and evil! What more could you ask for in a child terror/horror movie? Vera Farmiga playing the mother, Kate, she was very convincing and her acting was on-spot excellent! She was so sympathetic, and me, along with the whole theater, when she slaps Esther, everyone clapped and/or cheered! The little girl Max, (don't know her name at the moment, sorry) was a very convincing actress and this was her first film! She was great! Every time she would even shake her head or give a reaction, everyone would 'Awwww' because she was so adorable. Now, the twist was something I already knew before seeing this movie, which was a bummer, unfortunately. However, it did not ruin the movie at all for me because it kept me interested and kept me in suspense. Now, a few words about the people who are boycotting this movie: I understand that the movie sort of gives of a feeling that orphan's are evil little children, but this is a MOVIE! Stop whining. If you don't like it, it's not like you have to see it. This movie is still in theaters and will stay there! They are not going to stop production of this movie just because some people disagree with the concept. It's entertainment. Get over yourselves and complain about your own lives.I give Orphan an 8.5/10 Awesome film.One of the best of 2009.",8,2,4,27 July 2009
Paranormal Activity," Too much hype, Too much of a let down
","Let me say, I was expecting that 'Parnormal Activity' was going to be an awesome horror movie that really made you scared and really reminded you what fear feels like. This wasn't the case. Before this movie hit the theaters in my area, I was dying to see it because of all the hype it was getting. When it came to my theaters, I went out to see it with a few friends. Let me say, it really wasn't that good. I don't understand what people saw in this movie. What was so scary about it? What was so interesting about it? The scenes dragged many times, and most of the time, nothing really 'scary' happens. Can someone say 'OVERRATED'? I think this could win the award for most overrated movie of 2009. I hope the sequel isn't a let-down.Don't waste your time seeing this.6/10",6,5,9,21 November 2009
Drag Me to Hell," One of the BEST horror/comedy films I've ever seen in theaters!
","Okay, as I am writing this, I saw this movie over a month ago in theaters but never got to writing a review. This movie I saw in a COMPLETELY empty theater, no one in there but me. The movie from start to finish was thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat. However, it did have me jumping out of my seat and screaming a few times! Christine Brown is a wonderful and well-acted out character played by Allsion Lohman. Allison portrayed Christine as a character that was smart, witty, funny, and courageous. I really got into her character. Justin Long plays Clay, Christine's boyfriend. His acting was very good and he is the 'I can't believe it until I see it' type of person. Lorna Raver plays the scary Mrs. Ganush. Lorna Raver's character was well-acted and VERY frightening! This movie had so much suspense, great acting, awesome writing, a GREAT plot, and awesome jump scenes! The jump scenes were a little much, but they weren't weak like in 'The Haunting in Connecticut' these made me jump and scream! If I didn't see this so late in the theaters I would have seen it again, but they took it out the day after. I will so be buying the DVD.",9,1,2,27 July 2009
