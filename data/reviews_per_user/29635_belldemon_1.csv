Miracle," Well Worth It
","My wife took me to see a sneak preview for my birthday (Saturday January 31st).  I'm a huge hockey fan/player and have been for years.  When all this took place, I was only 3 years old.  Therefore I have no memory of the actual game.  The movie does an outstanding job of introducing the global climate in the lead up to the game.  The culmination of the cold war policy, and the rest of the historical events that were taking place at the time of the contest.  I also feel that the director(s)/producer(s) were very true to the match-up.  A much larger, physical, and seasoned Russian team against the smaller, inexperienced USA team. The movie was very balanced in that there is a lot of Herb Brooks' relationships outlined on and off the ice, his struggles to coach the team his way, combined with the excitement and great cinematography of the actual matches and practices. I give it 8 out of 10 for that feel good feeling, and 7 out of 10 overall. I might be biased because it was a birthday present though.",9,0,0,3 February 2004
