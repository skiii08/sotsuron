The Matrix Reloaded," Best Film Of The Year
","'The Matrix Reloaded' is the best film of the year I've seen so far.................. The whole movie was GREAT, I LOVES the part at the Zion (when everybody danced and Neo/Trinity are busy with their own stuff), the fighting senses were AWESOME (cool computer effected). I can't wait to see part 3, and I hope there's going to be part 4 (perhaps they'll make another video game). My advice for you guys is that if you didn't see this movie yet, go see it now, DON'T WAIT......",7,0,0,18 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," 'The Matrix Awesome'
","I bought my tickets 2 months before the movie coming out and I saw it on the first day of released. The whole movie was AWESOME/GREAT, the story was GREAT and of course all of the fighting sequences were the BEST. 'The Matrix Reloaded' is way much better than part 1 and I have to said that 'X2' isn't as good as this movie. This is a must see movie of the summer. ***** out of ***** Rated R for strong sci-fi action/some sexuality (between Neo and Trinity - HOT...)",7,0,0,17 May 2003
