The Benchwarmers," Let's be real...
","Okay. Lets be real. This isn't exactly going to be a Shindlers list. It's an Adam Sandler movie. However, it has an excellent moral behind it. It is a movie for the little guy that didn't get to play ball when that is all they wanted. It is a movie where the underdog is the one you are rooting for. Add this with Adam Sandlers cruel comedy, and you get The Benchwarmers. It's a great movie, with a lot of laughs. The Benchwarmers has some twists in it, and a nerdy zillionair. It is a movie that will have you laughing until the very end, and still leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside at the end. Another A+ movie by Adam Sandler if you ask me!",9,2,9,8 April 2006
