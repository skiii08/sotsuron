Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," US-and-A ------- Light, Unique, and Hilarious
","Before I watched 'Borat: Cultural Learning of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' (I don't know why the title is so damned long), I expected it'll be similar to his previous movie as Ali G. It however turned up to be very enjoyable and exceeding my expectation. I could feel that the audiences were also enjoying the ride and picking up all the jokes easily.When the movie started, I was rather worried as I saw its format. It is using a classic-film format, in which you normally find on the 70's movies. Surprisingly enough, I was wrong again as the format itself became a really good selling-point. Together with the comedy itself, Borat has occupied my mind for few days - trying to figure out how could a person have those ideas.Simply put, this is a unique movie offering a different perspective to the audiences. Story-wise, you shouldn't expect too much as well as the usual aspects from a movie (e.g. sound or graphic effect), but if you'd like a one-and-a-half hour non-stop good laugh, this is the perfect course for you.The story line goes as following: Suggested by the title, Borat is the representative of Kazakhstan with a mission to learn any cultural aspects of America where they are to be implemented in Kazakhstan. The movie therefore covers Borat's journey in learning the American culture while chasing his first-sight love - Pamela Anderson.",9,4,12,4 November 2006
The Girl Next Door," a light movie but qualified
","An interesting movie I should say. It is a story about two teenagers who have different backgrounds, or I should say exactly the opposite. Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch), a 18-years old nerd-achievement-oriented, started to step up to the whole new world when Danielle (Elisha Cuthberg) came as 'the girl next door'.As a teenager movie, obviously, it contains most of the 'ingridients' teenagers need. From the sweet romance date to the porn stars convention in Las Vegas, it has mixed pretty well as a teenager-comedy-romantic movie.Play the role of Danielle, Elisha Cuthberg has become a big plus in judging this movie. I would say she looks fantastic although her role play does not need any spectacular acting skills to perform. Overall, she can bring you to the stage that you feel you would like her. Therefore, I give her credits for that.In my opinion, The Girl Next Door worth to watch and one thing that stays in my mind after watching this movie is 'always know if the juice worth the squeeze'.",8,0,0,8 May 2005
Spider-Man 3," Too much drama, but still love it..
","Well, I watched the movie earlier today - quite late for a fan I would say. It is indeed I saw many critical reviews pondering and saying that Spidey 1 and 2 were much better. Well, to be completely honest, they are true but not completely.Here is the problem with Spidey 3. First, there is too much drama in the movie. This was probably intended to push the audience to empathize with Peter or Spidey. Unfortunately this simply does not work. I even glanced my watch during the movie to see how long the scene would take. Second reason is probably felt by the Spidey fans. Venom was illustrated too small. Eddie Brock should be much bigger, not a boy-band kind of kid. Thirdly, the ending was a bit shallow. Let's just say, it could have been better.Nevertheless, the movie still serves partly of its main purpose - to relieve all the Spidey fans thirsts after 3 years. The battle scenes were great as the effects were smoother made than the previous two releases. The fact it has different antagonists gave more variety in the battle scenes. Further, the jokes were still great and quite fresh.Simply put, this may not be the best Spiderman movie, but I still love it.",7,0,0,6 May 2007
Batman Begins," Tough opponent for Spiderman
","Watching the Marvel has been realising a lot of its superhero characters into movies made DC Comics feels itchy. Realising Batman Begins as the premiere series of Batman is definitely a well-thought move in order to attain all segments of audience.Basically Batman Begins is an epic before Bruce Wayne conduct his part-time job, Batman. It gives you the detail images on how he gained his fighting skills, tools, costumes, and even why he chose bat as his freak-mode style. In my opinion, DC Comics has done well by covering these details because the audience who knows nothing about Batman will be able to enjoy this movie and its sequels, which I supposed DC Comics will make.However, I did not see any spectacular point from its actors or actresses. I would say it is so... average. Anyway when you watch this movie, I am pretty sure that you will not mind it.Batman Begins covers the story of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) from the lowest point of his life until the life which every man will dream of. Starting in the area far away from Gotham City, the city of everything in Batman's world, Bruce is striving to find the truth of life. Until one day Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) appears and offers Bruce an opportunity to get the answer. It leads to Bruce's training and how he gets his power and skills.Dealing with his own past is not an easy task for him. Trying to overcome his traumatic experiences, he is trained by the ninja society. Further, the situation has become worse within the Gotham City. His childhood friend and also his love, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), is dealing with the crime of Carmine Falcone's gang. Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) is a criminal who owns half of the city under his control. It rolls as most of superhero movies which only have one objective, saving the world...I gave eight out of ten, because in general this is a well-made movie. Apparently I should say this is the truly opponent of Spiderman from the Marvel. But who knows that DC Comics will launch more, or Marvel will do?",8,0,0,22 June 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Would this end of the trilogy?
","To be honest, I could barely wait to watch this movie. I was simply amazed when I saw the trailer. There were many unexpected scenes - some of them added more values, but some of them were bit disappointing. Let say in the case of Angel. I expected that he'd be part of the main characters in the movie - at least that was what the trailers and posters showed us, but he barely showed up in the movie. Probably many people who watched the movie already would feel the same as I do. Of course, there were tons of nice unexpected scenes as well.Overall I love the movie. Compared to the first and second sequel, this has more 'mutant fights'. You could really see how powerful the mutants actually are - as it should be, of course. When you watch this movie, you'll actually believe this will end of the trilogy. Not so long until you see the end, you'll start wondering 'hey! is this really the end or what?' I don't know why the director ended the movie that way. Probably to be on the safe side since he also doesn't know whether the fourth sequel should be out or not. Anyway this is a movie that you wouldn't regret watching - especially if you like the first and second parts.The story began with invention of the mutation cure by homo sapiens, and also rise of the phoenix. Facing the war before him, Magneto - who's definitely despise the idea of curing mutation - created his own mutant armies. So, human with the X-men 'protecting' them versus Magneto's armies. Phoenix? The kitty of the whole movie.",8,0,1,25 May 2006
War of the Worlds," Low intelligent movie
","The first impression when I watched the teaser was quite positive I should say. It was attractive enough, unlike the real movie though. There are several stupid scenes where I felt I have been bullied by Stevie. For instance, the scene where the lightning strikes 26 times producing a massive electromagnetic wave which results on the defects of all the electronic devices even on Tom's watch. The most stupid thing is it also shows a man is recording the moment by his video-cam within that period of time.I probably overestimated War of the World regarding his previous works. In my opinion, War of the World would not be on Spielberg's hall of fame. Fortunately, it is held by Cruise and Fanning's acting. I would give them high credits for that. Further, as you might expecting already in Spielberg's movie, it has an awesome special-effect where is taking an important role in this movie.War of the World is started with Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise)'s new task besides his main job, moving containers. The task is to take care of his children, Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel Ferrier (Dakota Fanning), for 2 days where is going to be interesting because his 'nature' as a father. It rolls up to the aggression of aliens in tripod machine towards human race. Unlike Independence Day, this movie stresses more on the survival of humans rather than the mightiness of U.S. army.During the adventure to Boston where his ex-wife is, Robbie surprisingly wants to join the army to fight the aliens (I should say this is so stupid man! so unrealistic...). Moreover, it carries on with many entertaining scenes until it reaches a f*cked up ending.In conclusion, this movie can be entertaining but do not expect too much from it though.",6,3,7,3 July 2005
Fantastic Four," Very entertaining..
","Seems like the superheroes movie becomes the trend for the past five years. There are a lot of movies taken from the comic books, such as the Spiderman, the Batman, etc. However, do not expect the same things from those movies I have mentioned before. Fantastic Four does not emphasize on the same points as Spiderman or Batman. It rather goes with its own side of strengths, which I should say is really entertaining. I enjoyed this movie from the beginning until the end of the movie, although it would be better if Tim (the director) does not rush the ending.Based on its visual and sound effect, I only give this movie an average credits. There are few scenes where you see the degradation of one subject to another, and makes it look unreal. And somehow I noticed that the voices of the actresses or actors are not strong enough, thus sometimes the audience was kind of lost.Fantastic Four is a story of four people who went to the outer space in order to conduct a research, and become mutants after got hit by sort of cosmic storm. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is the Mr. Fantastic (for all of you who read the comic before), who is a genius scientist. After he got dumped by NASA for certain reason, he and his partner, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), went to Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahoon) to get funding on his research. There they meet Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) who is an employee of Victor and also Reed's ex-girlfriend. Things get really hilarious when Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) appeared in this movie. He is the brother of Sue who later on will possess fire as his mutation and call himself the Human Torch. These five people got different mutation caused by the storm. Reed becomes a rubber-man, Sue got her to be invincible, Ben becomes a stone-monster, and Victor becomes a metal-alloy man.Overall, I really enjoy this movie. It is not as heavy or serious as Spiderman or Batman, but it can bring you a nice Saturday night. Enjoy it!",6,0,1,15 July 2005
