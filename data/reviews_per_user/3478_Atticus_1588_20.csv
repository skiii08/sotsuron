Minority Report," Brilliant
","Minority Report is one of the most brilliant films to come out in some time. The story and twists in it, the direction, the acting, the futuristic setting, everything was sheer brilliance. This is one of Spielburg's top-notch best films ever. I am very glad I waited so long to see this movie because it was totally worth it. If you have not seen this movie do not pay attention to all the negative reviews on IMDB it is getting..just kick back, pay attention, and enjoy a brilliant thrill ride. 10.0/10.0 Best film there will be this summer.",10,0,0,23 June 2002
Se7en," Have you sinned lately?
","'Se7en' is one of the best horror, thriller, mystery movies I have seen in forever. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt work perfectly together and David Fincher put that movie together wonderfully. Recently I had not seen the movie but went ahead and bought the fairly expensive DVD. But I tell you it was worth every $25 of it. If theres one movie I could tell someone to go see right now, it would have to be 'Se7en'. A+",9,0,0,4 February 2002
Memento," My #5 favorite movie ever.
","See this movie,  now. Do not waste your time reading my comments if you have not seen it. Go now. This movie is the best, most original thing I have seen in YEARS. I have been waiting for the perfect movie and I have to say this is a perfect movie. 10.0/10.0 The way this film is shot backwards is the best thing about it.",10,0,1,27 April 2002
We Were Soldiers," A truly amazing, moving, powerful war movie.
","I have just got back from seeing 'We Were Soldiers' and I have to say, this is the best movie based on Vietnam. I finally convinced my father to take me because me, being under 18, had to get anyone to. But this movie truly made me think, it made me think like how I thought after I saw 'Platoon'. The effects in this movie were great, the direction was fairly descent but then again, it was very good, kind of both ways. The acting in this movie was suberb, everyone played their roles perfect and very well casted. The war action in this movie I loved, some of the best of the best, probably since 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie is very engrossing as well, it was 2 1/2 Hours very well spent, it only seemed like an hour went by. I truly loved and enjoyed this film. I would strongly reccommend it to any movie goer. 9.5/10.",8,1,2,10 March 2002
Blade II," Bring on Blade III
","I just got back from seeing 'Blade II' and it lived up to my expectations and then..suceeded them. BII is one of the best movies I have seen this year and it ranks up with the first Blade on how good it is. The direction is great, the acting is great, the blood and gore and special effects are suberb! I do suggest you see the first Blade first if you are considering seeing this one. Have fun with it though! 9.0/10.0Make BLADE III PLEASE!",9,0,1,27 April 2002
Malcolm X," Great! Was surprised that Spike Lee did this.
",I just got done watching 'Malcolm X' today and I have to say it was a great film. This is the only film of Spike Lee that I thoroughly enjoyed. The acting in in top form. D. Washington deffinately deserved a oscar nomination for his great performence. The rest of the acting is good too. The directing is pretty good! I thought it was very well shot. The story and the dialouge flows smoothly and flows along perfect. I suggest this film to anyone who has 3 hours to watch this movie and if you do not I hope you make time to watch it. I strongly hope you do. 8/10,Null,2,7,21 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This should have been Episode I.
",Opening night of Attack of the Clones I was at the theatre at 10 o' clock with my dad awed by this briliant movie. THIS should have been Episode I! The plot flows much smoother and I love the battle action scenes. You can feel the dark side coming on with Anakin growing impatient too. I am going back today to see this movie for the second time and I hope to see it another after that! WELL DONE LUCAS! 10.0/10.0,10,0,0,25 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," ALOT less action then you may think.
",This movie shows ALL  of its action sequences in the preview and at the theatre they are just extended and boring. Also the story was too confusing to keep up with if you were just trying to have a good time at the movies. I wish I had never gone to see this movie. If you want to wait until the DVD comes out and save money. 5.0/10.0,5,1,2,23 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Brilliant, my third favorite film ever.
","I have seen 'LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring' twice in theatres. The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why. There is so much I could tell you about this film and how much I love it but I will just point out those things. I cannot wait until 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. It looks just as amazing as the first just from the previews. If you have not seen this, go see it NOW. In a theatre or when it arrives on DVD and VHS. 10.0/10.0 A classic",10,9,10,29 July 2002
Spider-Man," Sam Raimi finally getting the spotlight he DESERVES!
","Sam Raimi, one of my all time favorite directors! FIANLLY getting the spotlight after doing a huge movie, Spider-Man. Spider-Man is a genious piece of art work. Yes art work. Everything about this movie is perfect..direction, script, acting..everything. Sam Raimi is going to finally get what he deserves now, FAME! 10.0/10.0 A+ GO SAM!",10,0,0,25 May 2002
The Usual Suspects," One of my favorite movies of all time.
","Recently when going to a video store I was looking for good deals on older movies. I saw this movie and I had remembered seeing parts of it but my Dad kept telling me to buy it, he said Its great! So I did and I took it home, doubtful, Watched it two days later, and I am HOOKED. I have watched it over 10 times in 5 days. This is my #4 favorite movie.(in front of it are 'The Matrix', 'Gladiator', and 'Lord of the Rings:Fellowship of the Ring'. If you have not seen this go and see it NOW! PLEASE! I also recomend the other movies. A+++",10,1,2,9 April 2002
The Game," Intelligent, greatly surprised!
","I have to say when I rented this movie I did not expect very much out of it. I had seen it sitting there on the dollar movies for quite some time and one day was like what the hay. I took it home and a few days later watched it and loved it. The plot has many twists and turns I did not see coming at all. The acting is fairly okay and th directing is pretty good. This movie has you gripped and then at the end has an ending I did not see at all. Go see this, pretty good! 8/10",9,0,1,21 July 2002
The Evil Dead," Don't you understand, were not leaving!
","Today I finally got the chance to sit down and watch 'The Evil Dead'. Now me being a long time fan of 'Army of Darkness' I expected alot out of this movie. That I did get. Yes, the acting wasn't so great in this movie and the direction was sloppy but comon people! You know it scared you. This movie was very, very, very gruesome. You have to have the stomache to handle it if you plan on watching it. So I say if you are a fan of 'Army of Darkness' or 'Evil Dead 2' I strongly hope you go and see this wonderful horror movie. 7.5/10.0",5,0,3,21 March 2002
Black Hawk Down," Best War Movie Ever Made.
","This is, in my opinion, the best war movie ever made. It shows the battle of Mogadishu from so many different perspectives and how it impacted everybody. No other war movie could do that and I think only Director Ridley Scott could catch this much chaos at once. How this film is shot and the directing are great, the screenplay is amazing, and how realistic the situation is is amazing considering this event only took place a few years ago. Although Saving Private Ryan is the Best WWII movie ever made and considered the best war movie...I think this is the one and only Black Hawk Down there will ever be and it is the best war movie ever made. 10.0/10.0 Go see it now.",10,0,0,19 June 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Masterpiece.
","Something so good, can go oh so awful. 'Reservoir Dogs' is a brilliant telling of a bloody diamond heist involving 4 strangers. Until they find out one of them is a police informer..but who? Quentin Tarantino is a master in control with this movie. No scene is pointless, The direction is great, the dialouge is amazing(sometimes funny, 'How would you feel if you had to do a handstand everytime you p***ed?') The acting in in top form. Although I have never seen 'Pulp Fiction' yet, I will, this is a awesome debut for Mr. Tarantino. If you have not seen this film yet I suggest you go out and buy it or rent it. I bought it without seeing it and I am extremely happy because I would have bought it anyways the first chance I got.
'Easy for you to say, you have a cool sounding name.'",Null,0,1,14 July 2002
Signs," Great, intense thriller.
","I got everything I wanted tonight out of the movie 'Signs'. Intense, edge of my seat, jump scenes, great story and it flowed smoothly, great film. It has a pretty good about of humor too. But most of all so very, very intense. I couldn't sit still cause I just knew I was going to be jumping in a minute! Everything in the end is really cool about how it fits together. I am gonna go back and see this movie again soon. I just hope I don't jump out of my seat again! 9/10",9,0,1,2 August 2002
Speed," One of my favorite action movies ever.
","This is one of the best action movies of all-time, within the ranks of 'Die Hard' and 'The Matrix'. The script to it is very well done and the action sequences keep you on the edge of your seat! The acting is pretty good too. Overall, one of the best action movies. Go see it!",Null,0,0,29 July 2002
Jurassic Park," One of my favorites, endlessly watchable!
","Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies. Everytime I watch it I realize how brilliantly shot this film was! Next time, or the first time, you sit down and watch it look at the camera angles and how Spielburg zooms in on things. Its BRILLIANT. And everything else about this movie is perfect. Hats to you Spielburg! 5/5!",10,1,2,25 May 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Perfection!
","I was truly and wonderfully surprised at 'O' Brother, Where Art Thou?' The video store was out of all the movies I was planning on renting, so then I came across this. I came home and as I watched I became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud. The Coen's have made a magnificiant film again. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you get to know the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you. I strongly would reccomend ANYONE seeing this because if you are not, you are truly missing a film gem for the ages. 10/10",8,2,3,10 March 2002
The Godfather," One of my Top 10 Favorites.
","This movie is one of the most brilliantly crafted piece of film i have ever seen. The story is told so well, so complex, and with so many characters you could get lost but...its so engaging its brilliance. The dirction is in VERY HIGH top notch and so is the acting. The script is great and this is a must see for everyone.",10,0,1,16 July 2002
