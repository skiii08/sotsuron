Casablanca," WHY ???
","Why is everybody crazy about this film?  I just find it a decent romance film (ah, it is very conventional and safe). I laughed out loud when I saw Casablanca listed #2 Greatest films of all time by the American Film Institute ( hey, how about Fight Club, American beauty, Mulholland Drive ? ). The story of Casablanca is simply straightforward, not witty or twisted ( oh, are all Hollywood films stupid so they call this one witty ??? ). The acting is fine, Ingrid Bergman is great but Humphrey Bogart looks damn boring like a sleepwalker ( or did he try to be cool? ). Ah, the only memorable quote to me in this film is 'The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world'. The others are forgettable and they may be classic because people consider this one a classic. 'Play it again, Sam' for instance, what the hell? The line ' You jump I jump remember? ' in the blockbuster Titanic is even much better. The message? Very clear: love, sacrifice, anti-war propaganda. That's all. Not deep or complex at all. The only thing I like about this film is the song 'As time goes by'. It is excellent.Anyway, Casablanca is not too bad, quite enjoyable. I give it 6/10",6,8,19,1 October 2002
Mulholland Drive," A FLAWLESS MASTERPIECE
","Contains SPOILER:'Mulholland Dr' is definitely the greatest film ever made. The dialogue is brilliant, witty, ironic. The cinematography is gorgeous. The music is eerie, creepy, haunting. The cast is perfect, especially Naomi Watts delivers a technically dazzling performance. The plot is complex, original, bizarre yet utterly meaningful. 'Mulholland Dr' left me reeling after the first viewing. It is too clever and intricate that for the first time in my life, my brain really got hurt ( even Memento is a much easier film ). After each viewing, I discover the deeper messages, metaphors and meanings of the film. Superficially, Hollywood is spectacular, adorable but behind it, it is a nasty, ugly and contemptible place. Maybe the world is just an illusion that someday we would try to escape the pain by living in our fantasy like what Diane did.David Lynch is truly ingenious, the best director working today ( I must confess that I'm quite obsessed with him ). Believe me, 'Mulholland Drive' will be regarded a classic over the time. Rating : A+         10/10",10,2,3,2 October 2002
