Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I loved it. It had its problems as all movies do, but I loved it!
","WELLWELLWELL.  I am a huge trilogy fan. I do admit that I was born only two years before the release of Jedi. I consider the older movies as the best ever made. I walked into this movie with a lot of fears. I didn't want to compare Episode 1 to its sequels but how could I not.  I am more than happy to tell you that it does live up to its predecessors.  First and foremost the thing I love most about this movie is that it is Star Wars.  Even with the amazing computer graphics it felt like all the other movies which is very important to me.  I would like to share with you all how I felt about this movie.  First for the down side. What was up with Jar Jar Binks?  I didn't like him at all!!  It seemed to me that Lucas, even with his wisdom, tried to accommodate the child watchers with a Robin Williams genie character.  His jokes weren't funny and he served no real purpose in the movie.  HE SAID EXSQUEEZE ME!!!! On that comic relief subject I cringed every time  Bass Nass did that face slobbering thing. Darth Maul didn't get enough screen time especially with all the hype he is getting.  He had very few lines and wasn't all that important.  Speaking of over commercializing something what was with the huge push on Mace Windu. He also had next to nothing to do with this film. I would have like to see more of Qui -Gon Jinn but what can you do? Enough negativity! On to the good stuff and boy do I think this movie has a lot of it.  The movie was out of this world.   The plot was good, the others stronger, but still good.  The hints to the story to come were amazing.I found it hard, in a good way, to get through this movie with all the knowledge of what was to come.  It enhanced the movie to a level that I have never felt.  The effects were great and there were scenes in this movie that I would be bold and say that they are some of the best scenes in all four movies.  It was great to see the familiar faces and overall find out how thugs began.  R2 and 3P0 were out of sight.  Overall this movie fit in perfect with its'brothers and sisters' which is one of the most important thing to me.  Even with all its changes and computer generated scenes it still fit with the other three.",10,0,1,24 May 1999
The Matrix," HELLO YOU VICTIMS OF THE MATRIX!!!????
","I am sorry to add such sadness to the comments but this movie is much more the running on walls and shoot-out scenes.  This movie is revolutionary not for its ground breaking effects but mostly for its principal. It says to the world that what we are doing and the way we live is WRONG, or at least it could be.  It does say that living as drones and following the system makes you nothing but a battery to those in power. I get upset to read your reviews that only discuss acting, cinematography and how cute Mr. Reeves is. Didn't this movie make you think. This wasn't like Con-Air that was just about blowing things up and causing havoc and then saving the day at the end of the film. This movie was brilliant because the thoughts it provoked, its fluid story, and constant questioning of what we've been taught. I give it a nine and say to those who haven't seen it please do so but look further than the million dollar shots and even more costly actors and look for the meaning within.",9,0,1,10 April 2000
