The King's Speech," Long Live The King's Speech!
","Colin Firth. Need I say more? If I DO, then go see this movie and you'll agree he is one of the finest actors around. But there's no one in this film that isn't wonderful: Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon, and Derek Jacobi (who practically cornered the market on stuttering himself by playing both Claudius and Alan Turing) to name but a few. The actors manage to affectionately recall their real-life counterparts without aping them. On a par with Firth is the brilliant Geoffrey Rush, and Australian playing an Australian. Despite being a 'root for the underdog' scenario, the script nicely manages to skirt clich√© and be warm, witty and restrained - all at the same time. In the past, the Queens of Great Britain have gotten their fair share of screen time (Elizabeth is a mere child here), so it is refreshing and enlightening to see its Kings so wonderfully illuminated.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," And those perks would be...???
","I'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it all before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded for it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve it. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set in a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is never stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it tries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters. Joan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY end of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend most of the time thinking 'I thought Joan Cussack was in this?' But I guess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan Cussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh, and wasn't alive in 1990.",6,34,68,17 October 2012
Memento," Time Warp (Again)
","I'm a great fan of non-linear storytelling.  MEMENTO takes it's place alongside MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG and Pinter's BETRAYAL as a good example of reverse chronology plotting.  As fine as this movie is (especially in it's early scenes), the outcome is somewhat unsatisfying.  Without posting spoilers, suffice it to say that MEMENTO's leading character suffers the same fate as the lovers in BETRAYAL or the leading man in MERRILY - all leave audience with a bad taste and a feeling that we've invested in folks we'd rather not know.  Still, MEMENTO is riveting viewing.  Especially for those of use seeking new avenues in storytelling.",Null,0,2,30 July 2001
Billy Elliot," BILLY Overcomes Adversity (& Cliches Galore)
","BILLY ELLIOT is a terrific movie.  That said... BILLY ELLIOT contains tons of cliches.  Like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2's latex masks, the conventions of a genre must be accepted from the very start.  A 'feel good' picture like BILLY demands that viewers accept a range of emotional string-tuggers: Billy's granny is going senile; Billy's mum is dead; Billy's Dad and Bro are striking miners; the family's never been to the big city, etc. etc.  Yet at every turn the honest and winning performances defy the conventions and will win over all but the most miserable of spirit. Don't resist - BILLY ELLIOT is a winner. Oh, but leave the theatre just before the silly 10 years later fast forward. This brief sequence isn't worthy of the rest of the picture.  You'll do just as well without it.",9,0,0,11 November 2000
Pirate Radio," Rock of Love Boat
","Funny, with some great comic moments by a terrific cast. Oddly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the one cast member that I was disappointed in - he might be anyone, really. Bill Nighy is dead funny, Kenneth Branagh straight out of a Monty Python sketch, and the ex-Mrs. Branagh - Emma Thompson - bedecked in period garb and sunshades to hide the fact she's better suited to the lead character's grandmother than his mum. Still, her razor sharp timing is priceless. The film is pitched at a high comic tone that isn't all that concerned with reality (despite the fact the story is based on real events) and the editing is choppy and the film over-long. Still - the cast looks like they are having a blast and - most of the time - so was I.",7,1,2,5 June 2010
The Mummy," Raiders of the Lost Sandbox
","How film maker Stephen Sommers saw Boris Karloff's classic 1932 MUMMY and came up with this confused mess is beyond my comprehension.  Despite being souped up to the max with ILM's best CG special effects, the only horror in this film is that for $80 million dollars it never comes close to being scary or providing a moment of suspense.  Instead, Sommers seems intent on aping the Indiana Jones adventures, with lackluster leads Brendan Fraser and Rachel Wiesz striving for ENGLISH PATIENT-like sparks that never ignite.  Scottish thespian John Hannah is dragged along for the camel ride, his reluctance to do the film showing at every cryptic turn. Even Bernard Fox, who went down with the Titanic (twice!), doesn't survive this pyramid of bad judgement.  'Calling Dr. Bombay!  Emergency!  Come right away!'Over-long at 125 minutes, this overwrought confusion of action and comedy seems like angry siamese twins - one wanting to be funny and glib - the other intense and moody.  Neither wins and chances are you'll find yourself longing for THE MUMMY'S REVENGE rather than the already planned MUMMY 2 sequel.  Any number of the rag-tag MUMMY films would be a treat compared to this.  The DVD release is crammed with boring extras that (like the film) don't know when to keep mum.'Calling Mr. Karloff!  Emergency!  Come right away!'",5,0,0,16 October 1999
Brokeback Mountain," Gonna Build A MOUNTAIN...
","...from a little hill. From a short story at the back of a collection of Wyoming tales by Annie Proulx comes this incredible film. Short stories seem to serve well as the basis for screenplays, leaving lots of 'space' for visuals. Here, the landscape of Wyoming is the backdrop for one of the most moving and unique romances since Romeo wooed Juliet. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are the central figures. Gyllenhaal is a master of charm - with a glint in his eye and a winning smirk. Ledger broods and mumbles in a performance that is reminiscent of (but never competes with) the memory of a young Marlon Brando. Despite the film's male-centric plotting, the female cast members are just as riveting. Anne Hathaway's final scene is played to perfection and Michelle Williams is the emotional core of the story. Both women are every bit as watchable and talented as their male co-stars. From a modest beginning, director Ang Lee has crafted a memorable and emotional journey. This is a mountain of a film.",8,8,11,9 January 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter & The World's Longest Camping Trip
","You can't really critique these films. They are more than films. They are visual translations of a cultural phenomenon. They just can't be judged on their cinematic merit alone. I haven't read the books and have no desire to. I have, however, seen all the films. In this (half) film I missed some of my favorite profs from previous outings, especially Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon (who is seen but hardly figures). The villains are really the juice of this final chapter, with Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, and Alan Rickman chewing the scenery in grand style. At one point I wanted to dub this film 'Harry Potter and the World's Longest Camping Trip'. Enough with the teen angst already. Although the impromptu dance sequence between Harry and Hermione is perhaps the film's one touch of humanity - giving the duo a rare moment to be kids, and not muggledom and magic's 'last great hope'. Dobby, too, is in rare form, with his CG denouement played out to perfection. But greed got the better of the studio and led them to stretch a single novel into two films. I would have preferred it had they left on a high note and let us experience Harry's last stand in one fell swoop, but the fans won't mind - like the film itself, it just prolongs the inevitable ending of a cultural icon.",6,1,5,23 November 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," Don't Miss 'Sunshine'
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is a surprising and thoughtful take on the dysfunctional family picture - with elements of a road comedy and a pageant spoof thrown in. While the script is never quite as tight or witty as you want it to be, there are a few unexpected surprises in store. To weather the few dry spots there's a terrific cast. They never fail to bring empathy and humanity to the desperate characters. The direction and design are considered, but never overtly so (watch for the skillful use of sunshine yellows). This film put me in mind of Beth Henley's 'Miss Firecracker' (a Holly Hunter vehicle) in which a group of sad and lonely Southerners find an emotional connection by helping a misfit girl through a small-time beauty contest. Both 'Misses' are testament to the human spirit and the strength of individuality.",8,1,5,25 August 2006
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim vs My Patience
",I loved the first 1/3 of this film. Meeting Scott and his off-beat pals thru a skewered lens set to comic book crazy. This unique visual take on the rom com is courtesy of game boy but didn't lose its sense of fun and reality: These characters are not so far off as to be unreal. Cera and company are (at core) really likable and I would have liked the whole film to stay firmly rooted in Scott's romantic ambitions. And there's enough inside humor to keep the non-game playing public amused as well. But the film's lengthy plot about conquering seven evil exes just got tiresome and frenetic. I could have done with several fewer exes and more about the core cast. Maybe a 'Scott Pilgrim' TV series would solve that problem? Maybe.,7,1,6,11 December 2010
The Illusionist," Now You See Me, Now You Don't
","Let's get this straight, I NEVER leave a movie before the end. That is, until now. There is something oppressively dull about THE ILLUSIONIST, despite the inviting trappings of a period mystery set around magic featuring some very fine performers. What more could one ask of an end-of-summer flick, right? Well, how about some sense of pacing and style. This film is so desperately quiet, I had trouble staying awake in a mid-day matin√©e! It is more than an hour in before someone raises their voice above a hushed stage whisper. The pauses would put Harold Pinter to shame. You could literally drive a 'horse drawn carriage' through them. Giamatti and Norton are fine performers, but whatever nuance they bring to the film is lost amid detailed shots of 19th century streets and buildings. I felt like I was being smothered by down pillows and fled the cinema after nearly 90 minutes, gulping fresh air by the mouthfuls. What happens at the end? I couldn't care less. Where is Doug Henning when you need him?",4,6,20,1 September 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Over-Rated & Disappointing
","Welcome to one of the most disappointing and over-rated films of the year: GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK. A look at Edward R. Murrow and Senator McCarthy should have been riveting and inspiring. Instead this flat feature is dull and uneventful. Director Clooney employs gimmicks galore to seduce his audience, but he can't overcome a lackluster script and his own neophyte direction enough to do more than scratch the surface of a fascinating time and place. Clever cuss Cooney's monochromatic lensing is the film's first big mistake. No one under 45 associates black and white with anything but oft-repeated sitcoms like I LOVE LUCY and Hollywood films: both fiction. The gimmick only served to distance the viewer from the subject, not lend veracity. While the first rate cast is in fine form, they have all been better elsewhere (including the much-praised Straithern as Morrow). Using Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. as a metaphor for CBS's own private witch hunt (no employees may be married) relegates them to symbolic status, robbing them of any reality. As they lie in bed staring into space, I felt their boredom with their limited characters. Clooney telegraphs every plot point and uses heavy handed symbolism at every turn. From Ray Wise's first screen shot, I knew (without knowledge of the real-life Hollenbeck's fate) that a Willy Loman-esquire gas pipe was in his future. A shot of Frank Langella's Bill Paley alone in a studio tells us nothing without a single glimpse of the actor's face. It's lonely at the top? Tell us something we didn't know. A Morrow interview with Liberace oddly avoids a single raised eyebrow when Lee is questioned about his marriage plans. A second interview with a Gabor is so short we're not even sure which Hungarian sister he's interviewing. A little humor here was much needed, but Clooney misses again. Kinescopes of McCarthy's hearings go on far too long, making us long for a proper documentary on the subject instead of this pseudo-effort. The script also inexplicably avoids any mention of CBS's biggest star of the 1950's, Lucille Ball. Ball herself was accused of being a communist in 1953, putting CBS's cash cow 'I Love Lucy' in serious jeopardy. Clooney's Paley never even mentions the redhead or her red scare experience. Instead, he mystifies most viewers with mentions of Uncle Miltie in a dress (Berle was important to the decade, but has not withstood the test of time like Ms. Ball's sitcom.) He also invokes the name of 'The $64,000 Question' which only brings to mind a far superior film of similar topic and time period: QUIZ SHOW. For further comparison on what to do when making a bio pic of the era, see CAPOTE. Where GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK fails (even when it dazzles) CAPOTE succeeds - in living color.",6,2,6,8 February 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Dark & Semi-Sweet (but Never Gooey)
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp indulge their inner child once more with this bag of mixed nuts. While some moments work brilliantly (Burton's fantastic visual sense is perfectly suited to the material) other moments are are a bit of a let-down. It's not really possible to discuss this film without mentioning the Roald Dahl book and the first film, so I won't even try. Depp mystified me with his freakish Jack Sparrow in THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN - camp for camp's sake. Here camp is in full session again but Burton has the smarts to temper Depp's tart eccentricity with flashbacks to Wonka's troubled youth. While these don't really add much story-wise, they do help us understand Depp's choices. In the end, however, it isn't nearly enough to make Wonka a real character, especially when played against the ultra-reality of Highmore's introspective Charlie Bucket. While Burton's visual flair is at it's most impressive, he misses some of the small details: Charlie's eventual discovery of the golden ticket, for instance, is rushed through as if to say 'You know what happens here'. Harsh contrast to the first film which featured the torturous slow unwrapping of the bar, the pained look of anticipation on Charlie's angelic face, that wonderful glint of light off the first glimmer of gold, and the triumphant swell of orchestral brass braying 'I've got a golden ticket' as Bucket ran joyously home. Burton also miss-steps with the film's ending, which goes on far too long. Because we've seen Wonka in therapy (literally), Burton feels obliged to give us the treacly slow awakening of mental health and acceptance of self starting with a visit to Willy's father, Dr. Wonka DDS (Christopher Plummer). While I admire the clever contrast of dentist dad and confectioner kid (not found in Dahl or WILLY #1), I couldn't help longing for the concise culmination of the first film: Charlie passes test - Charlie wins factory - fade out. But all in all, riding the Wonkavator or the Wonkatania with Captain Burton is a visual feast not to be missed.",7,4,6,15 July 2005
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Give 'em an INCH...
","John Cameron Mitchell's tour-de-force as actor/director/author of HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH is nothing short of remarkable.  As theatre fans have long known, Mitchell is a memorable triple threat talent - actor, singer, drag queen (j/k).  Transfer of HEDWIG from stage to screen is brilliantly visual and engaging.  Hedwig's lifestory unfolds in just the right measure, stringing the captive audience along till he bares all in the film's fadeout.If there's an inch of regret about HEDWIG it is that the storyline is somewhat thin and the characters never really emotionally engage us to the point of joy or tears - it all adds up to a triumph of style over substance.  Good news is that Mitchell's/HEDWIG's style is completely unique and therein lies the substance substitute.",Null,0,1,8 September 2001
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Thames Reservoir Dogs
","For Americans, screening LS&2SB is like imagining what Fagin's gang would be up to if OLIVER TWIST took place in London's East End today.  Or possibly peaking inside the roughneck neighborhood of Alfred P. Doolittle nearly a hundred years post PYGMALION.  Billed as a comedy of sorts, LS&2SB never really gets the hearty laughs it needs.  The film's plot has more ironic twists and turns than a ring road from London to Stratford including a funny final freeze frame that is neatly typical of the rest of this 'Kraysie' flick.Following four cockney lads who get into serious debt after a rigged card game, the film's antic camera work (worthy of TRAINSPOTTING) and a great soundtrack (almost worthy of THE COMMITMENTS) can't belie the fact that our four heros somehow get lost in the proverbial shuffle.  With heaps of other shady characters to sort through, the viewer is left waiting (not too long) for the next plot point.  Rock icon Sting turns in a nicely understated performance as JD, bar-owning Dad to the lad unlucky in cards.  As this is tough turf, the butch film features only two 'birds' to speak of, both more plot device than person. If all the above's your bag of cash, give this one a 'butchers.'By the way, if you didn't understand that last sentence, better see LS&2SB on DVD, where a cockney rhyming slang dictionary is one of the extras.  If you're like most Yanks, you'll want to keep the subtitles on, too.  Them blokes don't 'alf talk funny, don't they?",7,0,1,6 September 1999
War of the Worlds," Winning WAR
","That Mr. Spielberg really knows how to churn out a great summer flick. This adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS nearly manages to make us forget the recent public TOMfoolery between our hero and a certain babbling Brooke. Watching Bayonne eaten by tripods did provide certain thrills for this Jersey boy - pay day for all those hours spent in bumper to bumper traffic. Cruise is in control, but pint-sized thespian Dakota Fanning is this film's key - she provides both the requisite humor ('I have back problems' she whines sardonically when asked to bunk out on a cellar floor) and the warm and fuzzies. Indeed, the relationships between Cruise and his kidlings is the film's bedrock with the tripod Aliens providing the scary chills and thrills of a sci-fi roller coaster. 'The crazy loon in the basement scene' (a staple of every WAR) pays off nicely thanks to Tim Robbins as said 'loon'. Like most treks, it all ends in Boston - but if you've any common sense at all, leave before they reach Beantown. The film's confusingly simplistic ending is not only dumb but sentimental. Its nearly enough to do the film in. But luckily it's only the battle thats lost - not the WAR.",8,0,3,11 July 2005
The Blind Side," Pass the syrup
","As icky sweet as it is clich√©-ridden, this real-life story of an unlikely mother and son proved devoid of any real tension. This is one of those premises that sounds too odd to be true on the page, but once on the screen doesn't go anywhere. Even the last-minute inquiries into the family's motivations for adopting Big Mike prove too little too late. As for Ms. Bullock, even her post-Oscar scandal seems more interesting than this slight narrative. Her performance here screams Kathy Lee Gifford on Lifetime, not Oscar winner. In fact, even Kathy Bates is in low gear here. Only the brilliant Adriane Lennox proves really memorable. Perhaps the young actor playing SJ had some moments, but they, too, seemed way to over-orchestrated and (ironically) lacking reality.",5,6,10,13 June 2010
The Sixth Sense," The Grateful Dead
","I won't be giving away anything to say that popularity of 'The Sixth Sense' relies largely upon it's twist ending.  Don't try to figure out what that twist might be while watching the film - you'll be wrong.  While I can't site specifics of this plot twist, I can reveal that the film makers manage to cover themselves neatly in the larger sense, but where the twist falls apart is in the details.  If 'A' plus 'B' equals 'C' for the bulk of the film, it must also be true when the twist is revealed.  Most folks, however, won't bother with the math and will be happy being told that 'A' plus 'B' equals 'whatever we tell you.'  Those who have seen the movie will know what I mean.Otherwise, the film is moodily shot and well-acted.  Arty mood and surreal atmosphere help the film patch plot holes and are more understandable at film's end.  Scene stealer of the year goes to the tot playing Cole 'Ghost' Seer.  Willis is fine as the Doc and Toni Colette (now with deluxe bee-stung lips!) ably subdues her Aussie accent to be a Philly single mom.  About an hour in, however, audience aches for the movie to declare it's intentions and get to the twist.  And it does, just in a nick of time.",8,0,0,22 August 1999
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter and the Terribly Long Intermission
","Loved the start of HP7II, but should have paid closer attention (or read the books) to truly appreciate the middle bit. Loved Maggie Smith stepping through the crowd to battle evil. Flanked by an all-star team of UK performers, most all of whom have at least one moment in a sea of appearances. The finale doesn't disappoint either. Didn't much care for the obligatory epilogue, but as it is from the book, Potterfiles would decry its exclusion. Shame that greed and length had to portion this film out in parts, as taken together they are remarkable; broken in two, slightly diminished in impact. Rather like taking a year long intermission at a wonderful play.",8,0,2,22 July 2011
