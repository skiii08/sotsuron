Blade Runner 2049," what the fuck did i just see ?!
","I don't know how did this movie get a high rate!
i've wasted 3 hours of my life watching this piece, maybe if i watched the prequel things would have been different. But really most of the movie i couldn't put the events together and i got bored so easily
sound effects and editing are way over the top
when it passed 2 hours into the movie i really didn't care what was happening just felt the obligation to finish something i started
But the CGI is very good to be honest
not so much acting, Ryan Gosling did his part well not so much for Harrison Ford and Jared Leto
what i really liked was the scene between Gosling and Batista in the very beginning and that's it.",1,5,8,13 January 2018
