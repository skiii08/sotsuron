Scarface," Rapper's stop Hatin because Hatin is not a word!
","This Movie is wonderful and I love it. I think Brian De Palma was making a real statement with this movie that with money comes power and you must control that and the greed that comes with it as well. I cant stand that all these rapper types have latched onto this movie and say it is the greatest movie ever. They are taking all the good that can come from this movie and using all the hate that it has to sell back to the children that will by their music that live in the projects, and by doing so it is the rappers who are keeping their people down. If they would rap about what life is really about, love, family, friends, maybe God, and HARD WORK. Yes HARD WORK! What these rappers are selling is the idea that if you shoot rob and take all that you can you'll be happy with your new Nike's, Hillfigures, and video games. When it is really HARD Work that will get these kids were they need to be and to understand that if they try hard they themselves can change the way they live.Enough of that then, as for the movie Al Pacinio does a great job as showing a man rise from nothing and then fall from his greed. I think this is one of De Palma'S top five and speaking of that I bet the rappers who take this movie to heart don't even know who Brian De Palma is, would not surprise me. Watch this movie to see not what to do with your life and then while your at it stop buying gangster rap to shut them up.",10,0,2,8 September 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny
","This movie had many laughs and it made me feel gross for watching it a couple of times to, but that is what you knew you were getting into when you sat down to watch this. For my generation, people 15 to 35 this movie is awesome, but for people over or under that age this movie I am almost sure would not play well. I had a good time tho. I however did find there to be to many genitalia shots. But since most films avoid that I guess it is okay. I can also see how Jewish people would be offended as it goes a little far with that joke, but not being a Jew I was able to laugh, maybe that is wrong I don't know. All in all this is a fine edgy film, just know what your getting into beforehand.",7,0,4,6 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," A Good mission But Not The Greatest Mission.
","This movie is an OK watch and did not deserve the lampoon it got but still it does not live up to the two past films in the series which are much better. What makes the first Mission Impossible better is it's stellar direction by Brian De Palma, and the fact that it almost has to be watched twice or more to uncover all it's meanings. It's not for stupid people as most action flicks are. The second one is better than this one because it has some of the best action ever showcased on film and it is in fact the best of the series. Now there are certain things that do hold up this third entry as well. It has a good pace, hot chicks, Ving Rhames, and some cool deaths. As for the plot, it is no good. Commercials make more sense than this film. It did not gel well and you can tell it was made on the fly by a over rated director (who has not really done anything I care about.), and an actor who felt he was so competent that he could simply walk through the role. All the supporting cast is fine and real, but Cruise just phones it in. While I feel that this film is overly criticized, I do think it has some merit, but no story of value. Good for a night of films without logic.",7,0,1,2 September 2006
Grease," Good Dance Movie.
",Great movie. The Soundtrack is even better. I love listening to the music. John Travolta made a great transition from Welcome Back Kotter on T.V to this a major motion picture. I hope that he one day comes back and does a proper Grease sequel with Olivia Newton John. I know they would probably be little old for this but with Travolta doing a new musical version of Hairspray maybe he can find this character in himself again and give us the sequel we deserve. The film however is great. Jeff Conway rocks as the bad boyfriend of Stockard Channing's character Rizzo and I love it when they kinda make up at the end. The supporting cast is very talented in there performances and it shows that they are talented dancers in the numbers that they perform. I say watch this movie when ever you can.,10,2,4,17 August 2006
The Exorcist," So, So, So Overrated
","I will admit this film is good, but it is not, I repeat is not the greatest scary movie of all time. That loving honor should befall to much greater films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974, of Course), Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter, Pet Sematary, Dawn Of The Dead, Hellraiser, SAW, The Devil's Rejects, and what I consider to be the best horror film of all time Carnivale of Souls. There are many others that are better I just named the ones that are at the top of there game. The Exorcist has huge gaping holes of logic missing that you could only believe and fall into it's trappings if you were a catholic. I am not. I find the movie to be painstakingly slow and uneventful. I guess if you find jump cuts and loud noises to be scary then this movie is for you. I also hate how William Fredkin is so prissy about everything, like he is the grandmaster of cinema, sorry that spot goes to Wes Craven who himself made a far, far better film only a year earlier and in a shorter amount of time and with a lot less money. That film was of course Last House on the Left. I suggest seeing that as it will shock you far more and it is indeed grounded in reality unlike this turd of a film. I do however think that Jason Miller is a fine actor and I wish he could have gone on to a better career than he had. Sad that this film is what he'll be remembered for. Sit this one out.",7,0,11,30 October 2006
Saw III," Fine but not great like the first one
","Let me first off start by saying that I thought this was a good movie and decent but as a conclusion to the series it sucks. I love the film and its exploration of Jigsaw and Amanda's characters and their relationships, but I found the supporting cast in this one to be something different from the other two and that difference is that they were boring and that I did not really care for them. All the other side characters in the trilogy had something about them that made you care. In this one they were just second rate. I liked the fact that Adam and Eric returned and I also thought the revelation that Amanda killed Adam was a better twist than the manufactured one that was given at the end. They should have saved that tid bit for the final frames. I am very sad that all the characters are all dead now or at least supposedly. I still want final conformation on Eric and Gordon but there is always Saw four waiting in the wings. Although I hear it will be a prequel which would be cool. Hope to see everyone there.",8,5,9,29 October 2006
Quantum of Solace," Worst Bond Movie Since Octopussy
","I went to this movie hoping, praying for nothing short of a masterpiece. I thought all of the ingredients were there from the last movie Casino Royale to make this finally the Bond movie with the biggest scope and rage of the series. But I was wrong. What on saw on the screen was a movie that could not hold it's camera steady and every shot was less that 2 seconds long. There were also hardly any wide shots to show to the audience what they were actually seeing on the screen during fights scenes. This made everything seem unrealistic like the were trying to hide the stunt men with how tight and fast the scenes went. Where as I believe Craig did most of his stunts if I were him I would angry that it was shot this way because it takes his presence out of the film and makes it look cheap. The villain in the film was the weakest since the no names in Octopussy graced the screen. I hatted that they killed Mathes off and it seems was too sentimental for the hard nosed Bond that Craig plays. Also Felix Liter seemed like an after thought forced into the film rather than as essential piece to the equation, which is a pity because that character has great potential that will hopefully be realized in the next installment after we get rid of Marc Foster from behind the camera. Foster is my main antagonizing point against the film, I say this because Craig holds his part of the bargain up nicely and grew as Bond even in this crappy film he was surrounded in. Foster just should stick to art fair and leave action to vets like Martain Cambell who knows what he's doing, case in point Casino Royale and Goldeneye. Some thing I did like about the movie were I believe Judi Dench and Craig have remarkable chemistry and I can't wait to see it grow in better movies. I also liked the idea of the Quantum organization,0 which is just SPECTER for the modern age and I hope that Bloefield from the early movies is the head of this and that this was just a lead in like DR. No. All in all I think this movie should be viewed but know that it is a pale imitator of Casino and everything before it. Pray that some one makes a better Bond movie next time.",3,2,5,14 November 2008
Casualties of War," Love it
","Masterpiece! This movie is magic and makes me sad that our country was ever involved with that vile war of nothingness, and no I am not against the troops. I think Johnson was an idiot and that he should never have sent the soldiers they did not know what they were doing they were just doing what they were told. At that time the vast majority of the people over their could not even vote, how sick is that. What makes it even sicker is the way the American public treated these heroes upon their return, and yes they were heroes even though it was an unjust war they are still our soldiers and they were fighting for us, and they should have been respected as such. Michael J. Fox does a great job in this showing the naiveness among the soldiers at the time and Sean Penn does a good job showing how bad a persons psyche can go when pushed to the limit for something they don't believe in. I do not condone what Sean Penn's character does in the film and he was rightfully punished but I can see what drove him to it. Brian De Palma does another stellar job with his visual style that will never be toped and the lighting is great in this movie. I hate that it bombed at the box office, because everyone should see this. Great movie.",10,26,44,20 September 2006
World Trade Center," Weird
","This film is hard to watch. Going in I thought I would be able to sit through this without becoming squeamish, I was wrong. When Cage and his partner get caught in the falling debris and are left to sit there for the rest of the film's two hour run it is agonizing to watch. You can feel the pain that the characters are trying to convey they feel. Each time Nick Cage gave a yell I sat up from my slouched position in the theater chair. This proves to me for the first time that Nick Cage is a great actor. His only other good movies to me are 1983's Valley Girl, 1996's The Rock, and 2005's The Weather Man. All of those are terrific. Everything else he has done I find bland and non entertaining. Oliver Stone did a good job on this. Stop hating haters this a good movie even if he got some things wrong. Watch this.",9,2,6,20 August 2006
Mission: Impossible," The Comeback
","This is the last super successful film by Brian De Palma and it is well worth it. The story is top notch and moves fast, so fast that if you don't pay attention you will miss out. It's a movie that if you miss something you blame the movie and not yourself if you miss something but you are wrong if you do this because it is all there you just have to pay attention. This story is one you earn by devoting yourself to it. Tom Cruise in this is at his best and I love it, his only other better performance is in this film second installment M:I:2. This is where for me Cruise left his chick image behind and became a real actor. Brian De Palma does none of his signature frames in this movie but I believe that is because he realizes that this is a story that he did not create and that he is just there to film the story not make it his own. Ving Rhames does a breakout performance in this and has never looked back awesome work. Watch this.",10,3,6,27 September 2006
Saw," I have the future of horror and it's name is SAW
","This movie is the future of horror. When Jigsaw gets up off the floor at the end I felt as I hope the audience who watched the first Friday the 13th felt when Jason Voorhees popped up out of Crystal Lake, and the feeling is AWE. I knew then that horror films had changed again. We were finally out of the WB, UPN horror generation of self mockery and now back into the glory days of the late 70's and all of the 80's when the blood was king. Thank you James Wan and Leigh Whanell, you are gods who are now as high up as the masters Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, and the best Sean S. Cunningham. This movie changed the world. The acting was a little choppy but who cares when you are rewarded as well as this film does. The killer Jigsaw or John Creamer as we would learn in the follow up is now already as noticed as Jason, Michael, Freddy, and Leatherface. Tobin Bell the man behind the SAW is also one of the greatest actors ever to explode on to horror cinema. I love this movie everyone should watch it.",10,0,2,21 August 2006
The Untouchables," De Palma at his best
","This a fine crime drama movie. Kevin Costner does a fine turn as Elliot Ness the man who would hunt down and take down Al Capone's empire. Kevin Costner does the role of his life in this and the only other thing by him that even comes close to this is The Postman. Sean Connery does good in this as an Irish cop who is trying to redeem himself. I believe that this is and was the turning point in Connery's career. Before this he was seen as a has been and had been type cast as James Bond, but this broke him out of that rut by showing that he had range. Charles Martin Smith is funny in this as he is in almost all of his movies. Can't wait to see him do something big again. Andy Garcia makes an early appearance in this as well and it helps the film as he is a good actor. But the real saving grace of this is Robert De Neiro. This is his forth collaboration with director Brian De Palma and it is probably their best effort together. Although I like Greetings a lot. Brian De Palma finally gets out of a tough patch that he was in and makes another masterpiece. This is easily one of my top five favorites from De Palma. Watch this.",10,1,2,20 September 2006
Scream 2," Good Follow up
","This film is a decent follow up to the 1996 original. The reason this one is even half as good as the first one is because of returning director Wes Craven, and the cast of course who all graciously returned. The most disappointing thing about this film was the death of Jamie Kennedy's character Randy Meeks who I loved. After seeing the first Scream my life was forever touched by the lovable rants of Randy. I live my life by his teachings and still to this day shed a tear when I think of his demise. He was more than just a character to me, he was like family. When I was sitting in the dark lonely theater back in December 1997 watching this I shrieked in terror as the blade went into Randy and ended the magic that was his character. I was ticked. The film has it's moments though. I love the evolution of Sydney Prescot and think they took her in the right direction. I hate the fact that Courtney Cox and David Arqette survived this outing. i thought is was placeable in the first one but outrageous in this one. The over all dark town of this film seemed to jive well with the continuation of the first one's more pastel look. Don't think I do not like this movie, because I do. It like the first one defined who I am and I could never complain about that as I like me. I just feel this film could have let Randy live an had Dewey and Gail die.",9,0,0,18 August 2006
Scream," Don't you blame the movies. Movies Don't Create Psychos they only make psychos more creative.
","It is with those lines uttered by Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis that my life changed. Before this film I was just a casual movie watcher being only ten years old. The only films that had stirred my attention by this point were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars, and Alien. Even though Alien was my first encounter with horror, Scream catapulted me into an obsession for the genre. Scream introduced me to so many franchises and pop culture phenoms that I was now an instant film buff after watching this film. Irented it no less than twenty times before my mother gained the good sense to buy it for me. After I owned it I had free reign to dissect the film. And dissect I did. I went through found all the quotes and references and then went on to find those films thus increasing my obsession for the genre. Thank you Wes Craven for many, many, many years of enjoyment. I now share this film with my little eight year old sister who her self is becoming a fan of horror. This movie is great, ten stars.",10,0,1,17 August 2006
Halloween," Good, But Overrated.
","I love Halloween and all of it's sequels, but I am tired of everyone acting like this is the end all be all of the horror genre, because it's just not true. Everything in this film that is supposed to be so original had been done before and in most cases much better. Look at Black Christmas were the dolly shot was first pioneered, Blood Feast and Psycho, where some of the first slashers came out to play. See also the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Last House on the Left, and The Hills Have Eyes, for all of you people who say that Halloween was the first to be instrumental in bringing the modern wave of horror to America. I also hate it when John Carpenter acts like no one else can possible make a movie as great as him. You know what Rick Rosanthal's Halloween II, it's a better movie and it should be the one that is praised. Yeah I said it Halloween II is the better movie, and John Carpenter needs to get off his high horse and stop bad mouthing his legacy. Halloween is just a very, very slow paced independent movie that was lucky because it had a soulless producer named Moustpha Akkad who in later years would destroy every thing he worked so hard to build with Halloween H-2-0. To add to that he also never admitted it. I can say never because he's dead now (Which I am sorry for, when he died it felt like the Joker died, he was my enemy, and I miss him.)Now don't get me wrong. Just because I went on this rant does not mean that I do not have an affection for this little film. I just wish people would stop acting like it's the Beetles and maybe see that it's a little more like the Rolling Stones (It will never die.) I also in fact do love John Carpenter I just feel that he tries excessively to go out of his way and put down this series, and toot his own horn. I feel that his films Dark Star, Assualt on Precinct 13, Escape From New York, The Thing, and They Live are all better indications of his style. Why can he not be known for those films, and not for this film that is it's self a knock off, however a decent knock off. If you want to see real horror watch Halloween II (which Carpenter wrote but did not direct) and stay away from this dull first installment unless you just want to see where Michael started.It should also not go without mentioning that Donald Plesance rules in this just like everything else he does and he is the true spirit of the Halloween series (Not Carpenter, Curtis, or even Micheal Myeres can take that title away from him!!!)",9,1,2,28 August 2006
Carrie," Love The Ending
",Brian De Palma was at the top of his game in the 1970's and 80's minus 1973's Sisters and 1985's Wise Guys. Carrie is a film that proves this fact. It is a disturbing depiction of a girl trapped in a horrid body (although Sissy Spacek does not look that bad it just proves her acting capabilities) and tormented by every one in her life. Her mother hates her because her mother has a fixation on God and sees every thing that is not done her way as evil and hell worthy. Her classmates torment her when she has her first period at 17 and does not realize what is happening to her. This scene is striking and sad to see a girl become a women in such sorrow conditions. But all of this is nothing compared to the rampage ending. Throughout the film Carrie slowly discovers how to use levitation powers and this culminates in the end when she is forced into hysteria and her powers are unleashed on her fellow prom goers in a bloody orgasm of death. In the film she takes her whole class out minus three people (Two she takes out latter and the other would get in the sequel The Rage: Carrie II) This scene is staged beautifully by Brian De Palma who makes great use of his recurring split screen movement. This film is awesome and supplemented by it's cliff hanger ending. Which at the time was not really meant to be a cliff hanger at all as it was the 70's and almost no one ever thought of a follow up back then. See this.,10,4,7,20 August 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Classic
","A Nightmare on Elm Street, that title says it all. It is exactly what this film is, a Nightmare, in a good sense. It is terrifying. My own experience with this film is somewhat of a personal one. Around the time that I was a three or four year old I had a demented babysitter who made me sit through all the Nightmare's that were around at the time. I assume either three or four had been made at that point as it was the late 80's. I remember being sat in front of a T.V for hours on end and force fed this series. I at the time hatted the women who made me watch this film. I did not have the vocal capacity at the time to tell my mom what was happening, it was not tell about five years later after I had left the women's care that i ever remembered watching this film and it's sequels. This film impacted my life in several ways through the years. First I was in a state where I could never watch this movie or any other horror film. The fear of this move scared me all through every day life until about the time I reached the age of Eleven or so. That was when my cousin who knew of my fear showed me that Freddy Krueger was only a character played by a man named Robert Englund. I remember this well as it was a turning point in my life. From that point on I became a film fan and mostly of the horror genre. I studied all that I could and watched all that I could it became an obsession and still is to this day. I love this movie and many like it. I feel bound by this movie. It is a part of me. To discuss the film though is to say that is terrific. Wes Craven's direction is distinct and tough. The movie has a fast, cheap, dirty look to it that makes you feel dirty when you watch it. You almost feel like you need to take a bath after the film ends. The Johnny Depp death scene is great I love it. Heather Langenkamp is great as the last girl and love what she goes on to do in the series, I also appreciate what Wes did with the seventh entry in the saga by making it so surreal. Robert Englund is a God, although Jason is better and my favorite killer. Watch this movie to get lost by it's magic.",10,0,0,2 September 2006
The Matrix," This Movie Is Lame and Overrated
","i only give this film two stars because Keanu Reeves was once a good actor with Speed and the Bill and Ted movies to his credit. I will say that Matrix: Reloaded is a far more stunning and brilliant film than this could ever hope to be. I feel sorry for anyone who would call this the best movie ever or say that it's stupid CGI effects are the best in the world because you know what, CGI is not the best use for special effects. I don't see how anyone could think so. When you see it, it never blends in and is always annoyingly showing and out of place. If you look at older films you can see that love was put into prosthetic pieces and mate paintings which will always generate more awe than CGI can muster. To date there has only been one movie to properly use CGI and it was Jurrassic Park and the only reason that worked was because it was one of the first times it had ever been scene, especially in the detail that that film showed. So get over your selves Matrix geeks this sucks and should be avoided.",2,1,7,28 August 2006
Donnie Darko," Donnie Darko WILL save the world!
","This is one of a very few movies that can bring me to tears and I love any film that can change my emotions like that. I only bought this film because the director's cut had a commentary with Kevin Smith and I love everything he's done so I figured since he put his stamp of approval on this it must be good or at least worth a shot, so I did. And when I watched this I fell in love with everything it stands for, and I cried when Donnie Darko dies at the end, it was unfair for him to die, but I understand that that is the meaning of this film, life is unfair. I love how the character time travels through the Evil Dead and thought to be funny. The soundtrack is wonderful and I hope to buy it someday. Watch this it is great.",10,2,5,6 September 2006
