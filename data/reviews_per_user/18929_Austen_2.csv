Requiem for a Dream," Lou Reed copied well
","This movie (and book) plays like a Lou Reed song (see 'Street Hassle'). Aronofsky develops his striking style as seen in 'Pi,' and benefits greatly from a bigger budget.  A brilliant film all-around.  So note that the topics of this film have been well-explored in the arts for decades.  The cinema finally takes their crack at it, and really there is no one better than Aronofsky to handle the task.  He seems to have less sympathy for the characters towards the end.  Though 'predictable' is hardly a word for this film, among independent music at least the story is at times cliched.  The cast is what makes this film most memorable.  Highly recommended.",7,0,0,22 July 2001
Gladiator," All too predictable.
","Gladiator had it's moments, but was altogether too blunt and predictable. There was some superb acting, but the way the film was put together just comes off being very superficial.  If a ten-year old boy was to make a movie, this would be their approach.In a certain sense, the setting of the film was a time of rather simple people, so in that sense the movie could work.  However, all these dream sequences are tacked on seemingly to try and give the movie some kind of deeper credibility.  In that sense, the movie as a whole fails.  Too bad for Phoenix, Crowe & Nielsen who turn in fine performances. Excellent makeup too!",3,0,2,7 May 2000
