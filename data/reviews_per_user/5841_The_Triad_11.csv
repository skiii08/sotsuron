Mission: Impossible III," As good as action movies get.
","Mission Impossible: III, third part of the franchise gives you what you expect. It's a definite improvement on the second film in the series and is a mesmerising film in it's own right. As with all action films, it will require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief to get the most out of it, and if you do, you will be greatly rewarded. I won't go into too much detail on the plot, but I will say that one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest devices has been used to full effect here. So what do you want? Fast Cars? Yep. Explosions? Yep. Ludicrously engrossing action sequences? Yep. Tension? Yep. Suspense? Yep. But MI:III also has to offer some great dialogue, acting, music, locations and even a little bit of comedy. There you go. If you feel like a decent, well made high quality action film, you can't go more wrong really.",8,1,2,17 May 2006
Ali," The Greatest... Nearly
","Ali is a very interesting film that succeeds on many levels that is very brave for covering certain areas of Ali's life that some people will not get. This film is not a portrait of Ali's boxing career, but rather his political activism, involvement in the civil rights movement and his relationship with the Nation of Islam.Biopics are tricky things, and surely, the life of Muhammad Ali could have been covered a thousand different ways. What Michael Mann knows, is that the main 'rise and fall' story would have been covered in numerous documentaries. Ali, as a result is an intriguing look into parts of Ali's life that the populous may not be familiar with.As for the film, if you can get past this factor, (and for me, it wasn't a struggle at all, but a welcome) the film has a great script, (jumping straight in to Ali's first title fight) cinematography and all that a film usually needs to be good. The acting in particular is exceptional. Will Smith used to be the guy from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air remember? Jamie Foxx was hilarious, Jon Voight was perfect and Mario Van Peebles delivered in the role he was born to play. The film is quite stylish at times, especially early on, heavy on music, though I don't really have an opinion on whether it helped the film or not, (it worked most of the time, actually) just thought I'd throw that in.Ali is a great film, more of a civil rights struggle film than a boxing movie. If you're expecting the usual story, of Ali's boxing career you may have to wait for another Ali film to be made. (I suspect that there will be eventually.) For now though, I'm certainly not complaining.",8,1,2,28 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," One very Impressive Spectacle
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was a very big film. It was huge. So, the usual is done with Hollywood sequels here, more of the same, but bigger. And I felt it, it was quite a heavy first part of the film, lots of information and detail before the ball really gets rolling and the whole thing starts to flow. The plot changes all the time so would be frivolous to try to explain a plot that encompasses the whole film. Needless to say, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan all get dragged into another adventure and meet friends and enemies, old and new along the way. The film is big, it's long, it's crammed with characters, some of which suffer due to the amount of screen time they get due to there being so many. But the film's appeal is in it's sheer spectacle, the sets and costumes and special effects are all of an absolutely incredible standard. This surely is the reason the big screen was made, and too see in there enhances the film to a great jaw dropping sight at times. Perhaps the only thing that the film didn't have going was a feeling for the characters, with so many of the new ones given screen time it was hard to feel when the main three got into perilous situations, or maybe that was just me. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 was an enjoyable, likable film, that demands a big screen viewing, but the main stars are the art and effects departments.",7,0,1,9 July 2006
Hotel Rwanda," An important film.
","Hotel Rwanda is an important film, it's subject matter is of an extremely serious nature, in a similar to the likes of Schindler's List. It depicts the events of a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, during which Hutu man Paul Rusesabagina shelters the endangered Tutsi civilians from the angry machete-armed Hutus. The film handles it's subject matter very well, telling precisely why these two 'types' of people, (they are really only different in name, which was given to them by Belgian imperialists based on vague classifications) are not getting along, without being too simple. The film than follows the Schindler's List formula, with Paul trying to shelter as many of the Tutsis that come his way, and hold off the Hutus for as long as possible. The acting, script, score, cinematography etc. are all of a good standard, though nothing really stood out for me (which in this case is a good thing as it enhances the realism). The film should also be praised for challenging the viewers watching, in a line that Jack Daglish's character (the cameraman) says. The film is difficult to watch at times, and works as it's own film very well. It's only major failing is that it may seem a bit samey for those who have seen Schindler's List, or even Lord of War, or any other film with genocide as the subject matter.",7,1,1,22 June 2006
Scary Movie 2," If a critic is just one person, then a review is just one person's opinion
","Comedy is a lot easier to judge than most other forms of cinema, it can easily be measured by how many times you laugh. I suppose drama, could be judged by how much it 'gets' to you, a horror on how much it scares you etc. Most of you will know what this film is about and what to expect, parodies of recent films and some very low brow humour, so I won't go into detail giving it a proper review, but I'll just say if that sounds up your street, and it's on the TV one night, check it out. If you aren't likely to find a string of gay, sex, toilet and the like jokes entertaining, then you should avoid. I fell into the latter category and still decided to watch it, and it got a couple of laughs out of me and a few smiles, mainly from the exchanges between the guy in the wheelchair and the guy with the withered hand, the guy with the withered hand in general, the Big Daddy Kane nod, and the high tech devices they used for communicating near the end of the film. There is a nice bit of comic acting in here too, and as with most parody movies, you will also get more out of it if you've seen the films it spoofs.Unless you're a fan of general toilet humour, be aware of what you're getting into.",3,2,3,22 May 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Nice, but not great.
","Pan's Labyrinth was an interesting, beautiful film to look at (most of the time) but from a simple entertainment standpoint it was just a bit on the dull side. The film is set in Spain, against the backdrop of the Spanish civil war. A young girl goes to stay with her mother and her new stepfather, a one-dimensional fascist general.The film succeeds on many levels, mainly from cinematography and effects standpoints. But fails (for me at least) to gain much interest into the characters involved. If the film had got me to care about the characters a bit more, it would have been a great movie, but as it stood, it just lacked that depth of character that it needed to push it into the next level, leaving me not to care too much about the fate of the characters, no matter how beautiful, or ugly their world became and the script, (or at least the English translation) was average at best. (take the first interrogation scene with the stuttering man for example.)For anyone who has seen a Hayao Miyazaki movie, the notion of a young girl retreating into fantasy to escape her troubles is nothing new. And although Pan's Labyrinth might be a masterpiece in terms of cinematography and effects, it really should've tried more to investigate the characters rather than having a simple 'innocent young girl' vs. 'murdering fascist general' which was just a bit too simple.",6,4,9,28 November 2006
Apocalypse Now," 1,2,3, what are we fighting for?
","It's that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-cut, re-up, Redux 22 years after it's original release.The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's main plot (if it has one) being Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the Colonel's story along the way.My initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times, especially early on, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in, in the form of surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses however, a good deal of tension is built up with Willard's reading through various reports on Col. Kurtz until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end.The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and I found the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but as the film progressed... I'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better, or it fitted better, or if it had just grown on me, but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying it.This is the second time I have seen the Redux version, (I have seen the original around four times) I'll say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a 'classic' film, with lots of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot), in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based), as the second time around, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favourite films.With the big four Vietnam films, Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere, but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work, especially towards the end where it becomes staggering, and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence.",8,2,2,29 June 2006
The Machinist," Will need more than one viewing to fully appreciate
","The Machinist is a film I find hard to categorise. When first viewed it may come across as a mystery, on second, a character study. Whatever it is, it's very good, and will need to be seen twice to fully appreciate the detail of the main character Trevor Reznik and the effort that went into all of he the details of the character (not just Christian Bale's jaw dropping weight loss). I don't want to say any more for fear of giving too much away, but I will say if you thought the film had 'been done before' to an extent, you mustn't dismiss it, but re-watch it, discover the differences and see that this film is an exceptional character study of a very interesting character.",8,2,3,4 July 2006
Children of Men," Jaw dropping, astonishing, brilliant.
","Children of Men is a film set in England in the near future. The world has gone to pieces, a fascist state is in power, revolutionaries are plotting and women are infertile. Intense, bleak, harrowing stuff, and not since Blade Runner has a film captured and expressed this feeling through the sets, locations and production design so throughly. Though not exactly a 'film noir' it's this feature of Children of Men, expressing the bleakness of this situation, through cinematic technique that is it's best asset. The plot is just as intense, characters well presented and interesting, acting is solid, script? Solid, cinematography? Phenomenal. If you can get you're head around the initial concept, (are you really going to sit there and say 'women infertile? What a preposterous idea!') you will be treated to one of the best films of the year.",10,4,7,24 September 2006
Casino Royale," Refreshing
","Casino Royale gives the Bond franchise a decent injection of adrenaline that it needed to be relevant again.Chances are, you already know what Casino Royale is about, so I won't go too much into details. It is a difficult film to review, mainly because it will obviously be compared to all the other Bond movies (which I can't say I'm a fan of, they're mostly hit and miss decent enough action movies) and also because there is quite an odd structure to the proceedings. (Though, this may be because it doesn't follow the same structure as most other Bond movies.) I'll just get into it, the film succeeds due to the reinvention of the Bond character and becoming a back to basics film, this can be credited to both Daniel Craig and the scriptwriter for the former, and Martin Campbell for the latter. I'm sure I'm not the only one who is annoyed at the level of CGI used in films these days, it's usually so obvious it detracts from the film and lessens the impact due to it being completely fake looking. Thankfully, Casino Royale ditches this in favour of a more realistic approach, including the likes of Sebastien Foucan, parkour extraordinaire (the reason I wanted to see the film) to create some realistic, hard hitting action scenes.Another aspect where the film succeeds is the relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynd, which was a joy to watch, and a welcome change from the bordering on Benny Hill antics that the likes of Roger Moore got into.So, it's got solid realistic action, rounded enough characters for an action film (including the main 'villain' Le Chiffre, who despite his eye gimmick keeps up with the reinvention of Bond, given decent reasons for his villainous actions, not just a madman bent on world domination.) The film fails on a few levels, as big and action packed and Bond as it is, I felt it may have worked better in three short episodes due to it's odd structure and pacing, it feels like three films pasted together. This is probably due to the fact that I was expecting a typical Bond structure, (Bond tracks villain, Bond beds women, Bond beats villain, Bond gets his girl, end) which the film was brave enough to ditch, so not really a big failure. The other main failure is the now mandatory product placement, (the scene with the Ford looking particularly just like a car advert) but I usually look upon product placements as tongue in cheek myself, and have a bit of a giggle about it rather than kick up a fuss.In a nutshell, Casino Royale is a meandering journey with James Bond, complete with hard hitting scrapes, gambling for the Queen, and relationships with women. A very entertaining film.",8,2,3,4 December 2006
Amélie," A film to cherish
","I'll start by saying that Amelie is easily one of my favourite films. It's about Amelie, a shy, day-dreaming, waitress who enjoys life's simple pleasures. One day, Amelie finds a small tin box in her house, and decides to return it to it's owner, the first in a long line of people who's lives she will make better (and worse) over the course of the film. On the surface, this could be just another 'quirky' film popular with the more art-house types, but Amelie has a great emotional depth in it's central character that is unparallelled in any other film. Amelie is the poster girl for lonely, shy, weirdos everywhere who struggles to find love herself because she can't face reality. It's this subtle, quite distressing subtext that makes Amelie the great film it is and will surely be missed by those who don't make the connection with the character. Elsewhere, Amelie has great cinematography, script, acting, score and whether you notice or not, brilliant direction from the back on form Jean-Pierre Jenuet. On first viewing the film comes across a bit of a mystery. How is that gnome going all over the world? Who is the mysterious character who keeps getting his photo taken and throwing it away? But unlike some 'one-twist' films, where once the mystery or twist is revealed there is no need for a repeat viewing, Amelie reveals depth in the characters within the main plot, and entertains with exchanges between the more minor characters, and a few very subtle sight gags. Right, problems... being this should be an impartial, critical review and all that, the one complaint I would have is that JPJ pushed the green a little too much on the DVD. If there is a shortlist for films to be considered 'the perfect film' this would surely be on the list, and just might be the one to deserve that title.",10,1,5,4 June 2006
