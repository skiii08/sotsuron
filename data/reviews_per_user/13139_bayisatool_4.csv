Iron Man 3," Better than 2 but...
",while I enjoyed this movie more than Iron Man 2 it still left me with a dissatisfied feeling. The movie did have its strong points which were some entertaining action sequences and Robert Downey Jr. witty performance. Otherwise the movie was a disappointment. For starters my biggest complaint is that we don't see that much of Iron Man and when we do his suit is always running low on power or malfunctioning. Another issue I had is that the movie had useless characters who could have easily been written out of the movie or combined with another character to save on time. I also felt that the movie ran about 20-30 minutes too long. Another issue I have with the movie is if Iron Man can get thrashed around by Thor's Hammer and keep coming back for more; then why do his suits end up getting destroyed so easily in this movie? Also they bring up the fact that Tony suffers from PTSD but they don't really address it beyond bringing it up. Oh and why did Tony let the Mandarin's forces destroy his house when he had an entire army of iron man suits hidden that could have taken out the the handful of helicopters that were sent to attack him!? Overall it was still a fun ride even if the plot was like iron man's suit; barely functional.,4,1,6,4 May 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Please skip
","This is my least favorite Marvel title. First off I am not very familiar with the comic but if this is what the source material is like then I am not missing out on anything. The plot wears very thin very quickly. The special effects looked cheesy and cheap. The action sequences were unbelievable and silly. Wolverine performs physically impossible feats, i mean even considering his mutation. Logan vs the hummer anyone. The movie was also filled to capacity with useless characters whose only purpose was to tell wolverine how to get from point a to point b. Oh and by far the stupidest part of the movie was when gambit stops wolverine from killing victor just so we could have an action sequence involving gambit. If you are older than 13 i doubt that you will get much out of this movie.",2,2,3,4 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," just OK...
","This movie is flawed. Even by super hero movie standards this movie is flawed. However I did enjoy this movie more than the 2012 reboot. What I enjoyed about the movie basically boils down to a handful of things. #1 the action. I thought the action set pieces were well done and they actually looked pretty cool for the most part. #2 I really enjoyed some of the music choices that they used in the movie. For example during spider-man's fight with electro they used dub step which I personally really enjoyed. #3 a good chunk of the jokes had me chuckling and some even had me laughing pretty hard. It is unfortunate that for all the things that were done extremely well that there were just as many flaws in the movie. #1 The story was extremely predictable. I mean my brother and I guessed what we thought would happen in the movie just based on what we saw in the trailer and we were spot on. We didn't get a single detail wrong. #2 The whole will they won't they dating game that Peter and Gwen played in the movie felt like a huge waste of time. #3 there was about 30 minutes of film that just felt pointless. Stuff that didn't lead to anything in the movie and took up time that could have been used to develop the villains/ set up other parts of the story. #4 the ending of the film should have taken place earlier in the film. If it had then we could have gotten some real development in spider-man's character. Instead all that 'development', if you can even call it that it happens so fast on screen, happens in a montage. At the end of the film the list of good and bad things that I noticed in the film were about the same. I recommend that you manage your expectations of the film. If you do I believe that you will enjoy yourself. I give this movie a 5/10",5,12,25,3 May 2014
The Ugly Truth," just what I expected
","I am a sucker for rom coms. I am aware that many like this one are not very good. They all draw from a short list of popular clichés and then they mix them up and cast the movie with the 'it' girl of romantic comedies at the moment. The clichés featured in this movie are, but not limited to; the chauvinistic man whore who acts the way he does because he was hurt, the liar revealed, the bickering couple who 'secretly' love each other, and topped off with a cheesy public outburst to declare their love. The result is a generic rom com that will disappoint the film critic. I enjoyed this movie because I knew exactly what it was going to be when I saw it. Sometimes I enjoy predictable movies because I don't want a surprise. I enjoy knowing what is going to happen throughout the movie. It's like eating a frozen pizza or a hot pocket. You know it's not very good for you, some would even debate whether it is actual food, but sometimes you can't help but enjoy a substandard meal because it is a guilty pleasure. For me that is what this movie feels like. Nothing in this movie is spectacular and some of the things in this movie are down right awful. That being said I don't regret seeing the movie and enjoyed it despite its many many flaws.",4,1,3,19 March 2014
