The Hangover," A Cure For The Hangover
","The Hangover is an enjoyable, laugh out loud movie that will go down as one of the better comedies to come out of Hollywood in recent years. There isn't much needed in terms of plot as four friends head to Vegas for a stag party and subsequently wake up 'the morning after' with only strange mementos of the night before to leave them wondering what they did. The fact that the clues include a real life tiger in their bathroom and a baby in the cupboard only add to the intrigue. Cue a series of set pieces and some glittering one liners and it's easy to see why this film was a big hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Anyone that has suffered the agony of not knowing what happened the night before, and then the acute embarrassment when you gradually realise just what you did will identify with this movie. And watch out too for a great turn from Heather Graham and a hilarious appearance by Mike Tyson - yes, THE Mike Tyson.",7,1,2,17 January 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Flashes of brilliance, but no Pulp Fiction
","Quentin Tarantino remains a compelling, if slightly unfulfilled film maker, and I was very interested in this latest offering. The premise sounded like typical Tarantino comic book escapism. Set a film in Nazi-occupied France and have Brad Pitt lead a group of Jewish-American soldiers intent on collecting - literally - the prized scalps of the enemy and it seemed to provide the perfect platform for another trademark Tarantino blood and gore fest. But the film never quite delivers on its initial promise, and although there are flashes of brilliance, this is no Pulp Fiction. But it is essential viewing and whatever one thinks of Tarantino's subsequent career moves since the highs of the 1990s, there is little doubt that the man still possesses an abundance of talent and knows how to deliver popcorn cinema out of the mainstream. Christoph Waltz is excellent, none more so than in the opening scene where QT teases us with a scene choking with tension. And Brad Pitt is wonderful as the colourful Aldo Raine. Pitt hams it up with effortless skill, and despite his obvious play acting in the role, we still engage with his character. One wonders if his portrayal was almost an in-joke from Tarantino as a metaphorical take on the American military view towards conflict and wars in general. And with no pop culture discussions to engulf the characters given the time and place of the story, QT instead uses this film as a platform to show off his huge knowledge of world cinema, and barely a scene goes by without the director trying to dazzle us with his encyclopedic references. There is even a snippet of Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack. In some ways, this is less comic book than, say, Kill Bill, and Tarantino as usual sets up long scenes that double up as set pieces - not necessarily in action but dialogue. The film does veer off in unnecessary directions at times, and does not entirely convince - it sags badly in places in the second half - but this is still required viewing and Tarantino's unique view of the world remains watchable with interest.",8,1,5,20 December 2009
Home Alone," Hughes hits the mark with seasonal hit
","Home Alone will long be remembered as a seasonal, workable hit comedy that will stand the test of time. The huge hit of 1990 - amazing to think it is nearly 21 years old - spawned 3 sequels that came nowhere near mastering the original, but John Hughes is in top form here and delivers a worldwide global hit. It was the movie that made Macaulay Culkin an overnight star, and thankfully for him his cutesy acting is pitched perfectly well. It would be easy to side with Joe Pesci and Stern as the bad guys when faced with an obnoxious smart ass kid, but Culkin shows us his vulnerability through the loneliness of being left at home, and it is this that works well. The humour is decent, the slapstick almost painfully real, this is a good movie with heart that deserved the success bestowed upon it at the time.",7,0,0,18 December 2010
The Prestige," No illusions as Nolan's piece hits the mark
","The Prestige is a unique thriller that works very well thanks to the slick direction of Christopher Nolan and a terrific contribution by a stellar cast. A movie that revolves around the acts of Victorian magicians is perhaps not at first glance the most obvious backdrop to set the story to, but Nolan delivers a powerful, engaging and compelling piece that is thoroughly enjoyable. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play two rival magicians, who through fate and tragedy, become competitively obsessed with the success of each others' acts. The sense of illusion is perfectly pitched throughout by Nolan, and it even gives the audience a wide appreciation of the world of magic (one almost can't wait to get home a try a few card tricks!). Jackman and Bale are magnificent, and are ably supported by the usual brilliance from Michael Caine. Quite how David Bowie pops up is anyones guess, but the whole movie is well made and will rightly be regarded in years to come as a superior picture.",8,0,1,4 July 2010
The Color of Money," Scorcese and Newman hustle pays off
","Film maestro Martin Scorcese will be remembered in years to come for his gangster films, but The Color Of Money is right up there with his best offerings and is a classic film. It centres on Paul Newman reprising his role of 'Fast' Eddie Felson that he originally undertook in 1961 for The Hustler. Only this time Felson has found a sensational new protégé in Vincent Lauria, played by Tom Cruise. Quite simply, the film is magnificent, especially the first half, with Newman in blistering, Oscar-winning form. Nobody plays boozy anti-heroes quite like Newman, only this time Felson is well off and affluent and is living a comfortable life as a liquor seller. Interestingly as well, Cruise is fabulous, and this is about the last movie he made before he became an overnight sensation and international megastar. But you can see his talent in every scene, and he bounces off Newman's brilliance with ease. Cruise's talent is that he makes his schoolboy-immature character of Vincent ultimately likable, displaying his vulnerabilities. Some of Newman's lines in the opening hour are classics, and Scorcese's constant use of zoom in close ups is beguiling rather than irritating. The film is also tremendously lit, and some of the seedy pool halls are gloriously presented. A masterclass from all concerned, and this film is one of the best movies ever made.",10,0,0,31 December 2009
Knowing," Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of
","Watched this the other night, and after reading the other reviews on here I was surprised at how much of a slating this movie gets. OK, so many of the reviews seem to match a general theme - i.e. - great movie but very poor ending, and that's probably about right, but I do feel this movie is a lot better than it appears. The premise of a girl predicting events 50 years into the future by using a sequence of numbers is very well done, and the obvious predictability here is that Nicholas Cage will inevitably come across some predictions that haven't yet happened. But the suspense is well balanced, and the real problem this movie has is that the build up to the finale is so well organised, that there is no way they can end the film adequately. In the end, we are almost forced to accept an ending not so much cheesy as positively laden down with cheddar. But thankfully the producers steered away from the cliché ridden 'America saves the world' type of curtain faller - goodness knows how much messier it could have been had Bruce Willis and not Cage been the star name. And that then got me thinking about endings and movies in general. It never ceases to amaze me just how much some movies divide audiences, and in some cases are we expecting too much? Shouldn't the function of movies ultimately be to set out to entertain and do we get too self centred and precocious about some titles? Frankly, there is enough pacy tension and entertainment in the opening hour of this film to more than paper over the cracks, and if Spielberg had been at the helm, we would have all been heralding it as a work of genius.",3,1,4,8 December 2009
The Man Who Would Be King," Caine and Connery the perfect mix as Huston hits the high notes
","Legendary director John Huston had kept the desire to make The Man Who Would Be King burning away for two decades before Sean Connery and Michael Caine finally brought it to life, and the result is a wonderful movie that, despite its quality, has often been overlooked when discussing the careers of the two leads. Caine and Connery play Peachy Carnehan and Daniel Dravot, two quick witted rogue soldiers who desert the army at the time when the British empire ruled the world. Based on the Rudyard Kipling story, Christopher Plummer plays the author who first encounters the two men when the decide to set themselves up as rulers of the tribal Kafiristan, and plunder fame and fortune along the way. Plummer is merely a foil for the central duo, and is used sparingly, only really appearing at the beginning and end of the movie. Probably because of his hideous Graeme Souness moustache. Huston's masterful direction brings the best out of Connery and Caine, and as a double act they sparkle and fire off each other in every scene, almost in a brotherly, telepathic way. Indeed, it's Caine's early scenes, where he delivers quick fire lines in his broadest Cockney, that work exceptionally well, and as mentioned earlier, I often think this is some of Caine's best work that gets scandalously overlooked. People do refer to this movie once in a while, but always seem to just mention Caine, Connery and Huston. View it objectively, and from a Caine point of view you will see he totally nails the part and perhaps the great friendship he has endured with Connery off screen brings the best out of his performance on it. The turning point of the story is when the native tribesmen mistake Connery for a God when a stray arrow strikes him but he does not bleed. In fact, the arrow gets embedded in his bandolier which the locals do not realise. There is a masterful change of direction in the movie when Connery begins to lap up the total worship that suddenly befalls him, and his character's ego becomes swept along with disastrous results. But at this stage, his relationship with Carnehan changes from equal partners to one of attempted superiority, and here as well the ability of Huston to so successfully convey this between the two men is seamless and masterful. The chemistry between Connery and Caine is as good as Newman and Redford at their best (Newman was allegedly approached for the role but recommended Caine) and the stunning location work in Morocco is simply beautiful, especially the backdrops when Connery is on his way to see the local high priest. And of course, no review of this picture would be complete without mentioning the one and only movie appearance of Caine's good lady wife Shakira. Despite the well documented story behind Shakira's role, she only has one line to deliver (in fact, actually just one word - 'Roxanne'), and for the record plays Connery's wife, who also famously refers to her (in the script of course) as a slut who has bitten him. That's one for the pub quiz champions of the future.",8,0,1,25 December 2010
Paranormal Activity," A chiller that delivers
","Whether this movie can inspire after repeat viewings remains to be seen, but the intention to scare the audience witless is clearly successful, and it is no surprise that this low-budget chiller became a runaway hit. If, like me, you saw the 'obvious' scenes coming, you may not be afraid to turn out the lights at bedtime, but that still won't mean you will be any less impressed at a very well thought out movie. Comparisons with The Blair Witch Project will be inevitable and numerous, but the impact is no less for that. There are three key scenes of sheer terror, and the old Hitchcockian values of 'what you IMAGINE happens off the screen is infinitely more harrowing than what you see ON it' gives the film a massive edge. The movie also won't get away from the 'what the hell are they still sleeping in that bedroom for' scenario, but this is still a worthy hit, and will be one of the most talked about movies of the last decade and beyond.",7,1,3,16 January 2010
Once Upon a Time in America," Leone classic will live on for decades
","Master of the Western Sergio Leone swapped Clint Eastwood for Robert DeNiro, Cowboys for Gangsters and the Wild West for an even wilder New York, with this seminal masterpiece. It was Leone's last film before his tragically early death at just 60, and although he was working on a big budget World War II film at the time of his demise, in a way that is tragically fitting as no film could have topped this one. Of course, whilst Leone naturally made his name in the sixties with the infamous Spaghetti western, the sheer sprawling grandeur of OUATIA is an unforgettable experience that attacks the senses. From the opening image of Robert DeNiro's opium filled body to the final scene some 229 minutes later, the sensation carries on throughout and hits home more powerfully than any cheroot-chewing Clint or twanging Morricone soundtrack ever did. DeNiro plays 'Noodles', a young man who grew up with his compatriots in Prohibition America, who then returns to his old haunts three decades later to reflect on his life as a hard-bitten gangster. Every scene is pitch perfect, and whilst there are some caps doffed to the likes of The Godfather, Leone doesn't hold back with scenes of rape, murder and brutality that give the film an edge sharper than a month's worth of Eastwood stubble. It's amazing in that Leone was returning to the helm of a movie for the first time in over a decade - there is no let up in the brilliance and certainly no signs of rustiness. And legendary collaborator Morricone is also back in tandem. Morricone delivers one of his most mesmerising scores and it was reported that DeNiro demanded some music be pre-written for scenes and then played back whilst they were being shot just so he could pitch the mood of his character. It's hard to say that this is Morricone's best work because his career is generously decorated with brilliant soundtracks, but it's also the case that 'Deborah's Theme', for example, is even played at funerals these days, such is the power of the music. Even Lennon and McCartney's 'Yesterday' gets an airing. James Woods and Elizabeth McGovern provide faultless support from the cast, but this is a movie of colossal brilliance and will rightfully live on for many decades to come.",10,18,36,12 April 2011
Victory," Ridiculous but essential Victory a must for footie fans
","This film is best viewed through the eyes of either a) an eight year old boy or b) an England football fanatic. So if you are neither of those when you either saw this movie or have yet to see it, then that is pure bad luck but not something I will account for. As I was very much an 'a' then it is my prerogative to like this movie when many do not. I even believe it gives me the right to smirk at some of the cheesier moments with ease because when all is said and done I am still very fond of this presentation and always will be. Right. Happy? So where shall we start. Well how about John Huston? One of the most legendary cinematic monoliths ever to come out of Hollywood, ends up directing a movie about football or, as Huston would have said at the time, 'so-ccer'. It's akin to Martin Scorcese directing a Tom And Jerry episode or Clint Eastwood appearing in Celebrity Big Brother. Quite how much 'direction' Huston had over the football scenes is highly debatable, but that is the first shock over with. The plot is utterly ludicrous of course. An allied Prisoner of War camp just happens to house some of the worlds most infamous footballing legends, and they put together a team to play a German side, with much of the outcome designed to further progress Nazi propaganda. Inevitably, the Germans punch, kick and cheat their way through the game whilst 'our boys' look on helplessly. The sub plot here is that during half time, the Allies will make a daring bid to escape and not return for the second half. But you guessed it, whilst still believing the game can be won, the English led team decide not to take an ideal opportunity to escape from a POW camp and instead return to the field for the honour of a football match. Given that they entertain the crowd so much with their football that it sparks a pitch invasion at the end which precipitates their escape anyway, this gives the wafer thin plot even more ridicule. But do you know what? I don't care. This is how football movies should be made. I don't care that 'we' have Sylvester Stallone in goal. I don't care if a pushing-fifty year old Michael Caine mixes it with the football heavyweights like Booby Moore and Pele. I don't care if every sporting cliché is visited shamelessly to great effect. We even get 'Nazi' softie Max Von Sydow eventually applauding the breathtaking football skills of the Allies to the evident brow furrowing of his superiors. It's just a good romp through a genre we've seen so many times before. In fact, giving a war film a footballing theme could be seen as being dynamic and ahead of its time. Actually, I've just thought of an idea - how about a war film set in a POW camp that gets visited by ruthless aliens? Steady on now, I'm in full flow. This is popcorn cinema at its best - nothing to take very seriously and all good fun. Yes, that seems ridiculous even now when you consider the backdrop the movie is set against, but it is the case that nothing more preposterous yet at the same time compelling came out of Hollywood in the eighties. Then again, there's always The Hand.",8,0,1,27 December 2010
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Carbon copy fails to find its feet
","Whilst John Hughes did an admirable job in reuniting virtually the whole cast for this remake of the 1990 smash hit, that it about the only positive thing to take from this lame sequel. What is remarkable is that this is virtually a scene-for-scene remake of the original, without any discernible attempt to revisit any new ideas or conceptions. Perhaps given the box office success of the original, the producers were at pains not to stray from the well beaten commercial path of success. Not even the idea of setting the movie in New York does enough to breathe fresh life into the same old premise. Culkin's career never recovered from this, and although the film was yet again inevitably a smash hit, audiences will feel a little short changed and certainly think they've seen it all before (which of course they have).",2,2,7,18 December 2010
The Wrestler," Rourke triumphs over adversity in astonishing movie
","The Wrestler is one of the most poignant and powerful movies to come out of Hollywood in the past decade. Micky Rourke gives a quite astonishing performance as the ageing, broken hearted (and boned) fighter living on past glories desperately patching up his abandoned body to keep eking out a living doing the only thing he knows how to. His life is turned on its head when he suffers a heart attack in the aftermath of a brutal fight, yet wonderfully the picture fails to fall into the clichés of fight movies and avoids all the pitfalls that are invariably attached to a vehicle of this kind. Never before have we see seen so graphically and movingly just what the fighters have to go through in the name of entertainment and to give their fans what they want. We see the wrestlers discussing their moves before each fight, but this doesn't detract from the bone crunching punishment they take even if their bouts are elaborately stage managed. There is no better fight scene in the movie than when Rourke secretly cuts his own forehead with a concealed razor blade to get the crowd believing his injury has been caused in the ring. Rourke then has to try and achieve a reconciliation with his distant daughter, and also tries to build a relationship with lap dancing Marisa Tomei. The parallels between the two leads are obvious - Tomei's character also recognises the degradation and humiliation attached to her job as she tries to maintain a body 'fit for purpose' in a job that she has to do to pay the bills. Rourke is the colossal star of the show here - he underplays his depair with a magical touch and we root for him 100% despite him not wallowing in his vulnerabilities. The Academy Award voters must hang their heads in shame as never has an actor been more deserving of an award as Rourke. This is a phenomenal movie, and is highly recommended.",10,2,4,19 December 2010
Casino Royale," Bond back with a bang as Craig dazzles
","The problem with the longest running franchise in cinema is that after nearly half a decade, originality should be in short supply. After nearly 10 years playing James Bond, Pierce Brosnan was allegedly dropped due to contractual problems (i.e. he supposedly wanted more money than the producers were prepared to give) so in comes Daniel Craig. Certain Bond aficionados were audibly heard groaning with disbelief once Craig was announced, but anyone who has followed his fledgling career since the days of Our Friends In The North a decade earlier would not have had any concerns. Craig is arguably the most talented 'actor' to take on the role of Ian Fleming's legend, and coupled with an incredible physical presence, is easily the best Bond actor since Connery. And it is here that Casino Royale wins hands down. Craig reportedly did a lot of his own stunts, and, just like Connery, he has the pumped up physique coupled with a touch of elegance that makes his Bond so believable. The numerous hand-to-hand combat scenes are thrilling and totally convincing. Going back to Fleming's original source material is also a canny idea from the producers - let's face it some of the Brosnan story lines were getting frankly ridiculous (ice palaces anyone?), and not even the late great Cubby Broccoli tried to take on this novel in his heyday - probably because the David Niven spoof was around at the time. This is a tremendous entry into the Bond annals - fast paced, stunning and absorbing. Throw in the raw theme song of Chris Cornell's 'You Know My Name' and the irresistible Craig and you have the best Bond film in 20 years.",10,1,5,25 December 2010
