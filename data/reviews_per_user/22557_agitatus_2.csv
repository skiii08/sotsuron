Skyfall," Hollywoodish venture, too long, low payoff.
","A largely commercial venture that caters to the Superman crowd, I could not take this as seriously as a Mission Impossible, for instance. There were too many panderings to Cinametique, and the whole thing was just way too long. It stretched and stretched it seemed. I could have edited this down and chewed off at least 40 minutes. Plus it was all way too obvious as far as progression of plot. The mystery just wasn't there.Javier Bardem played his role magnificently, as would be expected. He makes a great bad guy. But the clownish blonde hair and the CG teeth...man. The security setup with him in the glass cage (with no potty to go in) was way ridiculous, as well as the moment with him on the ladder being shot at 5 times by Bond and evidently Bond claiming that he missed on purpose. The whole deal then with the explosion in the ceiling of the tunnel and the crashing of the train with its lights still on during the whole ordeal and no one on board the train in evidence was quite amateurish, no matter how much they spent on the scene.

Prometheus," Great re-opening of an old franchise. Superb.
","You'd think Alien would have run it's course as a three time film franchise. It's been since 1979 since the first Alien popped out of a stomach and into a man's birthday cake, and today we still have acid blood that eats through helmets, and snake-like creatures that dominate men and seem to like esophegii. But what we do not have in this film is cheesy effects and off-screen suspense as style. We have instead the great visionary filmmaker Ridley Scott, author of Bladerunner and Gladiator, both stories having different epic proportions. He was the perfect choice to bring this story line back to life, and as he's said in an interview, 're-open that book'. Story is oftentimes everything, but here in Prometheus, it is story and look and feel, just as cinema should be. Film is show, and not tell. The showing does the telling, and we are offered a great feast of first rate special effects, practical sets mixed with digital artistry, and wonderfully orchestrated mise-en-scene. That would have been Roger Ebert's vernacular. But what would Gene Siskel then say? 'Basically, for a scary movie, it's beautiful.'As for myth, Prometheus was a progenitor, Greek mythology, making man from clay, so it's appropriate to show the self-sacrifice of an 'Engineer', allowing his own genes to be utterly destroyed in order to populate a virgin planet with the genetic makeup of a god. Am I giving away too much? More....For my full review: http://xyvector.blogspot.com/2013/06/prometheus-2012-ridley-scott- charlize.html",8,3,6,26 June 2013
