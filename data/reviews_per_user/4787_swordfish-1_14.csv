Scarface," Simply Brilliant
","Did you ever asked why people mention so often Scarface? Well I got an answer to that. Because it's one of the best films of all time. Everything worked just perfect with this movie. The cast was superb, the music was cool. Simply fantastic.  This is going to be one of those movies for which even after a century people will be talking about and they will still watch it.",10,0,1,21 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Only for kids under 10
",Once again a top grossing movie that makes me think what is wrong with Americans.This movie is so bored and so long that your nerves can't handle it after the 1-st hour of the movie.It's effects are nothing special except a piece of modern tecnology.At the start it seems interesting.You keep the same opinion till about the first hour.After that 'o my god it sucks'.If someone told me before that this is going to be a top grossing movie I'd call the ambulance and sent him to the hospital for rehabilitation.But there's nothing you can do about it.People lose their minds when they go to cinema for such a movie. Well as I said I recommend this movie only to the kids under 10.,8,1,2,11 April 2002
Armageddon," Great simply a great movie
",I don't know what's wrong with those people who don't like ARMAGEDDON.They must have some kind of disease.Anyway everybody has his own opinion.And my opinion is that this is the best movie I ever saw. It's the first movie that made me cry. The scenario is perfect.It couldn't been better.The cast is simply terrific.During all the movie you have emotions that make your heart jump from its place. You can't miss this movie. You'll enjoy this movie more than having fun with your friends at a seven star hotel.,8,2,3,11 April 2002
American Beauty," Gosh it sucks
",Man this movies sucks. Best picture winner. Make ma laugh. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. I saw it with about 5 or 6 buddies and we all were so disappointed. After this movie won the best picture I consider oscar as a joke. How could this one possibly won 5 Oscars. This film should have won only one Oscar and that is for the worst movie of the year or maybe even for all time. Kevin Spacey had a middle range performance. It's a sin how Denzel haven't took the award home for his outstanding performance in The Hurricane. Anette Bening did quite a good job. As for the rest of the crew I can only say I was so bored I didn't even analyse their roles.  Somebody should pres charges against Academy Awards for such a crime against humanity(and to give the best picture award to AB is a crime).,10,0,1,29 April 2002
Apocalypse Now," A lifetime movie, one of the all time greatest
","Well I don't need to say much but Francis Ford Coppola made an astonishing film that will be remembered for decades. With Al Pacino turning down the role of Capt. Willard, and a lot of other difficulties, Master Coppola never quit, even in the toughest time of his life when Apocalypse Now almost got him bankrupt. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** read at your own risk! The story began with Capt. Willard (Charlie Sheen) being chosen for a very strange mission. He killed a lot of people, but this time it was different, he was sent to kill an american, a high decorated american colonel (portrayed by Marlon Brando). The trip until he found him had some of the most perfected motion picture scenes. All the cast gave outstanding performances starting from Charlie Sheen, Robert Duvall (he won the best supporting actor Oscar), Senior Brando was great as always in his supporting role, so were Frederic Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Denis Hooper. The screenplay and the direction from one of the most influential persons in filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola were at the highest level of greatness and pure cinematic pleasure, really brilliant.  And before posting this I would like to add that AN was robbed at that years Oscars.",10,1,1,1 July 2003
Face_Off," The best action movie I've ever seen
","If you don't believe me than at least take in consideration that 9 friends of mine agree with me that this is one of the 3 best action movies ever made. The aperance of Travolta and Cage was superb. John Woo is definetely the best director of action movies. The story is unique(one thing that rarely happens cause almost all of the action movies have the same topic). Also this is quite unpredictable, it's not a thriller but you're not even a little bit sure of what will happen in the end. 10/10. The best action movie of these last five years.",6,2,4,9 May 2002
American History X," One of the best movies ever made
","This is a masterpiece, my #5 in my all time favorite list. The performance by Ed Norton is one of the best in movie history, right up there with Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and De Niro in Taxi Driver. Also Edward Furlong gives an unforgetable performance as does all the crew. The direction was perfect. I can't believe Shakespeare in Love took the Best Picture Award that year.  Really this is one of the best movies ever made, words can't describe it's greatness. I don't wanna get into spoilers, but I will recommend to everyone this film.  And BTW I read a lot of reviews complaining about the fast change of Norton in the movie. Well that's the best part of the movie. I mean come on people this is no a bullsh*t movie to last hours and get boring. And I would like to mention one more thing. The speech at the dinner is one of the best scenes in motion picture. It's right up there with 'You talkin' to me'(Taxi Driver) and 'You think I'm funny'(Goodfellas).",10,0,1,25 July 2002
The Usual Suspects," One of the best films of the last decade and all time too
","I'd recommend you not to read this if you haven't seen this movie yet but to go to find it and to watch it. This movie is perfect. There are no flaws in this. Great acting, great directing, great writing. Simply perfect. This is a movie that you can watch every day and not get bored of it. I just can't imagine how at the hell this movie had such a small box office grossing.  Anyway I just want to tell those who are reading this to go and hire this masterpiece. You ain't gonna be dissapointed. I'm not going to talk about the film cause if I tell you the ending you'll probably wish I never did. 100/100",10,0,1,19 May 2002
Mulholland Drive," One dream, one reality, one masterpiece
","Ok now the first time I saw this film I was outrageous and really hated the ending and the Lynch himself for not giving an explanation about what was all the fuss about.Last night I decided to give it another try and I'm stunned even myself because of how dramatically my opinion change. This is one of the most perfect movies made in these last couple decades. The story is perfect, the direction by Mr. Lynch is at the highest possible level (he certainly deserved his academy award nomination, he should have even won it). And let's not forget over the top performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring, they definetely had a chemistry, one of the best maybe ever seen in the motion picture (just take a look at the lesbian scenes).***SPOILERS*** read at your own risk Now let's do a little search on the plot:  the first part of the film is a dream from Naomi Watts(Diane), the way she wants her life to be and the perfect indication to that is the way she is portrayed, she can do nothing wrong, she came to the city of dreams, found her lover, was becoming a star cause she was unmistakable as an actress and so on.Now the second part of the film, from the cowboy saying wake up girl is the reality, and also the beggining of the story. Its amazing the way that Lynch could tie the story though the names get changed and everything seems out of order. Naomi Watts (Diane) is in love with Laura Elena(Camilla), but that love is not returned cause Camilla is in love with the director(Justin Theroux). There are very strong indications that they never even had a love relationship, I mean look at the scene where Camilla comes from nowhere and Diane says 'Camilla, you are back' and than she disappears (which means that she was halucionating), which brings us to the conclusion that the couch scene (a few seconds later)  was also an ilusion or a halucination by Diane (Naomi Watts).After the engagement of Camilla(Laura Elena) with the young director (Justin Theroux), Diane(Naomi Watts) hires a hitman to kill Camilla. The Hitman says 'when the job is done you'll find this key where I told you', so when Diane finds the key, she feels guilt and her concience pushes her to shot herself.That is about it but there is just another possibility: it may also be that the first part is not a dream, but is afterlife of the two girls (after they dies). Rating: 10/10.",10,1,2,29 July 2003
Black Hawk Down," A copy of Saving Private Ryan
","Well I thought this is going to be a fantastic movie. It was my type of movie and I really expected a lot from this one, maybe to be one of my favorites. And so the movie began. At the first 20 minutes it was bored but I was hoping it will get better. And finally the war began and i can say it never ended. The movie had no meaning. Only war and fights. Awful. The scenes were so bored that I can't explain how happy was I when it ended. I was so so disappointed. I expected so much from this one but I really could se nothing good in this piece of sh*t. A time ago before watching it I wanted it to do good in BOX OFFICE but now I recommend you not even to think about going to watch this crap. Watch Saving Private Ryan.",5,0,0,16 April 2002
Titanic," Hmmm it deserves it all
","The TOP GROSSING movie of all times and 11 academy awards winner.What else can you say about this movie except that at that time there were many people that watched it 3 times a day.So if you haven't seen this movie make your own decisions should you watch it or not.I would say that it is one of the best movies.All you people out there saying that this is terrible, put your minds together and do something better than James Cameron did in this movie. Probably deserves all its success.",10,1,3,11 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The worst Top Grosser of all time along with LOTR
","I just saw this movie. It ended a few minutes ago. I usually don't write about movies as soon as I watch them but this one was so so so so so terrible. Words can't describe this. It's about 2hours and 15minutes bore, headache, and everything else bad. It's better to count the stars than to watch this piece of sh*t. What was this movie all about? Hmmmm. Don't know. It was about nothing. It was about stupidness that Hollywood produces and people still watch it. When you look at the sucsess that this disaster has achieved you find out how many sick minded people are in our planet(i'm not including kids under 10 here cause this can still be funny for them). 0,0001 stars out of 100.",3,1,2,29 April 2002
The Deer Hunter," One of the best movies ever made
","Firstly let me tell you that this is not a war movie, this is a movie about affects of the war. This is a movie about friendship, love and courage. SPOILERS*** If you think that the wedding scene was stupid, than you're a fool. The wedding scene though it's a little bit to long, makes us care about characters. I never gave a sh*t whether the main characters in Full Metall Jacket and Apocalypse Now will die or not but my heart was beating very fast during The Deer Hunter. I felt I was Michael(De Niro) in every part of the movie. This is the most realistic movie I've ever seen, the script was great, the direction couldn't be better. And I didn't notice this movie lasted 3 hours until now. It wasn't boring, not even for a single moment. Anyway I'm not gonna get deeper but I will recommend this one to everybody. By the way the rusian roulette scenes are one of the best in the movie history. ***** out of *****",10,0,0,19 July 2002
The Godfather," The best was, the best is, and the best will be for many decades
","This is the best movie ever made, alongside with Godfather part II. I have no words to describe this, it's simply wonderful. I can't find even one little flaw. How could I? The directing by Francis Ford Coppola is the best ever done, the acting by Pacino, Brando, Duvall and the rest are astonishing. The cinematography and script couldn't be done better. This movie, if people will live in earth for many centuries, ain't never gonan be forgoten. This is something that even in the year 3002, parents must show to their children, so they'd understand what means a masterpiece. The only movie who came close to Godfather I and II is Schindler's List. So 30 years gonna and only one movie came close.  The best movie ever made. 101 stars out of 100.",10,1,2,28 July 2002
