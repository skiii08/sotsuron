Sucker Punch," Sort of a guilty pleasure
","Ninja cheerleaders with guns fighting robots, zombie Nazis, and dragons. I'm not sure what else you need to say, but IMDb wants ten lines. How about 'The Jacket' meets '300' and 'Sin City'? All in all, a thrill ride with plot twists that keep you guessing the entire time. The story line is more about crazy situations than plot exactly, but the stunning visual effects more than make up for any plot holes. I would put this slightly ahead of 'Sin City' and '300'--also graphic novels--just for the visual effects and cinematography. The originality of the story earned it an extra star from me. There are a couple places where the story is disjointed, but overall it is complex. You can discuss the fine points of exactly what each person thinks really happened around the water cooler. Or, just watch it for the cheerleaders. Either way, it is worth seeing, worth seeing twice, and worth owning.",8,2,4,13 December 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good for newcomers; great for Trekkies
","As with the previous movie in this 21st-Century revision of the 23rd Century, the performances by Zachary Quinto (young Spock) and Karl Urban (Bones) are outstanding representations of the original characters as their younger, more emotional selves. Zoe Saldana (Uhura) and Simon Pegg (Scottie) do a good job with their parts even if they seem to have made the characters their own. Chris Pine (Kirk) plays the part with more sexual magnetism and drive than Shatner did (incredibly) but with far less charm. I expect we will see more smooth operating as Kirk begins to age. Benedict Cumberbatch offers a dramatic rethinking of Khan at every level. Though it was interesting, the dramatic change in Khan's character was noticeable, and the age of the character should have been older as he would have been the same age in this reality as in the previous time line. However, the reversal of roles at the reactor chamber was masterfully done. Watching Quinto and Pine reenact this classic scene from 'The Wrath of Khan' will give you chills. It was beautifully done, and faithful down to the facial expressions. So, although the somewhat more emotional, younger characters will appeal to the younger audiences or those new to the Star Trek universe as pure action, the faithful re-imagination and execution of moving scenes from a past/future that no longer exists is sure to draw appreciation from even hardcore Trekkies.",9,1,4,9 July 2013
Across the Universe," Excellent Use of Visual Metaphors
","Often, when we see a movie set in the Vietnam era, the directors and writers get lost in the atrocities of napalm and warfare. The directors of Across the Universe have imagined to illustrate the evils of war and radicalism without becoming enamored with it. Rather, these are backdrops to show us the true cost of war--the human conflicts. With visual metaphors that spend every minute showing us the human costs of war rather than telling us, this film borders on poetry rather than a movie. The balance of dramatic writing seen generally in stage productions was made much more poignant by the visual effects only possible on film. Some may wonder why I did not give the movie a 10. I was mildly disappointed by the Liverpool artist's singing or emotional output in his studio. Also, the movie focused so much on visual story telling that the plot lagged behind, especially between the Sade and her guitarist. I also never give movies a 10 unless they change my life. This was an excellent movie, but it did not change my life. Therefore, a 9.",9,0,0,17 July 2013
