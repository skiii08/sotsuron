It," An example of a good remake.
","It's certainly not scary. This movie relies on being unsettling or creepy rather than being truly scary. But that doesn't really matter, in this case. This film is exactly what a remake should be. It's well acted, has characters you can actually root for, and even has some laughable and sad moments.",9,1,2,3 February 2018
