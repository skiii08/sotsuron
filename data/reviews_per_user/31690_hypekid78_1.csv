Lucky Number Slevin," Super Movie!
","I've been waiting for this type of movie 2 return 2 the big screen 4 a long time! I'm getting tired of transsexuals,gay cowboys and racist la cops! Movies r meant 2 tell a story that will catch your imagination,not something that u see every day at the six o'clock news!And Lucky Number Sleven does just that,with it's British/Scottish style of direction! Lovely acting by Josh and Lucy (the others don't need acting grades anymore) :))))I liked everything, from the plot 2 the soundtrack!Great work!Keep em coming like this guys!",10,0,10,9 May 2006
