Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The dark side of the force is strong in this crap-fest
","This movie is HORRIBLE. If you've been lucky enough not to have seen it consider yourself saved. Don't watch it now. You've made it this far. But if you just can't help yourself then let me throw some of these nuggets your way : 1) jar jar bunks is the worst character ever created. He'll annoy you to the point you want to switch to the dark side and finish him off. 2) way too much CGI and too little story. 3) little 7-8 yr old Anakin, future Darth Vader, is terrible. If a list of worst child actors was released this kid would be at the top of the list. Maybe it's not all his fault as Lucas puts these actors in impossible situations because of poor dialogue. Lucas has clearly lost touch with the ability to create seamless dialogue.
 I could go on and on about this massive disappointment. Now Disney's flying the ship (though the results are mixed at best). R.I.P. Star Wars franchise your time has past",1,1,4,22 July 2018
