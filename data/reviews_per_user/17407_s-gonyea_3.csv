Scarface," Alright
","This movie was a huge thriller. I could barely look when the chainsaw scene was happening. The way Al Pacino wrapped the guy up made me have to cover my eyes. I didn't like the gory scenes in this movie. Also, this movie didn't have to be 3 hours long. Half of the time Al Pacino was just swearing. The scene where they were at the pool wasn't needed in my opinion. The type of movie isn't for me, but people who like a thrill with some gore..... go watch this movie. I would have to rate this movie a 4/10 .",4,0,4,1 February 2017
Citizen Kane," Alright
","I thought the film Citizen Kane was an alright film. I thought the director ( Orson Welles) did a pretty good job visually. The effects were great for the time (1940's). There was a lot of use of Low camera shots. I thought that the camera angles helped shape how Kane was seen as a powerful man.I didn't really like this movie because I thought it was boring. I didn't think that the actors were very great..Citizen Kane went through a lot of ups and downs before his life ended. I thought it was interesting how Citizen Kane turned his poor lifestyle that he was born into to being a very successful man. Although I didn't really like this film too much, I did think that the camera work was great. The focusing of the camera really worked well in my opinion.I would rate this movie a 5/10, Even though some people may say it is a 10/10, I just because i was really intrigued.",5,2,4,12 March 2017
To Kill a Mockingbird," good
","Harper Lee did a very great job with this film. I remember reading the book ' To Kill A Mockingbird in grade school. It was pretty interesting to find out about how things work in the courtroom. The racial injustices surprised me. This movie was very moving and a great story to follow.Tom Robinson was the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl. He gives an amazing performance. Tom Robinson's performance really stood out in the scene where he was in the court room and testifies on the witness stand. Just because Tom cared about a white girl, he had to face almost certain death if he was convicted. That is just so wrong.I can't believe people can be so prejudice and create so much hatred towards a man ( Tom Robinson) only because of the color of his skin. Atticus Finch (Tom's Lawyer) really stood out to me. He had a great amount of courage to go as a white man defending a black man in the courtroom. Even though it could mean that all of the townspeople would hate him, and disagree with his belief's, Atticus stayed focused on the trial and didn't give up. Atticus was probably one of my favorite characters in this movie because he did something that no other white man would ever do for a black person during that time period.I would give this movie a 8/10. It was a pretty good movie in my opinion. I would watch this movie if you are really into the law, and racial injustices.",8,0,1,5 April 2017
