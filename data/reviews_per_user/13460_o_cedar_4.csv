Requiem for a Dream," Every thing you read is true...
","Yes, it is completely depressing and not only for the weak of hearts, and the elderly, this is really one of those movies that make you think about yourself, and about the real sense of happiness.... I can't really say that you'll feel better after having seen it, and you won't be like 'Wow, I'd like to see it again' but for a movie to move and shake you that much, I think it's job is done...NB: It was only prohibited under 12 in France.... wow, I'd never let my kids watch this under 16, it even made ME sick at times....",10,1,1,7 May 2003
Rocky V," Bad, yes.... awful? .... n-n-no...
","Yes this movie is a bunch of crap... it destroys the Rocky myth (he is now incapable of boxing), it contains so many cliches and the plot can be read really far ahead that it is light-years behind the 2 first Rocky films... III and IV even being quite poor at least were quite entertaining... But I'm such a Rocky fan that I still enjoyed seeing a new fight scene with this 'body-blows sequence' that occurs in every movie... I gave it a 4.... but for someone who hasn't seen the other movies pass your way, this is not even worth that...",3,2,6,10 April 2003
Apocalypse Now," Avoid the ReduX version
","I have just seen this movie for the first time, and it was the ReduX version. I really enjoyed it at the beginning, but then it dragged on for too long and that finally numbed me to the point of not liking the second part of the movie... Thus it is difficult for me to rate this movie because reading what was added to the first version, I must say that without these 50 supplementary minutes, it must really be a stunning experience... I would have given it a 6 for the ReduX version (interesting but far too long with the boring scenes that were added: Bunnies girls, plantation...) and the original version would probably have gotten an 8 or a 9... I rate it 7 then...",7,0,1,10 January 2005
Toy Story," Huh?? This is in the top 250???
","OK, Toy Story is nice and yes, it is visually quite good but hello, how can this be rated as one of the greatest movies in history??? It is just entertaining at times... maybe it is better for kids... Monsters Inc. is a lot better, and if you want to see a cartoon that says something rent 'Hotaru No Haka' aka 'The grave of the fireflies' is Soooooooo much better....",5,6,46,17 August 2003
