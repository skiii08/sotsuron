The King's Speech," Great movie!
","I just came back from watching this movie in suburban Chicago. I understand this film is only in limited release here in the US, which is a shame because this is such an excellent movie. If this film was widely available, so many more people would have the chance to enjoy it. There have already been quite a few excellent reviews of this film, so there is no point in repeating. I will say that I was surprised (more like shocked) as to how funny at times this film is considering the subject matter. Trust me, you are going to laugh out loud as I did (but I will not tell you when!).If you have the chance to see this film, do it! You will find yourself totally immersed in the story and cheering the King on. I have never been part of a movie audience that actually applauded after the film ended until tonight. That should tell you just how good this film is.",Null,1,2,29 December 2010
