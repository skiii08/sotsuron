Your Name.," Yes overall it IS pretty good but....
","Lets jump straight to this.First half - engaging. It is refreshing to see the two person exchange their lives/bodies and watch how the people surrounding them are affected by the change. Eg. After the girl goes inside the boy's body she helps him ask his dream girl out.Second half - tedious. The love story. After the 50 minute mark it all boils down to some clich√©d love story. And worst of all is it drags on and on. Audience are forced to sit through 40 minutes of teenage love where one person is chasing the other relentlessly and with great desperation. I nearly stood up and yelled out 'Just STFU and move on you stupid cow!'!!!!90% of the audience were Asian teens. During the film I heard a lot of laughter at jokes that were outrageously unfunny. There was a part where some cute dog appeared on the big wide silver screen and from the audience came this overbearing 'awwwwwwww' and in this I could detect the shrill voices of teenage females and males who wish to impress. That is not a problem, I am not trying to be mean in ANY sense. But these people might be the INTENDED TARGET AUDIENCE and where the majority of the reviews are coming from. This is worth keeping in mind.",6,8,30,3 December 2016
The Witch," The jokes never end
","Hahaha!My friends wanted to get a good scare, and as the Conjuring 2 wasn't out yet, this film was used as substitute. It was a very bad mistake.Things happen at such a slow pace that interest wanes long before 10 minutes is past. You fall asleep and wake up expecting to find the film done and realized it has only been two minutes.... and that is when you start cursing. Why this film is classified as horror the audience will never understand. It is not scary! Half the time the main character stares at a candle flame or some object or another while the camera does a close up on their face, and that is their way of building tension. And then nothing happens. The other half of the film involves everybody praying as if there is a million dollars on offer for the guy who prays the most.Redeeming qualities are found in the pure absurdity of the situation/characters. There is this teenage boy who looks at the breast of this girl who works for his family, has he even hit puberty yet???? And then the mother getting pecked by the scarecrow on the nipple thinks she is breastfeeding a child... HAHAHA!Avoid this guys... well it was funny sometimes",1,31,72,8 June 2016
