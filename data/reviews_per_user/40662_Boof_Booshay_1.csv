Deja Vu," I Loved It!
","Excellent story, actors, acting, action, special effects etc. make this a must see movie in my opinion. This is the best movie I've seen in a long while, and has a great plot which (upon first viewing at least) seems to have no holes like many time travel flicks do. Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer make a very good team, and will hopefully team up again in the future (or the past? lol). Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, Paula Patton and Jim Caviezel all deliver the goods as you would expect.Pay no attention to the critics that blabber on about the movie being unrealistic and unbelievable - of course it is, it's not a documentary, it's a movie! This is an edge of your seat thriller that keeps you guessing right to the very end - 10/10",10,2,4,11 January 2007
