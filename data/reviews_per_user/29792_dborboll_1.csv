3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 gives the Western genre life.
","When I at first saw previews for this movie I was pretty excited. The original 3:10 to Yuma wasn't during my time and I had never seen it, so I see this movie with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe during previews to a movie and tell myself I am going to see it. 3:10 to Yuma is simply a masterpiece, the acting is absolutely superb, Russell Crowe delivers a performance for the ages. You cannot help but love his character. Going into this movie I was thinking it was going to be a big action style movie as many westerns in the past have been, I feel I was wrong. Don't get me wrong there was a good bit of action, however the story was just so great and full of life, while I was watching the film I really didn't even think about the action in it. 3:10 to Yuma just has such depth that you will just be immersed in it until you realize the credits are rolling and you get that feeling of sadness that the movie is actually over.",10,3,6,1 October 2007
