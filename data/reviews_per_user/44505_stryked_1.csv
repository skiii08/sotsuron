The New World," Another fishing spree into the unfinished editing school
","Ah previews. A gloriously rich and colourful preview caught my eye, I wish it hadn't but alas it did and so I watched a bloody awful tragic mutilation of film where I can only presume the editor had a dodgy eye and a gammy hand. The script, from what I can establish, consisted of pointers to the actors to: 'look slightly odd as though someone popped a fish up your shorts...' to be closely followed by a shot of a tree, a rock, a random puddle or...well those were the choices really. Cinematography was dreadful but it gave me a great laugh at the manic wonders that grace the screen knowing people are getting paid for this 'fish up the shorts' roller-coaster ride. The sad thing being that I cannot claim back the few coins I gave to this grass rustling dribble or better yet, get cast in one of these characterless films where I will get paid for looking sulky in a corner. I enjoyed the preview though.",1,0,3,24 July 2006
