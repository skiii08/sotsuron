Scarface," Exciting and Relentless
","Al Pacino who happens to be my favorite actor shows his best performance in his role in Scarface. He plays a Cuban who comes to America to fullfill the 'American Dream'. I didn't know that the American dream was to sell cocaine but whatever its Al Pacino. The lines in this movie are absolutely great and heartfilled and I think that Al Pacino definetly deserved an Oscar for making this film along with Brian Depalma. Also Michelle Pfeiffer plays a good role in this performance as Frank Lopez's snotty wife who Tony loves. You can say that Tony loves hard to get woman. This reflects his attitude because his attitude says he can do anything because he has 'balls'. Tony looks down on people who he feels doesn't have 'balls' and called them 'Cocaroches'. Overall, I felt the impact of this film, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.",10,1,2,9 April 2004
Hellboy," Exciting, Fun and Charasmatic
","Ron Perlman shows a great performance in Hellboy. He plays A badass demon captured by Dr. Tom Manning who truly loves him and shows him the ways of good. This movie gives a lesson on acceptance. This is exibited when Hellboy shaves his horns to fit in and the love affair between him and Selma Blair, which shows us that even a creature of his kind could have feelings of that sort. Hellboy is exciting when he kills many villans such as the fish creatures throughout the movie.  He does this using his oversized gun and bullets and his enormous powerful hand that he is born with.  This movie is pretty well rounded and very well casted. I think the movie would be better if they would have concentrated more on the upbringing of Hellboy. Otherwise this movie is a good film for teenagers, adults and kids and is fun to watch.",7,0,0,4 April 2004
