The Devil's Advocate," Don't ignore this magnificent movie!
","The Devil's Advocate was one of those films that I didn't really have high expectations. Little did I know that it was to be one of my favourite films of all time and a must own on DVD. The Devil's Advocate has a terrific story line of mans seduction to wealth and success. The great theme of how the simple life is better when it comes to moral values, and how mans greed and lust for money, brings chaos.Al Pacino is without a doubt, my favourite actor ever and this role of Satan/John MIlton (arguably his best role since Tony Montana), brings more depth to Pacino's sometimes-typical roles of gangsters and cops. Al Pacino, and the gorgeous, extremely lovable and very talented Charlize Theron bring a lot to The Devil's advocate. Pacino's character has some magnificent dialogue; when Pacino talks about love, 'Overrated. Biochemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate'. Absolute genius. Pacino's character is also, in my opinion very profound. With quotes such as 'I'm here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began. I've nurtured every sensation man's been inspired to have. I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him. Why? Because I never rejected him, in spite of all his imperfections. I'm a fan of man. I'm a humanist. Maybe the last humanist'. Absolutely classic.The only problems I had with The Devil's advocate were it's ending and Keanu Reeves. Don't get me wrong the happy ending was OK, but I think I would have preferred the clich√©d ending of Reeves blowing his brains out. Honestly I think that Keanu Reeves can be forgettable in all of his films (except for Bill and Ted), especially when he is along side the best acting abilities that Theron and Pacino's offer. Basically, an actor, who possibly plays a slightly more convincing part, could definitely replace Reeves' UN-exciting persona. Generally, Reeves doesn't convey the southern accent and doesn't convince as the role of attorney Kevin Lomax.Overall The Devil's Advocate is a multi-genre film that is witty, scary and quite romantic. This film has everything to offer film lovers from the ages of late teens and up; definitely not to be missed. 9/10",7,0,1,6 February 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick and Science Fiction, what more do you want?
","Stanley Kubrick is quite possibly one of my favourite directors of all time. With the likes of Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange and the Shining, there's no denying that he's one of the most versatile directors of the 20th century. The 1968 film of 2001 a space odyssey can only be described as one of the biggest jaw dropping, cult classic films ever made. Even when you watch it now, it still amazes you. This film was made four decades ago and there have been very little sci-fi films; possibly the likes of Alien or Star Wars, that have come close to it's fantasy and UN-real adventure that leaves you pulling your hair out in amazement and question. If there is a more surreal film out there I'd like to see it.",9,0,4,4 February 2006
