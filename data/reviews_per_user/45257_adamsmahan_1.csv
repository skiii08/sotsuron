Blade Runner 2049," Great visuals & great acting with a weak story.
","I found this movie to be lacking the punch it needed to be worthy of the previous work and the immense acting talent it contained.
There seemed to be 'filler with the addition of an unnecessary supporting character that seems to pull you from the story, rather than color it. It requires too much suspension of disbelief and is astoundingly demanding of your 'movie reasoning.' It leaves the story incomplete with its failure to answer how. Plausibility seemed crucial to the plot and nothing was mentioned. Even in the realm of distant future sci-fi, where far fetched possibilities are more acceptable to an audience, a theory wasn't even mentioned. 
It is pretty and performed well, but, in my opinion, it missed the mark.",5,4,7,16 October 2018
