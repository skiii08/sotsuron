Million Dollar Arm," Excellent Feel Good Film!!!(MILLION DOLLAR ARM)
","I really enjoyed this film. Its a great baseball film, a great feel good film. Perfect for Memorial Day Weekend ( as was '42' last yr). This is heartwarming , moving, inspirational, and should be seen by all' I guarantee you will love it. One of the best baseball movies I've ever seen. But not only about baseball is also about learning to respect other cultures, The entire cast was great, loved Dashin, & Runka , and BRENDA ( Ms. Lake) a real find,,, Go see it You will come out feeling happy and enthralled, as well as inspired. Its too bad was released same week as Godzilla Imax.. This film is 10 times better.. Up there with Pride Of The Yankees,Bang The Drum Slowly, Field Of Dreams, The Natural and last years much underrated film '42' Go see it you will love it!!!",10,2,3,24 May 2014
Les Mis√©rables," A Great Historic Film Not To be Misssed
","Les Miserables is the best movie I've seen this year As great as the Broadway show was, the film is better, more action the closeups. etc The cast is excellent HUGH JACKMAN should receive an Oscar for his performance as should Anne Hathawy wonderful performances Russell Crowe is excellent as well though his voice doesn't stand up to the others Auduence broke out in applause several times (rare in a NJ theater) After Hathaways moving performance ' I Dreamed A Dream' ' and 'Master of The House' ( Sascha Cohen , Helen Bonham Carter hysterical,) and for Hugh Jackmans performance of 'Bring Him Home'At the end received a standing ovation.. Long yes 3 hrs, never boring not a bad moment in film beautifully directed by Tom Holland and photographed.. The most satisfying film I've seen this year ( and there are many good films this yr) Note* Glad Colm Wilkinson Broadways original Jean Val Jean was included in a small part as the preacher.. Ot to be missed!!",10,2,3,26 December 2012
