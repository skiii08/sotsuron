The Ring," Chilling, but not thrilling
","'The Ring' overall is a very well-produced, well-directed, obviously 'Americanized' version of the 1998 Japanese film 'Ringu'. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a journalist looking for answers regarding teens deaths after having apparently viewed a 'killer video-tape.' Rachel gets her hands on the tape, views it, and only has a week's time before her own demise to solve mysteries of 'The Ring.' However strange and cheesy the premise may sound, the movie is surprisingly eerie. Many of the scenes in the movie have a deeper meaning that could easily be missed. If you have seen the movie and hated it, chances are you weren't paying attention or were only watching the 'surface movie,' not looking for the allegorical references. Laced with strong theatrical elements as well as creepy effects, this movie is not recommended for viewers under the age of 10.Overall: A creepy movie, not a scary movie. Pay attention and be aware of details. If you want a scary movie, rent 'The Exorcist,' a truly scary, mindless horror film.",Null,0,1,10 March 2003
