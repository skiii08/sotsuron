The Blair Witch Project," Scary movie if u know about the whole story
",Everywhere you go you hear people talking aboout the Blairwitch Project and on t.v. you see commercials claiming that this is the scariest movie of all time. So naturally you go to the movie theater with a couple of people and you pay your 7.50 for the movie and you start watching it expecting a movie that will give you the creeps for a long time. Now the movie is done and everybody you went to the movie with is dissapointed and saying what a joke the movie was. Well I understand why you would say that due to all the hype this flick was given but maybe if you had visited the official blairwith project site in advance then you would really find the movie scary because when you go to the site and you read about all the mythology and everything it makes you see the movie in a whole different way and it makes you think more about the movie and when you watch it you understand what the people in the beginning of the movie are talking about and it really makes a difference in the chill factor. ANother thing I recommend is when the movie turns pitch black close your eyes and listen deeply to the sounds cuz they really make the scene more intense. The bottom line is to find out more about the mythology behind the movie before you watch it even though you know its fake. This movie is a 10/10 if u watch it the way I told and if you go watch it not knowing anything about the story and are expecting it to be the scariest story then it gets a 3/10 for u.,3,0,2,28 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," One of my favorite movies of all time
",This movie was an awesome movie and is really the first movie about ghosts in ages that makes sense and not only that but gives me chills.  I think the acting was superb especially by Osment who played the role of the little boy. When I first saw the movie I was like no way at the ending and I was saying thats impossible but after I thought about it I realized it made perfect sense and made the movie even creepier. This is a film I will have to watch more times to catch every little detail. Trust me people you need to go watch this movie immediately and really think hard after the movie to explain to yourself what happened in that movie. A 10 out of 10 but I don't want to say too much cuz that tends to ruin the movie a bit.,9,0,0,14 August 1999
