United 93," I Didn't Think They Made Movies Like This Still...
","This is an unparalleled film in its tremendous emotional engagement of the viewer. From the very beginning to the gut-wrenching final moment, this is a piece of art that one must remind oneself is almost a reenactment of an actual event. Paul Greengrass & crew have outdone themselves with this detailed, powerful film.The ultra-realistic depiction of mass confusion and breakdowns in communication between ordinary people trying to cope with an unprecedented situation pack so much punch because we, looking back today, of course know the outcome. Yet all we can do is sympathize for these souls who are nearing their untimely end. This is film at its finest; emotionally gripping, perfectly paced and brilliantly edited to portray the mess that September morning was for those trying to prevent further destruction.The class and respect for this tragedy Paul Greengrass has shown is a no-brainer. You have to be seriously delusional to anticipate a film like this coming out in some Die Hard action-type style of nonsense. It's obvious great care was taken and needed to be, and the result is nothing short of one of the best films I have seen in years.Clearly Greengrass has written the film closely following the 911 Commission's report, and the key in viewing a film like this is to detach yourself from your belief, whether you be a dedicated conspiracy theory believer or have Bush's pictures hanging on your home walls. This is a story of people dealing with an immense situation, at its heart.",Null,6,10,26 August 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," What Are People Smoking?
","**** No real spoilers, but of course since I hate spoilers, a tiny line in my review may be regarded as one, so be warned ****I read another user review that very accurately stated one's expectation in terms of the 'kind' of film they are going to see in REVOLUTIONS will determine their opinion of it more so than its content. I completely agree, and though that may seem obvious, this film has been so horribly under-appreciated and criticized due to wrongful or misguided expectations. I think it's an absolute gem and now, having seen it again about 3 years after seeing it during the opening weekend, I am even more fond of it.The story of The Matrix and all the layers within the main arc is a wonderful story. The first film was truly about belief, and believing that you are powerful and capable of what you believe you are capable of. It had a great message, and then of course RELOADED took us deeper into the world of The Matrix itself, increasing our understanding of just how much more there is to all of it. I believe what happened was a bit of the message of the first film was lost on audiences as it was slightly missing from the sequel, which focused on the plot of the free humans vs. machines itself far more. However, here comes REVOLUTIONS, bringing us right back to the concept of belief, and even more so, the ongoing dispute between logic vs. faith. The Architect is of course a program of complete logic, whilst the Oracle is evidently faith-based. This is alluded to throughout the film, and the film progresses along these opposing ideas, with a fantastic scene where Neo enters the machine world and engages 'belief' from the most unlikely possible source (something many have missed).And what can I say about the CGI and SFX overall? Absolutely unbelievable. I have watched the great battle sequence between Zion and the squids many times now, and it still blows my mind. The level of detail is unmatched in any other action sequence(s) that I have seen in any films. The quality of the CGI and the intertwining of live-action humans with the CGI is breathtaking, and the sound effects are extremely well-done. 3 years later, I have seen several of the big-budget effects-heavy films, and none hold a candle to what this film offers. There is so much in here to enjoy and to make repeat viewing a pleasure.9/10",Null,0,3,24 September 2006
Black Hawk Down," This Is How You Do It
","BLACK HAWK DOWN affected me profoundly on my first viewing, and now, with four more to reflect on, the genius of this piece is obvious.As another reviewer stated spot-on, this is as though one were watching documentary footage. And you better believe it is. This is hands-down the most realistic war footage ever filmed and offered to the public's eyes next to archival video of an actual battle. The action is intense, unrelenting and accomplishes the rarely achieved feat of having the viewer's emotional attachment draw in, sustained and juggled in perfect balance between varying characters at a consistent enough rate to let your heartbeat rest alas at only the final few minutes-- if even then.The cast and crew's unquestionably tremendous efforts are visible through every moment here. The performances, editing, cinematography, lighting, effects, pacing-- it's almost a dream for a film-goer. I am a film lover and yet I only have about twenty DVDs, an intentionally small collection as I only buy the rare movie I am engrossed in and can be sure to enjoy no matter the ninth or ninetieth viewing, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of them.I just watched it again today for the fifth time, and when the mission begins, I felt the same acceleration in my heartbeat, the same chill down my spine as the first. Those are the signs you're experiencing something; not just 'watching a movie.'10/10",Null,1,2,21 January 2006
