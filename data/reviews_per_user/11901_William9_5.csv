Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More mature than it seems at first glance...
","The Phantom Menace may look like a kiddy movie, but there are some truly dark undercurrents.  First, of course, is the title.  It makes us wonder, who IS the phantom menace?Obviously, Darth Maul and Darth Sidious are two obvious choices.  Maul is just a pawn, however.  And I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Sidious is in fact Senator Palpatine.  And, as most fans know, Palpatine is the empoeror in the Return of the Jedi.When viewed from this angle, the movie is less about the good Jedi triumphing over the evil trade blockaders, and more about Palpatine using everyone, Maul, the Princess, the Jedi, the senate, and even the Trade organization, in order to overthrow the senate.At the same time, of course, Anakin could be considered the phantom menace, as he looks like a savior, only to be ultimate evil in disguise.The horribly bad 'Jar Jar Stinks' is thankfully offset by these deeper aspects of the good, but not great, film.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Sexual Harassment in the Theater
","If you're easily offended, please go see this movie a couple of times to lighten up.The second funniest social satire of 1999, right behind the brilliant, four star ELECTION, a film that doesn't have to rely on shock value to get its point across.",8,0,0,8 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Laughably bad dialogue
","It's really, really sad when you're sitting in a theater with 1000 non-native English speakers and they're laughing at the amazingly cliched, poorly read English dialogue.  The scene with Anakin moaning 'mother' in bed elicited shrieks of laughter, and, upon reflection, is the only really memorable scene in the entire film.As one Finnish girl remarked after the film was over, 'the cheese is strong with this one.'",5,0,0,16 May 2002
Apocalypse Now," An American masterpiece
","This film is so dense that it takes many, many viewings to understand and truly appreciate it.It stands in a very select group of films.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Pulp Fiction," One of the most moral films of the 90s...
",Salvation and redemption are the two things this film is all about. Forget what you've heard about it.  Watch it with an open mind.,Null,0,0,3 June 1999
