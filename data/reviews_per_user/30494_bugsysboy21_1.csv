Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Truly fantastic
","I have seen both Sherlock Holmes movies, and have read many of the S.H books, and I find all of them fantastic, anyone who argues with the ingenious of this movie stating it's *Not Holmes* is naive. S.H a game of shadows is meant to put a twist on the classic Sherlock Holmes and bring us something to entertain us and enthrall us with Holmes' surely style, and this movie does just that, be open to new ideas and you will love the modern action hero Sherly. The special effects, the action sequences, the mind entrancing thought process needed to engage yourself in the mystery, and the connection between the characters, mainly between S.H and Dr. Watson is just amazing and deep, you can feel the brother like experience that the two of them share. Once again, great movie, a must see for any fan of S.H",10,1,3,13 June 2012
