Skyfall," Lazy!!
","I enjoyed the film, typical James Bond, but the director/writers could have made more effort to let the film make sense(I know James Bond films are fantasy but at my age I would like them to at least scan). I feel the film was based round the set pieces without regard to 'realisme'. Istanbul, London, Shanghai, Macau, Hashima Island, Scotland. I did think about pointing out all the 'daftness', UK agents in charge of NATO lists in a NATO country etc, but I will limit myself to pointing out Bond needing to dig out the bullet that shot him to find out that it was radioactive and only three 'mercenaries' use that type of bullet( would we not have carried out autopsies on the dead agents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). Scipting needs to be better in future, very lazy this time!!",Null,4,9,12 October 2013
