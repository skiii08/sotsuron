Source Code," Errr I guess OK?
","The movie was good for a pop corn night, or to kill your time if you have nothing better to do. According to my expectations it was kinda what I suspected, although I am sure I will not remember much of it tomorrow. Sadly, it is a reproduction of many movies like 12 monkeys, Deja Vu, Butterfly Effect etc etc etc etc. So it delivers nothing new, but at least the acting is good. The story is a bit boring too and it is obvious from the beginning that the guy is not where he thinks he is. But overall, I did not feel sorry for watching it, but I am not thrilled either. So I guess that makes it an OK movie. I would suggest DVD rental.",5,4,8,3 April 2011
