The Blair Witch Project," Don't Go Into the Woods
","I went and saw this alone but if I hadn't gone in the afternoon I would have had to ask an usher to walk me back to my car.  I was that creeped out.  It tells the story of three filmmakers who go into the forest intending to dispel one small town's version of the bogey-man.  But they never come back and this footage is all that is found.  When will Hollywood learn that special effects mean nothing compared to the power of the human imagination. Not seeing a single thing brings all of your old child haunts back to life. Enthralling and very, very scary.",9,1,1,8 September 1999
The English Patient," A Plum Plum
",I only went to see this movie because my friend recommended it and wanted to see it again.  I soon understood why.  Incredible scenery coupled with one of my favorite music scores make this piece stunning even without its storyline and high quality acting.  Don't be swayed from the nay-sayers or the ones who believe that it was just a bunch of hype.  There is a reason this film cleaned up at the Oscars despite it's lack of 'Hollywoodism.'  If you have even an ounce of romance in your soul you have to see this movie of star-crossed lovers.,10,2,5,9 September 1999
Footloose," Dance Machine
",City boy moves to small town and doesn't fit in.  A film based on the same old story that follows the same old lines yet somehow manages to make you enjoy.  Nothing new happens in this movie but you will watch with a smile on your face (especially during Kev's big drinking/dancing scene.)  A great representation of what an 80s flick is all about.,8,22,41,8 September 1999
Armageddon," Brain Bomb
","This movie is silly and loud, asking viewers to suspend their brain action completely while they watch.  I'm all for a good fantasy but ones that are based on some sort of thought process.  The simple fact that the people chosen to save earth from a date with a comet are a group of oil drillers with no space experience is just the major problem in a film filled with unlikely happenings.  A better asteroid bet is 'Deep Impact.'  Don't bother with this one unless you are a huge action fan or your TV option is the Olsen twins.",2,0,1,8 September 1999
The Red Violin," A Note Above the Rest
","Like an orchestral maneuver this movie winds around you until you are caught up in its glory and powerless to escape its emotional intensity.  It is wonderful.  The film follows the path of a violin through the years as it makes its way through five different stories and many different lives. Unfortunately the transitions are not always smooth so you must pay attention but it is oh, so worth it.  A moving piece of cinematic excellence.",Null,0,0,27 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Thrilling Surprise
","What a wonderful treat to walk into a movie expecting nothing and come away seeing one of the best films of the year.  I expected little seeing as Bruce Willis was the star and although he does a fine job it is the young boy, Haley Joel Osmond, who steals this show.  He sends shivers up the back of your neck with just his eyes.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  You just have to see it for yourself.",9,0,0,8 September 1999
