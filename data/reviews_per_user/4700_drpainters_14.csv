Angels & Demons," Interesting and at least it's 30mins shorter then da Vinci code
","Was decent enough. Sure it's all ridiculous but it's at least quicker paced then the first movie and 30mins shorter. Looking at this series as the adult version of national treasure, just tracking ludicrous clues left around at different tourist destinations.",7,0,0,18 November 2019
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Alice just didn't get her groove on her.
",Movie just never really got a great groove. Has some great scenes and per my review for the fifth installment 420 + 3d makes this an amazing experience. But I would still rank as the 2nd.worst ahead of just the 2nd movie.,7,2,2,27 August 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," There's birds ! Like more then a usual amount.
","Steps it back up with some great random b actors (Johnny cage mortal Kombat anyone) and solid action. I'd rate this as the 4th best in the franchise. Good villain, cool zombie scenes and some good deaths.",7,4,5,27 August 2019
Underworld Awakening," From Shakespeare to Gorey action
","The first 3 are all pretty dramatic romance Shakespeareesque action movies. All very similar in style . This one is much more like the resident evil movies but underworld ( I prefer resident evil movies, so just fine). So you may not like it if you enjoyed the first 3 for their tone n style.",6,0,0,24 April 2020
Yesterday," Solid , tad long maybe
","Solid original story . Well acted, directed. You won't regret seeing it and the music is great of course. Just felt like it was a bit longer then needed. Otherwise.worth a watch and recommend",7,0,0,11 September 2019
Resident Evil," I just freaking love these movies
","All the talk of no females in movies but you have these and underworlds. Critics just slam them though rather then enjoy for what they are, ridiculous action/horror movies . That become more cheesy and 3d as they go along . Series even has enough of an ending. Love watching all these through and 3d copies are a bonus.",8,9,11,23 August 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Fun but least favorite of them
","It's got some good scenes but overall I find this to be the weakest and least entertaining. It's not terrible just not my favorite, but it's not like I'm gonna skip it when I rebinge the series (like I do with matrix 3, X-Men last stand, Terminator 3... You get the point)",6,0,4,27 August 2019
Midsommar," It's all well and good but I wouldn't watch again or recommend
","Cinematography, lead actress was solid, slow burn movie that gets weird, then weirder. But 2hr30min runtime would mean I don't go back and not good enough to recommend at that length either.",7,0,1,3 October 2019
Saw," First is excellent.
","First is excellent must see horror thriller. 2&3 are ok, but not close to as good. And 4-7 have some of the cheesiest main actors but are kind of cheesy/stupid with an ongoing storyline that keeps you watching. I enjoyed 4 the most out of all sequels I think.",8,0,2,30 December 2019
Don't Breathe," So darn good n tense
","Def worth a watch. Very tense and scary movie, not really bloody. Would highly recommend and one I own on Blu-ray",8,0,1,20 March 2020
The Green Mile," As good as it gets
","As good a movie as your going to find. Story, acting, directing everything is just down as well as it could. Only issue which isn't even that noticeable is the 3+hr runtime. Pacing is good enough that you don't really notice but it is a long comittment to watch.",9,0,1,30 November 2019
Midway," Meh, wouldn't rewatch.
","It's okay, cgi is very meh for a big budget film. Don't like how they have characters seemingly enjoying and having fun being at war, disrespectful to all the soldiers who did serve. Wouldn't rewatch or recommend. Kind of drags despite a ton of action.",6,2,3,20 February 2020
Pineapple Express," One of my fave stoner movies
","Between this n Harold n Kumar. I watch each once a year, both are hilarious. This has more of a story/plot to follow do I would likely give this the edge.",9,0,0,1 February 2020
Windtalkers," Good enough
","Lots of action scenes. Isn't overly well written or directed , but is good enough to watch. Should of had more drama around Ben (beach) and gone more into the code development or working on it. Just about nic cage dealing with minor infrequent ptsd and the generic slowly realizing that the Navajo characters aren't so different from their white counterparts.",6,1,1,11 November 2019
