The New World," Why is the title not Pocahontas
","This movie should be titled Pocahontas. It's long and boring Love story. Like Romeo and Juliet, but then more boring. This is to blame due to the long silent parts when Mr Smith and Pocahontas are together. This miss title fouled me in to believing this was something it was not. Making it an real disappointment. And boring or did I make that already clear. The problem withe the story is, if Pocahontas was known as the native princes why din't she come with Mr Smith to England?? Or why din't he stay with her??? if they where so in love.... and why did she stay so loyal to him after finding out he was still alive?? He left her and din't come back the foul... The OK part is the natives there story how their culture was far more compassion full then the European counter.",4,2,7,28 January 2006
Inside Man," Great bank robing movie
","This is one one of the best scam/heist type of movies. You could really tell this a Spike Lee movie, all the black and white reverence's. Spike lee did a good job, this and 25th hour are his best work. The story is good you get a lot off hints but not enough to spoil it for you. There are a few plot twist as expected of this type of film. And the jokes are great of course the hole black white thing makes it more funny, it speaks to all people.Well I don't want to make Spike Lee in to a great director he has his faults. In this film is the shot of Denzel running to the bank but he is not running effect(* is badly done, at least I din't like it. It was the only trippy effect in the movie, so it was not expected. And thats the only thing that was not solid, like the rest of the movie. The plot solid, actors solid, Spike solid. So thats why I gave it an 8.*(if you have a better name for this type of shot please let correct me)",8,1,1,27 April 2006
V for Vendetta," To political
","To tell you the truth I was expecting a bad ass action flick, but it turned in to a political message that you could not escape even if you want too. It was put on so thick that you wanted to rebel against this movie. The dialog was OK but in the end the where so many question asked I got tired. based on the little action and the message it's an OK movie. but it din't blow me away like The Matrix.... But what I did like was how the story was changed to today's problem with government.... Not that anybody will start a revolution.... Hugo Weaving did a great job it's really hard to act when you can't use you face.",8,1,3,11 April 2006
