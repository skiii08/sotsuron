The New World," Ethereal meditation on the birth of a nation and the nature of love.
","Ethereal meditation on the birth of a nation and the nature of love. Beautifully scripted, acted, and shot. Terence Malick is a genius and, selfishly, I wish he'd make more movies. This movie won't make much money and I ask people who like it to support it--tell your friends--and the seemingly endless line of talented people who are eager to work with Malick. World-class actors, producers and other money people, cinematographers and sound people realize his unique talent. Why can't a broader audience? Oh well, if you like this movie and haven't seen THE THIN RED LINE, DAYS OF HEAVEN, or BADLANDS, get the DVDs. Better yet, check for them/request them at your local college, film society, museum or whatever and try to see them on a big screen.",10,5,12,1 January 2006
