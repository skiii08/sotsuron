Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg pulls it off
","Steven Spielberg shows why he is the most important director in Hollywood. Not just anybody takes over a project with 'Trash' written all over it, and makes a very good movie out of it.'Catch me if you can' is a very enjoyable film that you can watch over and over again. I believe I'm one of the few that thinks Leonardo Dicaprio can be a good actor when he puts his mind to it. And although this is not the case, I must say that this is one of the few movies in which I don't find him annoying. Tom Hanks also proves his quality with an excellent performance in a supporting role, although it never felt right Hanks doing a goofy second to Dicaprio. Another great addition was Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr. He doesn't have as much screen time as Dicaprio or Hanks, but makes a strong background character that helps the audience understand Dicaprio's character. I think the film's biggest plus is being a real-life story. I don't know how much of Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life has been changed for the script, but no matter how different it is, the story is believable, except for making Dicaprio a 17 year-old, c'mon!. I think somebody hit the jackpot when they looked at Abagnale's adventures and said 'Hey, somebody should make a movie about him'.Spielberg made a great last minute save with this film. I just can't imagine it being a good movie with Gandolfini as Carl Harranty and Verbinsky directing it. Spielberg + Hanks can never fail. I'm just glad Dicaprio didn't ruin it for us all.",8,0,1,22 March 2003
The Ring," Worth watching... just barely
","A videotape that kills people when they watch it. *sigh* All right...The argument of the story sounds somewhat intriguing and the first sequence of the movie makes you think you're going to have a hard time trying to sleep that night. Well, I for one didn't.As the storyline develops the whole videotape business goes down the trash and the movie slowly turns into a 'What lies beneath' or 'The sixth sense' kind of film. I didn't like that one bit. By the end of the movie, and specially in the last sequence, you have to remind yourself 'Oh yeah, the tape! That's what this was all about!'. In short, the movie weakens itself progressively and finally collapses, just to have a little spark of life in that 'last confrontation' scene. Still, the very ending, in my humble opinion, is nothing short of dumb. And Naomi Watts' performance doesn't help the story much either. It's just not convincing.I think the movie is worth watching for two main reasons:<ul><li>The videotape itself gives you goose bumps. As they say in the movie, it's something you'd only see in a nightmare. - The 'last confrontation' I mentioned earlier contain some of the scariest images you'll see in any movie. The director chose many of those shots so that they would look like an individual point of view, and that has a big impact when you're alone in your room watching TV. But then again, most of this new wave of thriller movie directors do the same.</li></ul>Aside from this two sequences the movie does not contribute anything to the genre. Recent movies like 'The sixth sense', 'The others' or 'Signs' have a much bigger impact on the audience using only the atmosphere built throughout the film and a few carefully selected shots and sounds; they don't rely in visual FX: just good directors and good performances.

Minority Report," Goooood Sci-Fi
","What could you expect from Steven Spielberg besides an intelligent well-done film? 'Minoriy Report' is just that. Plus, it has the intensity of Tom Cruise's performance. If you ask me, it's a good mix.The story is not that convincing though. Crimes being stopped before they happen. Hmmm. I was not so fond to the idea of humans being able to predict when and how a murder was going to happen. When I heard of the movie I thought it was gonna be like an enormous organic computer to calculate probabilities, give results and never miss. Anyway, the point is: police has now a window for peeking into the future.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the top cop of this department who has unlimited faith in this system; he dedicates his whole life to it since he lost his son and wife. But his faith is torn apart when the system turns against him. And the running starts...I think what I liked the most of 'Minority Report' was Spielberg's vision of the future. It almost makes perfect sense (then again, except for the infamous pre-cogs): personalized advertising, eye scanners, 3D home videos, etc. Now THIS I call science fiction. I don't think I could have bared to see it under Paul Verhoeven's eye (originally, he was to direct the movie).The whole look of the movie is fantastic. Unlike his 'compadre' George Lucas, Spielberg does not show off with visual effects in every frame of the movie. They are there alright, but he manages to blend the SFX with the background so nicely, your eyes take them as a whole. There's also that blurry look we saw in 'A.I.' that makes it feel like you're dreaming of it.There's this one other thing: the ending. Is it just me or this ending is just as bad as 'A.I.''s? I mean, in 'A.I.' they could just have put 'THE END' when David finally reaches his Blue Fairy and close a very good movie. I feel the same happens here, but go see for yourself. Maybe it IS just me.",8,0,0,25 August 2002
The Rookie," 2 for the price of 1
","Following Disney's purest tradition, 'The Rookie' tells a story of hope and believing in yourself.This film is actually a two-in-one combo. The first half is the story of the bad (baseball) team that, through some hard work and inspiration from their coach, come all the way from behind to win the championship. This movie we have seen tons of times ('Hardball', 'Mighty Ducks', 'Little Giants', etc, etc.). There are very few references to the Jimmy Morris tale during this first half.The second half is all about Jimmy Morris and his struggle to pursue a long lost dream: become a major league baseball player. He is driven to gain self-confidence, hope and ultimately courage to take a shot at his dream; even when he's old enough to be retiring from instead of entering professional baseball. On the other hand, he has a family to take care of and a decent job he would be turning down to go after a potential lost cause.All in all I think this movie is a story of courage. It takes lots of it to go after something you forgot you wanted more than anything; that and a very supporting family. The fact that this is a true story makes this point even more significant.The movie itself may seem a little bit too long for it's purpose, specially the first half which didn't need so much detail, but it takes its message across well enough.",7,1,1,16 November 2002
Insomnia," Gotta love this one
","Insomnia isn't your average serial-killer story. It's better.There are several elements in this movie that makes it work:<ul><li>First of all, the storyline. It's intriguing; it deals with guilt, lies and the desire for (impossible) redemption. The plot doesn't center in finding who the killer is or who is gonna be his next victim, that is pretty much clear when you see the trailer. No, the plot revolves around the cop having his prey in his hands but not being able to turn him in or finish him off.</li></ul><ul><li>The performances. The oscar-winning trio make the best out of the script. Pacino, Williams and Swank are perfectly cast and give the best performances I've seen this year. Al Pacino and Robin Williams prove that they can do a role far different than what they're used to. Williams has the potential to do a memorable villain. Let's see what he's up to in the years to come.</li></ul><ul><li>Directing and cinematography. Boy, Christopher Nolan achieves to picture a place where you actually can't sleep. This little town is a dark, creepy place although the sun never sets. Also, through out the movie Nolan depicts quite well that awful feeling you get when you haven't had any sleep.</li></ul>I loved this movie. Please, don't think of it as a 'Seven' or 'The bone collector' type of film. It's smarter than that. I tell you this because on my way out of the theater I heard a couple saying 'Ah, I thought it had more action, I almost fell asleep...'. Oh please! You want to see cheap entertainment? Go see Resident Evil or whatever. Leave the seats for those of us who appreciate a very good movie.",9,0,0,23 June 2002
We Were Soldiers," War movie with a simple plot
","I have not too much to say about this movie because I felt the movie didn't have to much to say. It's the depiction of a combat held in Vietnam by Hal Moore's company. And that's about it.Yes, there's the whole brave-soldiers, american-honor message in it, but I just don't think the movie takes that message across. I stick to 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Black Hawk Down' (in that order) as my favorite war movies. Now those are movies that say a lot.The thing that kept me from rating this movie with a 7 was the technical achievement of it. The sound is superb and the whole photography is amazing.As with 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Black Hawk Down' the level of realism of 'We were soldiers' is a little bit over the edge. Maybe film makers are trying new ways to describe the horror and madness that the soldiers are put through. I say we will never fully understand what, and why, these men experience on the battlefield, no matter how real the film looks.",8,1,2,16 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The all-digital cinema begins
","Well, I'm a Star Wars fan. I think it's going to be a long time before we see another set of movies so imaginative and captivating. Overall, I think Episode I and II are the two most spectacular films of the last 15 years.But I won't try convincing everyone of you to think like I do. That's not the purpose of this space, although most of the users do not seem to realize this. Besides, so much (good and bad) has been said about this movie that I would only say 'I agree with this', 'I don't agree with that'. By the way, have you noticed that all the bad reviews of Episode II look like a 'copy & paste' from another one?I wrote a full review of this movie but it got too long for me to put in here. So if there's one single soul in this planet curious about it, please e-mail me! Let me tell you about the Titanic-effect, the strange ratings for movies of this kind and the reason of StarWars-mania.Here I want to talk about the all-digital-cinema tendency. I didn't write this until I saw 'Attack of the clones' a couple of times in a traditional projector and in a digital one.Episode II was filmed entirely with digital cameras. That means in a few words: no quality loss all the way from shooting to projection (if using a digital projector). This you can clearly see in the digital projection right from the beginning of the movie: the Star Wars title and the space background have never looked so good before. You can almost feel the textures of every skin, cloth, ship or wall. There are dozens of wide shots of the different planets in these movies; with a digital projector these shots look dazzling. There is so much detail in the movie you can go crazy trying to get all of the action going on. Unlike in Disney's 'Atlantis', I didn't observe any 'pixelation' whatsoever in the entire movie. If the industry can improve the resolution to these cameras, then there will be no contest: digital cameras will take over filmmaking.A much different subject is the digital visual effects. Let's go back to 'Jurassic Park' or 'Terminator 2'. That was the first time we ever looked at the most realistic T-Rex and liquid metal assassin in the history of movies. From that point it looked like digital FX would just keep getting better and better. 'The Phantom Menace' took the visual FX to the limit, just as the first 'Star Wars' did in 1977. Personally, I didn't expect any less. The movie was a beautiful thing to look at.But then came the time when you were not so sure. Movies like 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' and 'Spider-man' really got me questioning myself: 'Is all-digital the way to go?' Now that I've seen 'Attack of the clones' I think my answer is definitely 'No'. Don't get me wrong: 'Attack of the clones' is another state-of-the-art SFX movie but it just doesn't look as great as 'The phantom menace'. I agree that there are some shots that are either too difficult or impossible to do without using digital effects, and having someone like George Lucas in the director's chair, well, you just have to figure out how to come up with something realistic. Examples of these are the speeder chase through Coruscant and the final lightsaber duel with Count Dooku; both look great and they look even better in a digital projector.Still, there are some other sequences that could have been better looking doing things the traditional way. I still don't know why all of the clone troopers are CGI's when they could have used plain old costumes or why put 'digital makeup' to the Jedi children when many of the other character's make up is so great. When you see the interior of the Jedi Temple you might think they selected the realism level of the rendering to 'Cartoonish'. This movie is full of those contrasts: you can see landscapes or creatures so realistic that you don't even notice they're computer generated, and you can see 'virtual sets' so false that you can't help wondering if the Rancor in 'Return of the Jedi' looked any more inserted.I hope that digital effects improve their realism level and that someday they can complement the overall SFX of a movie, along with animatronics, puppets, optical tricks, real sets and some other of the old stuff, just like in 'The Phantom Menace' or 'Lord of the Rings'. I think they can coexist to make the best SFX movie yet.",10,0,0,13 July 2002
The Bourne Identity," A very good spy movie
","There aren't too many spy movies like this, in which the hero is not the James Bond type who's going to save the world from the ultimate super-villain.Matt Damon portrays Jason Bourne (one of his many identities), a regular guy who lost his memory and is about to discover he's a genuine lethal weapon. He fights not to prevent the villain to take over the world, but to regain his memory, to find out his true identity and, in the process, change his previous way of life. All he has to do now is avoid the other agents trained like himself trying to eliminate him.I liked this movie very much. The addition of Franka Potente to it was a really nice plus. And seeing the whole story staged in Europe was a very nice change from L.A. and New York. But the main reason I liked it so much is Matt Damon's performance. He's one the rightful heirs of future Hollywood. He's shown that he can play any character convincingly, even when the role is a Van Damme type of character.The action is good, the suspense is good, the chasings are good, the performances are good. Just go see it.",8,2,2,16 November 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Lots of fun but still forgettable
","I keep wondering: Where is Disney going? There was a time when each movie they made was as good or better than the one before, namely 'The little mermaid', 'The Beauty and the Beast', 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King'. That era is certainly over. They even used these for 'Lilo & Stitch' advertising campaign.'Lilo & Stitch' is 85 minutes of fun, kids and adults will like it just as any other of the last Disney movies, and as such is nowhere near becoming a memorable film like the other movies I mentioned. That's what I think Disney is missing. The best animation movies since 'The Lion King' that came out under the Disney label were all Pixar's productions: the 'Toy Story' movies, 'A bug's life' and 'Monsters Inc.'.Maybe the original idea was to make a movie about a character that was completely different than any other they've made before. I think that idea got lost in the way. From the trailers and advertising we got the impression that Stitch was going to be next to Bart Simpson as the most mischievous cartoon character of all, but it turned out to be a lot more subtle. What kept them?I'm beginning to think that Disney will not be on the vanguard of animation again for a long time and instead will be following Dreamworks' steps. Too bad.",7,1,2,6 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As grand as the 'Fellowship'
","Just as its predecessor, 'The Two Towers' is a major scale film, very well executed and performed. I don't think I can call it a sequel, since it was simultaneously filmed along with parts I and III of the trilogy.Just under three hours long, the movie picks up right where we left in 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Frodo and Sam are on their painstaking way to Mordor and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to catch up with the Uruk-Hai that took Pippin and Merry as prisoners. Enter Gollum, the Riders of Rohan and Treebeard, the new characters that play an essential part, each on their own, in the whole trilogy.I was looking forward to see this movie ever since I was captivated by the first installment of the trilogy. I hadn't read any of the books by that time, but the story caught me so much, I just couldn't wait another year to know what happened to Frodo. I think that's the main difference between my perception of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers'. To be honest I felt that the first film was too long the first time I saw it, but when I finished the book and saw it again I felt it was too short.Now, having read the book twice, I feel that 'The Two Towers' is just a little bit too long, and I think I have a very good reason to do so: chapters 8-11 of book III and 7-10 of book IV were simply cut out and  and replaced with many other battle sequences, like the attack of the orcs on the people of Rohan on their way to Helm's Deep, many flashback and dream sequences, and others I won't tell to avoid spoiling it for you. This certainly will benefit the third film 'The Return of the King' as it will contain many more action sequences than the book describes (and I agree it needs them instead of such a long epilogue), but 'Alas!' it made me mad having to wait another year to see them. And since those chapters are left out, the whole movie concentrates on the grand finale of the Battle of Helm's Deep. Did you think the first battle sequence of 'Saving Private Ryan' was long? Think again.Leaving this aside, the movie is a very good adaptation from the book. I'm amazed by the way Peter Jackson's vision brought the story and its characters from the books to the film. All the places and landscapes are everything I had pictured in my mind. I was so anxious to see Gollum and Treebeard come to life, and I got more than I expected. In fact, despite the disadvantage of being a digital character, Gollum's performance is the one that makes the most lasting impression in this movie (and perhaps the three of them). Just like Frodo, you feel pity for the little guy. Awesome voice performing by Andy Serkis combined with flawless animation. Also, kudos to Frances Walsh for her screenplay adaptation. It's no easy task writing a linear story from a book that goes forward and backward in time so abruptly.I have to see it again two or three more times to make an honest vote about it. I thought 9 at first, but that's just because I missed Shelba so much. I guess you guys that had read the books before felt the same way about Tom Bombadil (although she's not out at all, no my precious, just delayed...).Now bring on the Extended Edition on DVD! I want to see Treebeard's home, the complete battle with the Balrog, more Merry and Pippin! One year is too long to wait for 'The Return of the King'!",9,0,0,21 December 2002
Men in Black II," Just another summer movie
","I enjoyed 'Men in Black' when it came out in 1997 because it was a story I had never seen before: a quick simple story about a secret government agency who protects earth from dangerous extraterrestrials.I don't think 'Men in Black II' was such a good idea. Yeah, OK, they got a few millions more in their pocket, but the story was better as a stand-alone. Now they are a pair of so-so movies.In MIB-2 Will Smith takes the role of the pro and Tommy Lee Jones the role of the rookie during the first half of the story. Neither did a good job. I thought that Tommy Lee Jones was gonna be the reason worth to see the movie, but I was wrong. He's just not the type of actor who plays second to a Will Smith.As in the first movie, the visual effects are awful but the music is superb. This sequel is more of a comedy than the first one, you get a good laugh.As one film critic said on the radio 'When the best part of a movie is a talking dog, there's something wrong going with it'.",7,0,0,18 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Potter got Better
","There are just a few sequels out there that turned out to be better than the first, and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is one of them.While keeping a lot from the 'Sorcerer's Stone' in terms of casting (fortunately), pacing and humor, 'the Chamber of Secrets' is a much darker film. It depicts a more threatening and dangerous Hogwarts; a place in which you could actually die if you're not careful.The overall performance is also better, if just a little bit over the top, which actually helps narrate a more complicated story to the children (for whom this movie is intended). Jason Isaacs and Kenneth Branagh were great additions to an already great cast.The first film had very poor computer-generated visual effects, particularly noticeable in the Quiditch game sequence. Well, it seems that the FX department went through a lot of work to improve the look for 'The chamber of secrets'. The perfect example is Dobby, one of the three major digital characters of 2002 (along with Yoda and Gollum).In general, almost every aspect of the film is better than its predecessor, except for one thing: the 'Scooby-Doo' feeling of it got stronger this time. Since I haven't finished the book, I can't say for sure if this is the screenplay's or the book's fault. It's a very childish end to a not so childish movie. You know what I mean, the 'Ha ha ha, I'm so very evil that I'm going to tell you all the details of my plan for taking over the world so that you can thwart it once you escape from my ellaborate death scenario while I laugh and say, for no particular reason, sarcastic-evil phrases out of the air' scene. No, that was not Dr. Evil speaking, just the bad guy in 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' (hmmm, maybe they are related).I hope our paisano Alfonso Cuaron does an even better job for 'The Prisoner of Azkaban'. If things keep going this way the 'Harry Potter' saga will be worth having both in the books and DVD.",8,0,0,8 February 2003
Signs," Suspense the way it was meant to be
","I have to admit it: M. Night Shyamalan is becoming the new master of suspense. He has already proved it with 'The sixth sense', but now with 'Signs' it looks like he's bringing his skills to perfection. The tension goes from zero to infinity in a perfect pace during the movie. I honestly didn't expect 'Signs' to be that scary from what I saw in the trailer, but fortunately I was completely wrong. Many think that 'The sixth sense' is Shyamalan's master piece, but I say it's still to come.In 'Signs' we get to see, finally, a non-psychotic Mel Gibson without a gun. He plays now a very peaceful, and depressed, ex-priest Graham Hess who has lost his faith. He lives with his two children and his brother Merrill played nicely by Joaquin Phoenix. The three of them bring the necessary (and almost too many) comic reliefs to the movie. You have to have a laugh between those moments of sheer terror. Moments that are mainly created by your imagination; it's the typical 'Oh no, don't go in there! Run! No, not that way! What's going to happen now?!'. This is the type of movie that doesn't work in a TV. You need to be surrounded by a crowd ready to wet their pants and, most importantly, you need the sound of a cinema theater: the movie relies a lot on the sound FX to build up the tension (something I really loved). What I did not like about the movie is that in the end it's not about giant circles in crop fields, and it's not about alien invasions; it's all about father Graham and his faith. I think that's the reason I see so many plot holes, which I will not mention here; I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen this movie... and have actually read this review. Bottom line: Very good suspense movie, but aliens and priests? Not a combo I liked.",8,0,1,16 September 2002
Gangs of New York," The 'Bill The Butcher' movie
","I went to see the long awaited 'Gangs of New York' not knowing what to expect. When I got out of the theater I was filled with a sense of peace not because the movie portrayed it, but because it showed the other way around.
'Gangs of New York' is a movie about open war; about defeating your enemy by any means necessary, about going into battle when everything else has failed and you realize killing the other is the only way. The movie shows a place with no law but the street law, no order but the order the gangs establish; a place where violence is the common language. This is a city in which the strong survives and the weak is massacred (it reminds me of today's Tepito, Mexico City). And in the midst of chaos there is still room for honor, loyalty and love.Martin Scorsese has done a great job transporting us to this dreadful city. Once again I have to (painfully) admit that there is no need for computer graphics to make a time and place, such as XIX century's New York city, come alive. I guess it is much easier for actors to be in character in a place they can see and touch. It also demonstrates that you don't have to be extremely explicit in your shots to achieve a sense of animal violence.Daniel Day-Lewis and the rest of the actors did an excellent job, with the possible exception of Cameron Diaz. Leonardo DiCaprio has proved again that he can be not-annoying when he wants to. After this movie and 'Catch me if you can' I wonder if he's only good when he's sharing the screen with a REALLY good actor, like Daniel Day-Lewis or Tom Hanks.And speaking of Daniel Day-Lewis, HE IS AWESOME! His performance is the best of 2002-2003 and probably the best I'll ever see in years. Thanks to his portrayal, Bill 'The butcher' has made it into the list of the best villains in the history of cinema; right up there with guys like Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. He's the face of pure undying evil. He's the most powerful guy around, he knows it too well and he will use it against you -personally- if you ever cross his path. I absolutely loved him. I think he is the trademark of the whole movie; I imagine a future conversation like this: -'Hey, what was the name of that movie with Bill The Butcher in it?' - 'You mean Gangs of New York?' - 'Oh yes, that's it'.There is one other thing I noticed about the structure of the storyline. It would seem it was based on a three-act play, the first being from the beginning to Amsterdam meeting Bill the Butcher, the second from their meeting to the betrayal and separation and the third from the separation to the end. Each act has its own climax and the pacing of the movie becomes very slow, and sometimes too slow, in the transitions between them.The only thing this movie lacked for me to rate it a 9 is a good ending. Me, like many other people I know despised the ending, or at least didn't understand it at all. I liked the very last shot though. The one with that beautiful view of the evolution of New York City.'Gangs of New York' is a must-see. Go see Daniel Day-Lewis in the performance of a lifetime.",8,1,2,29 March 2003
