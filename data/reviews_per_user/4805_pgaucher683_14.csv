Blade Runner 2049," I've missed Roy until I found Love.
","I agree with Peterfaure's review here because I'm a fan of R.Scott and Blade Runner is one of his masterpieces, so when they started talking about a sequel, R.Scott was mandatory of course, instead they chose D.Villeneuve, as a Canadian, I was delighted and I was also worried.From my point of view, (I watched Blade runner once a year since its release), D.Villeneuve did his own masterpiece, I mean, what R.Scott's BR 2019 could have been with today's technology,
D.Villeneuve has developed his own vision in the Scott universe, you know immediately where you are and the story is catching up in the opening as you imagine Dekard and Rachel driving away to this place (if you've already admitted that the sunny weather and the forest at the end was one of the unicorns in the 1st).If I'm not a big fan of Ryan Gosling, I have to say, here, from his recent movies where he's still this guy without expression, except sometimes, a burst of anger, found his purpose;
As a replicant he is subtle enough to display emotions due to his memory implants, he lives with a hologram, Joi (Ana de Harmas) but instead of an anti-hero like H.Ford / Deckard, it's just KD6 / 3.7, a tool, another human face, used by the LAPD to track down older products like D.Bautista (which deserve more important roles) in the first few minutes;
Morton is not a 'Roy', 'replicants' these days' have found a way to live far from civilization until the end, until you meet love (S.Hoeks) she is as beautiful, ... smart and perfect as Rachel was, but also ruthless and mortal as Roy was too, as K. says, 'if he has named you, you must be special!'Wallace (J.Lehto) is the new technology. guru, the Creator, since Tyrell died long ago leaving a legacy of Nexus more human than human, seeking the definitive Path of Life in his children, probably 99% an AI himself, will give Love the full power to find the inconceivable.
Lt.Joshi (R.Wright) and K found a body in a hidden crate at the bottom of Morton's farm that can destroy the thin balance between human and AI, in fact, Tyrell was a genius because the human remains in this box. are of a woman who gave birth and she has a serial number.The recent suites play a lot on nostalgia, who as a fan was not happy to see Han Solo pass the Millenium Falcon door?
Here is the same feeling, at least for me, seeing Deckard (H.Ford) face to face with another Blade runner was the end of a 35+ years wait, Harrison Ford does not make an appearance in as a guest and of course reinforce the wonderful cast all the way to the end.
Well, even though I've missed a lot of Roy's poetry (Rutger Hauer), a strong musical score like Vangelis did, you'll have everything, a soundscape, a dark atmosphere and ... time, D.Villeneuve took the time to install his story and it is a movie, I will recommend for sure, it's a must.
The coolest thing for me is that I can and I will watch BR 2019 and then 2049 right after, because:
if only all the sequel were that good.",10,2,10,4 February 2018
Lone Survivor," war movie at it's best
","if I was younger, I will go to the Seal training, it's hell, and not everybody can go through but after this movie I wanted to sign in even more.the movie is about a small part of Red Wings Op. but, not the easiest one, far from it and the only thing which bothers me is, why they didn't tie up the 3 guys then get the call or tried until they find a place high enough and someone says ''yep, we will be there in 20 min to pick you up'', released the 3 Muslims after ward, will never knowthis is one of the best since Black Hawk Down, all the cast gives a superb performance and there are the stunts which are unbelievable, they (the real Seals) should have died almost 10 times before finally being shot down. It was a great story to tell, about cool, committed and proud people, the cherry on the cake is P. Berg, who did a stunning job as always, if you've liked the Kingdom you will adore this movie like I do, I've seen it many times now and still goodwell it's a must watch",9,0,1,30 June 2015
Interstellar," a Milestone for Nolan brothers, do you know how love can be so powerful
","I wanted to make a new review, my previous one was nothing but crapi've watched Interstellar 4 times already, i like the Nolan brothers, they are prolific, of course they have been influenced by others, but i don't think they are plagiarism period! from Memento to Inception or the best Batman's sequel ever made, they are simply great.I didn't like 2001 (S,Kubrick)for instance, but i absolutely loved Solaris with G,Clooney, Interstellar is the story of this single man who's living with his stepfather (john Lithgow) his children and love them as every father does, except Murph , they are connected together, more than with Tom who is really down to earth, Cooper was a NASA pilot and engineer once, now a farmer in a close future where Earth is dying, the 15 first minutes are about this father and his kids, chasing a drone to get some spare parts and it's really there that start a incredible journey, at this very moment , Hans Zimmer take the lead with one of the most beautiful and powerful score ever made for a Sci-Fi movie, the last time i've felt that , it was the one by Vangelis for Blade Runner,I've loved every second of this movie, Matthew McConaughey is outstanding so are the others, young Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) is incredible, she reminds me of Dakota Fanning who was one of the greatest child actors (I am Sam, War of the worlds, Man on Fire), they will discover together an anomaly which will lead them to a facility where Professor Brand (Sir Michael Caine) and his daughter (Anne Hathaway) try to save mankind, Cooper as an ex NASA pilot is very welcome but was it an accident, how did he found this place,? who told him? He will have to take one of his most important decision as a father, leaving Murphy and Tom who are young but also as a human being, fly a spaceship through a black hole to visit 3 worlds which could be the next planet for us,they spent 3 hours on the first world, (23 years on earth), imagine how Cooper feels, when is listening his messages, Murphy (Jessica Chastain), Tom (Casey Affleck) are adult now and it's absolutely brilliant, but they'll face a greater threat when they'll wake up professor Man (Matt Damon) and discover a terrible secret i will remember this film for ever , it's a masterpiece, one of the best movie ever, watch it as soon as you can",10,2,6,25 May 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," splendid
","i've seen the 1st one because like everybody, i was a huge fan of the comics, in 2000 it was a pretty amazing movie, the others sequel, well...never mind.with a rate of 8.1, i can't miss right?, i almost said to myself ''what happen?? they've made a other good one for once'' and wow, it's the best sequel ever made, what a great movie here, the story is really well made, going back to the seventies to stop a war against the mutants, cool, enjoy the ride;They send Wolverine in the past with a simple mission, team up with Charles and Magneto to stop Mystic who wants to kill Dr Trask (P.Dinklage who is superb ). The man has invented a device which can reveal if a mutant is around, he also builds a new weapon, the Sentinel to kill them. these sentinels are destroying Mutants, but also all human who is related with or will be.Well, the biggest treat is, if she kills the Dr. she is imprisoned and her DNA allows of transformed Sentinels, who are at war... 50 years later! reminds me a bit of Terminator Judgment day. It's way better than a new sequel called ''genesis or 1st class''no?, First class was.. just good and too long! you can see them young as well in this one^^ OK it aimed of settled the newcomers:J.McAvoy (Charles) is definitely the best cast as a 70's Charles, now a disappointed man who is a junkie (kind of) to get his leg back and free his mind.M.Fassbender (Magneto/eric)is brilliant as well, a mutant tried to kill J.F Kennedy really? no he was one of ours!J. Lawrence, alright, she's hype and one of the best actress of her generation (I like her very much, believe me) but, I don't know if it's because I had Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in mind all along the movie, I've found her just good.. enough, even she was great as a Teen Mistic in 1st class.Just to say, which pleasure to see Omar Sy (Bishop) in a movie like this, who would have believed that his stupid jokes from the time of(Canal +), would lead him towards X-Men, Jurassic World after the magnificent untouchable!i must say, it was too short, i wanted more, Xmen, with this one, are still on top with avengers and others Marvels hits.go for it",9,0,0,18 June 2015
Gone Girl," a bit overrated
","i didn't read the book, i watched this for Rosamund Pike who, i think, is a extraordinary talented British actress.until the end, this movie is outstanding, R.Pike gives a superb performance as a psychotic and paranoid woman, B.Affleck as her husband is great as all the cast.one day she disappears, after a few weeks, the cops start to think that probably the husband is the ''MAN'', this stand for almost half the movie, when we start to see what really happened, Amy is Machiavellian, no one notices so far, but she had organized everything to send her husband in jail for a death sentence, she's living in a motel until 2 morons steal all her money. She will, then, ask her 1st lover to give her shelter and then start a new scenario to go back home.. BUT the end is: what are they doing!?OK she comes home, after killing Collings (N.patrick Harris) , she is literally painted with blood, saying ''he'' was trying to rape and murder her; well, OK, but then, nobody will even clean her face whatsoever at the hospital, may be she has been hurt right? so the 1st thing they must do is, look for wound or else while she is on the bed but no..., Now she is there, in a wheelchair (still painted with blood) answering questions from the police, the woman, in charge of her case, who suspect she lied, can't talk or ask anything even months after.oh!, alright then, see, B. Affleck is doomed, he is forced to live with her, saying, ''ok, we are a good couple now, no problem'' instead of putting his wife on Shutter island.it's like they wrote an end quickly to make a longer movie than it should be, luckily, it's in the last minutes of it, so the disappointment isn't that high, but for me, the movie ended when she arrived homeIn any kind of movie, actors can deliver great performance, R. Pike (Amy) deserves an Oscar for this.What should have been one 10/10 is not more than 7/10",7,1,4,17 June 2015
The Hurt Locker," it really hurt
","i've seen the trailer long time ago and at 1st sight, i've said to myself may be one day on DVD or else so i watched it today, because i'm a fan of G. Pearce, not all his work, anyway he died in the first 5 min.. i convinced myself to watch the other 2 hours....never again, the best thing i can think of, is, this ....thing make any other modern warfare movie a good one.Watch American sniper instead or, of course, one of the best movie ever made on the subject, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Black Hawk down etc..if the point was to show that they take care for the man next to them, Black Hawk down is thousand time far better if it was to show that war is dangerous.....and can make soldiers suffering in anyway, there are far better movies than this oneand if it was for shown a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, I feel sorry for them to be represented by that.nothing against the actor and their work, i think they have done what they can with their character but everything is inaccurate or completely stupidR. Fiennes as a special ops is killed 5 min. after they all fall into an ambush, OK, why not, he had been killed by a faster sniper than him, who killed 2 others before, so he is good right? A. Mackie takes on the Cal.50 and: '' sh..t bullets are jammed by blood, please clean it'' it'll take 10 min. to clean the ammo, the Iraqi sniper doesn't even fire once during this time waiting for what? get killed of course and so on...!well 1/10 because there is no 0",1,3,5,19 May 2015
Black Hawk Down," one of the best
","this movie is showing how hard, brutal modern warfare is for young soldiers(the scene where Pila is killed..you can see on the soldier's face ''omg it's not like in movies or video game, look there is blood all over the truck, my friend is dead, he is dead omg'')and how stupid it is sometimes to engage a country against people who are fighting each other for centurieswho heard or check what is going on in Somalia since?the movie is based on real event and is about top American forces engaged against a warlord who leads his country to death by starving and mass murdering.they settle a mission, which should last 30 min. and it will fail, rebels are more organized than they thought and they engage them in a guerrilla. It's not where American's army perform the most, they are more like a hammer than a scalpel. they'll spent all the night under fire before being rescued, by the NATO forces.every actor here is great, but special mention for Josh Arnett as a fresh leader who must lead his men in this mess for the very 1st time and he'll have many many things to worry about.Ewan McGregor ''the barman'' who wants so badly to go on the field, I'll have more than he expected Tom Sizemore, as a fearless Colonel and a vet, he is absolutely great Eric Bana, he is Delta forces and his performance here is one of his best, his last line '' hey! we start a new week, it's Monday'' then going back on the field after he explained to J. Arnett what war is about, the other man next to them.Hugh Dancy the medic, see by yourselfthen William Fitchner who, IMO, is a underrated actor, the same here, he is Delta and this is one of his best movie.this is a movie who belongs with , Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Apocalypse Now in the hall of fame of war movies",10,2,2,22 May 2015
Everest," the Mountain win
","believe it or not, i didn't know the story, never heard about it and i'm old enough. The 1st time i've seen the trailer i believed it was about top climbers who had a very bad day on the Everest and because of the cast, worth watching, kind of sport movie like Vertical limit . Jack Gyllenhaal, Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin are really great everywhere, Keira Knigtley and Emily Watson as well.But then in the opening you have a few sentences explaining who was the 1st to climb and reach the summit and who died or did the same the next 40 yrs and..... this: Rob and his Adventure consultant business who takes every day people on one of the most dangerous mountain in the world I mean what?! how is this possible, people are free to do whatever they want with there lives but guys, use common sense right,are you insane? my view change instantly from a good sport movie to what it must be, an horror and catastrophic story. It's amazing to watch people using ladder to pass over a crevasse, as Beck says, '' yes i'm scary, i know i can die but i didn't pay to die like i was in Walmart''at the end you can't blame Rob Hall, he died trying to make every customers happy.. against all safety like Doug the Postman, what is he doing here? none of them meet the requirement to be there, even Beck who was training 6/7 days is a miracle, the man is alive but shouldn't.i loved the movie because of the Everest's beauty, the cast who delivered, and most importantly the story which was, for me, incredible. the survivors can't be proud of this adventure but really be happy to be alive. it's a must see",9,0,0,21 December 2015
Sicario," When the law can't solve all the problem
","i've watched it for the 2nd time yesterday and it was the right moment i suppose, because everything became clear, i mean, the 1st time it was like reading a book from right to left but, something was there.i'm sure D.Villeneuve like P.Berg and S.Soderberg's works, there is this documentary kind of style like Berg and those close-ups, lights like Soderberg, i've absolutely loved Traffic and of course the last kingdom or Lone survivor, Sicario could have been made by both of them.Matt (J.Brohlin) is perfect, a cool guy you can probably share a beer with on Sunday afternoon, but he is also a spec op who get the power to go anywhere and change the rules of engagement on taking any opportunities, like hiring B.Del Toro who was a attorney in Mexico once and seek for revenge against the man who killed his family whatever it takes, that's why he team up with Americans.at 1st sight, Benicio Del Toro is like a consultant, doesn't talk much, but you quickly find him as the ruthless guy in the room and on the same page as Matt is.For legal purpose, they take Kate (E.Blunt), who's the head of a tactic response team and play by the book, in there crew, everything which will happen then, will hurt her of course. Let say E.Blunt is perfect as a lost but strong women on the field, because of her training and what she already did as a cop, (the first 15 min of the movie, ouch!!), she can handle everything even when Alejandro shoot her only to reach his goal, the man had never been so close to the finish line and no one can stop him, but for her, still, it's not the right way and want to stop all of this until Matt explain what those Cartel's guys did. at the end, it's a eye for eye, Talion's law kind of story.You've already seen this? yeah, me too, butall the cast as everybody involved in this movie were brilliant.a must see",9,0,2,28 March 2016
Blade Runner," R.Scott's Masterpiece
","I.m a huge fan of R.Scott's work, i've watched Blade Runner in 82 and almost every year since...like yesterday evening :)In 79 R. Scott had made Alien the 8th passenger to compete against Star Wars for Fox, both changed Sci-fi movie forever, then he gave us Blade Runner and for me it's his masterpiece.It's a noir movie, a disappointed cop is hired by the L A metro police in a near future to kill replicant, human AI.It's raining all the time, no sky, it's really dark, down town LA is a mix of a open market for anything,animals clones and genetics shops, cheap hotels and squats, skyscrapers are huge, the Tyrel corp. looks like a modern over sized pyramid, most of the human beings who are always there, have diseases or have no money and cannot go to the space colonies. then i must say, the movie is really far better than the book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' was.Harrison Ford is superb as all the cast. which is, for some of them, their best movie as of today, I became a fan of Rutger Hauer as well for his portrayal of Roy. do you know that, Roy's last words were a total improvisation of R.Hauer? the music by Vangelis is perfect. after all these years, it's still one of the best sci-fi movie ever made,you must see it",10,4,9,16 May 2015
Spectre," a summit of disappointment
","i've always says D.Craig was the best bond after Sir S.Connery, all Bond with Craig were great, the car chase intro in the tunnel ending with Mr White in the trunk (Quantum of Solace) made me think yeah he's back. i've had high expectations for Spectre, the trailer was good, so let's enjoy. it's nowhere close to a good bond, it's a roller-coaster of some good moment and some, not bad but blend without any appealing.pros:D.Craig still great as bond, C.Waltz, will never thank enough Q.Tarentino for this great actor, they give Mr white (J.Chistensen) a excellent scene to get out of the franchise well deserved and brilliant:), M.Belluci, she's in for about 5 min but it's worth itcons: L.Seydoux, she's a pain to watch as she was in MI-Ghost protocol, the whole story is a mess, then put Q, Tanner, M and Moneypenny on the field, why not, so, give them something to do, not just as follower in a car.M hold a gun ''epic'', Q hacking the spy network, yep it's his job and really good at it, Moneypenny was a agent before and just play a green plant, Tanner is still Tanner... i hope for Craig it was the last, he's a really good actor and deserve better than this to show his talent, for the others they don't need Bond as well, so can't wait to see them in something elsesorry this was a review for Spectre i completely forgot about it^^",4,1,5,27 March 2016
Warcraft," i must have seen it in theatre
","there is a non official club in the video game world, those who have played (or still do)World of Warcraft (not Warcraft, that's another club :P) and those who don't, it's not a elitist statement, just expectations.i've played this games since the beginning and was sure, the movie they've been talking about since 2006 or so will be a failure, i didn't even watch the preview nor read anything about, then a few weeks ago, a friend , player as well, told me it was a solid and well made movie about '' our'' world and i would be surprised by it.i must say it's absolutely stunning, as a fan, it's a pleasure to see a universe you've spend so much time in, become somewhat ''real''.the cast deliver a great performance, Ben Foster is stunning, as the others, for once Orcs looks like beast, kind of Hulk remastered, human must be smarter and clever to defeat them,CGI is exactly what i was looking for, especially the magic, i've been blown away by the visual, well.. a blast.the only downside (little), is that you need to be a fan or player to know what's going on, to know the places, why and who is Garona?, Why Guldan, if there is a sequel, they'll probably develop it more, who knows.As a fan i give 8/10, but i'm sure other people are a bit confused on what and when, then it's all about entertaining and Warcraft didn't miss",8,0,0,24 October 2016
13 Hours," ''We were Warriors''
","wasn't expecting such a powerful movie from director M.Bay, but here it is, as per some others said already it could have been more , some extra scenes would have explained better why they've been almost ''left for dead'' in Lybia.All, ALL the cast is really good, James Badge Dale nailed it as the commandant of this special unit, all the members are Ex-Seal or black ops, J.Krasinsky did it as well, he wanted to do some drama role and here is navy seal but a newbie in the crew, Max Martini, always rock solid in this kind of role and so are the others.It's powerful as Lone Survivor/2013 was, a different story of course, but 6 men have spent 13 hrs in hell to keep 24 Cia's members alive and themselves while their government was thinking if it would be a good move to , may be, help them. You know the deal, it's more easy to forget about 30 peoples which are not supposed to be here instead having to explain to the whole world why Americans were still in this country.Their opponents are only people with weapons, but rather dangerous because of inexperience, everything can happen and almost will, they have lost 2 of 6 men after a fight against hundreds rebels, they were not super hero, they had a real tactical advantage plus experience.my Title is 'we were Warriors' because of 'We were soldiers/2002' but also because all survivors have quit and retired for good after that and must be proud of what they've done that night.If you like good war movies, like Black hawk down, Lone survivor and the like, watch this, it's one of the best.",8,1,3,5 May 2017
Alien: Covenant," Finally..
","..they've reached the dam..Airlock, everybody agree, the very first Alien was/is a masterpiece, nobody can do better except R.Scott.So for me, Alien Covenant is as good as Prometheus is a disaster, Prometheus was beautiful, design wise and bad because of the weakest women lead in the franchise or the lack of a strong one, here it's more like the very 1st one.We follow a colony ship -the Covenant- who must reach a new planet with 2000 people +crew and embryos to start over, they'll have to stop, because of an accident during a routine made by Walter (M.Fassbender)which lead to woke up the Crew earlier and then because they'll receive a com. from a smaller planet around, this time it's not Mother who stop the ship and it's the captain who order the discovery mission, (you know, between 7 yrs in Cryo sleep and a few weeks to reach a new heaven, it's easy to choose.) Every thing will go wrong as soon as they arrive because, even after a century of space travel, they are not prepared to walk somewhere else than on the good old Earth. When they land it's Earth like, but there is nothing except forest, water, lakes and ..wheats, no birds ,bugs, or any single animals, just some form of pollen; Now take a women who is in charge of a shuttle but can't handle a sick person without a panic attack and it will opens hell's gate for the whole crew.They'll be rescued by the only one person around, an hermit played by.. M.Fassbender-who is terrific here- (like in Prometheus BTW)and if you remember Prometheus, you'll know at first sight where they are.the 1st good point is, even the cast isn't unknown, they are not that famous which is really good (for me) (i've seen alien the 8th passenger in theatre, i was young and i just know , T.Skerrit and J.Hurt by that time) they all did good, but a really special mark for Katherine Waterston, she don't have a cat, but what she surely have is, Rippley's spirit and.. balls. the 2nd one, whether some people here like it or not, A.Covenant is the best sequel to the 1st one than any other, of course they'll do the same mistakes, of course you know what's gonna happen, but it's more dramatic, it's less claustrophobic (slightly),more fast paced. Thirdly, R.Scott used a lot from the 1st and a few idea from the 2nd and the 3rd opus in this one.Don't think i've spoiled many thing here, but you'll discover a bigger treat than the Xenomorph himself in this story. I don't know if there will be a follow up but i hope so, for those who says R.Scott killed the franchise, they are really wrong.i recommend this to anyone who like Aliens",8,3,10,16 June 2017
