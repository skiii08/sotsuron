Whip It," Inspiring, heart warming movie
","Whip It follows Bliss, a teen who is looking to get away from her mother's idee fixe of the d√©butante lifestyle, who finds herself accepted into a roller derby team. The film is inspiring, amusing, and has a rebellious yet warm spirit. All of the characters were very well developed,especially as it shows the change in relationship between Bliss and her parents, as they both come around to each other's viewpoints. Kristen Wiig was phenomenal as Maggie Mayhem, a positive role model and friend to Bliss, and Ellen Page showed off her great as usual acting ability as she reacted to the actions of those around her. Whip It was incredible in every way, from plot to characters to directing to acting. While not the film would not necessarily fit right into the 'chick flick' genre, the focus on a mostly female cast does a wonderful job of portraying girl power, and emphasizes the fact that females don't need 'that special man' in their life to succeed or be happy. This hidden gem of a movie is well worth a watch.",10,2,6,29 April 2015

Superbad," An awkward, hilarious, sweet, and unforgettable comedy
","Superbad is exactly what the title implies- raunchy, boozy, and more than a little naughty. This comedy captures the awkward hilariousness of teenage antics as it follows two seniors, Evan and Seth (Michael Cera and Jonah Hill), as they attempt to bring alcohol to a party in order to get laid. The result is laugh-out-loud funny and sweet as the two friends not only get into a lot of weird situations, but they also grow closer to each other. With a cast full of comedic geniuses, it's no surprise this movie is so successful. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are able to pull of complete ridiculousness while also being vulnerable, making their characters believable. Bill Hader and Seth Rogen steal the show as two completely irresponsible cops who get into almost as much trouble as the teenagers. And of course, the character Fogell, also known as 'McLovin' is entirely unforgettable as the awkward teen who befriends the two cops while trying to buy booze for the party. While not a movie that should be viewed by children, it is a hilarious look at teenage life and leaves the audience quoting its lines in delight afterward.",Null,0,1,3 May 2015
