Casablanca," Best Movie Ever (Don't Care What the AFI Thinks)
","I know that I cannot add anything to a discussion of this movie that  has not probably been said before. But in my humble opinion, there is not a weak scene, not a weak actor, not a weak line in this whole movie. It is on my list of best movies ever as the best movie ever made so far. This includes Citizen Cane, Gone With The Wind, Godfather, etc.",10,2,3,25 November 2003
The Notebook," My Nomination for Academy Award
","This may be the best movie I  have seen in 30 years. The things I liked about it1. Gena Rowlands and James Garner were masterful. They exuded true chemistry, and they were able to bring out the emotion of the story without being maudling and without being manipulative. I believe that they are shoo-ins for nominations for academy awards. He modeled tenderness and love in a way that I hope husbands of aging wives will learn from.2. I liked the fact that Lon was not one dimensional. He loved Allie enough to let her go.3. I liked the way that Allie's mother was able to show her that she understood the difficult choice Allie had to make between Noah and Lon. She admitted her mistake about not being honest with Allie when she presented the letters.Questions left unanswered:1. Did Noah work in the lumber mill for the rest of his life? I doubt he could have provided like he did in such a job. Would liked to have known his occupation.2. What happened to Noah's mother?One thing I did not like.1. I appreciated that there was no nudity (no, I am not an old fogey). But can we not understand that characters in movies are having sexual encounters with having to feel like voyeurs. When Rhett grabbed Scarlet and carried her up the stairs we knew what was going on without full graphics. Can we go back to panning the cameras to the shadows or the moon.Even so this is a great movie - should become a classic. I give it a 10.Andy Smith",10,0,0,17 July 2004
Troy," True Shakespearean Tragedy
","I saw this movie as a Shakespearean Tragedy in that the major characters had fatal character flaws that ultimately controlled their destiny or demise. Achilles' (Brad Pitt) flaw was his pride concerning his ability to fight. Hector's (Eric Bana)flaw was his loyalty to family even when they were screwing up. Paris' (Orlando Bloom) flaw was the fact that he was a wuss - he did better later in the movie so long as it did not involve hand to hand combat.In my opinion there were 2 major problems with this film. One is that it never invoked an emotional quality that made you care. Epics such as Saving Private Ryan or Master and Commander both drew the viewer in emotionally. Second, all of the actors have given better performances in other movies. For instance, there was a scene in which Drad Pitt is trying to cry (I won't tell why to spoil any of the movie), but it almost seem that he was yawning instead. I kept thinking he needed to take lessons from his wife on how to cry on cue.Over all I gave it a 7, and it is worth seeing once. But in all probability, I will not buy the video.Andy Smith",7,0,1,31 May 2004
Van Helsing," Loved the Movie
","Kind of like Indiana Jones Meets Frankenstein ( and a lot of other horror monsters). Kate Beckinsale was gorgeous. The plot was good and well written. The acting was good (not great), but the special effects was well done.I especially enjoyed the protryal of Frankenstein as basically good. And the actor playing Carl reminded me of Danny Kaye and was the glue that held the picture together. In fact I would say he stole the show.If you like good wholesome monsterous adventure, then I recommend the movie So I am very surprised that most of the voters (with whom I agree 90% of the time) have rated this movie so low. I cannot see anyone rating this less than a 7. Even so I give it a 9.Andy Smith",9,2,4,15 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Did not enjoy as much as the first 2
","I would prefer Chris Columbus to direct the next Harry Potter installment. I found this installment slow and plodding. Everyone says that this installment is darker - well - Duh! - the third book is darker. I found the actors less like they are making new discoveries about themselves as budding wizards and more like bored old pros. Because of this shift, the devil-may-care feel of the first 2 seems to be lost.What seem to be a balance in the first 2 movies between what appealed to adults and to younger viewers was skewed in this movie toward adults.
I found myself several times bored and falling asleep during this movie. I look forward to the next episode of Harry Potter - Hope Chris is back.Andy Smith",7,1,1,19 June 2004
Cars," Movie That Touches Heart and Funny Bone
","As far as pure devil may care humor goes, Over The Hedge is probably funnier, but Cars has good humor, but also touches the heart without being manipulative. The humor is obviously generated mostly by Tow Mater the Tow Truck whose voice is provided by Larry The Cable Guy. And the moral of the story is provided by the relationship of Speed Mcqueen the racer whose voice is Owen Wilson, and Doc Hudson whose voice is provided by Paul Newman. The moral can be summed up by the poet that wrote, 'No man is an island unto himself'. Rarely are our accomplishments the result of what we do alone - most successful people on sports, arts or business have people in the background doing a lot of support work.So this movie works on the level of a humorous story, good moral point, great art work, and last but not least a very good sound track. The remake of Route 66 is very good. Based on these qualities I give the movie a '9'.",9,5,6,17 June 2006
Shrek 2," Fantastic
",It is hard to believe but Shrek 2 is better and funnier than the first. The humor was quick and truly unique. I had the best laughs that I have had in years.My favorite charcters were the 3 blind mice and Pinnochio. As always Eddie Murphy was a stand out.Of course the fairy godmother as treacherous is a new concept. And Prince Charming as self absorbed is refrshing.I did feel the music was a little strained in its use and was better used in the first shrek. This movie has something for every age - bith kids and parents will enjoy this movie.Andy,10,1,1,25 May 2004
War of the Worlds," Formulaic Spielberg
","Have you had a well made meal and you knew the chef was talented, but in the end there was not anything unique or special about the meal? That was how this movie was. If it had been made in the 70's it would be considered great but there is so much Spielberg formula about it. It is like Jurassic Park but the dinosaurs are aliens this time. You had the 2 kids, the distant male father figure who was not emotionally available to the kids, the crowds going nuts scene - The same things we saw in Close Encounters; E.T., - yada, yada, yada...I never warmed up to Tom Cruise's character; and it seems the only person trying to act was Dakota Fanning.Is the movie worth seeing? Yes. Will you regret going to it? No. Will I buy the DVD? Definitely Not.I would like to see Spielberg do something like Color Purple again.Andy Smith",6,1,3,24 July 2005
