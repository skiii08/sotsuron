Black Swan," Black Swan is an attack on all the senses.
","Black Swan attacks on all the senses in a vicious and visceral manner. A great performance from Portman as well as the minimal, but strong, use of costume and make up make this the haunting dance that it is.Similar to one of Aronofsky's previous films, Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan is a difficult one to stomach. Littered throughout is unforgettable imagery, dark themes all woven together with a loud and menacing score. Black Swan is a great film, not one I think I'd watch again but it does what it seeks out to do. A few minor things are irksome like a couple jump scares that while successful seemed forced at one point. I'd recommend it without saying anything of the plot but, well, don't expect to just watch it for the dancing because there's far more here than that.",7,0,2,8 August 2016
Captain Phillips," A great exhilarating, yet slightly disposable, thriller.
","Captain Phillips is intense, real nail biting, edge of your seat intense. Plus it's Tom Hanks and who doesn't enjoy a bit of Tom Hanks.I personally enjoyed the small character development throughout, the intuition from Phillips was great and the dynamic between the Somali pirates was well developed and real. One of the few flaws was some hammed in exposition at the start to make you care for the characters immediately, also while I'm a fan of shaky cam some of it felt too much during a couple of actions scenes. Although a few minor faults doesn't stop the film from being a fun and an exhilarating thriller. Most definitely worth watching for the first half alone.",7,0,1,8 August 2016
Capote," Not much more than a good performance.
","Capote is a performance powerhouse, yet it falls flat and average in other areas. Hoffman embodies the character of Truman Capote to the absolute fullest, it's really enjoyable to watch him act.The plot is okay, I found that the plot kinda dawdles for a long time without really achieving all too much, but it's not bad. Everything else keeps the film together, nothing is bad but only boring which is a real shame. I wanted to find something great in this, but it just never gripped me. It never reached a level which I was hoping it would. Hoffman and Keener were great together but there was no where near enough of them on screen together.Sadly a great performance doesn't make a great film, Capote is slow and tedious and feels like a long novel itself, dragging from point to point.",6,4,6,8 August 2016
Children of Men," A greatly enjoyable and beautiful dystopian picture.
","Children of Men presents a concept heavy yet very believable dystopian future, women are no longer fertile and the world is falling apart. The film's atmosphere is established straight away, beautiful cinematography and camera-work strings together some of the best sequences I've seen, a few long shots are astounding and very memorable. My only minor issue with Children of Men is a few instances of hammy dialogue, while it doesn't subtract much from the film it can be distracting to hear a couple of bad line deliveries.Other than that I have no real other quarrels, the plot is paced brilliantly and everything works like a well oiled machine, perhaps more could have been explored but it may have bogged down the film in exposition. Overall, Children of Men is well up there as one of the best, if not the best, dystopian films of all time.",9,1,3,8 August 2016
