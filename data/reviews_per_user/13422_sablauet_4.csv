Come and See," A masterpiece, perhaps the greatest war film i have ever seen.
","I just caught this film on tape, where did it come from?  -I had never heard of it before and yet it may very well be the greatest war film i have ever seen.  It starts out more or less like a small art house picture and by the end it is epic.  Surely Steven Spielberg must have studied this one before making Schindler's List for it's portrayal of the systematic, town by town liquidation, of jews, gypsies, woman, children... in bellarusse during WWII, and it is absolutely devastating.  Spielberg's film feels like hollywood hokum by comparison, and i really liked Schindler's List, or rather, i thought it was a great and powerful movie.  but there are so many unforgettable images in this movie, images that will forever haunt me, from the opening scene where young boys pry rifles from dead soldier's cold fingers, to the roving eyeball of a dying cow.  Make no mistake, this is a difficult film to watch, but should be required screening for all.",10,5,8,2 March 2003
School of Rock," It's the Jack Black show, and a rock'n good family flick.
","This film is the ultimate Jack Black role, it was obviously tailored for him and it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing this part, or the film existing without him.  I for one can take him or leave him in most films, but here he is able to utilize all his talents and push the envelope just enough... but is thankfully reined back before becoming insufferably obnoxious.  The director does aterrific job of taking what easily could have been a very sappy, syrupy, formula film, and give it some edge, and make it fresh and fun.  A wonderful celebration of the spirit of rock-n-roll and the need to stick it to authority that all adolescents, perhaps everybody, feels one time or another.  It's a piece of fluff but a well made one with heart and something to say.  And the kid's are amazing!",9,0,0,18 July 2004
8 Mile," What a let down from Curtis Hanson.
","I'm a big fan of Curtis Hanson so I was really disappointed with this ho-hum, been there done that formulaic film.  It was very well directed, shot, acted, but why bother, it had nothing new to say.  The only wrinkle that was remotely intriguing was the rap battles, but even these offered little in the way of suspense, the entire film was so predictable.  You easily could have cut from the opening sequence to the end battle and it would have ultimately of had the same impact only without wasting two hours of my life.  Eminem does a fine job of playing himself, he pretty much reacts in every scene the same way regardless of what is going on.  The film goes to great, and very boring lengths to show what a great guy he is. This movie was fine but had nothing new to say about life on the streets that I have not already seen in dozens of other films.",5,0,1,18 March 2003
Gangs of New York," Almost great.
","Well in my mind Scorsese is just about the greatest living American director still working on a regular basis.  This film had many elements of greatness but ultimately I had my share of problems, the biggest having to do with how this epic got made in the first place.  No way, no how was a picture this size going to get financed without a big star or two at the center, and it is that star that was my biggest problem with the movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio does a perfectly fine job but his performance is hardly inspired, he did the best job he could but we was not the best person for the job.  I found him to be one note and boring.  Too bad Collin Farrel was not the hot star then that he is now, I think he would have been far more interesting.  Daniel Day-Lewis on the other hand was absolutely awe inspiring.  Man can this guy act, never would I have thought a year ago that I would shake in my boots at the mention of his name, but his Bill the butcher is seriously intimidating. The rest of the cast is first rate, especially old faithfuls like John Reilly and Brendan Gleeson.  The production is huge, the sets amazing though because there were so few sets, I'd say the bulk of the action took place in three locations, the movie felt oddly claustrophobic.  Maybe after a second look I will feel differently as is so often the case when viewing the work of a master like Scosese, but for now I felt the film was lacking",8,1,2,29 March 2003
