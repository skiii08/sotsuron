Deepwater Horizon," deepwater horizon
","I had the opportunity a few months ago to see Deepwater Horizon in theaters during a college strike day. I love watching films that are based on true stories because afterwords I love to do some research on the actual stories themselves and to compare and contrast the Hollywood version and the actual events. So Deepwater Horizon was based on a semi-submersible drilling rig owned by Transocean off the shores of the Golf of Mexico about 250 miles away from Huston, Texas. April 20, 2010 there was a large explosion causing the largest oil spill in the United States. Directed by Peter Berg there was an excellent cast that included Mark Wahlberg,Kurt Russell as the main characters. The whole movie was set on the oil rig and what the crew members had to go though in 2 days. The head crew members knew something was wrong with the drilling machine but the cost was adding up everyday they were not drilling so the owners of the rig were pushing hard to drill even though there were red flags of the drilling being unsafe. The movie added real life clips from news channels. Also, at the end of the film before the credits the director added actual pictures of the crew members and their stories of what happened to them after the explosion. The director did a great job keeping the suspense and action pack through out the film. Trying to keep details such as when the explosion happened you see the slush of mud and water exploding out all over the crew members and the fire on the rig. There was not much of a love story going on except the opening scene with the crew members saying good by to their loved ones as they make there way to the oil rig. There was also the occasional phone call or Skype while on the rig.I liked how the story was based on the rig and the explosion without the extra Hollywood love story added in. This kept the viewer focused on the events that were played out. As a viewer you almost feel as though you are standing on the rig with them. I really thought the details were great the camera angels and lighting were well done to give you that action pack suspense feel of being part of the movie. Deep water Horizon kept ya on your toes especially knowing that it was based on actual events watching the crew members struggle to survive gave me a more emotional feel towards the movie. Like any Hollywood film representing a true event you will always see added scenes that were not part of the actual events to keep the movie watcher engaged but doing some research on the actual event i thought that the director did an excellent job keeping it pretty realistic. I was surprised on how fast this film came out when the actual even only happened 6 years ago so its still very fresh in peoples minds. I would recommend this film to anyone to watch!",9,0,1,5 December 2016
Moana," Moana - great lessons for kids
",So i took my daughter who is 5 to see this movie a few weeks ago. Of course i was expecting the usual Disney princess story line but i found that this one had a few different significant lessons in it. Keep in mind this movie is based in Hawaii on an island.1. Growing up... Moana being next in line as Chief on the island wanted to explore the ocean yet her father was holding her back from even setting a toe into the ocean. He himself was the same way and ended getting hurt and lost a friend to the ocean. Her mother was a little more understanding of her daughter not trying to hold her back from her dreams. Lesson for parents you..even if you are afraid to let go of your child you need to give them a chance to express themselves and learn from trial and error you cant protect them all their life.2. Grandmother and Death...Moana's grandmother was very free spirited and related to Moana in fact many of the scenes we see her trying to help Moana go out on the ocean and discover who she is. The grandmother being on her death bed tells Moana to go because the island is slowly dying and their people are in trouble. Grandmother knows Moana is the last hope of their tribe to survive. She like any other elder are the ones we look to for guidance. When grandmother passes away Moana sees her change into a stingray and 'becomes her guardian angel' This was a way to explain to children that even though death is sad you can still keep that loved one in your thoughts and forever hold on to their memories.3. Environment- The movie shows that our environment is in trouble and without doing anything to help it we are all doomed as our food supplies will disappear and vegetation will be ruined. The reason Moana sets sail is to give back the heart stone so her island can heal. The message is to protect the environment and for a kids movie i think they did a great job at it. The movie was cute my daughter enjoyed it i enjoyed it. I like how Disney incorporated myths and legends as well as traditions and culture. I would recommend this film. The animation was great the music was great and catchy. was it Disneys best film no but the story line had a good meaning to it and i feel that my daughter understood it well with some explanation.,8,5,16,5 December 2016
