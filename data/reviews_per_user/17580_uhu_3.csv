The Legend of Bagger Vance," Beautifully filmed movie carrying a message
","This is one of the movies I would not want to have missed. With the movie telling a story rather modestly and calmly, it is difficult to tell why that is so. The most important of the reasons why this movie is important to me is that it bears a message behind the story, demanding from us to lead a meaningful life, and purveying this message to us very naturally and by no means imposingly. And then there are the beautiful landscapes and the great cast. Damon and Smith are an odd couple, but play their roles impeccably. And Charlize Theron, with her Southern brawl, is simply irresistible.",8,1,3,11 May 2003
Being John Malkovich," Overrated
","I cannot understand why a movie with such a poor plot, so badly filmed (with long sequences dimly lit, for example) and acting that is everything else than outstanding can reach the top 250. This movie is grossly overrated.",4,4,10,13 April 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," Good acting and filming can't mend a poor story
","Once Upon a Time in the West is one of my favorite movies, so I was looking very much forward to see this one. De Niro's acting is impeccable in this prohibition time film and there are some really beautiful pictures, especially in the episodes showing the youth of the gang. As usual, Leone moves forward slowly, concentrating on details. The movie, by jumping back and forth between past and present, develops a complicated story you wonder how it is going to end and tension is slowly building up. But then the riddle is solved, and you sit back, wondering how the director could ever have tolerated such an ending. It is incoherent, incredulous, even absurd. I was completely disappointed when the movie ended.",4,4,12,21 November 2004
