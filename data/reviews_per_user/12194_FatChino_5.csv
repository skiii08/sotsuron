Requiem for a Dream," Whats your fix?
","'If there's ever a TV junkie it's the old lady ...' Aronofsky's harrowing tale (based on a novel by Hubert Selby Jr.) of four respective addicts walks a fine line between 'MTV movie' and progressive independent storytelling that uses technology to help it's cause. Ultimately its comes through unscathed, powerful and thought-provoking.Hip-hop montages used during shots of drug taking/ t.v. watching (Sara's addiction) weave the two separate stories together as the four characters head towards their final demise. These and the various camera techniques used through the film really might have resulted in an ultra-stylized piece of work that was impossible to penetrate and appreciate the stories that were developing. However the balance is perfectly achieved and the camera work works to develop the characters, (the close-up of Marion leaving Big Tim's house and throwing up, as well as Sara stumbling down the street in a shot that would almost be more suited to a music video come to mind) as opposed to rendering them secondary to the various techniques on show.The first time I watched this film was in the kitchen of my university halls. Gasps could be heard as the film entered its film grueling final sequence. Silence reigned supreme when it was over. It truly is a powerful film and hasn't lost its affect on me on subsequent further viewing. Ultimately though IT IS NOT A DRUG MOVIE. Its focus is on the characters and the battles they are having with their addictions ... whether that be dope, prescription drugs, television or the longing to be young, popular and happy and again.The performances in the film are all that could asked for. Ellen Burstyn is a t.v. addict widow who gets a call telling her she will be appearing on her favourite show. Burstyn portrays Sara's descent to ultimate insanity, via prescription slimming drugs, brilliantly. Although much has been made about it, it has to be said that it is refreshing to see an older woman in a lead role and Burstyn handles the responsibility admirably; her performance the stand out in the film. Jared Leto plays Sara's hapless but well-meaning son Harry. The desperation of his situation comes through perfectly in his performance as he struggles to support his best friend Tyrone (Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion (Connelly); although I am not quite sure how he actually handles the scenes where he starts crying. Connelly has the same desperate cloud hanging over her character, as the bright but ultimately doomed drug addict designer. Wayans pulls out a great display and shows he can handle 'serious' film making as well as his Wayan's bro comedies.Aronofosky has a create a truly mind blowing (really hate to use that phrase too!!) piece of art here; the joy of this film is the story that shines through the stylized exterior.",10,0,1,29 June 2005
Rocky IV," Pretty Poor ... But worth a look ... really it is!
","So this is how the Rocky story went on ... and on, and on, and seemingly on ...Rocky's now best of chums with old enemy Apollo Creed; but wait what's that on the horizon of freedom; the grim specter of communism (boo hiss); and they have the technology; they've created some sort of killing machine in the shape of a boxer (Drago); Apollo's too cocky for his own good; he comes out to box dressed like Uncla Sam; oh look there's James Brown; Apollo's killed in the ring; Now Rocky's p**sed MONTAGE ... and we're off to Siberia!!! (Rocky's all heart you know; you can see it in the way he trains, helping out those poor Russians by pulling their ploughs; Drago by using some sorta boxing based technology, well, that's just cheating isn't it?!!?) Fight night; Rocky takes his usual pounding; but wait he's not going to give up; he's making a comeback of some kind; wow, the Russian crowd for some strange reason are backing Rocky (please explain why even when Creed was losing in the US they still backed him but here it is different); Rocky's beaten the Russian killer; Cue Rocky's victor speech ... 'Can't we all get along guys? Please? Addrriiiaann.' OK the storyline may not have changed much from the other Rocky's (Rocky=underdog; fights big monster; losing but comes back to win etc etc), I might not agree with the naive political outlook of the film and the film has possibly the worst montage sequence in any film I've watched (it just goes on and on), but this film really is great for sitting down to with some friends ... the cheese is present in massive amounts and although it is just that little bit cynical you just can't help but poke fun at it every 5 minutes as opposed to getting up and turn it off.On a quizzical note I can't understand what Drago's character is supposed to be exactly. It seems like he is/should be set up as a pretty much 2d monster/ punch bag for the audience but I got a sense of vulnerability/ that he was merely being used by his trainers at the first press conference and at the very end. Trashy motivational music is amazing; in that it does its job ... its big, loud, (terrible) and makes you wanna go out and, well, kick some ass really (see Hearts On Fire, Sweetest Victory et al).In all a weak rehash, definitely worth a look though if you have a streak of cynicism running through you (make sure whoever your watching it does too!) or maybe if you just want something 'up-lifting'.",4,3,8,17 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Sorry Steve, Just Can't Let You Get Away With that Ending ...
","This film seems to have everything going for it ... brilliant action sequences, unnervingly horrific scenes, a dab of political commentary and just a smidgen of character development ... make no mistake this is a Spielberg action/sci-fi effort not to be confused with 'serious-Steve' who made Schlinder's List and Saving Private Ryan ... then we come to the end of the film.WHAT HAPPENED THERE!?! Fair enough this is Hollywood. Maybe everything has to be tied up nicely (perhaps to his credit Spielberg didn't go too over board and totally reunite his on-screen family of the times). Perhaps I would have felt let down with a totally downbeat ending that would have seemingly tied in with the grim tell of survival that had proceeded. The ending though just comes off as rushed, ill-conceived and a total let down. The original Wells' ending could have been handle much more positively ... the final 'battle' scene and subsequence Freeman (king of the v.o.) voice-over just leaves you wondering what really might have been.What proceeds that though is great entertainment. Popcorn flies through the air, loved-ones cling to each other as Spielberg delivers a series of high-impact shocks and hands are held over eyes waiting for the next jolt ... OK well maybe not quite but this borders on horror at times ... honestly it does! The scene where Cruise ventures out into the newly harvested world of strange vein-like creations is awesome (in the non-surfer and totally intellectual way!) and brilliantly created.All notions of horror aside this is an action flick dealing with the grim notion of survival at all costs. The first appearance of the 'tripods' is particularly impressive; buildings fall, the earth heaves and people ... well they basically fry! As the story progresses we see Cruise's (he may be a jerk, but he sure does Hollywood blockbuster well) dock worker, Ray, tries to build bridges with his estranged children (awwwee). Eventually we see Fanning's (a talent I'm sure well be hearing about for years and years to come) character become drawn to him, but Justin Chatwin's (just a tad annoying) Robbie relationship with his father is slightly confusing ... just when he seems to have made a connection he runs off to join the army! I guess these are minor details; the real drawing points of this film are Spileberg's use of SFX, the set-ups created for these action scenes and Ray's tale of his grim efforts to save himself and his children. These all hold up well to scrutiny ... but the ending, OH, the ending ...",6,0,1,16 July 2005
Sin City," Comic book adaptation come good
","POTENTIAL VERY MINOR SPOILERS The first real comic book adaptation I had the privilege of viewing was the original brilliantly campy Batman ... Adam West with his lawful haircut wore underpants over his tights, zapped, biffed and socked his way out of being boiled alive in giant teacups and treated Robin like he was a little kid. And it really was fantastic!!! Those pows and thwacks may have been a tad crude, but added to those trips up Gotham's skyline and the ridiculous sets and eccentric villains Batman made for an entertaining 25-odd minutes of loose comic book adaptation.But this is 2005. We've seen varying degrees of success in region of adapting comics since 1966. The earlier Batman's set the bar too high for more recent efforts to reach (eagerly awaiting Batman Begins); Dick Tracy definitely showed some promise and the recent Spiderman's and X-Men (to a lesser extent) movies showed what could really be done by combining modern day technology with genuinely interesting story telling.First off and most obviously Sin City's striking and innovative use of colour and technology sets it apart from most other films you are likely to have the pleasure to see. In an interview I heard Clive Owen (and he himself knowingly admitted it clich√©d) that this is something that is totally new; and the man is right. This film noirish effort is filmed in black and white ... there are no grey areas ... the spilling of scarlet blood or the flash of blue eyes is the closest you'll get to the relief of colour. The scene in which Bruce Willis' character is about to close in on Roark Jr. and he is standing by a massive farm door, particularly struck me, in that it look as if a frame from the comic had been drawn into the film. Another interesting touch is the use of silhouette frames at key points in the film.Sadly I myself haven't yet read any of Frank Miller's Sin City comics but the inclusion of the author as a co-director (as well as reports I've heard) suggests the film is particularly loyal to the original story lines. Tarantino manages to muscle his way into Miller's vision and is a 'special guest' director for one scene.The performances of those occupying the corrupt hell hole that this Basin City are very solid to say the least. Mickey Rourke is particularly forcefully as 'psychokiller' Marv, while Alba and Willis stand strong in their story about a weathered cop stabbed in the back for protecting an innocent young girl. Elijah Wood gives an unnerving and totally silent performance as the demented Kevin, a young cannibal. The violence although totally over the top (this is a comic book after all where men can take up to 5 shots and survive) is unrelentingly brutal; scenes involves the male genitalia are very gruesome and had me wincing for a minute. The film itself aside from its obvious quite brilliant and striking presentation is an unrelenting testosterone rush from start to finish. It runs like a film noir with the main characters narrating as woman with near perfect features seem to either end up dead or in the arms of some vengeful do-gooder (or longing for those arms). This is surely reflected in the female cast; as big a fan as I am of Brittany Murphy the prospect of playing a scantily clothed stripper or soon to be dead hooker may not have appealed A-list actresses. I think I must have been joined by have the cinema when a slow sweeping shot of Alba borough an unwitting smile to my face! Sin City is definitely an innovative piece of work from the visual artistic perspective; add to this some quite gripping story lines and you've got something that sees the progress of comic book adaptation in cinema take another step forward.",9,0,1,10 June 2005
Evil Dead II," The Sequel to the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror indeed
","This is the type of film we really wish we made ourselves before some else thought of it. It's intelligent but not entirely complex ... entirely enjoyable yet a serious piece of film making ... everything adds up to cult status. It's the type of film your uninformed friends (or mine at least, I'm surely surrounded by fools) dismiss as trash without giving it a chance.Raimi showed us the thrills, chills and blackly tinged laughs he could bring about in the first in the series on a virtually non-existent budget. Here with just that little bit more he retreads old ground but everything still works ... probably more effectively too! Seeing some of props used and slightly off production values (the 'muppet' headless girlfriend in the shed, the demon head stuck to camera attacking Ash towards the end, Ted Raimi's ripped old lady from hell suit and the quickest of glimpses of set floor boards during one stage of shooting) shows how Raimi was still constrained by budget issues.Seriously though, who cares ... this film has 6 different colours of blood, some seriously funny slap-stick scenes (didn't think I'd say that anytime soon) and a chemistry between lead Campbell and director Raimi that let the jokes flow freely.Campbell proves himself a master of face contortion, self-harm as well as flipping himself over! So many classic scenes in such a short space of time ... my favourite being when Jake is dragged into the cellar and a torment of pink blood comes pumping out. The camera work is as dynamic and as fast paced as in the first outing, the shot of ash standing by the remains of the bridge at the start of film standing out for its grandness among otherwise less cinematic shots.The film leads on nicely to the 3rd installment in the series with one-handed Ash getting sucked into another dimension to face the undead in jolly olde England (or something like that). It really is no wonder that the in-store geeks/pop-culture snobs of High Fidelty described Evil Dead II as the greatest movie of all time.'Groovey' indeed.",9,17,23,13 September 2005
