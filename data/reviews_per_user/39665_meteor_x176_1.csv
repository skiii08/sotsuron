The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A nice movie to appreciate some nostalgia!!
","The Perks of Being A Wallflower - I stumbled upon the movie when searching for something mild, soft to watch for the Sunday afternoon's procrastination from work. The movie totally blew me away and left me in awe while following the protagonist's incredible journey of transformation from a quiet, shy, introvert outcast to a strong and sociable teenage student who can stick up for himself and his besties. (Well, he got Emma Watson's character at the end, that explains a lot.) This is definitely a movie for my students as the high school life depicted in this movie is somewhat similar to theirs: the countdowns of the days left in high school (more than 1,000 days), the exams, the parties, and most of all, the friendship. Watching this movie and seeing how the young people are bond with each other makes you appreciate your friends and those around you so much more. Set in mid 1990s, the movie struck me big time due to the nostalgic feeling it brought to me. I can feel I was brought back to the good old days in the 90s when I spent all the care-free days with my best friends in high school. Time has flown at a ghost-riding speed and when you look back, you'll be sad to find out what's left of you and what you have lost. Totally a decent movie. Highly recommend to those who haven't seen it. Though it also contains some dark elements like homophobia, sexual abuse, drugs, the movie is still a perfect choice for teenagers.",8,0,2,28 December 2015
