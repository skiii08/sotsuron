The Blair Witch Project," really scary
","Don't read much except the tag line before you see this!  Don't let anyone tell you much about it, either.  Except that they got really scared.  Saw it yesterday, and we get the creeps even in retrospect.  Good acting from the unknown crew, really atmospheric filming.",9,1,1,2 August 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Very enjoyable, terrific fun to watch
","This movie had everything:  action, romance, comedy, drama, the elements of Greek tragedy, Oriental mysticism.  All done concisely, as well!  Wonderful sword and martial arts fight scenes, very little graphic violence. Beautifully filmed, and completely enjoyable to watch.  Unusual for the number of female protagonists and antagonists.  Go see it on the big screen!",10,0,0,27 January 2001
