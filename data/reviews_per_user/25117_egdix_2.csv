Ford v Ferrari," Follows a simple formula.
","With the actors in this movie, I thought it would be better. Bale and and Damon are always enjoyable but the script was lacking and all the other characters were cut out cardboards. Balfe was wasted as Bales's wife. You could have plug and played anyone in that role. The Ford executives were one dimensional with Josh Lucas' character playing the villain of sorts. We never know his motives except for being a jerk. Overly predictable in terms of how the characters would act. Could have been done so much better.",6,0,2,20 April 2020
