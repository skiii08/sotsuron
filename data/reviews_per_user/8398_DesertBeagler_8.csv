Vertigo," Terrible, terrible, terrible
","'Terrible' is the word that comes to mind to describe this movie.The overall plot and interaction between characters is so implausible that at one point I began laughing at how bizarre it became.The main character (Scottie) is a retired police detective/former lawyer. He comes off as a gigantic dimwit. Clueless throughout the entire film, clumsy, unsure of himself and completely gullible. He doesn't act, talk or carry himself like you would expect someone playing the role of 'clever detective' to. It would have made much more sense to cast him as something more mundane like a professor or accountant. At least then it would give credence to the irrational decisions you wouldn't expect a detective/lawyer to be making. Of course, the reason for this character's profession was to give reason for his friend's request he act as a private investigator (which could have been just as plausible with any profession, in my opinion).For example, if you're going to covertly tail someone you probably shouldn't stand 3 feet behind them staring at their hair.The script was rushed and I agree with criticisms that Hitchcock did so to fit it within 2 hours. For example, Scottie falls in love with Madeleine even though he's met her only several times. We're supposed to believe he's truly in love with her but from my perspective he comes off as a guy with a hard-on for a hot blond. Even the most desperate romantics would be wary of a woman exhibiting psychotic behavior that you don't even know that well, right? I also think if the viewer is expected to care about Scottie's despair/struggles, they probably shouldn't have made him what most today would be considered a home wrecker. There wasn't even an 'oh gee, I feel kind of bad for starting an affair with a married woman, let alone married to one of my friends'.The acting is over the top. I thought 'Midge' delivered the best performance but unfortunately her role served almost no purpose to the overall plot.The facial expressions became an annoyance. It was almost insulting that the viewer can't be expected to notice something without doing close up shots followed by Scottie's overly exaggerated eye-squinting and head cocking.This was all set to the most annoying part of the film: suspenseful violin music. It was like a 5 minute track set on loop for the whole film.Overall, I was just purely disappointed. The plot didn't make sense. The script was over the top. The acting was terrible. I couldn't find much about this film I found entertaining.",3,9,17,15 February 2016
Citizen Kane," Decent, but rather boring
","I found Citizen Kane to be rather boring. The story sort of ends where it begins and plays a back seat to the overbearing message the film is forcing on the viewer. The emotions didn't feel genuine or powerful enough to support that message and move me in any significant way.The time line felt sloppy. At some points, too slow. At others, too fast. The film climaxed after a 'fast forward' of what seems like several decades. You have to appreciate the film's point of witnessing Kane's transformation from one person into another but the road to do so feels like it's full of potholes and shortcuts. I feel critic's praise for it's 'revolutionary' accomplishments for the era it was produced in is well deserved but unfairly considered for the 'Best Movie of All Time' title. I didn't find anything about Citizen Kane to be remarkable other than it's ability to stand out against other films of the era.",3,1,5,17 February 2016
Oblivion," All Around Great Movie
","Oblivion is a great mixture of sci-fi, romance, drama and mystery. Talented actors, a great script and a very clever plot make this movie worth watching if you're a fan of sci-fi/mysteries. If you're big into action sci-fi, this probably isn't for you. It's much more about dialogue and following the main character's journey through out the film. What really resonated with me were the emotions he went through and the decisions he had to make. Defying authority, pursuing his own interests, etc.The addition of the love story is what really made the movie great all around. I'm a sucker for these types of romance films -- the sci-fi aspect keeps you entertained and the love story triggers emotions.",8,3,5,15 August 2013
The Mist," Wildly predictable, frighteningly clichÃ©
","The Mist's unique, interesting plot was overshadowed by mediocre B actors who portrayed over-the-top characters that engaged in completely implausible reactions to the situations they found themselves in.The main complaint of most horror films and why so many of them fall short of being anything worth talking about is people always end up thinking 'No one would ever do that'. You know, when people are screaming for the character to 'Run!' while she instead stands there with a dumb look on her face? Yeah, this movie is pretty much like that the entire way through.Almost none of the characters attempt to act rationally. In fact, that seemed to be the overriding point of the film. It wasn't the main character trying to survive something evil -- it was the main character trying to survive the unrealistically stupid actors in his company.The film climaxes with a terribly bizarre, try-hard ending. You either love it or hate it. The people that love it want to praise it like it was some unexpected, shocking plot twist. Yes, it was unexpected. Unexpectedly dumb. Yes, it was shocking. Shockingly unrealistic. And, that sums up The Mist. Unexpectedly dumb, shockingly unrealistic.",5,3,5,25 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Lacking originality
","Most of the user reviews on IMDb are trashing the film for stealing the plot of the first. It's hard to argue that's not the case when the story line is practically identical. For that reason, the film has no originality. Unless of course, you consider inserting awkwardly unrealistic social advocacy elements into the film as being 'original'.Let's go through them:1) John Boyega as storm trooper with a conscious. Because if they don't put a black guy in the film, they're racist. And if the black guy isn't the one who did something heroically rebellious, they're racist. Because black people never get major roles (according to everyone at the Oscars). The problem: You're making one of the highest grossing films of all time for the most successful film franchise ever and you decide to cast a guy who's had a part in one movie while at the same time managing to destroy the whole concept of what a storm trooper is supposed to be. Nice job, Disney. 2) Daisy Ridley as Luke Spywalker; girl version. Because it's 2015 and I'll be damned if girls aren't as strong as boys are. Right, Furiosa!? Girls can do it, too! Because if we don't make a girl the hero of the film, it will alienate our female audience. The problem: You're a 3 year old girl dropped on Jakku and grow up without family/friends in complete isolation yet you still manage to end up with a British accent. I can only imagine this 'I've been in like 3 episodes of a TV show' actress didn't have half the skills necessary to learn how to speak without one. 3) Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux Apparently, 'a long time ago' in a galaxy 'far, far away', the Irish people managed to get there because for whatever reason a top ranking General has an Irish accent. What's more, how do you explain such a young looking guy getting to that high of a position? I mean, there's storm troopers older than him. Does his Dad know Kylo Ren and was like 'dude, my 25 year old looking son needs a job!'4) Adam Driver as Kylo Ren I think this casting decision was an accident. I feel like Day 1 on set, Driver showed up and the director was like 'Wait, where's Elijah Wood? Ah, screw it. Driver looks like a baby faced 20 year old. He'll do!' His character comes off as 'I saw an ad on TV for the Dark Side and I had just gotten in an argument with my mom about how much XBOX I'm playing so I ran away and now I get to be the First Order guy with a mask and I can play as much XBOX Live as I want because Supreme Leader Snoke doesn't care!'5) CGI Giant as Supreme Leader Snoke I definitely couldn't tell it was CGI, could you? When Adam Driver took off his mask and held his hand up to use the power of the dark side, I was really, really scared (almost as scary as Toby McGuire doing the same thing), but when this CGI giant gets mad and makes a >:( face, man, is it scary!6) Black Storm trooper in a relationship with white girl Because we need to show the world that interracial relationships are okay. Otherwise, you're a racist! Even though it came off completely unnatural and awkwardly fast, it's beautiful and you agree with it. What they should have done was switch Oscar Issac with John Boyega. But of course, that would make them racist because then the black guy gets the side-role and the Italian looking guy gets the girl. Issac also doesn't look as young as Boyega, so I assume they thought it wouldn't look as natural. (Ha... haha..... hahahhahaa) This film was made purely for mass market appeal. Rey attracts females/young girls to the film. The black guy scores brownie points with the racists/black people, Mark Hammil, Harrison Ford and Leia bring back the baby boomers, all the 20-ish looking actors make sure the millennials connect with the film, the CGI giant brings over the Harry Potter/LOTR fans and finally copying the first film's story ensures people will like it.",6,10,17,30 March 2016
Rear Window," Overrated Suspense Flick
","Rear Window is certainly well shot and the suspense is there. However, the mystery isn't. It's very predictable. That's fine, but unfortunately Stewart isn't a very convincing actor. Coming off of 'Vertigo', I was thankful he was portraying a photographer (Jeff). Well, this is supposed to be a 'tough' photographer who wears boots, treks through jungles and eats grizzly tribal foods in foreign lands. He doesn't look or act 'tough' in any way.There was a scene near the beginning of the film where Jeff was supposed to doze off, not being able to stay awake and watch out his window any longer. It looked more like he was having a stroke than falling asleep. If a Hollywood actor can't convincingly fall asleep, that's a problem.The film is filled with just downright unrealistic events.To go through some of the more extreme examples: At the end of the film after Jeff falls from the window, the policeman pokes his head out to report a full confession with multiple details. This was 10 seconds after they pulled the killer off of Jeff. All that in 10 seconds? I don't think so.Prior to that, Jeff was hanging only by his fingers/hands on the ledge. He has a big, strong looking man pushing on him but somehow his fingers have superman strength (yes, that is a 1998 Rear Window remake jab at Christopher Reeve). Of course, it's only when the police stop the killer that he falls.The scene prior to this with his camera flashes was the dumbest killer/victim scene I've ever seen. Basically, the killer is standing at one end of the room and Jeff in his wheelchair at the other. He puts a bulb in his flash and sets it off, temporarily blinding the killer. The camera focuses close in on him rubbing his eyes, stopping him in his tracks then recovering. He takes one more step, and this whole process repeats about 4 or 5 times until he finally reaches him. Of course, it's at this point that the police coincidentally show up and he's able to scream for help. It's comical.Earlier in the film, Jeff's girlfriend is being strangled/attacked. He and his nurse just watch. He squirms like a pansy and says 'Oh gee, what do we do?' Oh gee, golly whiz, what do you do? Well for one, if someone's life is in serious danger, you don't do nothing. You could scream. Yes, screaming out and saying 'HEY A**HOLE, I CALLED THE POLICE! WE SEE YOU ATTACKING HER!' would actually be a rational thing to do. But, the police magically show up literally 15 seconds after he calls them and save the day.The problem is all of these unrealistic scenes were unnecessary. They could have easily been replaced with realistic alternatives. Great movies don't require the viewer to throw rationality out the window (no pun intended). For that reason, I feel the film is quite overrated. I also think the Freud analysis of the movie some people have like 'it's a take on society's obsession with voyeurism' is complete nonsense. No, it's actually not. It's actually a crime-suspense film about a nosy, bored neighbor stumbling upon a murder - not a message to viewers about society's inner perversions.",5,9,14,20 February 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Mildly entertaining garbage
","They're walking in a park and the guy says 'stop'. Then, ~100 people just stop like it's the manikin challenge. Apparently, everyone in this movie is an assassin. No one is walking in a park in the middle of a day except assassins. They make it seem like the ratio of assassins to non-assassins is 100/1. The homeless guy begging for change: assassin. The woman playing a violin in the subway station: assassin. All backed by some ancient assassins network that uses blood markers to guarantee assassinations. Kept in a binder with some rich guy in New York. If you stop for just a moment and think of how implausibly dumb this plot is, you begin to understand this is more of a comedy than an action flick. Let's kill people, then leave our DNA on a marker associated with the person who wanted them killed (which also happened to be our fingerprint), then let's hire women to run an operator exchange to send out text messages to thousands of stranger's phones with information on the inevitable murder of someone. Sounds legit! Even past the terribly implausible plot, the acting is just horrible. Reeves barely speaks 2 words when he talks. They come off sounding exactly the same. Quiet and awkward. Like, is he on Xanax the entire film cause he sounds like he's stoned. Then, occasionally, he'll speak a foreign language. Does it sound like he's fluent? No. It sounds like he's regurgitating his rehearsed lines. Just a weird way for the director to try and make it seem like John Wick is this insanely talented, worldly hit man. Wick thrusts a knife into a guy's heart and tells him it's stuck in his aorta. If he removes it, he'll bleed to death. To think anyone aside from, say, Terminator, would know exactly where you stabbed someone or where inside of their body the knife ended up down to the centimeter -- is pathetically stupid. It's implausible, as is the rest of the movie. Lastly, the fight scenes (although also implausible) are halfway decent. The only problem I have with them is Reeves is not cut out for being a talented mixed martial artist. He doesn't have the build. His hips are too wide and his shoulders not enough. He honestly looks a little clumsy.",3,54,117,17 February 2017
The Martian," Too scripted, hollow and clichÃ©
","Damon's portrayal of a stranded astronaut on Mars is let down by a mediocre script, terrible physics and implausible events.His character expresses little emotion through out the film. Everything is done very nonchalantly with a mild sense of confidence. It's like he's on Xanax the entire time.Nothing really remarkable happens. The film poorly attempts to add plot twists -- monkey wrenches being thrown into survival plans. They come off very scripted and implausible. If you're a rational person, the film has plenty of 'Oh, give me a break!' and 'Yeah right!' moments.All the characters are so scripted and clichÃ© it's hard to look past. You have the character that wants to do everything by the book. The one that wants to do nothing by the book. The bureaucrat made to look like the bad guy for caring about public image. The bureaucrat made to look like the good guy for willing to sacrifice public image. The old scientist who can't think past his old ways. The cool young trendy scientist who has fresh, genius ideas. The romantic astronaut who seems to have a thing for the main character. The astronaut who talks way too much and of course is the 'tech' support of the crew.Overall the film just seemed too clichÃ©, too scripted and too hollow to really appreciate.",6,1,3,25 January 2016
