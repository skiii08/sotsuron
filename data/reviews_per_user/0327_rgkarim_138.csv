Ford v Ferrari," Gas Up And Get Set To Check Out This Rivalry
","When it comes to cars we like them fast and furious, or at least for many that is the dream as handling the monster speed can be overwhelming. So that's where racing comes in, a means to extend one's self into the faceless visage of a Nascar or Formula One in hopes of seeing their heroes win. Yet, what goes into a racecar? For the die-hard fans and car enthusiasts they understand the mechanics behind it, but for fans like me, well there is a lot more under the hood of the vent. Today's movie is all about the battlefield of racing, though perhaps more of a look into the window of the past in the international racing venue. Tonight we look at the rivalry between two big car empires, in their battle for supremacy as I review:Movie: Ford Vs. Ferrari (2019)LIKES:Surprisingly Decent Pace

The Technical Jargon Mixed Well

The Heart
The Finale Of RacingDISLIKES:The Predictability

The Drama Vs. Reality
A Little More Integration Of The Wife
The Ending After The RaceSUMMARY:Biography dramas usually don't run at a pace that entertains me fully, but Ford Vs. Ferrari succeeded in this endeavor and put the pedal to the medal in storytelling. The elements of describing the business deals, politics and even development of the car are all a carefully blended together to be engaging without being overbearing for this reviewer. It finds a way to make all this business jargon funny, putting just enough spite, attitude, and stubbornness to work and masterfully relieving the dialog heavy plot. What impressed me even more though was seeing the character integration into this film, finding ways to make characters I care about and how I hoped the policies would not shoot them in the foot, which is key to helping me stay invested in a drama. Bale in particular was my focal point, his character having the most lines cast out and the central engine that drove this car. He plays the part well, adds that charm he brings to many of his roles, and then melds with the rest of the teams. Throw in all the dialogue filled with the jargon and you had me feeling like I was part of each group in the decision to battle the big boys.
However, despite all the heart of the film, most fans are going to want to know how the special effects department works in this film. Good news, for America's love of making things loud, bold, and powerful continues on this look back into the past. For guys like me, the musical score at times amps up the elements with its background noise augmenting the scene and making my skin goosebumps rise in that emotional way. Now add the layer of the sound editing and effects and you get the major effect of this movie. Those who love to listen to their engines roar as they fly down the street, or identify the clicks of the perfect transition to the next gear are going to love this movie. All those elements brought together with the theater sound drop you into the driver seat and gets the blood pumping. Finally, combine that with the visuals and you've got yourself a movie that somehow takes what many consider a dry sport of turning left and instead give you the dynamic element of being in this life or death thrall. When combined with the story, it's magic and gives a purpose to remain entertaining, which can be very difficult in a racing movie without gimmicks (comedy of the Love bug or action of the Fast and Furious).Despite the realistic nature of this film though, it still has some elements I would have liked to see curbed. One, the predictability of the film is still there from the foreshadowing alone, though if you know the history of this movie's plot you'll of course predict the ending (which I didn't). Despite the appreciation for the special effects, yours truly has sensitive ears, so the full volume of the engine roaring can be a little painful/ingratiating if not careful. These minor components aside, the movie's constant question of drama vs reality comes into question, and I feel there was a lot of magic integrated into the film compared to the reality. It adds entertainment, but I wonder just how much of this was true to paint the characters a little more notably, more so Matt Damon's character or the arrogant vice president. In terms of further character integration, I would have liked a little more of the wife, who though was involved throughout the film, felt there was a little more she could have had in here to really pull the film to full circle. My biggest dislike though was the last twenty minutes of the film, which I will not spoil. The film had another point that I felt would have been better to end, and while I understand why they did the last part in terms of closure, the last 15-20 minutes could have been edited down where I think the true story ended, wrapped up with a nice information card montage they do. It's times like these where the last piece is placed that sometimes throw me the wrong way, but I will of course recognize the honor and work they did do in those final moments.The VERDICT:Overall, Ford Vs. Ferrari delivered what I expected and more. It was a drama/biography that was not boring to watch, with a pace that like the car continued to work and immersed you into many aspects of the war between these two. A fantastic balance of story with technical prowess is going to be the entertaining factor for much of the audience and looking at the people around me during my showing should impress the target audience. Sure, it's predictable, a little time bloated, and loud, but the only factors are potentially the movie magic blowing things out of proportion and the potential ending that really had me bugging. Otherwise, outside of not being the most original idea or the most dynamic telling of a story it works for a trip to the theater.My scores are:Drama/Biography/Sports: 8.5

Insidious: Chapter 2," Finally, a good Sequel!
","I'm back and busier than ever, but that doesn't mean I don't have time for a quick movie review. Hello Robbie K back with another movie review this time on the latest horror movie sequel Insidious 2. As many of us know, the world of sequels is usually lacking, especially when it comes to the horror genre. Usually the scares and creepiness that we loved in the first movie has grown old and stale, often warped into a stupid, cheesy piece of work that is more humorous than scary. So when a sequel to a great movie like Insidious was announced I cringed at the possible trash that could come out, though with director James Wan returning to project I had some hope that we would get something good. What is the verdict? Read on to find out. Insidious 2 starts as a miniature prequel, reintroducing the world we fell in love with and warming up the audience to the creepiness and scares that await. Jump back to the present where we continue the tale that we left off, again helping us get reacquainted with our old friends the Lamberts, who are trying to move on from the past terror. Not one night after moving in do the ghosts start their antics again, working to scare the heck out of the audience. Wan and crew once again put their imagination to work, and succeed in bringing both scary and creepiness together into a beautiful balance. Like its predecessor, Insidious 2 uses the setting as a pallet for the imagination to paint on, often using subtle sounds, unique camera angles, and that ivory-laced music to raise the hair on your neck. A slight glance of a passing silhouette, something moving in the shadows, or a light fixture licking come together to set the mood before the jump factor comes out of no where, making many audience members screaming. While these effects have grown stale for me, I still appreciate the work the team has put together, and how well edited it is to make a film that will make many scream, which may provide some laughs as well. Make no mistake my friends, Insidious 2 will provide the scares you've been craving since the Conjuring. If you've read my reviews, then you must know that scare factor isn't the only thing I look for in a movie. For this reviewer, story is also important and Insidious 2 has a great plot indeed. As mentioned before, continuing a horror story is hard to do, but Wan meets the challenge again, this time managing to tweak the story to explain some things that were left unanswered. Who is old woman? What happened at the end to Josh? How about some of those scenes that were so vague in the first one? All of them are answered, and so cleverly integrated into the first one that many fans will gasp at, or perhaps scratch their head in confusion. Insidious 2 has the ability and twist to make you say, 'WhatÂ… are you kidding me?' as another piece of the puzzle is revealed. While I was able to predict the movie, just from how many things I've seen, the surprises this movie have are a fresh approach that I've waited for someone to show me. The tale has some mystery to it, having all of the characters, both new and old, working to uncover the truth behind the hauntings. Throwing in the suspense, use of shadow, and all the other factors I mentioned before results in a tale that has you wondering what Wan has in store next. Insidious 2 also has other aspects that made it a strong horror movie sequel. For one thing the comedic relief from characters Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson), two geeks who join the crew in hopes of living up to their mentor Elyse's noble legacy. While they do help provide some suspense, this dynamic duo had me in stitches with their casual dialog timed perfectly to relieve the stress. Unlike other movies, I felt their comedy wasn't too stretched or overacted, which made it even better. Aside from the comic relief, the acting for the crew was good, all characters having an equal spread across the film so that everyone got adequate time with the cast. The lovely Rose Byrne did a nice job as always, but this movie her character was a little bit stupider and over exaggerated so I can't say she was my favorite. Patrick Wilson captures the creepy intensity of a possessed victim, though his screaming and actions during the climax are a bit laughable, especially when you realize what movie they are referencing. The rest of the cast did a great job too, but I'm running out of room so let's move on to one last thing. The makeup and design of the ghosts is incredible, the evil ghost (Danielle Bisutti) is pale, creepy, and gloriously brought to life. It was quite welcoming to see a ghost that was creepy, and not one that looked like a luchador pedophile (Red Demon). However, the biggest props go to the makeup transformation of Josh (Wilson) whose progress is incredibly detailed and sculpted to represent the thing he is decaying into. I can't say too much more though, but those who value the art of make up will hopefully appreciate the work put into this movie. So if you haven't guessed yet, Insidious 2 is a sequel worth checking out. It's got scares, story, and laugh, all brilliantly captured and edited to make one great film. Don't let the fear of crappy sequels stop you from seeing it, and make sure to bring a friend who jumps so you can get extra entertainment.

Blade Runner 2049," Crime-Noire Runs The Show: Not A Thrilling as I had Hoped
","There are plenty of movies in Hollywood, only some of which ever reach legendary status that seals their place in history. These sacred films were usually ended in a manner that didn't require a sequel, but leave it to the big studios to not leave things along. Tonight, Blade Runner 2049 premiers to the public, alongside some high review scores and plenty of praise. Despite the decades long gap, this movie holds promise to be just as good as the sequel. Robbie K is here to share some thoughts on the latest flick and help guide your viewing pleasures. LIKES:True Sci-Fi Crime: The trailers don't lie when they say Blade Runner 2049 is a crime noire film. It opens with the reference back to the first film and soon uncovers a mystery that will run the course of the movie. As this occurs, the other parties are seeking ways to hinder our 'hero' (Ryan Gosling) from uncovering the truth. Like a glorified episode of half the crime-dramas on television, Blade Runner 2049 is all about capitalizing on a prolonged crime and mixing as much drama into it to help add character development. All of this is nicely wrapped up in a science- fiction spin, integrating the floating ships, robots, and large computers as the theater it unfolds in. Emotionally Artistic: The thing that many reviewers seem to appreciate is that the movie brings a lot of emotional punch to the audience. Our directors managed to interject a lot of feeling into Gosling's supposedly emotional character. As his story continues to unfold, you'll be submerged into the psychological nightmare he is forced to face. While the traumatic stress is certainly enough to pull some heart strings, it's the artistic portrayal of determining one's self that adds fuel to the fire. Self-Identity, a thing many struggle with, is well-addressed in this film, trying to uncover the truth about his self, all while solving the crime. Throw in a rather deep, albeit weird, romance story and you will round out the emotional plot lines many seek. Acting: A character is only as good as the actor who portrays it to life and Blade Runner 2049 is a shining example of quality acting. Gosling as the lead was a good choice, his ability to play a man with an identity crisis is quite believable, primarily in the way he seems to stand on the border of sane and psychopathic. While not his best role, I enjoyed seeing the anti-hero part played by him again. Harrison Ford reprises his edge well enough, but I felt they didn't utilize him as well as they could. Ana De Armas: I was happy to see more of Ana in this film, seeing her branch down some more emotional pathways, all while driving the character development of Gosling's character. Yet, I can't lie, that she was beautiful in the various outfits she shifted into during the film. I got the best of both world in this film, and appreciated the costumes that she sported in her awkward scenes. DISLIKES:Not so thrilling: The first Blade Runner had some suspense to it, the constant thrill of the chase as Ford tried to hunt down the rogue androids. It kept the pace going, all while integrating the elements I mentioned in the likes section. Blade Runner 2049 though wasn't that thrilling to me. The action was rather bland, the emotion with it almost as flat, and had little suspense outside of how much torture some of the characters could take. I expected a little more spice to the mix, but don't let the trailers fool you, the thrills were more like spills. Long: If a movie is going to be nearly three hours, it needs to either move, or have an exciting climax. I found neither of these elements in this movie, but instead a very drawn out movie that seemed to drag. While the message and artistic license are appreciated, the editors could have really dropped half the footage to get me out of the theater faster. Perhaps if the ending hadn't been predictable I would have been more intrigued, but I found myself fighting sleep at times because from these elaborate, and often unnecessary details. Predictable Story and Under Utilized Characters: Blade Runner 2049 might have been a well- built Sci-Fi Crime story, but that doesn't mean it wasn't predictable. Most of the 'twists' I got in the first hour, leaving me nearly two to go until they revealed it. In addition, my expectations of where the story was going were also shattered as other characters were underutilized for more sappy looks and near depression. This especially goes for Ford and Leto, who I felt got the short-end of the stick in this film. Throw in some of the loose ends, more like bait for the next film, and it left me unsatisfied with where the story was going. Loud: Many films are loud in a theater with blaring music and special effects to make the seats shake. This movie though, just had obnoxious sound effects that were high-pitched groans, mixed with a soundtrack that while unique was not the most pleasing to me. Brace yourselves for this interesting sound soiree, because you are going to hear it a lot. The VERDICT:Blade Runner 2049 is artistic, a visual display that is packed with emotion, Sci-Fi charm, and a crime noire element. It has much of the same feel as its predecessor, but I felt it lacked the suspense and thrills that the trailers promised back in the teaser. Sadly the predictable story, underutilized characters and audio assault didn't justify the nearly three hour run time for me. Don't see this one when your energy is low folks, or you just might be fighting sleep. My Scores:Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",8,16,40,5 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Disney Hits A Grand Slam Predictable Tale
","Disney seems to have their hands in every pot these days with animation, superhero movies, even Star Wars is in the plans these days. However tonight's review is all about Disney's sports movie genre. Now with classics like Remember the Titans and Miracle, we've seen the studios make history come alive, yet the current focus for many sports movies is moving out of the arena and going behind the scenes of the athletic world. Today I share my thoughts on Million Dollar Arm, another addition to the baseball movie franchise. . Now we all know Disney, they like to open up a film, most of the time, by showing the protagonist being down on their luck, and this film is no different. After a client decides to look at a different company to sponsor him, JB (Jon Hamm) is forced to take a gamble on recruiting the first Major League players from India. With the help of his crew, he manages to find Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal), two boys with big dreams and big hearts, who are forced to take a trip that will challenge all of their characters. Will they do it? I'm not telling you, but Disney has combined a variety of things to make a great story for you to enjoy. First thing to mention is the blending of cultures. Director Craig Gillepsie has crafted a film that shows off the lifestyles of both Americans and Indians alike. The comparison and contrast of these cultures is beautifully captured on film, often accompanied by a score that compliments the customs and feel of the scene. While Disney still has a way of adding sappy, everything is happy moments; they alleviate such antics with comedy relief, often throwing insults to both cultures in a classy way that keeps the movie fun. This balanced blend is much appreciated, as it keeps the movie fresh and avoids making the movie a two-hour snooze fest. However the cinematography is not just about showing off the unique settings, but also assisting in bringing the characters to life. Of course acting helps with characters as well, and Million Dollar Arm has a strong cast to support the story. Hamm has the most dynamic role, forced to transition between various qualities, as his character evolves over the course of the film. Sharma and Mittal, do a nice job playing the boys discovering a new world who bear a heavy weight of making their country/families proud. Pitobash and Alan Arkin are the comedy stars, each delivering the lines with well-timed emphasis that adds the kick to make the scene funny, especially when it's not beaten over your head (take notes people, more doesn't mean better). Finally the lovely Lake Bell cleans up for the main crew. A combination of beauty and acting, Bell's character Brenda provides confidence, rationality, and fun that makes you feel energized no matter what consequences may arise. The chemistry between all of them is incredible, and very balanced to craft a family you will fall in love with. Of course this is a Disney movie and that means, especially when it comes to real life movies, inspirational moments. Million Dollar Arm is filled to the brim with moments that will make you want to go out and fight for your dreams. As custom to Disney, these scenes are often elaborate, with great emphasis on the characters challenges, struggles, or skills. Close ups on their faces are often followed by sequences of audience members watching in suspense, including skeptical scouts and coaches, trying to bring you into the scene. And of course, Disney quickly offsets such suspense, with a light hearted gimmick that helps relieve the tension you might be feeling. Such feel good moments are old hat for Disney, especially with the music score they choose to play alongside the scene, but at the end of the movie you will get a warm feeling in your heart that might bring a tear to your eye. Yet like their heartwarming scenes, Million Dollar Arm is a predictable story filled with obvious foreshadowing and build-up to what comes next. Those who don't pay attention to obvious cues may be surprised by the outcomes, but otherwise don't expect many twists in this story. Also the stakes for failure seem to be high in the movie, yet when they actually fail, the consequences do not reflect the tone the characters make and are often blown over. Perhaps it's because they wanted a quicker movie, or perhaps just wanted to keep it upbeat, but there is a lack of bite to this film. Even when JB goofs up and upsets his 'family' there is no edge, just quick a resolve that makes everything suddenly okay. A final, minor weakness, is that this movie is like all the other Disney sports movies you've seen. The formula is still the same and the lack of a new approach takes away the uniqueness of the filmRegardless of the weaknesses, Million Dollar Arm is a good movie that is great for audiences of all ages. The chemistry between the actors should pull you into their little group, having you root for the team, as they embark on their journey. Throw in the comedy and a little love story, and you've got something for everyone to enjoy. Yes, it's still Disney's 'magical' approach to everything, but I assure you that this movie will put a smile on your face and entertain you nonetheless. So if you're looking for a film this weekend, I give two thumbs up for Million Dollar Arm! My scores are:Biography/Drama/Sports: 7.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",8,5,7,17 May 2014
First Man," Artistic, Out Of This World Portrayal, But Not The Most Entertaining
","Reaching to the stars, traveling through the final frontier, and making contact with the unknown is what the science fiction authors are all about. To think that the dream was realized years ago is a feat many still to this day question. Tonight, my review is about the adventure to the stars and the men who led the way. Wrapping up my revies this week, tonight yours truly analyzes the largely advertised, potentially award winning, biography about Neal Armstrong entitled: Movie: First Man (2018)Director:
 Damien Chazelle
Writers:
 Josh Singer (screenplay by), James R. Hansen (based on the book by) 
Stars:
 Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Jason Clarke
LIKES: The Acting: A big role like this requires big talent and Gosling has stepped up to the new psychologically heavy, portrayal of the man who journeyed to the stars. His depth portrayal of the role is top notch, a balance of a dramatized role that feels realistic and very reflective of the psyche of space travel. Claire Foy on the other hand drops into a very regal and strong role, expressing the other side of the coin as the wife of an astronaut. Their chemistry works together, and the focus on each one leads to amazing performances that makes for endearing characters. The Immersive Experience: You want to feel like you are blasting off into space? You've got it! You want to feel like you are being strained by an overwhelming array of G Force? You've got it. You want? Okay I think you get it. First Man's team did their best to get you strapped into the space exploration experience and did a fine job in my opinion. One will feel like they are experiencing this first hand, with a screen that rattles, sound effects that dropped you into the heart of the mission, and a number of technical terms to further enroll you in the experience. The Setting: I'm a sucker for movies successfully taking you back in time. First Man takes us back into the time period of the 60s, bringing the cars, looks, houses, and hairstyles to really bring you into the decade of exploration. First Man keeps all the themes rolling and adds that extra bit of magic by introducing a gritty filter to help you achieve the effects of watching the events through the new reels of yore. This may not seem super cool or necessary, but that extra nostalgia helps pull the experience to new heights so nice work there. Unique Approach: First Man decides to go a little more abstract in its presentation than the normal historical documentary. A realistic portrayal with minimal magic, First Man is always about taking an event and then having you reflect on it. The result is a psychological trial of experiencing the stress of this field of research, that helps with experiencing the historical prowess of this space travel. While this approach will not be for everyone, it gets points for making an effort to be unique and artistic while also to the point. The Portrayal of Struggle: I agree with my fellow audience members that First Man did a fantastic job expressing the difficulties of getting this mission off the ground. From the failures of the testing modules, the setbacks of equipment burning out, and to the very stresses of the rocket itself, all of it is nicely detailed in this movie. You'll not be subjected to montages or magical findings, but instead get the bare facts to provide the full on knowledge of the issues this program faced. 
DISLIKES: Other characters: It's not that the other characters are bad, it's the fact that they aren't utilized as well as I wanted. Much of Armstrong's group, with the exception of the wife, are only fragments of the story overall. I wanted to see more interactions with them, get their input and contributions to the story, instead of the dram filled moping they chose to focus on. Why they did this I don't know, but I believe the abstract approach has much to do with this. The Heavy Jargon: I mentioned earlier how the movie immerses you and sadly it does this a little too well. The special effects drown out a lot of meaningful conversation in this movie, reducing the lines to mumbling, incoherent rants that aren't easy to follow. Even for what you can hear, the movie relies very heavily on jargon and technical lingo, which if you don't subscribe to physics or rocket science may not be the most interesting thing to listen to. Mindset vs Program: The abstract direction taken in this movie works for getting into the head of the characters, and you'll get plenty of shots of Gosling trapped in his mind, moping in a teary-eyed mess as he relives his experiences. It's beautiful artistically, but it's not the most entertaining as I came to see more of the design to get to the moon. Like Hidden Figures I wanted character development and integration than psychological reflection that a book is better at hitting. Regardless, this approach didn't quite work in terms of my expectations or entertainment valueDragging Pace: The biggest thing for me... is this movie is slow at times. It has to do with how long it takes for us to get into the meat of the program, only to be then be dogged down by more personal life components than the exciting tests you want to see. As such, this constant up and down presentation that didn't quite work for me and had me fighting sleep at times. The VERDICT:  First Man is different from what I expected. It's unique presentation is going to be the make or break for modern audiences and whether or not they will enjoy this movie. Those looking for a realistic, well-acted, artistic, immersive approach will enjoy the historical representation of this movie. However, if you wanted that Hollywood magic, entertainment, and more like a story presentation, than this film is not going to be your cup of tea. First Man is certainly a piece of work, but it all depends on the type of experience you want. Worth a trip to the theater? I think so for the effects and the food for thought, but otherwise hold out until next week when blockbusters return. 
My scores: Biography/Drama: 8.0

Men in Black 3," Is it worth the Time?
","It's been a few years since I saw a Will Smith movie that didn't involve him being bitter or depressed. However, this weekend Mr. Smith stepped back into his role as Agent J, the Man In Black with an attitude. Now although I love the first Men In Black and I was okay with it's sequel, I had my doubts about this third movie. After all not many sequels have proved their worth. Does Men In Black fall into the same category, or is it one of the few sequels that actually worth seeing in the theaters? Read on to find out.What could the world's best alien busting team possibly have left to do? Time travel of course, and Men In Black is full of time jumping goodness. In case you haven't seen the trailer, MIB 3 has J (Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) once again teaming up to investigate the extraterrestrial crime ring, while also ironing out their own personal issues. However, K gets taken for a little time trip and disappears from the world with only J having any recollection. J refuses to let his partner fade into the abyss, and instead decides to do a little time jumping himself eventually meeting the younger version of his partner (Josh Brolin).Call me a sucker for science fiction, but MIB 3 was perhaps one of the better sequels I have seen in a long time. Smith and Brolin did a fantastic job in this movie, both still recapturing the classic teamwork of the original MIB. When they aren't working together though both actors play their characters well. Smith still has the same sarcasm and one-liners to make you laugh, while Brolin captures that stonewall dry humor that is both funny and driving at the same time. Jones on the other hand has a more limited role in the film than I anticipated. Although he plays a key part in the story, Jones actually doesn't get that much screen time in the film, which is quite a shame as I really enjoy his role as the monotone agent who shows little emotion. Regardless of the acting though, the story was much better than the one we saw in MIB 2. Amidst the constant comedy of J's clumsiness and spunk, lies a tale that is heartwarming, sentimental, and quite fun. Now don't get me wrong this movie didn't have the most original plot, and it was fairly predictable with only the slightest twist here and there. Still this movie had a little bit of something for everyone. A few exciting fight scenes, some fast paced chases, and some witty use of technology are all in this movie, and should be quite entertaining to the audience. The team did a nice job bringing the extraterrestrial world to life, with all the gadgets, lasers, and alien goo looking fairly real. Yet one can definitely tell they designed their camera work to bring out the most with 3-D technology. However, another thing that helped keep this film interesting was the villain Boris (Jemaine Clement). Unlike MIB2's main villain, Boris had an edge that made him feel more of a threat. His personal vendetta with MIB was also a tad more exciting and better integrated that made a more exciting story. Boris though had a voice that was more humorous than threatening, which was probably exactly what they were going for. Though for this reviewer there will be no villain that can replace Edgar the bug from the first MIB. There are some things I was missing in this installment of the series though. For one thing some of the classic characters were missing in this film, or only had a few seconds in the movie. Although new characters like Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Agent O (Emma Thompson) are welcome additions, there are some characters that shouldn't have been removed. A second weakness is the 3-D shots, which were a little over-dramatic at some points. I really don't like this new 3-D obsession as too many movie focus on shooting in that style and sacrifice other areas of the movie. I guess those are really the only two weaknesses I could pick up in the movie. MIB 3 is definitely a fun adventure that many veteran fans will enjoy. The directing team went back to the roots of the original to correct the mistakes of the second installment. I definitely give this movie a recommendation for a trip to the theater, but I haven't figured out if it is worth the 3-D showing. For this sequel, I give the following scores:Action/Comedy/Sci Fi: 8.0 Movie overall: 7.0-7.5Until my next review my friends, this is Robbie K signing off.",7,3,8,25 May 2012
The Finest Hours," A Fine Movie, but Not Unique Enough
","The Finest Hours, yet another heroic tale about individuals who defy the limits of nature to pull off miracles. Disney certainly enjoys capitalizing on these tales in the early seasons don't they? Chis Pine leads the cast in this story about a small band of coast guards ordered to brave a massive storm to rescue a crew onboard a capsizing tanker. Can this inspirational drama stand out from the sea of other similar tales, or has Disney just pumped out another feat of mediocrity in an effort to obtain money? Let's analyze shall we?When it comes to a drama like this an engaging tale is required as the backbone of the movie. Fortunately the Finest Hours manages to accomplish this by taking a straightforward plot and presenting it in fantastic way. The film follows the whole incident from three different perspectives that intertwine across the full two hours. This dynamic approach gave you the full picture and continued to spice things up as they illustrated the dangers faced on all fronts. As such, there is sure to be some part of the tale that audiences will enjoy that will bait your attention in this straightforward tale. Unfortunately, the tale is very predictable and lacked suspense for me, especially knowing the outcome thanks to the trailers with only the ambiguity of who would survive the ordeal. At least the love component is not to mushy to become cheesy and annoying so that's an added benefit. Let's jump to the acting now. Chris Pine grabs the part by the horns and takes it full throttle. His portrayal of Bernie Webber was a nice balance between bravery and hesitation as he tackles the challenges before him. While his accent is funny to hear at first, it eventually grows on you and adds some endearment to the character. Holliday Grainger's portrayal of Miriam was okay, a nice portrayal of a strong, brave woman whose verbal and non-verbal acting brought the courageous nature of this woman to life. However, the trailers made her out to be more involved with the process and I was disappointed with her limited interactions in the film. But best actor in this film goes to Casey Affleck, who played the deepest role of the bunch as the chief engineer. The emotions to which he had to balance were challenging, but I feel Affleck kept the character grounded and realistic on all fronts, thereby making his feats all the more impressive. All the other actors hit their mark well, but there are too many to cast in such a short amount of space. Perhaps the strongest quality of the movie though is the cinematic magic and special effects that brought the true suspense. The Finest Hours' computer animation is on point, with the deadly snow storm brought to life with high-definition details and incredible sound editing. I was brought into the storm, feeling the misery and despair the foreboding nor'easter brought to our sailors as the fury of the sea was unleashed. In the belly of the tanker, the chaos of sinking ship was brilliantly recreated that didn't involve the over use of pyrotechnics and explosions (take a hint Michael Bay). Special effects aside the cinematography was a key aspect in bringing the emotions to the scenes. Our cast of characters do a nice job delivering their lines, but it's the nonverbal acting that really delivers the punch. The camera-work is stable through and through (again pay attention Bay) and captures all the detail despite the aggressive winds and waves. And the symphony soundtrack only adds an extra kick to subtly make the scenes complete. The Finest Hours is certainly not the most original, or unique movie from Disney's collective vault. However, while it is not the most entertaining tale, it does highlight the important qualities of faith, duty, honor, and a slew of other morals that people harp on. The visual effects of this studio are certainly the highlight of this movie, which may be further enhanced by a 3-D showing. Overall, I'm satisfied with the work Disney studios did and feel this a movie most will enjoy. My recommendations for audience members who will like it are: older generations from that time period, fans of inspirational tales, and those who appreciate good cinema magic. I also believe this movie is worth a trip to the theater, thanks to the cinematic qualities. My scores overall: Action/Drama/History: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",7,2,10,31 January 2016
The Equalizer," Graphic Kills, Story Lacks Thrills or Surprises
","When you have a Denzel Washington movie you can be sure that fans are going to flock into the theaters to see the legend himself. Today I went back into the trenches of the local theater to watch Mr. Washington's latest adventure entitled the Equalizer. This film based on a television series from the past, has promised some dark justice being served in the streets of New York City with the hint of action that many movie goers have come to expect. Yet is this just another knockoff Taken, or is there actually something that helps this movie stick out? For those who haven't seen the trailers, The Equalizer's plot is about Robert McCall, a retired special forces agent, who chooses a simpler life of working and reading after some major life event. Of course, the dark world that he dove into seldom leaves it's denizens alone, and McCall finds himself back into the bowels of darkness to correct the problems at hand. And just like the trailers promise, this movie is indeed dark in nature. After a rather drawn out introduction into the world, the first mission, as seen in the trailer, rips off the training wheels and throws you into throngs of violence. Using the power of quick observation, a knock off of Sherlock Holmes, Washington brings his skills of improvised weapons use on to the screen. While this is clever, and quite awesome, the downside is the amount of gore that follows his moves, and the areas to which those devices are inserted. Should you go see this film, there is hardly any censorship in this film, but instead an eyeful of sharp objects being slowly jammed into the unfortunate victims. What makes it even worse, is the sounds the victims make, especially during the prolonged moments where the victim seems to be savoring the kill. Some of course will like this, but for this reviewer there is a limit to how much hostility one can take in a movie. Unfortunately this scene is not isolated, as the carnage and suffering only get more intense with each body added to the count. Intense suffering aside, the next component that you might be wondering about is the action that is promised in the film. So what about it? Well it depends on what you define as action. If you are thinking of action like Taken, where our 'hero' moves through the setting with superhuman reflexes, firing bullets with one hit kill accuracy that many gamers would kill for, then you will be disappointed. Instead this action is a bit more conserved, focusing more on using his mind then tearing up the bad guys with force. Sure McCall has some moves that you want to see, especially close up, martial arts moves to disable the weapon from their hands. Yet the fight scenes often involve slamming someone's face viciously into an object, and are over in a matter of seconds from the beginning. Such brief spurts of action, were fine, but for an action movie I had expected a little more excitement and a little less torture. At the end, the battle was a little more to my expectations, though still filled with gruesome kills, some of which, I have to admit, were pretty sweet to see, sort of like Home Alone meets the Punisher. No matter what the scene is though, Denzel Washington brings the edge that you expected to see, so much that a few in the audience yelled, 'He is such a badÂ…' well I won't finish that quote. What else is there to say about this movie? You can pretty much guess that it is all about Denzel, with just about every scene having the legend in it. Luckily his acting is still top notch, and brings a lot to the movie in just his character. As for the story, well it's alright in some places, but for the most part it's rather plain. The main plot itself has very little sustenance, with what seemed to be a slight attempt to interlock the cases with a big mafia group. It failed for me though, and the mafia group became nothing more, than more bodies for Denzel to pile up. Denzel's character has little story development, the fragments we get hastily explained and sometimes ill-timed that it loses any value. Perhaps the only thing that really develops his character, is his 'fight' to fall back into the soulless monster he was prior to the movie as he doles out justice. Yes, one will feel a mixture of emotions at the bad guys getting their just desserts, but aside from that there isn't much emotional stimulation behind this film. As for the dialog and humor, they are not strong enough to make up for the story. References to classic literature being integrated into the morals was a plus for me, a nice twist to the typical, overdramatic scenes we often get. Yet these heart filled moments are offset by yet another curse laden dialogue that seems to become the common trend. Guess they will never learn huh? Overall The Equalizer is an okay film, but failed for me on on a lot of levels. Fans who will enjoy this the most are those who think Denzel can do no wrong, and those who just want dark, twisted kills. The legendary actor still impresses me with his commitment, but for this reviewer, Mr. Washington cannot carry this movie for an entire two hours. My scores for this film are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",7,1,6,27 September 2014
The Expendables 2," Surprisingly Good Sequel, Though Still Needs Some Actor Balance Work
","It seems not long ago that testosterone the movie, I mean Guy Flick, I mean the Expendables came out. This action packed, adrenaline pumping, gun shooting, etc. adventure was the most popular movie among guys. Yes, all of the greatest action stars came together to make that movie, though Sylvester Stallone hogged most of the screen time and did most of the work. So when I saw the sequel's trailer months ago I was a little excited, though worried that this movie would be mainly another glorification to the aging actor. Were my fears and concerns justified or did the movie actually do what it was supposed to do this time. Read on to find out.Let's face it, with this many action stars there is going to be very little story in this movie. The motif for all the killing in this film is essentially revenge and nothing more, so those looking for one should stay home. To my surprise however, the film did add a little more background to the team in this film (though not much) to give them additional features to help them stand out. Most people who go see this movie though probably don't care about character development so long as they get the action they are promised. Well my friends, Expendables 2 has plenty of action throughout the movie that will make guys pump their fists in victory, well in parts that is. Though I haven't seen the first film in a while, I believe this sequel has more breaks in the action than its predecessor. After an amazing opening fight, where the team has the accuracy FPS gamers can only dream of, the team shifts gears into a nice hike/plane ride. Although a few skirmishes happen here and there, the action doesn't pick back up until the end in an explosive shower of guns. Despite the slow pace and attempt at story, the first and last battles have more than enough action to keep you stoked for a couple of weeks. You may wonder if the action or violence has been cut down because of the PG-13 rating. Relax my friends; you have nothing to worry about as there are plenty of exploding heads, blood, and awesome take downs in this movie. The only thing the PG-13 movie took away was the overuse of the F word, nudity, and a lack of corny sexual innuendos that we've been hit over the head with this summer, which is such a shame (sarcasm). With the action living up to par, the next thing to address is the balance of stars in this movie. Unfortunately despite the two years they have had to improve, the movie still focuses on Stallone's character as he again has most of the screen time. The first battle had all the squad members doing something cool to complete the mission and show off their impressive skills. Past that though, the directors decided to scrap two of the characters and replace them with Stallone's mug just frowning. Fans of Jet Li and Liam Hemsworth will need to soak up their parts at the beginning, because they soon leave the movie to make room for the newbies of the film. Jason Statham fans, however, will be thrilled to see English star continue to kick butt. The rest of the rag tag crew have some decent scenes, a lot better than the first one, but they still don't hold a candle to Stallone's face time. I even began to fear that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris were going to get the shaft. Luckily the ending battle prevents the audience from getting cheated out of its money, well mostly that is. As for Jean-Claude Van Damme , he is really only good for a couple of spin kicks and some unemotional acting, which is a shame. What else can I say about this film? One enjoyable thing to mention is the numerous references to the stars' other movies. The Expendables' banter loves to use well timed, often over exaggerated, quotes from films like Terminator, Die Hard, or Rambo. Yes I did laugh at these lines, but some of them had me rolling my eyes after the third for fourth time. If you pay attention you may find other references to movies in this film, one of which should remind you of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The dialogue is also full of puns that may have you chuckling if you are in the mood, especially the heads up line. Another aspect I'm proud to announce is that for an action movie the camera work is rather stable. What does this mean to an action lover? It means you get all the messy details the action team wanted you to see. That's right it means instead of getting camera work that looks like it was filmed during an earthquake, Expendables 2's camera men managed to find ways to keep the camera stable and smooth. Combined with some good editing and some close ups of our heroes, the film crew achieved their goal of adventure, though I wonder if they asked Michael Bay for some their explosive. Overall Expendables 2 is a decent sequel, but the team still has work to do for the third movie that is probably on its way. In particular I would like to see more of the other action stars than Stallone; otherwise they should just name the movie Rambo 5 and call it a day. Is it worth a trip to the movies? This action lover says yes as the surround sound, big screen experience makes the adventure come to life even more. However, if you would rather skip this flick because of what it lacks, rent it on Netflix at least. The scores for this film are the following: Action/Adventure: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",Null,2,9,17 August 2012
War Dogs," War Meets Wolf of Wall street: Teller and Hill Take On Politics
","Robbie K here, starting the weekend off with what elseÂ…a movie review. Tonight we jump into the political drama movie that is about our beloved country and those who try to cheat the system to make excessive amounts of cash. So lets bump past the formalities and dive right into my thoughts on War Dogs starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller! LIKES: Â• Good chemistry between actors Â• Interesting story Â• Comedy is wittyWhen I saw the trailers for this movie, I shuddered to think of the mess this movie could potentially be. After all, both of the actors (while talented) had not been in any roles that I absolutely loved. Therefore I was nervous to see these cast together and the potential stupidity/annoyance that could have been. To my surprise, these two were great together, having a dynamic relationship that sold the characters to me. Hill's brash, aggressive nature led the charge of the movie, but was able to be toned down by Teller's calm, intelligent, and more mature role. Each one was able to balance the others extremes and certainly felt like two coworkers/friends cheating the system. Once more I say that alone these guys were good, but together they were excellent. While the relationship is certainly the driving force of the movie, the story helps keep the pace and suspense going. The story is exactly as sold in the trailers of two young men giving up their mundane jobs to begin selling weapons across the country. Unlike other gun running movies, this film abandons the frontlines for the bank, and feels much like another rendition of the Wolf of Wall Street. Todd Phillips and his team integrated the lives of our characters well into the story while still adding an edge of threat to keep you wondering what would interfere. The many moving pieces keep one engaged in the movie, and while there were components I felt under developed, had enough detail in each to bring things together. Finally the comedy, I was expecting the comedy to be nothing more than a bunch of one-liners and facial expressions to make the next wave of memes. Truth isÂ…there are plenty of these moments, but surprisingly there is some rather witty dialogue that had me laughing. In particular the banter between the two held plenty of clever insults and jabs at American stereotypes. Hill's character in particular had more lines I found funny, mainly by his delivery, but Teller's responses to those lines also assisted with that factor. All-in-all, the comedy has all of the insult and stupidity you expect, but is delivered so well. DISLIKES: Â• Wanted more Ana De Armas moments Â• The F word and comedic antics getting old Â• Underdeveloped parts and the endingMy first dislike is the limitation of Ana De Armas' character. I won't lie, she is a beautiful woman and was very nice to have on screen (hey I am human after all). But I also really liked her character and how she drove the morals of the story despite all the corruption in this film. That goodness could have really refreshed the movie at some of the slower parts and they could have injected some more suspense in the film by having her in the film. Perhaps she isn't the most key character in this war/crime drama, but hey it couldn't have hurtÂ…I think. To sound like a broken record, the F word does not equal great dialogue or great writing. Yet Hollywood still can't get that idea through their skulls. War Dogs has moments where it is just one bomb dropped after another, which may not bother you much. Still this reviewer would love the strategic use of the word to maximize its comedy potential, instead of replaying the ploy much like a Hallmark Channel Christmas movie. The same can be said for the comedic ploys in this film, some of which are again beaten to death without much remorse. Jonah Hill's laugh (which sounded like a mixture between the joker and a donkey) in particular grew stale to me and was more annoying by the tenth time it escaped its lips. Fortunately, there aren't too many of these stale antics plaguing the riding. My final limitation was the underdeveloped components of the film. I've already stated the Ana De Armas parts, but there were other components I felt were in need of some fine tuning. The Bradley Cooper character I expected to have a bigger role for the price tag he carries and the way they snuck under the government's nose was a bit far-fetched as well. In addition, the fact that this is all based on a Rolling Stone article left me wondering how much was true and how much of this was Hollywood magic and fantasy. And as for the ending, it is a little lackluster and I would have thought more ploy, drama, and actual footage would have been in the film. Not to mention the final scene was ambiguous and unnecessary. The VERDICTWar Dogs was much better than I expected and really portrays the actions some may take to make a quick buck. While certainly not the most original or entertaining movie, the engaging characters will keep you entertained and the dialogue will have you laughing. However, these qualities are not enough to recommend a trip to the theater for most of the audience members. Only those with great capitalistic pride and who don't mind American political jabs should venture into this movie, otherwise wait for the Redbox rent.

Source Code," Much better than expected
","At first I was expecting the source code to be a mediocre mystery that was all about reviving a dead girl. However, this was not the case at all in this movie, which was a welcome change. The Source code was a thriller that was constantly moving, constantly generating questions, and keeping the movie interesting. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the variety of traits the main character, Gylenhall, shows in the movie who has a strong sense of justice, duty, honor, and love. Unlike some movies, the main character is not an idiot pilot, and has considerable knowledge of a variety of topics, one being quantum theory. Another positive quality of this movie, is how each visit in the source code continues to build up to the climax of the movie. The constant search for new pieces of evidence is also intertwined with constant character development of the protagonist allowing you to get a better attachment to the character. Another thing I found fun was each time he came out of the code, the character and story development continue to take place, again driving the action. Now let's talk about some weaknesses of the movie: One big thing is the protagonist seems to be too perfect, his collective traits of knowing advanced quantum theory make him a little unbelievable. A second thing is the explanation and ending may be too complicated or too unreal for some audience members, though I did enjoy the ending that took place. The third flaw has been present ever since the trailer came out in which the person who bombed the train is also planning to make another attack. As a result, this automatically narrows the suspects on the train. If you keep thinking during the movie then you can figure out who it is within probably two or three visits to the code. Regardless of the weaknesses, the thought, development, and constant pace are more than enough to keep you entertained and happy. At the same time it also has some good morals built in about finding true happiness and working through the negatives of the world. Thus overall I would give this movie an 8.5-9 on my scale. I hope you enjoy as well.",9,55,90,2 April 2011
Skyfall," For Me Much Better than Quantum
","This weekend the latest Bond film released and from the reports seems to already making nice money. For this reviewer though, my excitement was relatively low after watching Quatum of Solace so many years ago. Still a couple of friends and I caught the afternoon showing with the hopes that the franchise would make up for their previous work. I'm happy to say that our hopes were not dashed as Skyfall impressed us and renewed our faith in the series. If you're up for hearing my highlights read on as we dive into Daniel Craig's latest film. For those who have been in the dark, Skyfall starts with Bond (Craig) on another adrenaline fueled mission to recover a hard drive containing all the agents' identity. As seen in the trailer, a fellow agent named Eve (Naomie Harris) follows orders and supposedly send James down the river. However, like an ignorant stain that Bond returns once more after a threat to M (Judi Dench) 's life. The culprit of this crime is a rogue agent by the name of Silva (Javier Bardem)who has a personal vendetta to take out the head of MI6, in hopes of achieving his insane goals. The summary of the trailer is pretty much the story of this film, so don't expect too many twists and turns to come up in this film. It's simply a plot for revenge for previous acts, that while fun and quick really lacks any Bond Finesse. Those seeking the classic spy mystery and information gathering may be disappointed, as this Bond continues to move towards the action franchise. However, there is a bit of backstory to help keep things interesting, as we uncover more of James' past, and learn a little more about the dark side of M, at least pertaining to Silva. A few other events unfold in the movie, but most of them I saw coming from the earlier events in the movie. Perhaps the only thing you might be wondering in this movie is the tie in to the title, as every bond movie has some connection to it. Don't really care about the complexity of the story? Well then do you care about action, because this movie has got it going on. Bond's move have gotten more bad@$$ as he ages, trading in the typical one shot running kills, for a little more martial arts and more intense shootouts. Want proof? Okay, the first ten minutes of the movie is an intense chase, mixed with a touch of shooting, a little ingenuity, and a pinch of a fist fight all brilliantly captured to keep you in the loop. I was on the edge of my seat with excitement as I watched everything unfold, appreciating the fast pace to start the film off with a bang. The only downfall was that after such a pumping start, you feel the crash afterward, but not for too long as the action continued to occur throughout the movie. While all of them have impressive moves, these scenes are only a fraction of the time. For me these were small doses that led up to the grand finale at the end, that were just enough to break away from the dry conversation, but not overdone to have you rolling your eyes. Patience pays off though, as the final scene is filled with enough ingenuity, stunts, and suspense to reward the audience. Putting the action aside, Skyfall takes a few nostalgic turns back in time that fans will appreciate. The dialog itself contained a few classic lines that will make you chuckle, or at least make you respect the movie even more. Putting the bond references to the side, Skyfall's dialog is just funny itself, as the rivalry between the characters provides openings for insults, sarcasm, and other quips to keep one entertained. However, the biggest Bond nostalgia comes in the gadgets, but I'm not really going to say much as I'll ruin it. Regardless, keep your eyes open as I'm sure there are plenty of things I missed that others will pick up. As for the acting, well it's pretty much the same as the previous installments, good. Although not as suave or elegant as some of his predecessors, Craig has the killer edge to make him a good agent. I was impressed not only with his moves, but also his ability to deliver his quips with just enough emphasis to make his intentions known. Dench as well stays strong to the role, using her British background to keep the pride of the old program head alive. Like Craig, she too has just the right emotion in her words to make it feel real, and not an overacted dribble, though fans might not expect to see her fight, which was a surprise to me. Continuing on Bardem did a good job playing an emotionally disturbed, though creepy bad guy. His voice in particular had the calm collected edge to give you the creeps without going into a screaming rant, or some other stereotypical villain. Unfortunately, the directors made his calling card a little too plain for my tastes, which took the edge off of this villain for me. Well that and the fact he didn't do much other than send in thugs, and do computer hacking, which although smart was a little less flashy from the other villains. Skyfall is perhaps the first bond movie in a long time I would go see again. With a fast paced story, lots of action, and countless classic references this movie is a nice balance and a good step up. My only hope is with all the changes this one makes, there will be new challenges they will have to face. There is still plenty of things to say, but I'm reaching my limit so to wrap it up: it's worth seeing in theaters. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Crime: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",8,7,18,9 November 2012
Deepwater Horizon," Dive Deep Into The Horizon Of Flames
","What is it about disasters that we enjoy watching? I could come up with a number of reasons, but the bottom line is that Hollywood has shifted to dramatizing former events as a means for more movies. Hi, Robbie K here bringing you another review of the latest films to grace the screen. Tonight we hit Deepwater Horizon starring Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and a handful of other actors. Let's get started. LIKES: Â• Great acting Â• Over the top graphics Â• Emotionally stimulatingYou might be thinking that I have gone crazy, after all Wahlberg hasn't had the greatest roles. Deepwater Horizon breaks the mediocre streak and drops him into a position that may net him an Oscar nomination. Wahlberg's portrayal of Mike Williams is certainly a heroic one filled with wisdom, strength, and a calm edge that sets the stage for a natural leader. But there is also a realistic side brought out near the second half the screen that balances out the heroic theatrics of Hollywood. Kurt Russell no surprise plays his usual rugged role, making sure to add the hard edge testosterone rush all older actors need to bring. Hudson and Malkovich get A's as well, each bringing the needed involvement to round out the cast. All the extras and lesser billed roles complete the picture as a close oil crew, but much of their time is spent standing around or ducking from fire. Speaking of fire, the visual effects are top notch in terms of computer graphic imaging. Deepwater Horizon's reconstruction of an oil rig succumbing to its doom is very realistic. For you technical folks, the directors have crafted scenes to mimic the daily operations involved with pumping oil, from watching gritty mud flow through the pipe to the cracking foundation floor. That sound boring? Well those looking for a little more suspense will be impressed when the whole operation blows to piecesÂ…literally. You might be amazed seeing the rig, and its crew, get covered in oil before erupting into a fiery inferno you've seen in the trailers. My friend described the visuals being so good, he felt immersed into the disaster, wanting to duck or dive as explosions rattled the screen. Of course the real magic to the visual effects are the emotions it brings with it. The various sequences and montages of the exploding metal certainly paints a terrifying picture as you wonder how much time is left until something falls. Now add our characters trying to traverse the obstacle course from heck, feeling horrifying chills run through your body as you watch human bodies hurled through the air and disturbing injuries protruding in gory details. However, it is not all dismay and dread, no Deepwater Horizon has plenty of sequences and montages of heroism that will make you a little proud to be a humanÂ…no matter how overly theatrical it could be. DISLIKES: Â• Overdramatic at times Â• Already know the ending Â• Editing needs workI'm probably sounding overcritical or nonsensical, but here it goes anyway. Deepwater Horizon is at times a bit on the overdramatic side. As I said, much of the movie will light a fire in your soul that will have your patriotism in full force. Unfortunately, some of these moments are a bit too fake and in your face to get my full backing, primarily making an effort to pan on the American flag flapping in the flames. Even the more heroic moments sometimes get a bit too corny, the overdramatic focus on the camera amid a symphony soundtrack blaring pride. Again, they get the message across and deliver the emotion, it just sometimes gets a little too Hollywood for me. The special effects and the noble protagonist will certainly spread suspense and awe, but it doesn't help that you know the ending. If you paid attention to the news, you know all about what happens to the rig, and if you choose to ignore history take a look at the trailer. The opening sequence doesn't help things either by telling you the fate of a certain character that further adds predictability to the mix. What does leave in terms of suspense and surprise? Pretty much it is the fate of the crew that held any mystery to me, and that was scarce at times. Perhaps another minor dislike, but still one nonetheless. In regards to the editing, this one is a tough call to make. On the one hand I appreciate the details they provide about the incident, from the development of the disaster to how they faced the inferno the rig became. And yet, I felt some of it was elaborated too much for my liking. The build up was a little too long and drawn out, making it slightly boring as we waited for the dirt to hit the pipe. As the oil begins to bloom into a fountain the pace picks up, but then hits a very slow, somewhat pointless, standstill at the aftermath of the situation. Yes, it provides realism and rounding out of the characters, but again is a little too extended after all the excitement. They probably could have spared about fifteen minutes, but hey that's just me. THE VERDICT:Despite this being the third historical event to get a movie this month, Deepwater Horizon will provide the emotional thrills you want. A fantastic CGI design that's brimming with emotion and suspense. However, the predictability and overdramatic moments fall in line with Hollywood's magic and takes away from the message of the movie. I have to recommend this one for the theater though, primarily for the technological achievements it brings. Overall my scores are:Action/Drama/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",8,88,125,29 September 2016
It," IT rocks
","Remakes, remakes, remakes. It seems every time you turn around, Hollywood is out once more make money by simply updating a previous hit. Often these remakes pale in comparison, but every once in a while, you get a film worthy of social media blow up and hype. This weekend, the highly anticipated, and over-advertised, IT remake crawls out of the studio shadows and attempts to make us face our fears. Can Hollywood bring King's famous work into the modern century of film, or will it merely make us scream in fright at horrible it is. Robbie K back from a two-week hiatus to bring you another review. Let's get started!LIKES:Creepy: Horror movies are supposed to be scary, and fans of my work know I love it when the studio crawls under my skin. IT has plenty of moments that creeped me out, primarily the use of shadows, sound, and those small details that teased the audience to the scares. A nice variety of tactics exists in this movie to make you squirm in your seat, all led by the deliciously evil Pennywise (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) and all his pasty white glory. One may find another of disturbing scenes in this movie, primarily in that cold, seeking stare he loves to use so much. Yes, It certainly mirrored the atmosphere portrayed in the book. Acting: Seldom do I say a horror film has good acting, but IT hit a home run with all the actors chosen to bring the characters to life. Instead of the usual airheaded, shallow characters who did nothing but scream and curse, this cast portrayed a much broader emotional roleÂ…while still cursing. This group did such a good job that I actually liked and invested energy into the characters, which isn't usually the case in modern horror cinema. While I can't give shout outs to each one, I certainly will give props to how much they sold the summer adventure to me, almost like Stranger Things meets the Goonies, with a little more demented atmosphere on top. Of course, the real props go to Skarsgard, whose portrayal as Pennywise is certainly a major part to the horror he brings. His delivery is incredible, that shadowy, whisper like voice that mimics the element of the movie. Throw the laugh and creepy body acting, to get the complete demonic nature of Pennywise. The Story: Stephen King knows how to write a story, and thank goodness, this director knew how to bring it to life. IT finally proves you can have a scary movie with a plot worth investing in. This version follows the book very well, managing to develop the characters, lay out the story, and still bring all the creepy parts into beautiful detail and length. The result is a more engaging movie, increased suspense, and an emotional roller coaster as you live the adventure through these kids. This aspect is my favorite component of the movie and certainly worth the price of admission, including the little revelation at the endÂ…which fans of the book will know. DISLIKES:More Suspense, Less Scares: IT might be creepy, but I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be. I, nor my friends, didn't jump at all. Despite creepy build-ups and a setting that welcomes scares, IT still has the same predictable foreshadowing that is used a little too often that it dilutes the big revelation. While it was certainly more suspenseful in regards to the adventure, I don't foresee myself getting nightmares from this movie. Unbalanced at times: IT has a lot of things perfectly done in this movie, but there are a few moments where they seemed to drop the ball on their characters. True, I haven't read the book in a long time, but I seemed to remember each kid having almost equal involvement in fighting the shapeshifting embodiment of fear. In this film though, I felt they dropped the characters at time to the backburner, choosing to focus on just three of the main characters. The Computer Effects: The past two dislikes are minor and just space filling, but the only major dislike was the CGI effects. When IT conforms into the more realistic entities crafted by makeup and costumes, I would feel grossed out, sickened, and get goosebumps. However, when the CGI moments came into play, the realism faded away to cheesy effects that were more humorous than terrifying. Sure, the creatures themselves would make anyone wet themselves, but their portrayal In this movie could have been maximized if they stuck to makeup effects. In addition, some of the convulsing moments were funny to watch, again due to the semi-realistic effects. While certainly not the worst visual effects, it could have used a little tune up to be honest. The VERDICT:IT proves that you can make a remake that doesn't stink and may actually be truer to the book. While not the scariest movie to haunt the theater, it is fantastically creepy and will certainly get your skin crawling. In addition, the acting and story are fully developed and bring about a wonderful tale that will keep you hooked into the movie wondering where the end of the adventure would be. Yes, the computer effects need a little work, but otherwise a solid addition to the horror genre and a worthy trip to the theater. My scores are:Drama/Horror: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9,7,17,8 September 2017
Hereditary," A Genetic Mutation in Horror, That Took Long To Execute With A Finale That Was Meh
","Robbie K here, ready to try and do another movie justice in his reviews and observations. Tonight's focus is on a horror movie that looked very disturbing, chilling to the bone, and potentially containing a high creep factor to really make you squirm in your seats. Yes, assuming you read the title of the movie on your way into this review I'm giving you my thoughts and observations on...Hereditary (2018)Director:
 Ari Aster
Writer:
 Ari Aster
Stars:
 Toni Collette, Milly Shapiro, Gabriel ByrneLIKES: 
Creepy: The trailers didn't lie, Hereditary is creepy as heck and not afraid to flaunt it in so many forms. While not loaded with jump scares that many love, Hereditary is all about using shadows and the edge of your vision to make you see things. It uses subtle sounds to keep you on the edge, and reveals just enough to keep you further engrossed in the thrills. Hereditary also is not afraid to cross the line to really get a reaction going, sometimes to the point of intensely disturbing visuals that one does not expect to see. Yet, my friends and I all agreed that the true creep factor comes from how realistic this movie is, at least at the beginning. The questions of how much is true and how much potential psychosis is helps depict some of the more extreme cases of mental illness and how dangerous and intense this disease can be. The Setting: A creepy movie requires a setting to bring it to life and this movie has got that going on for it too. The house is classic, semi isolated from town, with enough nooks and crannies to generate shadows that hide in the light. It's not these random temples or abandoned houses, but an actual lived in home that brings that realism to light and immerses you into the movie. And if you don't care about the creepy shadows and lights the movie holds, then just enjoy the beauty of the house, especially if you were dragged to the movie to begin with. 
Dynamic Story Changes: A fancy way of saying twisting transition, Hereditary's writer certainly new how to adjust the script to bring a different atmosphere with the movie. At first more of a psycho thriller with some potential horror elements, the movie manages to gradually fluctuate into other genres. It evolves into different types of horrors, and with it brings more levels of disturbing twists to begin to connect semi-vague pieces together. It certainly a bit haphazard and mashed like a play, but I give props for a writer willing to switch gears from time to time. In addition, some of the lengths they go to shake things up are certainly risky, but with it generating some reaction you weren't quite expecting. DISLIKES:Long: Heritage certainly does the job of tying up loose ends and making sure everything is explained (which of course is a like). Sadly, it takes a little too long to get to that point and in a very complex manner that is almost like going around your elbow to get to your thumb. The second act, and partially the third act, were very drawn out, boring to the point of trying to make these connections in a mask of coping mechanisms. Again, it's realism and portrayal are awesome, but as the direction of the movie starts to change, these weird transitions start to feel a bit too odd and not worth your time. The Goofy Faces: Some of the movie tried to bring some torturous reactions in the non-verbal acting. Poor Toni Collette came off with some rather goofy, perhaps unintentional, faces that were funny and looked more like being stoned or maybe getting brain freeze. Her son Peter (Alex Wolff) didn't turn out much better, as his own facial dynamics were, well goofy as well, primarily in that buck toothed, stoned look that was meant to be exhaustion. The Acting: Don't get me wrong, the acting was mostly decent, if not good, primarily in the portrayal of mental illness and fear. Yet there were times where hysterical crying, yelling, and blubbering were again a little too much and went down the wrong path. I'm not trying to pick on Wolff, but his hysterical crying was a little too forced for me and seemed incredibly fake compared to the rest of his performance. Why this gimmick was done more than once, not really known, but I can't say that it was a direction I would have taken. The Tongue Clicking: Not quite an as annoying as the trailers made it out, the use of the tongue clicking was decent at times, but a little over used. Whether it was the amplification by the speakers, or maybe just the excessive/random moments, this device started to grow annoyingly humorous and needed to stop. Thank goodness they got light of it and didn't bombard us too much with it. The Complexity: A complex plot makes you think, makes you question, and more importantly keeps you engaged. This movie accomplished those goals, but when the ending finally came through and the final transition happened, the complexity felt stupid and unneeded. Again, it supports the ending, but because of how much I didn't like the ending, this complexity just didn't feel the right direction to me outside of extending the film. Complexity can be good with a real good finish, (which some may like), but for this reviewer the ends didn't justify the means. The Ending: You saw this coming, but Hereditary's ending wasn't the one I had in mind from the trailers. A surprise can be good, but to quote my friends, the ending had completely leaped over the gap to another movie altogether that didn't quite fit all the way with the direction the first act did. It was almost like two screenwriters wrote the two halves, came together and tried to paste them together (even though there was supposedly only one writer). While the broad transitions will grip more people in, the movie's grand finale wasn't my cup of tea, though it may explain the disturbing steps this writer planned. And some of the end game decisions, rushed, pointless, and really not pleasant to look at (fans who see the movie will know what I'm talking about). The VERDICT:  The other reviews are right, this movie keeps you guessing, has a number of twists, is creepy and hard to stomach, and not afraid to go down the dark abyss to bring you shock. So, bravo in thinking outside the box and crafting a rather original tale with a dynamic component to it. Yet, this movie's tinkering with the plot was unnecessarily complex, with a few gimmicks/deliveries not really keeping in tone with the genre and the ends not justifying the lengthy journey I took to get there. If you like the Lords of Salem, you are going to enjoy the approach this movie takes, as it feels very similar in a lot of components. Yet, if you want a more linear, straightforward movie, hold your horses for later this year when other films are supposed to grace the silver screen.

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Cheesiness That Is Fun
","It seems that vampires have the ability to do anything they please. They can walk in the sun, bend the elements, and wield guns and swords like ninja warriors. This weekend they add yet another quality to their ever growing list starting the civil war. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter has opened this weekend and just as the title has suggested, there is a load of cheesy ideas to fill this movie. Was this like most vampire cheesiness though or does Abraham Lincoln's tale stand out? Read on and decide for yourself as I give some insight into the movie. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, for those of you who haven't seen the trailers, is a story that starts out with death. A vampire by the name of Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) murders Lincoln's mother as he watches in fear. Nine years later, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) attempts to avenge his mother by murdering the wise cracking vampire, only to fail his mission. However, a new ally named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) save Lincoln and trains him in the art of vampire slaying to prepare him for a bigger mission. That mission is to not eliminate one vampire, but a whole army that resides in the south who are planning to establish their empire one nation at a time. Now let's face it although the trailers have made it look really cool, the idea of our 16th president being the newest Buffy is a little out there. Yes it is supposed to be a satire on a classic tale, but honestly why vampires and not something else. Despite the cheesy ideas though, the production team did a clever job integrating their imagination with historical events. The underground railroad, the silver mining operation, and the civil war were all modified to have an undead twist to help create a new story that was although cheesy entertaining to watch. However, like most movies these days, the team sometimes stretches their creative minds too far, which results in some annoying/stupid ideas that make you roll your eyes. The varying dialog doesn't help much as the most in depth comes from Lincoln's various speeches and addresses that can be found in any textbook or historical site. Sure a few of the jokes and one liners are funny, but it is due more to irony one sees with Lincoln saying them. Perhaps the biggest strength of this movie is the action scenes, which for once has finally lived up to the trailers. Lincoln's moves are pretty sweet, and although it's hilarious and rather ridiculous to see the president hacking away, the moves are rather well shot. The various action scenes are diverse enough to keep the action fresh and fun, helping to give vampire slaying an edge that's been missing for quite some time. Lincoln uses his environment and hatchet to fulfill his hits, and most of the scenes are fast and exciting to bring one into the moment. Unfortunately for some, there is also some rather disturbing and graphic factors that I wish to warn you about. Those thinking of taking younger audience members may want to think twice as the countless close ups of vampires may have nightmare provoking faces and ear shattering screams that can scare you half silly. If you're one who gets sick from gore filled scenes then again avoid this movie as with nearly every swing follows a river of black blood. Yet another thing that seems to go hand in hand with action these days is the 300 technique of delayed motion. Like so many action scenes, Lincoln is filled with exaggerated swings and ducks that would put walking under water to shame. I can see two reasons for this overabundance of slow motion scenes. Number one is to help emphasize the finishing kills and help the audience feel the thrill of the final kill. The second reason, and perhaps the biggest reason, is many of the scenes were shot for 3-D. Whether it's throwing an axe, or a horizontal swing the movie has countless scenes to pop out of the audience, which in the 2-D version of the movie was lost on me. However, for those who love the technique, well drink up this movie and enjoy.I guess the last thing to comment on is the acting, which was okay but nothing special. Walker does a decent job capturing both the younger and older versions of Lincoln, acting rogue enough to be a hormonal teenager, yet calm enough to be the authoritative figure. As for Cooper, well he did a decent job playing the hunter as he captured the drifter/ranger character well. However, he also had numerous other emotions down and when the time called for him to show those emotions he delivers. The rest of the cast is fine and play their parts well, but I don't have much room left to comment on their strengths, since the acting isn't the strongest part of this movie.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an entertaining movie that is full of action and gore. Although the concept is rather ridiculous, it is worth a shot for any action lover or vampire movie watcher, though it is not a masterpiece. The clever integration of fiction into fact is worthy of applause, despite the rather predictable story. Perhaps the next time they do a movie like this though they find a better balance of using slow motion and perhaps even leave out the 3-D filming.

If I Stay," An Emotional, Moral Filled Tale
","Surprise, surprise another weekend, another movie based off of a book. I start my review off this evening with the latest popular drama entitled If I StayÂ… Why we have yet another somber, emotion engorged screenplay when we just had one, I will never know, but Hollywood is eating up the profits from movies like this. So with the hot little topic these movies are at the moment, I go once more into the dimly lit theater to determine if this movie is worth your hard earned money. What is my verdict? Like always, please read on to find out. The key factor that these movies go for is the ability to bring about some type of emotion. If I stay is no different, though in this flickÂ… you can pretty much guess what emotion is filling the screen. From the trailers, one should be prepared to go in for a tear jerker movie, filled with sad and morbid factors for the whole nine yards. In my theater, there were plenty of emotional fans crying, gasping, sobbing, and any other description you can think of as Mia (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) faces her trial of choosing to live. Before you turn away though, If I Stay surprisingly has some happy emotions to it as well, spread amongst the misery to help lighten the mood. Perhaps this is what kept me interested in the movie, as the delivery did a nice job balancing both happiness and sadness. Integrating the disaster amidst memories of Mia's life is a great approach, helping to establish and develop a backstory without giving it all away at the beginning. While I'm sure fans of the book already expected this, but I appreciated the development of the relationships with her family and friends, gradually building up to where the movie starts. The timing of these memories was spot on, each memory slightly deeper as Mia fights to hang on to life, using a different aspect of her life to carry on. Of course, the movie is full of morals about the various components of life, each done in an artistic fashion that is filled with glorified movie magic. One can certainly appreciate what the story has to teach, enough to oversee a little of the cheesiness in some of the scenes and dialog.Of course the balanced emotions are only one part of the strengths of this movie. The acting is not half bad, with Moretz doing a good job at playing the awkward girl role. Moretz is dynamic and I enjoy her broad spectrum of characters she can play and the way she brings her lines to life. In this role she gets to act like a real person, reacting to the situations life deals her as she tries to break out of her comfort zone. Yet, for me there was a little too much crying and weakness in this character, her drawn out rants of crying and screaming a bit taxing for my patience. Of course this fits with the theme of the movie though and helps one relate to the turmoil she is feeling. Playing her opposite is Jamie Blackley who is perhaps the central point in Mia's world. Blackley's character is an attempt to represent the wild, unruly side, but his character is more relaxed than wild. The audience will get more than their fill of his songs that fit well with the scene he brings to life. However, some of the songs are simply shoved down our throats in an attempt to promote the actor's talent at singing songs that sound all the same, (like a Taylor Swift album). Regardless, I like how real his character is, and not some extreme, high on life, rogue whose bad boy attitude has all the girls swooning. The rest of the cast was fine, and well fitted into the story, but they were all rotating around the giant love relationship in this movie. This brings me to the next part of the review, some of the weaker aspects of the movie. Despite the relationship being a little more realistic than others, it still has its moments of sheer fantasy and movie magic that sob lovers will enjoy. The predictable nature of the movie is also a bit old as well. While I did enjoy the balance of memories in the story, it was obvious where the tale was going with the underlying themes in it. Such predictability is overshadowed by the slow pace of this movie, as the lack of any exciting events leads to movie to be slightly boring. I'm still weaning myself away from the action, but this movie seemed to go around in circles instead of covering any forward ground. One minor thing is while I normally love songs that help bring out the emotions in the scene, this was a little too somber for my taste. Soft and classic rock fans will rejoice in the soundtrack, but it just didn't do much for me in this movie, and once or twice made me very sleepy. Overall If I stay is an emotional tale that drama lovers I feel will love. It's got great life lessons, an intertwined tale of both joy and sorrow, and some decent acting that fit well to bring the novel on the screen. Yet, don't let the trailers and commercials overhype the movie, nor should you go in comparing it to the book. While I have not read the novel, my track record leads to usually disappointment, so try and block that mindset if you can. Is it worth a trip to theater? My opinion is not really, as there is very little quality that would look better on a bigger screen. Truth be told it's a great girls night out movie, or a movie you can treat your significant other too in hopes of getting reciprocation.

Rocketman," Rocketing To The Stars In Artistic Wonder
","Musical biographies, an ability to take a peek in the lives of the stars many idolize from the music and screens. In hopes of getting their music and the drama, these films require trying to find a balance that will please many who flock out to see the great wonder. While usually they take one side over the other, you'll find that rare treasure that finds the balance. Today I finish my weekly reviews with the epic film that has been built up for the last several months. Legendary Elton John and company have put out a film to try to capture the legendary rock icon on his journey to greatness. What's the verdict?

Real Vs. Exaggerated
Not The Same Music Impact for meSUMMARY:To recreate a living legend you have to hire the right person and Taron Egerton killed it with the recreation of Sir Elton John. The mannerisms, the look, and the showmanship are all captured brilliantly in his performance, playing the tormented soul that is the Rocketman. While the rest of the cast supports and plays their parts well, it is the focus on Egerton that draws everything into the movie. Hollywood brings the full arsenal of creation into the film, doing wonderful work on the make up as Elton ages, with not only facial changes but hair line. The recreation of his costumes mirror the performers quite well in terms of detail in all the spectacle that they were. Going along so well is an impressive set design and shooting locations that drop us back in time and places that he made famous. It's these special effects that help bring you into the full moment of the movie as well as increasing the spectacle of the numbers. Rocketman's musical numbers go on the trend of utilizing the song and dance routine typical of a musical and cueing them to potentially hint at the points/events of their creation. If you love those moments from High School Musical and show tunes of the theaters, then the numbers should get you real good, with similar techniques inspiring and highlighting some of his eccentric works. It's a different style compared to Bohemian, but the traditional route should get lovers of the genre smiling and potentially singing in glee. And to top it all off, this movie really hits one in the heart, as you learn about Elton's demons and the lessons he had to learn along the way. The ending in particular gave me goosebumps, and really puts a perspective on someone I never even remotely knew compared to all his numbers.
Yet, the thing about Rocketman is the approach they chose did not quite have the spunk and energy of Bohemian Rhapsody's melody. The pace is slow at times, drawing on the drama to fill the gaps rather than the comedy/energy of the numbers. For those who love the deep dive into the darker aspects of life, you've got it in this film, though I could have done more for the censorship myself, especially if it could have led to more concert and musical numbers. In addition, the analysis of overdramatic vs. real is always a question, especially given how the drama moments take a firm grasp on this movie. I myself like more of the musical spectacle and seeing that creative process, rather than getting downtrodden at the demons that plague us all. And while I appreciate these moments quite well, and attempt to learn from this, I missed the full-blown musical edge that I've gotten in some other films, especially because those numbers were not interrupted like in this film. As such, the numbers did not affect me as much as those in Bohemian Rhapsody, despite the mental moments they addressed.
Overall, Rocketman is a beautiful movie, focusing on the artistic side of things vs the full-blown concert relieving. Utilizing the pain and struggles of the artist, the movie is grounded in the plot of discovery, recovery, and all out creation from the motivations life throws at us. The special effects and showmanship will have musical numbers and John fans amazed, watching the recreation of the wonders unfold in modern day dynamics. As much as these moments moved me though, the movie is by far for those with a passion for the drama vs the music itself. Therefore, this movie is definitely a theater visit, but don't go in expecting a repeat of Bohemian in terms of straight up musical grandiosity, they may not quite enjoy this as much, especially when the numbers are interrupted. Still a fine musical biography to say the least and worth it for those who like Jersey Boys, Get Up Off That Thing, and musical numbers from theater.My scores are:Biography/Drama/Music: 8.0

A Star Is Born," A New Face For A New Age: Musical Remake Is Born!
","Robbie K with the latest review on another holiday remake, this one hoping to bring the emotional punch that drama lovers well... love. Tonight two acting/singing icons are ready to lead the way, with plenty of reviews already praising the two in making this movie come to life. Is it worth the hype, or have we been tricked by another Hollywood stunt? Robbie K here to help guide your viewing pleasures, so let's get started on my review of: Movie: A Star Is Born (2018)Director:
 Bradley Cooper
Writers:
 Eric Roth (screenplay by), Bradley Cooper (screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliott LIKES: The Acting: Hands down, the two leading characters have amazing chemistry together. Gaga's mature optimism but realistic grounding craft a strong character ready to brave the storm of drama to come. She brings the joy and energy to the film to help you get through the dark components of this film. Bradley Cooper on the other reprises his role of the sultry, depressed like, hero, who is easy on the eyes of the females in my audience and brings a sort of romanticism charm as well. Together, the duo tango in an amazing, dynamic dance of emotion that so many will grip on to. Decent Pace: Another prime example of a drama being heartfelt, but also not crawling like so many of these movies do. The first hour was over in an instant, and the second act, while not as fast, managed to keep a good run as they maneuvered through all the quirks. It led to my interest being kept for the movie and able to handle the predictable plot. The Story: The tale from the original is mostly there in a modernized form, reskinning the tale to have much more sex appeal than the original. Although not quite the same setting, the story still comes out strong, crammed to bursting with plenty of life aspects and lessons to hopefully resonate with the audience's journey. It's got a realistic pulse to it, which should charm many of the intended group, and keeps you enraptured as you live their lives through the screen. The Music: By far, the biggest and best component of this film for me was the music. Like all my fellow reviewers, the magic of this motion picture score is the heart and soul of the characters' feelings. These poetic displays of artistry fill much of the screen time, some in the concert fashion, others as the fuel for a montage, it brings the full-on bite and drives home the emotion of this film. As an additional bonus, you'll get a mixture of styles though it is limited to country or pop, but still a little variety is better than none right?DISLIKES: Same Country Song: While not too overplayed, Cooper's contributions to the music fest were not the most dynamic, choosing to play the same song four times and adding little with each replay. True, I'm not a big fan of country, but in regards to soundtracks, I might try to pull a mamma mia and sample the music to boost soundtrack sales. A Few Slow Parts: Scraping the bottom of the barrel for dislikes, there are a few slow parts that made me tired just watching. These moments were often prelude to another montage to buy some time, certainly a good trick to get you prepped, but maybe not the best in terms of pacing. The Few Unnecessary Shots: While much of the movie is spot on and necessary for the story, there are those moments that are merely for show to get things hot. A Star Is Born had a few scenes that were meant to add to the story, but were grazed by as sort of a footnote to not be forgotten. Sure it works with the new paint job this modernized version brought, and it had a few people hot under the collar, but for this guy, it just added fluff I didn't need for the story. Predictable: There are a few surprises to be thrown in, but for the most part this movie isn't too surprising or twist filled like I like to see. Not much I can say here, but don't expect too much deviation from the tale. The Okayish Character Development: I'm not saying that this is weak by any means, but I'm saying compared to the original, I feel the story/character component is not quite as strong as the classic. The new face of this story is all about the sex appeal and the music and while they did this fantastically, I feel that there was more potential to dive into these characters. Key tensions are there, and you have enough of the background story to get the gist, but I still think the art of storytelling holds the strongest in the ways of old. 
The VERDICT:  Did a Star is Born live up to the hype that reviewers and commercials built up? The answer is yes for the most part. The acting and music are perfect representations of this dynamic love story, capable of wooing you TGIT drama lovers and modern-day romanticists. Still, I think I like the original from what I remember and feel that the cool new look will appeal to the modern-day audiences more than anything else. Still, I had a good time with this movie and was very pleased at how much I liked the movie given my doubts from the trailers. So I would say this is the film for this weekend to check out, and have fun with the soundtrack if you so decide to do it. My scores are: Drama/Music/Romance: 8.5

Fury," Furious Gore and Action, but poor in character
","World War II is a time of tragedy, dismay, horror, and for Hollywood an opportunity to make movies. We've seen this historical time period represented in so many ways that you wonder what battle, or aspect we have left to cover. This weekend, the historical archives have been rooted once again, to deliver to us the tales of tank battle warfare. My review is on Fury, the action thriller released this weekend to most major theaters. With all the premovie showings and Hollywood exclusives, I was curious as to what the design team had in store for me. What's my verdict? Sit back, relax, and read my review. Where to start? I guess on the first big strength of the film, the action. This movie contains a bountiful number of intense battles in the German countryside. These exciting and suspenseful bouts of metal behemoth chaos are filled with enough explosions and special effects to make Michael Bay jealous, though in this case they are actually relevant. Audience members will be brought into the full experience with the incredible editing of the audio effects, as bombs, bullets, and the likes soar through the theater. You might be thinking, big deal I have plenty of movies that give me a similar experience. What's so great about this movie? For this reviewer, most movies don't bring you into the full tank experience. Fury plops us into the mechanisms of tank warfare, showing us the inner workings and the teamwork required to full operate the instrument of death. Each team member, or cast in this case, plays an integral cog in the maintenance of the metal monster, and one gets to feel they are working alongside them the whole time. In addition, the battles have strategy behind them as well, each fight having a different element and target than the last. While the colored bullets of green and red were a bit ridiculous, Star Wars anyone, it didn't take too much away from the thrill that was Fury's action shots. Action is only one element of the experience though, for it's the motley crew assembled that adds more depth to the movie. Leading the cast is popular heart throb Brad Pitt playing Don the commander at large. Pitt does his role well, the stalwart general who puts up with little crap to the point of being a jerk seems to be a natural part for him to play. Yet, somehow he plays the paternal role to the group and has that softer side that makes him likable. Batting second in command is Shia LaBeouf who finally left the artificially created Autobots to fight a war on his own. LaBeouf surprised me with his performance, a character who was grounded yet not afraid to fight off the enemy. His pipes from Transformers were put to good use in this film, his screams actually relevant to battle instead of calling for Optimus. Such a mature role was a welcome asset to the film, and I look forward to seeing more of these in the future. Logan Lerman has also graduated to a more mature role, and was a good character to play Norman the typist dropped into the horror that is war. Lerman's character makes a lot of transitions through this movie, and the young actor did a nice job portraying the struggles of a rookie in war. While the evolution into a Nazi killing machine was rather sudden, I think Lerman handled the emotions well and kept them in control. As for Michael PeÃ±a and Jon Bernthal, they too did a nice job as supporting character, playing the more aggressive and blunt tank soldiers that represent the animals men can become in the heat of battle. Regardless, the chemistry between this team was phenomenal, almost as if they were truly brothers of war and they were a team forged by battle. As for the problems with the film, they start with the character development. Fury's character development was rather poor at points. Yes, we got to see emotions and outlooks of each member towards the Nazi's, but aside from that the history of the soldiers was left in mystery. Pitt's panic attacks went unexplained, the pictures and backstory's of the other crew, pretty much nonexistent. In truth only Lerman's character had any real development, and that was due to him evolving into a true solider. This ambiguous nature made the characters a little one dimensional for this reviewer, and in truth a little hard to latch onto. In addition to this weakness, the next flaw in the movie is some of the scenes they put into the fray. Fury has a span of almost forty minutes of pure, boring, unnecessary downtime. As my buddy pointed out it was to relieve some tension and give some character development, but it failed for me and left me half asleep at points. Some post editing could, or scene directing I felt is needed to make a more relevant, and quicker, attempt to get some depth to our team. As for the ending, it leaves you a little cheated, proud at what unfolded, but at the same time disappointed by the inconclusive ending. There are a few other things that are a bit picky, but let's wrap this review up shall we?Fury is a great war story, filled with excitement, emotions, and brotherhood. I warn families to exercise caution with taking their younger family members to this, because it is bloody, filled with vulgar language, and intense. The battles themselves are merit enough to see this one in theaters, but the flaws I mentioned do take a way from the movie itself. It's no Saving Private Ryan, but Fury is a nice change up from the genres that seem to flood the theater. My scores for this film are:Action/Drama/War: 8.5-9.0 Movie Overall 7.5-8.0",8,4,10,18 October 2014
The Maze Runner," Runner is Not a Blunder, But Rather Vague
","This weekend is a big weekend, with at least three blockbuster movies releasing in my neck of the woods. I start my reviews this weekend with perhaps the most anticipated of the bunch, the Maze Runner. Once again Hollywood has decided to take a book series and run with it, in hopes that it will be the next big series to change the world. Yet like always, the question remains: Is this another glorified mess from the trailers, or have they done a good job? Well with two of my good buddies, I headed to the theater to start my weekend of reviews. I've never read the books, but knowing general trends Maze Runner has some big shoes to live up to. The premise is quite simple, a boy gets sent up to a center of the maze with a handful of other boys, and no memories of where he was before. This familiar bout of amnesia, is apparently normal, and within seconds he is integrated into a culture reminiscent of Lord Of The Flies. Of course, like always, Thomas is the one who defies the normal rules, and starts the journey of change that starts the trilogy. While the story is nothing we haven't seen before, the Maze Runner has some suspense and unknown elements that keeps you latched into the film. Throughout the film, my mind worked to uncover and guess the twists they had at the end, knowing the general nature of the set-up, yet not quite able to figure out the specific details. It is this element, at least for a Maze Runner newbie like me, that kept me into the movie. Despite the underlying mystery though, there were some other elements in the mix that made the Maze Runner an interesting experience. For one thing the movie is well shot and edited together. The entire journey is captured well, each angle well suited to give you the greatest detail in as little transitions. The same techniques remain during the dramatic argument scenes, which, when combined with the audio of booming drums and blaring horns, brings out the emotion and tension the boys are feeling. Yet, the best part of the camera editing are the action scenes, especially concerning the maze. It is always nice to see a movie defy the trend of shaky camera work, forgoing the 'realistic' first person perspective for actually showing us the scene at hand. Whether it be running or fighting, the camera is surprisingly stable and well focused on the matter at hand and brings some excitement to a rather slow plot line. Yes, unfortunately the story of the Maze Runner is a little drawn out and at points, rather vague and inconclusive. At first the ambiguity is fun, the multiple, unanswered questions keeping you wondering what path the movie will turn down next. These elements are integrated quite well with character developing moments, allowing more character buildup to help set the stage. However, for this reviewer it's nice to get some answers at points in the movie instead of more questions. Maze Runner for me provided vague solutions to the unknown, leaving more questions with that answer. Now this can be good if there is a nice wrap up to the madness, but for this movie that wasn't the case for me. I know, many are going to say that there are three books and answers come later, but this reviewer wanted a little more wrap up to at least some of the questions that developed over the two hours. To tell you the truth, I felt kind of gipped at the end of the movie, saying at the end, and I quote one of the characters, 'Really?'Despite the ambiguity though there are two other elements that help keep the movie going. First off the action is fun and relevant to the plot, the maze portions in particular being an intense fight for survival. Despite being a little savage and gruesome at parts, the evolutionary drive to remain alive is balanced with strategy, running, and fights with primitive tools. The action doesn't seem extra, but is built into the story quite well, spanning the fighting spectrum between the male rivalry to fighting the raging the Grievers. Of course the action is only as good as the acting as well, especially when it comes to interacting with CGI settings. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is the staple to the casting, surprising me with his performance of a male version of Catniss. Unlike the leading lady though, Thomas fought the culprits without being as whiney, a plus in my book for a leading character. O'Brien had a nice balance to his role, passionate and fiery, without crossing into an overacted, melodramatic mess. Lead Maze Runner Minho (Ki Hong Lee) was also a nice supporting character, bringing the wing man role to life and adding a little grounding to Thomas's flamboyant attitude. As for characters like Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Alby (Aml Ameen), Chuck (Blake Cooper), and Gally (Will Poulter), they were good too and each did a nice job playing their respective characters. Though with the exception of O'Brien, the real strength was the chemistry between all the group was the greatest quality of the acting and the community they formed. Overall the Maze Runner is a decent addition to the movie based on book library. There is a nice design to the movie, and a lot of good character building to set the stage in this morbid tale. Acting wise it is enjoyable, but in reality it's the action surrounding the story that got me the most. I still wished though that there was some better wrap up than what we got, despite the opening it provided. Overall a decent movie to watch this weekend, and has elements worth a visit to the theater. My scores are:Action/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",7,25,43,20 September 2014
This Is the End," A CavalCade of Comedy
","What would happen if six stars of stoner comedy films came together and were forced to face the end of the world? I didn't know either until I saw This is the End (TITE), a film written by one of these stars Seth Rogen, uniting his buddies from his various films to make what can only be an interesting adventure. Well interesting is exactly what you get with this tale and I'm here to shed some light on the latest comedy to grace the screen. When I saw the poser and trailers for this movie there were two ways I could see this movie going: funny and full of insane, and wacky adventure, or another drug filled comedy where all they do is go from point A to point B and get stoned/drunk upon their arrival. TITE however, decided to mash these two path together to make a hybrid that surprisingly entertained me, though that didn't seem the case at first. Stoner comedy fans will rejoice at the beginning, watching Seth and Jay Baruchel getting hopped up on so much weed you'll wonder how their brains take it. Then head into the party scene where not only do we get to see the cavalcade come together, but other stars make a cameo to show off what may be a reflection of their lives off camera. It's crude, it's cursing filled, and has so many awkward/inappropriate/over the top lines that will have the audience either cringing or laughing their heads off, the former option more for me. Once the cataclysm event occurs, as seen mostly in the trailer, the drugs and booze or shifted down a notch and a new 'balance' is reached that started to put this movie in better graces with me. So what did I like and dislike then.Let's start with the balance of comedy TITE has. Rogen and company bring all of their styles to the table on this one, with each one playing the characters you know and love. The diversity starts with more drug comedy, that makes our 'heroes' do some crazy and embarrassing situations that had most of the audience cracking up. Yet before this can grow stale, the movie transitions into curse filled talks about sex and all of its related bodily functions, sometimes leading to overexggarated arguments of two stars shamefully arguing about where they left their mark. For me however, the most laughs came from the parodies and quotes of various movies that are cleverly integrated into the dialog and plot to give the movie some pizazz. Rogen's pokes, or is it jabs at Hollywood productions also had me in stitches, and combined with some well-timed and clever quips there were plenty of laughs to go around that brought tears to my eyes from laughing so hard.Of course with a collection of stars this big playing 'themselves' you would think there would be some good laughs just from the characters themselves. Yes there were some characters I enjoyed, but for the most part the characters you see are those you've seen over and over again. Seth Rogen still plays that funny looking, and rather plain role that indulges in just about everything he can. James Franco, despite his diverse collection of roles, chose to go back to pineapple express mode and play the selfish jerk causing all the trouble, though he is slightly more in his mind. Jonah Hill plays that very soft toned, strange, and high pitched nerd who trades his attempts to be cool with his attempts to be peaceful, I think. My favorite of the bunch goes to Craig Robinson whose neutral tone, girlish screams, and well delivered quips had me rooting for the solo black actor. Of all the actors, his role had the most diversity for me, playing all the fields without going too far into one area, and without overacting. My least favorite character though had to be Danny McBride though, I've enjoyed some of his movies in the past, but I'm over his filthy dialog, arrogant rants, and perverted mannerisms that make him the wild dude that many like. His character is definitely the most annoying of the bunch and adds that black sheep/ doesn't give a damn edge that the movie needed, but could have toned down a little more. Despite all of these things though there were still some over the line moments that I didn't care for in this movie. Although this is supposed to be a comedic take on the apocalypse, there are some things that didn't need to be shown. Seeing the guys play soccer with a decapitated head and seeing cannibalism at its 'finest' are just two areas I'm not comfortable with watching. I also don't enjoy the concept of butt, or for that matter, regular raping as well. Sure the awkward reactions of the guys is fun to watch, but the concept penetrating someone in that way is not my cup of tea. Yet the biggest thing at bugged me has to be the visible shots of the devil's penis. Sorry I don't find seeing the male anatomy in all its lava orange/ brimstone gray glory, but that is something I think best left for the adult only films if you like that stuff though get ready to relive the Dante Inferno game all over. Factoring in everything though, TITE isn't a half bad comedy and was a fun idea to watch on a concept vaguely touched in the comedy world. I think the actors worked well together, the comedy stays rather fresh and appropriate, and although not the most surprising plot has a few things that may shock and surprise you. Overall Rogen did a good job making fun of a holy topic in a way that won't get him smite, but for those who are a bit more sensitive on this topic avoid the film. My scores are: Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",Null,2,19,14 June 2013
Passengers," All Aboard For Interstellar Romance and Visuals
","Space! The final frontierÂ…and the setting for so many movies in this day and age. Welcome to another Robbie K movie review. Tonight's focus is on Passengers starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as they voyage the stars in a pretty cool (albeit odd) looking ship. Based on the trailers this science fiction adventure looks to have romance, drama and mystery, but is this the case? Can these two mega stars bring a love story to life? As always read on to hear my take on Passengers!LIKES: Â• Fantastic Acting Â• The love story component Â• Beautiful visuals Â• Beautiful scoreNo surprise here, the acting is one of the leading components in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence's edgy mood is very welcome in this setting, painting a character that is vulnerable yet strong when faced with the dilemmas. Her emotions are so well-balanced in this film, painting a realistic character that many will anchor too. Yes, her cracking voice is getting a little stale, and she is playing similar characters, but it works so well. As for Pratt, again the man impresses me with dynamic characters. Pratt substitutes his normally silly persona for a more serious nature, and it works well. He sells his idolization of companionship, radiates misery from the isolation and betrayal, and still manages to come off heroic at parts. And the chemistry between these two is a reaction gone well. Pratt and Lawrence sell their passion for one another, almost as if they are actually in love with each other. Not easy considering Hollywood relationships these days. Speaking of the love story, Passengers' strongest story component has to be the relationship of the characters. It's a very dramatic tale packed with emotion that fluctuates between blissful happiness and heartbreaking revelations. As stated, the actors' chemistry helps sell the story, but the writers did a nice job designing this tale to be not only passionate, but believable. Yes, my friends, Passengers isn't a Nicholas Sparks fairy tale, but actually highlights the work involved with a relationship, nice work guys. And for those who want passionate love making scenes, it's got a few to spice up the film, but not so much to fall into the overdone (or pornographic realms). Well done guys, well done! Yet my favorite component has to be the beautiful visuals and music score that was designed for this film. Hollywood certainly knows how to create eccentric looking ships on the outside, but seldom do they create a large world within. The attention to detail is astonishing, each section meticulously designed to fit with the theme of the station. Even the engineering components have a logical explanation in regards to their purpose in the ship. And these settings are further amplified by the orchestral score that accompanies it. While many symphony tracks sound the same, Passengers adds a little something to help it stand out, especially during the spacewalk scenes where the music established both the beauty and spirit of adventure. DISLIKES: Â• Slow at the beginning Â• No mystery Â• The science fiction dilemma is semi rushed Â• Fourth character almost unnecessaryWe know some movies take time to build steam, but Passengers certainly struggles to get its ion drives going. The opening sequences are devoid of any edge, serving to introduce the ship and the dilemma involving one of our characters. However, this montage probably could have been cut down a bit to get to the exciting parts of the story (and cut down on the run time). In addition, the boring opening could be due to the lack of the mystery. Despite the teaser line put in the trailer, you'll get 95% of the answers in the first twenty minutes of the film. I had so looked forward to uncovering a conspiracy regarding their abrupt waking, but sadly the explanations are lackluster. The only mystery that remains is the technical explanations for what happens, which most viewers will not give a darn about. In regards to the science fiction component, Passengers is both good and bad in this category. The good is the ship, the technical jargon, and the looming threat of insanity in the void of space. However, the bad far overshadows the good for me. Passengers dilemma starts out pretty low key and remains low key for much of the film. Then at the drop of a hat things escalate to danger levels in mere minutes, a solution comes even faster, and the resolve is predictable and quite corny at parts. Even the introduction of a fourth character played by Lawrence Fishburne can't save the rushed plot development. Fishburne's role is touching at points, but the writers diluted his role to merely providing quick answers and a trinket to get the job done. Such a shame that the mystery and dilemma could not have shined like the love story. The VERDICT:Passengers surprised me by how much I enjoyed watching the movie. While a bit slow at the beginning, I enjoyed the love story and sense of adventure our characters shared as they hurtled through space. In addition, the beautiful visuals and strong attention to detail further impressed me, designing a set worthy of special effects awards at the Oscars. Outside the love story though, I was disappointed with the lack of mystery and rushed dilemma they placed in this movie. For once, I think the movie needed to be longer, to help make a more suspenseful film and get a little more kick to the relationship. This film is worth a scope for romantic audiences and those who like beautiful visuals. However, in regards to story over all, save this one home viewing. My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Romance: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",8,25,50,22 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Does It Satisfy Your Hunger?
","On this hot day I decided to cool off by going to my favorite thing of all time, that's right a movie. This week's flick I decided to check out was the Hunger Games, the movie based on Suzanne Collins' book. Now despite the international sensation that is the book, I wondered just how well the movie would live up to the hype and excitement that has built up over the past few months. Right now I'll tell you it is a decent movie, but for me did not live up to the craze. Perhaps the first thing I should say in this movie is how spot on the acting was for every character. As we saw in X-Men first class, Jennifer Lawrence's acting ability is incredible and very believable. Lawrence seems to have a knack for playing classic characters, and she managed to fill the very big shoes of the main character Catniss. Starring opposite of her is Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta. Hutcherson was a good pick for this role as his work in the past has required him to play that quiet, awkward, nice boy who seems to get caught in the most unfortunate situations and still come out okay. The duo seemed to have a natural chemistry for their roles, and their interactions mirrored what they read in the book. The mentors of Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) were also well done. Harrelson in particular captures the drunk, desperado quite well, yet portrays the concerned and caring tutor at the same time. It still surprises me how much of a chameleon he is as well. As for the other contestants, the casting did their jobs well and managed to select the right people in both look and attitude, especially Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Yes there are plenty of other actors to mention, but I only have limited space so I'll end this part with saying Stanley Tucci) was the perfect choice for Caesar, and his cheesy smile fit right in with the setting. But Robbie did they stick close to the story? Yes, they did, for the most part anyway. The crew in charge of this movie managed to adapt the book well, especially with the scenes and sequences focusing on the games. A lot of the man vs. nature element, or in this case woman vs. nature is captured with the camera work in the right angles to make one feel as if you were right there with Catniss. Most of the character interactions are shown as well, though a few of the extra actors have some laughable moments where they overact. What the movie lacks from the book however is a lot of the memories and internal thoughts that Catniss has, which as we know is kind of what the book focuses on. Parts where she is sitting in a tree, combing through the woods, or even sitting in a cave were a little less interesting without realizing what was going on in her head. Had they had that internal conflict it would have probably brought a little more understanding to some of the scenes, but again it's a movie and there is only so much more you can do. What else do I have to say about this movie? Well for one thing let's talk about the action. Depending on what you consider good action will determine whether or now you are impressed with this movie. Those looking for exciting, fast paced, weapon on weapon action will not be impressed with this movie as there is very little combat between the contestants. The little amount of combat there is a little difficult to follow, as the camera shows only glimpses of the fighters as it zooms around like a chicken with its head cut off. I suppose this is to avoid showing graphic kills on young kids, which is a good thing, but if that were going to be the approach I would have just skipped this scene. However, those who are looking for more the survival action and clever use of environment for killing, will be satisfied with this movie. Regardless of the action, the pace of the movie is good, not too fast and not too slow. All of the emotions you read in the book are in the film as well, and there were plenty of times I saw the audience quiver, cry, and cringe at the various scenes in the movie.To wrap this up, Hunger Games is a good movie that is definitely one of the better book adaptations I have seen in a while. With its fantastic acting, beautiful scenery, and accurate representation of the book, this film definitely deserves some attention. However, it still wasn't worth the hype for me and still has some things I missed from the book. Action wise it was okay, but again I'm more for fast paced action as opposed to the survival action seen in this movie. My final scores for this movie are as follows:Action/Sci-fiction: 7.0-7.5 Movie overall: 8.0I would say it's worth a trip to the theater and a good movie to see with friends, significant others, or even by your self. Until next time though this is Robbie K signing out.",8,3,14,23 March 2012
Zootopia," Dark, Edgy, Clever, Fun: Hard to Find Fault With Zootopia
","It seems that Disney studios continues to partake in a civil war between their two animation companies. Today Walt Disney Animation studios' puts out another work entitled Zootopia, to attempt to add another Oscar worthy film to their ranks. With all the hype and build up, I looked forward to being entertained by another masterpiece from their studio. Yet the question 'Is it worth the trip to theater?' may be ringing through your ears. So once again I'm going to give you my input and help you decide the answer to that question. ThereforeÂ…let's get to it. Like every Disney movie you can bet that the animation is excellent, and Zootopia is no exception. The cast of anthropomorphized animals fluidly moves about the screen in a human like manner as they live their lives throughout the fictional city, capturing the grace and dexterity of the homo sapiens they are modeled after. Even more impressive is seeing our animals in the primal state, as their anatomy is fully captured in spectacular detail. But animation is only one part of the magic of Zootopia. The design of the world is amazing, a perfect blend of modernized civilization and animal ecosystems. Zootpia's residential sections emphasize certain architectural styles that personify the particular mood of the area (e.g. Icy cold tundra as a front for the Mafia or the serene yet wild energy of the jungle villas.) All these details were brilliantly colored and shaded, bringing out the emotion of each scene, but still maintaining the whimsical nature of a Disney film. While I didn't see the movie in 3-D, I can certainly see this beautiful world being further stunning. While the design of the movie is enough to pull you into the theater let's talk about the story and comedy of the movie next. Disney always has the quirky, unique ideas that manage to imprint on our minds and make us fall in love with it. For Zootopia that main story is a mystery centered on disappearing animals across the city. This mystery established the suspense of the story, keeping me intrigued throughout the tale as to how deep the 'rabbit' hole went. The genius of the movie though is bringing two other stories into the fold and integrating them into the plot. These plots are character-developing moments that give our characters depth to latch onto. Much of these themes are tied to some big moral dilemmas that are very relevant today such as racism, feminism, and duty. And just like many of their movies, Zootopia takes at stab at teaching us how to properly handle these situations (shame on you Disney for teaching us!). Regardless whether you learn something or not, Zootopia is an emotionally deep tale that has many levels for all ages to enjoy and perhaps make you tear up in the process. As for the comedy, Zootopia trades in the stupid for a more clever and cute approach. Fans of the DMV will get plenty of witty jabs at some modern trends that include obsession with phones, scamming the system, and plenty of TV references for the media obsessed. Well-timed one-liners and comedic delivery by our voice actors keeps the comedy fun and fresh and had me (and a few other audience members) laughing throughout the film. I didn't notice many kids laughing throughout the movie, most likely due to the lack of the childish humor. Plus side, less repeating of quotes and sounds during the movie. Negative side, they might not be as interested in the movie. Regardless, I certainly enjoyed the writers' wittiness in this film and the fun energy they injected with their comedy without diverging from the theme of the movie. Now lets hit the weaknesses of the film. One thing I was disappointed with was how much of the movie I had seen from the trailers. Disney showed a lot of the funny parts numerous times and felt their effects had waned by then. In addition I felt some of the scenes were not as well done as the trailers had built them up to be, and kind of lackluster compared to the trailer counterparts (such as the naturalist scene). These moments felt unnecessary and barely relevant to the plot and could have been vamped up a bit. In addition I was hoping that the plot twist was a little better executed instead of dropping big hints to give it away. A few other minor complaints include: some overdone comedic ploys and some preachy moments that had me rolling my eyes. Disney once again hits a home run with their animated films. The design of alone is impressive, but the movie is incredibly fun, clever, and has the energy you love. Sure it may not be a film that will keep your kids squealing in laughter, but Zootopia brings many aspects to the silver screen that I think all ages will love. I fully support going to see this movie in theaters and hope you will enjoy the film as much as I did. My scores for Zootopia are: Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5Movie Overall: 8.0",8,6,16,5 March 2016
Argo," Argo See it!
","Another weekend arrives and so too comes another round of movies. To start things off I went with my friend to see Ben Affleck's newest film entitled Argo. Not only does Mr. Affleck star in this movie, but he was also the producer and director of the film as well, which has me worried he's following in Stallone's footsteps. Regardless, for those who haven't seen the trailers playing the last four months, Argo focuses on the Iranian crisis, in which 60 American hostages were held hostage by the Iranian public. Six of the hostages, played by numerous people, escape to the Canadian ambassador's house, where they hide from the radical soldiers. To help get these six out, the government sends in Tony Mendez (Affleck) a CIA specialist who has a crazy idea to get them out, produce a fake movie with the fugitives being the crew of the movie. So what can I say about this movie that is based on a true story. The answer is a lot of things, starting with the visuals of the movie. Argo's setting is well put together, taking a combination of three worlds and blending them into an amazing blast into the past. The hectic streets of Iran, the busy high and mighty world of Hollywood, and the stern, secretive halls of the CIA building are captured in very minute details. What does this mean to the audience? Well for me it helped pull me into the movie, helping me feel that I was a part of 1970/1980 world. Complementing the detailed settings is the integration of news clips from this time, blending them smoothly into the modern day filming. Instead of overdoing the news clips though, Affleck sparingly used these clips at just the right moments, my favorites being the Jimmy Carter addresses to the public. However, the setting and edition can only do so much, but none of it is possible without good camera work, and Argo does indeed have that. The visual crew managed to choose just the right angle to capture the emotions of the scene helping to bring out the chaos, intensity, and torment that filled the crisis. As a finishing touch, the grainy filter helped add a little edge to the film, making the movie seem like a live documentary. Although the camera-work was impressive, the acting was also another component that helped bring the movie alive. Affleck did a nice job playing the CIA agent role, using his lady pleasing scowl to mirror his intense nature. Bryan Cranston who played Mendez's boss was also well done, as Cranston's strong face and rough voice gave the character an edge that promoted challenge and driving force. As for the hostages, well they definitely looked the part with their 70's hairstyles and aviator glasses, but aside from some occasional spurts of dialog their facial expressions did most of the talking. My favorite actors had to be Alan Arkin and John Goodman, the two movie men who were the backbone of the Argo project. Both of these seasoned actors were hilarious, essentially a real life Statler and Waldorf who were happy to insult almost every aspect of the Hollywood world. My buddy and I couldn't help, but laugh as the two ridiculed the politics and laziness of the movie magic world, constantly working the system of corrupt agents and lawyers who were looking for a quick buck. The dynamic duo delivered there incredible dialog perfectly, adding another level to help the words strike home. These two may have made up a large percentage of why I enjoyed this movie. Argo has a lot of other qualities that make this a movie worth watching. For the older generation who lived through this event, the adapted story will most likely be nostalgic, especially the riots and new clips of incidents. Drama lovers will get their fill as well, as just about every group in this movie has some type of issue or struggle they have to overcome. As for suspense, well that really doesn't come till about the final thirty minutes of the movie, but once it arrives you may find yourself at the edge of your seat, (unless you remember the reality of the situation). People who enjoy making fun of countless systems will also be entertained by this film. As stated earlier, Goodman and Arkin's characters basically throw Hollywood under the bus, from getting contracts to designing a fake story. Those who love seeing government agencies getting shot down and made fun of, are also going to enjoy this film as well. While it's not like a typical comedy where the actors say lines that are targeted at the government, Argo instead uses the setting to make fun of it. When Affleck demands action, the big wigs instead say they have a meeting scheduled or say that's not allowed. The writers also threw a couple of quick dialog jabs in there to help bring some diversity to the humor, which also brought on some laughs. Of course those that are easily offended by such humor, or greatly support our political system's endeavors are going to be less amused. I'll also take this time to say that those who don't like seeing humans painted as monsters/animals are going to be angry at this movie as well. The combination of camera work and acting show the darker side of humans, and I'm sure there will be news stories of people offended by the portrayal of both Americans and Iranians. The only big error I can mention on this movie is that some editing could have been done about halfway through to make the movie a little shorter. Needless to say I enjoyed Argo a lot, and encourage you to see this movie in theaters, or at least catch in on Netflix. My scores for this film are below Drama/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",8,2,4,13 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Cast off Into Darkness
","Space the final frontier. It seems that no matter how many movies we make about the black void, we still continue to push the limits as to what lurks out there. While numerous movies have failed in their challenge, there are some movies that shine brighter than the stars that decorate the screens. One of these treasures is the Star Trek series, both show and movies, which deliver the science fiction adventure to other words and sticking to the physics pretty well. Although I was a little shocked at Abrams reset of the series, I still enjoyed the modernization of the series and the update in graphic/action. Now four years later, Abrams has come back with another sequel in an attempt to keep the interest alive. How was this movie? Please read on to hear my opinions.Just like the last movie, Abrams pulls out the stops to get the tale going with a rush out the gate. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew are out on a mission trying to save everyone from everything. Amidst the beautiful world and rather impressive CGI landscapes, the action gets the audience's attention quickly, perhaps even bringing you to the edge of your seat. Of course this is only the beginning, and throughout the movie the action just continues to vamp up bringing in more lasers, highly choreographed moves, and ship on ship action. All of this is brilliantly captured with cinematography that keeps up with the fast pace, only going into shake down mode when necessary (i.e. the ship gets hit). Now don't get too upset and worried that Abrams has turned this franchise into a kung fu movie with flashing lights, no instead the action is integrated with the story and drives the plot to help avoid any slow parts. Is it the best balance? No, but for this reviewer I like a faster pace so long as character development isn't sacrificed. Unfortunately the developing team did get a little carried away at points where a few chase scenes or an epic crash felt a little dragged out, or maybe it was just the fatigue I felt at two in the morning. Now let's turn our attention to the plot of Into Darkness. In a nutshell it's good, it's fun, and it has a lot of character development to keep people interested in the story. The relationship between Kirk and Spock (Zachary Quinto) in particular was rather well done, blending in a variety of comedy, anger, and a variety of other emotions that made it feel like I was watching two brothers fight. Yet just like last time, these two are only a segment of the character pillar and not the whole thing. Abrams and his staff did a great job integrating the entire crew into this film, getting all of them involved in some major way. Sulu (John Cho), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Bones (Karl Urban), and many more provide lots of laughs, plot elements, and a variety of other qualities that keep the movie just as fun as the first, yet with more drive behind it. In this film, the audience gets to see new sides to these classic characters as they are pushed by the darkness that surrounds them. Most of this darkness is due to the new villain played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The casting crew did their homework or got lucky when they got Cumberbatch onset. This man had the look, the tone, and moves that a good villain needs. I don't know if it was his acting or the character design that impressed me more, but this dude kept the story exciting and diverse as he threw new challenges into the fray. Of course tactics wasn't the only thing this dude had going for him, awesome moves, skills with weapons, and other qualities that I wish not to mention at the moment. Yet despite the sheer awesomeness of Cumberbatch's character, they still made him a little too strong, giving him the qualities of an unbeatable God that was a little too stretched for me.Abrams success with the characters and action are just the tip of the iceberg of success with this movie. The man managed to integrate a lot of movie aspects in a balanced manner that again kept the audience into the movie. There was plenty of comedy in the film, whether it is a well delivered line or a Star Trek reference that fans will absolutely love. When the audience wasn't laughing they were captivated by the 'twists' and 'turns' of this predictable story line. Parts of the movie even had people crying, or at least silent, as they awaited the fate of their favorite character. As I already said, the action was very well spread, constantly building upon itself to an exciting end game battle. All of this was a formula for success for me, and I wish that other movies could take the hint and incorporate this style into their movies, *cough Transformer, cough Newest Iron Man, cough a lot of other movies cough. However, I don't know everything about the art of making movies so I'm sure I'm missing some pieces to the puzzle.Star Trek into Darkness is a great science fiction action movie to get the summer started off. Great acting, beautiful CGI work, and balance left me clapping at the end of the movie. Sure the story was predictable for me, and yes some of the intensity was lost on me with their obvious foreshadowing, but still it was a tale worth getting into. As for the 3D, I can't give you much on that since I saw it in the cheaper 2D version. However the scenes I pictured popping out at me could be cool and not too cheesy. My score for this film is:Action/Adventure/Sci-fi: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",Null,3,12,16 May 2013
Knives Out," Enjoying The Sharp Humor To This Mystery
","Mystery movies can certainly be fun, but the refined art of mapping out a crime can be a challenge in this world with ever shrinking attention spans. However, there are still writers and directors out there ready to give it a try in hopes of bringing thought out plots back into the popular trend. Tonight's review holds such a promise and even more so it holds another redeeming trial for a director whose involvement in Star Wars was not the best received. With lots of advertising, I'm sure you have seen the trailers so let's get going as I review:LIKES:Acting
The Cinematography
The Plot Is A Good Mystery
Better Twists Than Anticipated
Involvement With Most Of The Cast
The ComedyDISLIKES:
Some rather worthless characters
The Run Time
The Pace
Perhaps A Little More MurderThe VERDICT:With an assembled cast such as this, you can best bet the acting will be at least moderate, and for me it was a fantastic display of work. All parties assembled really play the dysfunctional role well, portraying the motive filled shouts and complaints to an art that did not annoy or go overboard. Too many names to place I'll say that Craig was entertaining in his role of Colonel Saunders (a running joke) meeting James Bond as the detective, primarily in his interactions with Marta. Ana de Armas was the star for me not only because of her character, but more so in the way she played the levels of emotion perfectly and interacted with the squad the most to balance this art. Past the acting, the movie really picks up in terms of the visual presentation, feeling much like a detective movie from the 50s-80s, but modernizing it to the present day. It should captivate many mystery lovers, but more so generic fans who can point out a lot of devices and nods to famous detective sagas. However, the movie's main selling point is the presentation of the story that let's face it has been told time and time again in a Hallmark like fashion. Johnson, for me, accomplished the role of bringing out a good mystery, not only in the classic hunt for clues and mapping out suspects, but adding some nice twists to the mix. If you are paying attention to time and some info, you'll start getting an idea, but this film's twists (no matter how convoluted) do manage to spruce up the dusty manor of detective works. An even better angle for me, is the character utilization, while not perfect, every character has a purpose in some form or angle, with few sitting off to the sides as just mere bodies to fill a convenient hole or bridge. If not for the sake of the plot, then the character was used for comedy and that may be my favorite part of this movie. Knives Out manages to be very humorous in the regards of the comedy aspect, with well written dialogue, delivery of those lines, and timing wrapping up nicely to leave many laughing during my showing. That I feel will be a pull for many audience members, though don't expect usual slapstick, banter, and ridiculous, logic defying stunts to be pulled here, or you'll be disappointed.For such an artistic film though, there are still a few things I would have liked tightened up. Though all characters were utilized in some form, I can't lie at least three could have had more involvement than what they did. Hinting at being a part of the plot, these characters were left to the passing comments or joke props until that one moment a clue contributed. That family engagement they sold in the trailers, needed some more development for me to keep everyone entangled in the mess as opposed to on the side. In addition, the plot could have used a little more murder and threats to help spice up the drama/mystery, as I am partial to the deadly games of hunting in my movies, than anything else. For a movie selling that murder, I had kind of expected something else, but it's a mere trinket. I can say the thing I had the hardest time with was the run time and the pace. Knowing it's a Johnson movie, I expect it to be long, and for the most part the movie ran at a good enough pace that it did not feel super long, but other times did show the dragging I dreaded. I can say that there were parts that could have been cut out to shorten the length, or at least rewritten to include the character interaction I mentioned above.So in conclusion, what are the thoughts on this controversial movie/tale. To be honest, I do think it is a reimagining of Clue, and took a step into the modern world to help reach out to the new audiences. It's got the presentation of a mystery, with twists to help bring our well-acted characters together and entertain us with their drama. Comedy is also pulled out of the sheath and I think these two elements are the biggest selling factors to brave the nearly 2.5 hour run time Johnson has put forth. As such, I feel this movie is worth a shot at hitting the theaters for those looking for a drama/mystery/comedy, while others will most likely enjoy from the comfort of their homes.My scores for Knives Out are:Comedy/Crime/Drama: 9.0

Rise of the Guardians," Dare to Believe?
","When you hear the name DreamWorks, most likely you think animated fun? With films like Madagascar, How to Train your Dragon, and Shrek, the animation squad seems to have plenty of life in their studios to continue pumping these CGI hits out. This week, DreamWorks dived into the world of mythological gift givers in their film Rise Of The Guardians. When this trailer premiered about a year ago, I was happy with the promise this film offered. However, as we've seen happen plenty of times, I always have the worry that the trailer designers have fooled me once again. What's my verdict on their latest movie? Please read on to find out. Rise of The Guardians focuses on the big four protectors of children: Santa Clause aka North (Alec Baldwin), Sandman, Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), and the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman). These four are in charge of bringing happiness to the world in their own way, though most of the attempts through bribery in some shape or form. Yet when the happiness of children is threatened by the Boogie Man, now named Pitch Black (Jude Law), the four must call on another to help them face their challenge. This new contender is Jack Frost (Chris Pine) a spirit in charge of snow days who has a case of amnesia. What will this spirit who has a big case of ADHD be able to contribute, and what will he gain as a reward for his services? I can't tell you that.What I can tell you though are some of the qualities about this movie that made it a fun afternoon. The biggest compliment I have for the film is the animation. Once again DreamWorks staff has done their homework, finding ways to capture the movement of humans, animals, and mythological in a way that is fluid and smooth. Whether they are sliding down tunnels, flying magic sleighs, or fighting off the dark sands of Pitch, the characters don't lag, glitch, or fail to impress this reviewer. However, the characters design is also well done as it mirrored the personality of each Guardian yet gave them an edge over their classic renditions. In particular Santa's Lumberjack meets biker look was a welcome change, alongside the colorful display of feathers and scales that made up the Tooth Fairy. This edgy style was a welcome change and should be entertaining to both kids and adults alike. Yet what's an animated movie without good voice work to help add more character to this cast. Baldwin might have taken my vote for the best voice work, using his talents to give North a variety of emotions. At times he was cheerful and upbeat making some funny jokes and raising the audience spirits, while other times he dropped to a more serious and hard tone used to express the direness of the situation. The others of course did a great job with Fisher's bubbly air syncing with the Tooth Fairy, while Law's charming English voice darkened the already nightmare infused Pitch. As for Sandy, well despite lacking any real dialog, the little guy has a lot pizazz to his character. Of all the guardians he might be my favorite character. Aside from the animation though, there were some other things about this movie worth mentioning. The story, although fairly simple, is very entertaining and cute to both kids and adults. There are a few twists in the movie that keep it fun, mostly pertaining to Jack, but for the most part the story is linear and easy to follow, which is good for a kid's movie. While it lacks the jokes that Shrek has, Rise of The Guardians has other qualities that make up for it. The magic for instance is brilliantly brought to life in an array of flashy colors, bright lights, and clever shapes that are sure to wow the audience. Rather than just showing off though, the magic was integrated into both bringing happiness and fighting off Pitch's dark sands. Although somewhat limited, the action in this film was still enjoyable and suspenseful. North's blade wielding, Bunny's boomerang throwing, and Sandman's manipulation magic, will surely have you laughing, smiling, or at least a little applause from the well edited scenes. Action aside though, there are numerous points in the movie where the inner child from within is awaken once again. Rise of the Guardians strongest emotion is the power to believe, something that many have lost as they grew up. Those who long ago forgot the feelings of excitement wonder, and believing in magic may find themselves once again feeling the spirit reviving in them. There were a couple of times I felt my heart melt at the speeches the guardians gave. Yet if you never really got into the believing spirit, your heart might melt at some of the cuter aspects of this movie. The tooth fairies helpers and elves in particular are sure to make some squeal in delight, or at least say awwwwww.Rise Of The Guardians is another successful chapter in the DreamWorks animation studio book. With a nice balance of action, some fun comedic lines, great voice work, and some decent character development, this movie has just about everything for most fans. My only suggestions are to add some more action in the next installment, and continue to develop the other characters as well; whose pasts still remain a mystery. Even if you're not a fan of the story, or have never gotten into the holiday thing, at least go see it for the fantastic animation the team has put together. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I say yes. Is it worth a 3-D, I can't say, but the 2-D showing was pretty good. Should you decide not to go the theater though, definitely check this film out on Netflix.

Aquaman," Aquamantastic! Swimming In With Lots of Visuals, Story, and Action. The Right Direction For DCEU
","In the realm of comic book and superhero movies, DC once sat atop the throne as the champion of the real life, action films about our favorite paper bound heroes. As Marvel studios fell into stride though and secured it's regime, DC has struggled to find the same quality in its work for one reason or another. Despite whatever source of struggles, DC has been limping along from film to film, only shining once with Wonder Woman last year that renewed life. Yet, coming to shore this holiday season, is another beacon of hope in the form of Jason Momoa as the champion of Atlantis Aquaman. With the coming tide of movies, can this film restore faith in the franchise , or does it fall short once more of the glory of superhero films. Robbie K here with a week advanced screening of Aquaman to give his thoughts. Let's get started:Movie: Aquaman 2018Director:
James Wan
Writers:
David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (screenplay by), Will Beall (screenplay by)
Stars:
Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem DafoeLIKES:Acting: Momoa's talents as the gruff warrior continue to shine through, only this time much more in your face. It works well, brings the heart of the film in all it's wonder and glory, and really makes for an entertaining hero to watch. As the character develops, Momoa is able to go with it and it works quite well to entertain the masses, plus his abs didn't hurt as the women in my showing were swooning. His sassy partner in crime, Heard did a wonderful job stepping up into the major role, bringing sass, class, and looks that felt in tone with the movie and a great opposite to Momoa's rantings, and again the looks didn't hurt either. The rest of the cast did extraordinary as well, Dafoe's prowess as the vizier and mentor was like something out of a Shakespearean play. Nichole Kidman's performance held regality and love for the time she was in. Patrick Wilson did his job as the grandiose king, extreme in direction, but having enough salt to back up his madness.The Visuals: Leave it to Wan to come up with his own version of Atlantis and bring with it the same flair that he leaves with his other works. The studio's design of the underwater kingdom is solid, a blend of technology, magic, and biology that may seem a bit stereotypical, but captures the prowess of the mighty ancient realm. Past the city itself, the characters have a unique and fantastic design to themselves as each kingdom gets its own look to show a common origin, but still give their evolution different. Other costumes for the warriors had their own edge to it, and I personally liked Mera's costume feeling it was on point compared to her current modern-day image. And when it came to battle scenes, the effects worked quite well given Wan's flashy approach to his films. It feels like a comic book world brought to life and accomplishes the immersion into the nerd culture we love so much.
The Story: It's the classic Aquaman story that we've come to know, a greedy kingdom filled with headstrong rulers whose focus on the one approach drives their goals, while the other tries to find a way to his own identity. For the most part it works, and this Aquaman has enough features of his comic realm to appease most fans with the introduction of Black Manta, the family dynamics that are almost as warped as Game of Thrones, and the developing relationships Arthur has itself. What I liked the most was that even though it is part of a bigger universe, this film was able to tell its own story and stand alone, without relying too much on the other films that came before it. Again it's predictable and clichÃƒÂ©, but the tale should be enough to rope people in regardless of what arc you enjoy the most.The Action: You saw it in the films and you know this is meant to be one for the big screen before I even wrote these words. Aquaman is all about the fights and trying to imbue it with some diversity to break away from the other films. It accomplished the goal of bringing a variety of styles to the mix that feels part Fast and Furious, Part Game Of Thrones, and Part DC meeting kung Fu. Special effects lit up the theater in a thunderous display of sound editing that had the theater rumbling like an earthquake. I was drawn into most of the battles, and felt that on some of them they hit the target in the center to really have people jumping in their seats. As such, despite the nearly 2.5 hour run time, there is so much action keeping it moving you won't feel to bogged down by the time constraint.
DISLIKES:The Episodic presentation: Wan jammed a lot of things into this film, and while I appreciated the completeness, I felt the movie was a little too episodic for me at points. Transitions between clues were a little too fast for me, relationships progressing a little conveniently and quickly for my tasted to get the realistic factor. While complete overall, it lacks the polish of story that Wonder Woman held and I think it was because of the action focus of this movie (which I do like, but still do appreciate good storytelling).Action Scenes needing more depth: Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the action component as mentioned above, however, I also appreciate action scenes that are longer, more developed than what we got. Much of Wan's vision was very cut and dry 5-minute sequences that were impressive, but short lived, or sometimes more running than actual combat. While I loved a few of the battles that really captured the spirit of the combat, others felt too short lived. I agree with some fellow colleagues that there was more choreography needed, but perhaps giving a little more integration could have made these scenes shine for me.CGI Overuse: We know these movies are all about CGI making imagination come to life, but what we also know is the importance of balance and not diving too far into the realm of artificial imagery. Aquaman's visuals were a little heavier than most, like George Lucas in the prequels, the reliance on CGI made for some cheesier moments than I think intended, where some writing lapses helped amplify the artificial feeling to it. Like the end fight of Wonder Woman, the effects didn't quite add up to the picture I had in mind, and when you get to how fast they skimmed over some of the battles, it left me feeling I wanted a little more though to the battles at hand.The VERDICT:I could go on for hours about this, but let's wrap this up. Aquaman is definitely one of the better installments for this reviewer, finally getting out of the convoluted, too focused on darker themes that the DC universe went to and instead getting back to the basics of the superhero film. It is a visually packed joy ride made for the theaters, as this action-packed journey is all about showing off the technological, imagination driven ride Wan is famous for. I had fun in this movie and enjoyed the complete tale, despite how episodic the presentation felt. In addition, the action was very fun, but I wanted a little more coordination and investment to the sequences, so quality vs. quantity. Aquaman has bounced back to the superhero movie quite well, and with a little more balance, it may finally reach the intended levels they set out for long ago. Definitely worth a trip to the theater my friends, and potentially the biggest holiday bash of the bunch.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0-8.5

Deadpool 2," A Dead On Sequel
","Deadpool movies are so hard to review. It's not because their super complex, thought provoking, or even artistic symbolism, but it's more due to the fact of balancing ridiculous antics with serious hero quality. With the first movie being a breath of fresh air to the massively stuffed superhero movie genre, the sequel had a lot to live up to for pleasing the fanbase once more. After one of the most amazing advertisement campaigns to date, did this movie break the fourth wall of entertainment once again? Robbie K here to do his best to help you with your movie viewing pleasures. Let's go!Movie: Deadpool 2Director:
 David Leitch
Writers:
 Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick 
Stars:
 Josh Brolin, Ryan Reynolds, Morena BaccarinLIKES: Acting: Given all of Ryan Reynolds ups and downs, the young actor shines so well in the reboot version of Deadpool. His sass from previous comedy stunts (like Two Guys and A Girl) mixed with his physique/delivery of superhero, leads to a well-developed lead who carries the movie heavily on his costume equipped shoulders. Brolin comes in again as the villain, bringing his grit to a less CGI rendered height that works well to offset the hyper, ADHD like energy of Deadpool and with it comes great comedic banter. Much of the supporting cast nails their roles well too, capable of dropping lines and rocking CGI stunts. Domino: Of all of these though, Domino was my favorite character. In the age of rising female heroes, Domino is a well-developed character who brings so much to the weird table this film sets. Zazie Beetz really shines in this movie as a female partner in crime to counter the crazy of Deadpool. A great character who has a quirky power, this 'lucky' girl brings bite to fight Deadpool's humor, decent skills with a weapon, and surprisingly some enlightened looks at life that bring some zing to the movie. This character was a fantastic addition to the movie that should help expand the audience. Story: A Deadpool comic is often not the most developed in the story department, and given the direction of the cinema... one never knows how a sequel story will end up. Happily, I can report that this sequel did a nice job in the story department, managing to bring a decent plot that helps our characters evolve yet sticking close to the humor vibe of the movie. It's nice to see a ridiculous character grow, but still stick to the core qualities and Deadpool 2 did a much better job than I could imagine. Special Effects: Deadpool's ridiculous stunts means needing to find some way to make the impossible, possible on the screen. Hat's off, or in this case masks off, to the department who made all the bouts, mutants, and futuristic technology come roaring to full force to immerse you into the action. Speaking of which, Action: The action of Deadpool 2 is a mixed bag for me, but there are plenty of components that worked well with me. At the front line, are a number of bouts that have that chaotic, adrenaline fueled themes to it, mixed with snarky comments and unrelenting jokes that keep things fun, exciting, and a great opener. Seeing the moves, they choreographed/crafted, showed promise for some epic finales to come, always a good idea to cast the net and get them caught up early right. More on that later. Comedy: In truth, the strongest weapon in Deadpool's arsenal is the comedy that this film is drenched in, and by drenched I mean caught in a deluge. This sequel picks up where the last left off and with it comes a cornucopia of styles all hectically crashing together in a giant abstract masterpiece. Nothing is safe from Deadpool's adulteration, as the red garmented maniac brings vulgarity, ridiculous finishes, pokes at stories, comics, movies (including the franchise itself), and of course slapstick that transitions to so much more. I kept laughing my head off in this movie and loved the writing, cleverness, and of course mid-credit scene that victoriously finishes the movie off and delivers the answer to the wishes and prayers of the fan base. So, so good. DISLIKES: Over the top moments: Deadpool I know is all about breaking the 4th wall on just about everything he can. And certainly, in this installment, the writers did their best to break that mold as often and intense as possible. Given the laxer ratings, Deadpool 2 shows no qualms with crossing the line. Primarily the cursing, Deadpool 2 doesn't know when to quit in terms of vulgar cursing and certainly goes down inappropriate avenues I didn't particularly enjoy. A minor one at best, be warned that anything is possible with a mad mercenary. Comedic Stints Go on and on: Like this review, Deadpool's comedic banter sometimes treks on for too long. Those liking to see two smart alecks duke it out in a battle of insults, fake outs, and sarcasm for minutes on end will be delighted with the writing of this movie. I admit I did like it at first, but near the end this ploy had soon started to wrinkle like Wade's face. Action: While I certainly liked the action for much of the movie, I can't help but admit I was a little disappointed as well. Sure, the humor is awesome, the inappropriate battle moves fit well, and it felt like a Deadpool sequence come to life with little to no punches pulled. Yet, I'm still spoiled on some of Marvel's glorious cinema wars and had hoped we'd get some match ups to give them a run for its money. The epic climactic fight didn't quite have the on the edge, clap in your seat, scream in excitement epic fights that the trailers had hinted at. Those moments were fly-overs in an extended montage. Predictable: My buddy is right in saying that the movie certainly goes a different route than presented in the trailers. However,... the movie (perhaps as a stunt itself), dropped too many hints to lead you down the path to the answers that awaited. I was able to figure out all the twists with ease, and not have my mind blown as I thought it would. Another small dislike, but hey got to be honest at times. Character use: The trailers promoted the heck out of X-Force, making sure that we got our eye fill on just about every angle of Deadpool's own team to rival the goody two shoes X-men. And while the characters got their time to shine in comedy moves, their overall contribution to the film was cheated out in my opinion. Maybe that's what the comics have done, or perhaps it was a brilliant comedic ploy. However, don't promote characters so heavily if you are going to dilute them so much. Even his fellow mutants from Xavier's got a bit of underplay, another example of too many pieces leading to sacrifices being required to not make the film too long. The Verdict: Truth is I loved Deadpool 2 and while I had some issues, (which are pickiness of course), the movie accomplishes the goals of being a comedic spoof of superhumans that brings that bite to eat we hungered for. It's fast paced, it's witty, and it still keeps the story going on a level I didn't expect and this provides the breath of fresh air again that the first one did. Still, it's not a perfect movie for me and I still hope to get some more action and character usage in the next installment should Disney not limit Fox's creativity on it. Worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely, though be warned that the movie is not designed for younger audience members, those with weak constitutions to blood, violence, and vulgarity, or those not ready to step over the abyss into craziness. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0

Thor: Ragnarok," God Of Thunderous Applause and Comedy
","He's big, he's flashy, and he has locks of hair and a body that slays many. Yes, he's Marvel's own Thor, and tonight is his third solo movie's release date. In hopes of smashing the box office, Disney has brought the God of Thunder back with a darker twist in hopes of reigniting the magic of Marvel. Welcome to Robbie K's movie reviews and tonight we analyze, observe, and share my opinions on yet another movie to hit the silver screen. Let's get started!LIKES:Special effects: Disney's team is the master of money, which entitles them to deliver a dazzling display of cinematography magic. Thor Ragnarok is another example of how the Marvel universe can be brought to life. Dazzling special effects fill the big screen in the form of nature's wrath, flying projectiles, and monsters of various designs. While certainly not the most realistic of the graphics, Disney's group crafted fluid animation, colorful spectacles, and of plenty of speaker blowing sound effects to go with it. If that's not enough of a selling point, then how about the special effects of Chris Hemsworth's body will be happy to please the eyes of many female fans, plenty of shots according to my friends tonight. Action: Remember the first Thor where there wasn't much battling, but more babysitting? Yeah, well the Thor group managed to take the action of the avengers, and kind of cram it into this movie. Ragnarok, spares no time diving into the action, and keeps it spread throughout the entire 130-minute run time. The darker themes of the story certainly allowed this, and thank goodness, the directors took hold of the opportunity. While Thor certainly gets more of the seat gripping battle scenes, this movie provides the other cast some rather impressive scenes. And finally, Marvel has broken the cycle of lame villains, giving Hela (Cate Blanchett) some bite instead of just barking. With all these contenders and the edginess of the movie, you can rest assured that the dullness of Thor has been broken. Comedy: By far though, Thor Ragnarok's biggest selling point is comedy the series is so famous for. The third installment is perhaps the funniest of the bunch, trading whiny complaints of assistants and naked walks by old professors Instead, the writers decided to fill the movie with a lot of diverse comedic ploys to keep the chuckles coming. Slapstick humor, well-delivered one-liners, wacky catchphrases, sarcasm, and banter to no limits. Ragnarok has all this in fantastic amounts to keep the movie as fun and entertaining as possible. Even better, is how the comedy is also integrated into the action scenes, showing that the writers in Marvel haven't lost their talent after all. The music itself is also funny comedic relief, sounding like something out of an 80's video game, in all its dazzling, electric keyboard glory. DISLIKES:Missing Character Stories: Ragnarok has a lot of good with it, but one thing that was slightly annoying was how some of the characters lacked complete background information. Valkyrie in particular was a little rushed, leaving out some key things that could have made her an even deeper character. Even Hela herself has a rather shallow story, glazing over what could have been some cool sequences for some overdramatic banter about how hurt she was. Outside of Thor and Loki (who have had movies to weave their tale), the backup characters seemed slightly diluted in the grand scheme of the movie. Over-hyped Action: Don't get me wrong, Thor had plenty of excitement to amp up the pace and excitement of the movie. Unfortunately, the sequences are rather short-lived, or more comedic than actually exciting. With the bar set high for me, I was hoping that the scenes were going to be more intense, filled to the brim with fist punching, lightning throwing, and sword wielding incredibleness. And just as the momentum was building, they dropped it for more comedy and banter between Thor and some other character. This particular scenario was especially true for Hulk Vs. Thor, which while entertaining, was disappointing on the exciting action part. While the conclusion managed to build up my hope, it too didn't have quite the zing I had hoped. Despite all this though, I still enjoyed the action. The VERDICT:Truth is, Thor Ragnarok, while being dark, is one of the more entertaining films of the bunch on so many levels. It's got a fast pace to keep things going, action to liven up the scenes, a villain who doesn't entirely stink, and comedy to keep the dialogue fun as well. If you're like me you will be laughing almost the entire movie, but if you are ones preferring over the top slapstick and innuendos out the wazoo, then slow your roll for this movie. While I would have loved to see more character development (and use) of the secondary characters and a little more excitement in battles, truth is this is one of the better Marvel films in a while. And of course, with all the special effects, this reviewer can't help, but recommend you see this movie in theaters. Beware thoughÃ‚â€¦this movie is a little more inappropriate for younger audience members not only due to the more adult comedy, but also for the language used in this film. Exercise caution please when choosing this film, and plan a babysitter if you don't want little ears hearing course dialogue. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",8,2,7,2 November 2017
Ready Player One," Ready For Action, Visuals, and Nostalgia
","Robbie K back with another review and tonight it is on movie I have been looking forward to for a very long time. The latest book gone pop culture, tonight's film is all about the references (and merchandising) as the world seeks out an adequate video game movie to come to life. So, let's get started with a slight alteration to the style, as I review:Title: Ready Player One
Director: Steven Spielberg
Writer: Zak Penn
Original Author: Ernest Cline
Starring: Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn 
LIKES:Acting: Let's get this like out of the way (as most won't care). The cast of this highly CGI world is on point in regards to making their characters come to life. Sheridan in particular does a lot of the heavy lifting, balancing the geek, leader, and vulnerable roles all into a nice admirable package. Cooke has the edgy, heroic nature down, a virtual Wonder Woman who combines brain and skills to deliver the sassy goods to the group. These two have wonderful chemistry together, two leaders who incite a rebellion of imagination, accomplishing it with grace that many young actors fail to deliver. Ben Mendelsohn makes a good villain as well, a corporate wannabe who has only the eyes for cash and lacks the brains to go with the brash. World Creating/Visuals: No surprise here, Spielberg's team invested a lot of time bringing the world to life. Ready Player One's visuals are stunning, taking the imagination of Cline's book and making it pop to life on screen. The various planets all have dynamic visuals to bring each one to life, with exciting, pristine villas grounded by the rugged battlefields of volcanoes. The real world of a future dystopian society is nicely created with their settings and with direction meshes well with our heroes' journey through the cyberspace. And as for the characters themselves, the team managed to recreate the various pop culture references in fantastic design but adding its own twist to correlate with the movie. The heroes have that video game feel, immersing you further into the virtual reality setting as if you were part of the rebellion. The Action: The trailers promised action, and by George did it deliver... on most of the movie. Ready Player One starts strong with some action-packed sequences where racing and FPS/Third Person battles reign supreme. The theater shakes with the intensity and brings a promise that the rest of the movie is going to be just as fun. The rest of the sequences semi-deliver on this promise, primarily the final battle that has some incredible parts. Nonetheless, Spielberg's department did a bang-up job bringing the rush that video games bring, primarily the selling point for seeing it in the theater. The Nostalgia/Reference Hunting: However, the biggest selling point for me was the thrill of hunting down all the cultural Easter eggs/icons that they paid a fortune to portray. My eyes were busy seeking everything crammed in this movie, trying to see which 80's icons made the cut. While 80% are video game references, you'll find various movie, television, and song references shading the oasis, most cleverly brought in to bring life to the scenes in a meaningful way. I'll admit, the replay value of this movie comes in trying to track down everything hidden, like the Easter egg prize they are all seeking. The key demographic of this movie is going to be the fans, nerds, and gamers, as their eager eyes will enjoy seeing their favorites come together to battle the corrupt evil at hand. 
DISLIKES: The Lack of Challenge: Let's get this settled, the movie is not the book, and to be fair a movie about the actions of the book might have been duller to the general audience. However, the movie could have taken a page for challenging puzzles and cultural integration, because it didn't quite execute this component as well. Most of the quests for the key were diluted compared to brainteasing nightmares of the novel, that could have involved more research and diving than what we got. In addition, some of the solutions were a little more like backdoor cheats than true solutions to the impasses at hand. Character Development: I agree again with my fellow reviewers that the character development suffered a bit as well. Parzival and Art3mis get some decent backstories and growth, but the other characters are sort of thrown into the movie like hamburgers on a flat top. They have those moments that sizzle, only to quickly become fully cooked and dropped back into the background. Even worse, the legendary skills that were boasted in the book/movie are not really delivered for our supporting cast, such a shame really. Not the worst character use, but also not what I had expected. More Action: Surprise, surprise, Robbie wants more action. Ready Player One's scenes are incredible at times, almost as if we have visors on our heads and living the game. The problem for me is... they were too short at times and didn't feel complete for me. I didn't feel this too much until near the middle of the movie when the film hit a slow snag and could have used one or two battles to liven it up. However, the biggest thing I wanted, was seeing the millions of dollars of references used more than the fleeting glances we got. The moves done were cool but watching Parzival and crew work together with the iconic game crew rather than background noise would have been nice. I-ROk: This character wasn't utilized much in the book, so seeing him mentioned in the credits was a surprise. Sadly, they didn't do much with this character, to the point where he was almost not needed. The gaming community knows about epic hunters, villains, and rogues, but this movie failed to deliver on those grounds, instead getting a sarcastic flop. While the main villain was expected to be a rather incompetent jerk, his prized mercenary should have had a little more bite to back things up. Perhaps then the epic climax might have worked a little better, well that and maybe foregoing the van chase at the end... that wasn't needed as much. The VERDICT:  Ready Player One the movie is not the book, and the purists who want that book to real life are going to be disappointed with the changes that were made to liven it up. However, Spielberg's take on the film works in regards to action, visuals, and giving us the ultimate finder book of geek references. While the story needed some more wit and character development, the main tweaks needed to be using more of their merchandizing, more of their characters, and pushing their villains to be more. Had these elements been more explored, it would have given this movie more of the finesse it was looking for. Still, this adventure deserves a theater run given the special effects. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.5

Molly's Game," A Royal Flush In Acting, Writing and Fashion. Be Game For This Smart Film

-Jargon Heavy Molly's game is a drama that remained entertaining and engaging from start to finish. Its success comes in the presentation of the movie, tying past and present together in a format that keeps the movie pushing towards the goal of describing Molly's consequences of her actions and in a pace, that does not drag. This presentation has strong writing for the film to spring off on, and such a strong foundation made the job of bringing her story to life to an easier level. Yet the acting, primarily by Chastain and Elba, is the royal flush of the game, the former doing the heavy lifting to bring this role to life. All of the emotion is packed in this performance, crafting a character that will inspire and empower the audience for at least the first ten minutes post showing. 
 Certainly, this movie isn't the most original tale to come to Hollywood's corner, but that doesn't stop the studios from fluffing up the character somewhat. I think this is a more realistic biography, but one can't help but question the integrity of the film staying true to Molly's tale. Outside of that, the film primarily needed some tightening up of the scenes and cutting out some fluff to reduce the run time. Throw in some better definitions of the various jargon involved in this gambling world and you would have smoothed out some of the rough edges I had with this movie. 
 Molly's game lacks a lot of the flash, bang, boom that modern cinema has, but in its place, is an engaging, realistic tale that is a beautiful portrayal of this woman's life. It may not be the most exciting tale, but it's a drama I loved because it cut much of the overdramatic moments out and kept it at an exciting pace with its dynamic presentation. I strongly encourage many to go see this film in theaters, but definitely scope it out when it hits the rental places in three months. If you are really looking for a movie that portrays the talented part of Hollywood, check this movie out then.",9,2,6,5 January 2018
Moana," You'll go have Mo Funna if You See Moanna
","It wouldn't feel like Thanksgiving without a Disney animated feature to grace the silver screen. And this weekend the animation studios are at it again with another masterpiece sure to be nominated for best animated picture of the year. The name of the movie this time is Moana, a tale of Polynesian mythology wrapped up in a nice, Disney magical package. Will this movie net Disney the best picture of the year award, or is it just another filler until Pixar's next work? Robbie K happy to bring you another review this holiday season. Let's get started. LIKES: Â• Fun, new setting Â• Comedy Â• Soundtrack was kickingWe all know Disney makes fun films, but Moana's fun comes in form of the beautiful settings of the Pacific. Stepping away from the castles, this film will enchant you as you set sail on the majestic oceans and the mythical creatures that inhabit them. The world is colorful and dynamically shaded to match the tones of the film, which give the film a little energy to spice things up. No surprise, the animation is fluid (as always) as realistic movements (both living and nonliving) are captured in this breathtaking CGI. While I didn't see it in 3-D, this film's design would have popped out more with the special effects, therefore earning a recommendation to give it a try if you wish. But a Disney movie isn't just about the scenery, oh no you have to have characters that make you laugh and you can latch onto. Moana continues this trend, with the lead character (Moana) being the ever inspiring, girl power rocking, role model that most leads are. In terms of laughs though, Maui has you covered on this field. Dwayne Johnson delivers in the film, his bold, brash, and loud delivery matching the charisma of the demi-god. The hero has plenty of silly qualities to him, clever one-liners, slapstick antics, and a dancing tattoo which kept me laughing through most of the film. Throw in an idiotic chicken and anthropomorphic ocean and the you get a unique team for tickling your funny bone. My favorite aspect of this movie though has to be the soundtrack. This movie finally took a step back into the Disney renaissance world. A fantastic orchestra work sets the stage for adventure, bold brass instruments blaring and drums pounding as the boat coasts out into the wild. Other scenes have a more elegant touch to them to match the touching moments, rounding out the emotion of the film in a complete package. But many will fall in love with the original music our cast composes, bringing the upbeat, inspirational tone that will have young and young at heart hitting repeat over and over again. The soundtrack was perfect for this movie, and yours truly loved the islander twist to spice the tunes up. DISLIKES: Â• Not as exciting as other adventures Â• Unnecessary scenes Â• Missed potentialWhile Moana was fun and beautiful, it wasn't the most thrilling tale to grace the library. The film lacked suspense for me, never finding myself at the edge of my seat fearing for our heroes. Perhaps it was the obvious foreshadowing, or the fact that very little of the threats seemed deadly, but more cuddly and silly. Plus, the character development was a little lacking at times, so there didn't seem the looming threat of Disney killing a favorite character. Without the excitement, the adventure did grow a bit dull in terms of thrills, but fortunately the fun and animation make up for it. An even stronger dislike was how unnecessary some of the scenes were in the film for me. A few of the moments, were impromptu sequences meant to instill a sense of urgency, an effort I appreciate. However, the urgency had already been established and these scenes added little to the overall emotion or plot of the story. Unfortunately, the biggest sting was entering one 'supposedly' dangerous island that Maui builds up. It had such build up and potential, and then they dropped it. This island could have been a very unique and dangerous world that added some edge and diversity to the film in regards to bizarre flora and fauna. Yet, they quickly skimmed over this part to get to an obnoxious character (the conflict with him rather lackluster), which left me a tad disappointed. Sadly, no other creatures or beasts appeared from the depths to enhance the adventure, nor any major challenges to gradually enhance the skills of our heroes. The bottom line of this dislike, is that the editing was slightly off track for this reviewer and could have been expanded upon to add more depth and excitement to the film. The VERDICTMoana is another fine example of how awesome Disney is at animation. Beautiful visuals bring alive a unique world that will make you crave to be on the majestic waters of the pacific islands. In addition, it's a very fun movie that contains both laughs and music to instill the positive energy that Disney films love to do around the holidays. Despite all of this though, it wasn't the most exciting adventure for me and I really would have liked to see more of the mythology brought into the tale to further develop our lovable characters (and more of the cute pig too). Still, this film is worth visiting in the theaters for all ages and will spread some early holiday joy over you and those you love.

BlacKkKlansman," Those who don't learn from history, are doomed to repeat it
","Robbie K back again with another review, this time on a biography that showed promise for being a wild, crime filled law. Yet, there was the potential political game embedded in it that looked to get in the way, bringing concern that this movie may go down the wrong pathway. Nevertheless, I'm back to give you yet another review in hopes that I can help shed some light onto whether the movie is worth its weight in money. Let's get started on the review of: Blackkklansman (2018)Director:
 Spike Lee
Writers:
 Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz 
Stars:
 John David Washington, Adam Driver, Laura Harrier 
LIKES: Great Setting 
Costumes And Makeup
Clever Comedy
Awesome Sound Editing
Fantastic Acting
Strong Lessons  Blackkklansman is one of those movies that brings you back in time to all the crazy events of history. The setting alone feels like a blast from the past, as we drop into the war against segregation from the unique perspective of an undercover agent. Amidst the world building of this movie, comes an impressive display of retro fashions of the time, bringing nostalgia and a certain panache to the film. In addition, the fantastic soundtrack and sound editing brings that needed dynamic that represents emotion. While the film is certainly strong in the drama/crime aspect, the comedy is reserved for those with a dryer sense of humor. Clever wit awaits the audiences for this movie, forgoing the over the top slapstick for a richer laugh generator. Of course, all of this fails without great acting, and this film's two leads reach the goal of bringing the times to life and representing the story it wanted to tell. This strong work helps sell the strong lessons of what history can teach, wrapping it up in very grandiose, preachy method that rolls with the movie. DISLIKES: Aggressive dialogue
Too Dry at Times
Slow Pace
The Ending?
 Back in the day, the politeness and filtering were highly more advanced than today's standards. Sadly, the accurate yelling and vocabulary is a little too much for me, hearing all the derogative slanders, hating, and passionate politics just got to eye rolling proportions. Fan who don't like all the forbidden words of sailor talk, need to already turn away from this movie, though it still has nothing on Django Unchained and Phone Booth. Trying to offset this is the comedy that totally goes down the dryer route, but sometimes it becomes more a desert wasteland devoid of the usual comedic ocean. This leads to some fewer entertaining choices, and with it a slower, dragged out piece. Blackkklansman is horrible for pacing with me, establishing fantastic details, but sort of shirking the time management thing in advance of a complete story Still, the movie needed some spice to well spice things up so that the monotony could be broken up at times. Finally, the ending. Symbology and tributes are there to help motivate and teach the life lesson contained in this viewing. However, the real error I have is that the ending itself seems out of place for me. I get it, the movie was showing some current events, but it just didn't fit with the story they were trying to tell, which was about the past. The VERDICT:  Blackkklansman is an artistic piece of work, that makes some parts of history fun to revisit. However, the movie still needs some help with maximizing the entertainment/suspense element in their work. Given the dry, barren joke pool and an ending that doesn't quite click, you can see why the film gets some points docked away from it. Still, looking for the informative, big-budget portrayal of the events that took place, the movie does warrant some applause for the ability to make history come to life once more. Worth a trip to the theater? Can't say so, unless you want a political work of art... literally. My scores:Biography/Comedy/Crime: 7.5

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Web Slinging, Comedic Sensation: Feels Much Like the Comic Book
","He can do whatever a spider can! He is super brainy and has the ability to fight crime against a number of villains with interesting powers. And he has had two reboots in the last two decades. Yes, I'm talking about Spiderman, the young high school student who wears the coolest pajamas ever and has some pretty wicked powers. This weekend, Disney studios gets their hands on the series, in hopes of breathing life back into the series and expanding their already vast repertoire of films. Can Disney repeat its magic? Robbie K here to give you the updates, and as always, I appreciate your reading and fun. Let's get started!LIKES:Not another origin story: With all the reboots, cartoon series, and comics (if you still read), we know how the web slinger obtained his powers via radioactive arachnid science projects. As such, the storyboard writers decided to scrap doing another reboot of this and dived right into the fun at hand. Thank the lord! Spiderman homecoming skips the boring, lacking power component, so that you get the most bang for your buck in regards to super power heroics and Spiderman clichÃ©s. The presentation of this film is rather creative, using a selfie video to give a unique perspective on everything this Spiderman has gone through so far. Fun and Funny: Spiderman Homecoming takes a different approach from most of the other superhero films in that it feels like a high school student life only withÂ…powers. The result is a film that is fun, simplistic, and as me and my friend agree comedic. This tale is all about making you laugh with a fantastic dialog, great delivery, and a cast that only amplifies it. It's not easy making a high school film that isn't an afterschool special, drama filled, soap opera and still make it entertaining to watch. But Disney was able to do it again. While the production team has a lot to do with this, most audience members are going to give props to the acting. Tom Holland again rocks the role, taking his cameo from Civil War and runningÂ… I mean slinging with it. He is the first actor in this modern age to capture both the nerdy peter parker and the smart mouthed Spiderman, giving you the character you wanted made for some time. Now throw in Michael Keaton portraying a villain who didn't make you cringe, yawn, or sympathize for the performance they were asked to play. The dynamic between them works and to take a lamer villain like the Vulture and make him respectable gets thumbs up from me. And they utilized their entire cast very well, keeping their big-name contenders involved without robbing the main actor his time to shine. Ned: But my friend and I agreed that the best part of the film was Peter's sidekick Ned played by Jacob Batalon. This character had me in enough stitches to require Spiderman to web it up. Batalon delivers his lines perfectly, and makes the already comedic gold shine where others would fail. He feels like a devoted fan boy and it works to keep things entertaining. The cast did a great job sharing Peter's secret with him and having him as the devoted friend wanting to do whatever he can to live as a super sidekick. This character's work is dynamic, it's fun, and shows not all cleverness has been lost to cheap slapstick ploys. DISLIKES:Special effects are so so: I don't know if it's the costume, the approach, or what, but the special effects didn't impress me as much as they usually do. Spiderman's movements looked fake at times, and the weapons (outside of Vulture's costume) were a bit hokie looking. Not the biggest dislike, but worth noting. Editing/Lack of Action: Biggest dislike for me is more so the lack of action. No surprise, Robbie wants his superheroes to have at least one engaging fight, but that wasn't the case for me in this film. While Homecoming was funny and entertaining, it still lacked the bite that superhero films have had. The fights were short lived, didn't involve too many spectacular moves, and the villains didn't have any impressive moves. We know Spidey's universe have some of the most unique powers of the bunch, so why in the world didn't they show that off more. Of note, the battles do keep in theme with the movie, and are emotional in regards to character development, that is a plus. Yet a 134-minute run time needed a few more suspenseful moments to get the full effect. Either that or cut out the extra laugh, unnecessary moments to shorten the run time. Sorry guys, but editing is still in need of work. The VERDICT:Spiderman Homecoming is certainly one of the better installments of the modern Spiderman age. It certainly is one of the more enjoyable comedies I've seen in a while, and takes some of the darker edge that has been building over the last few installments. A great use of cast, good writing, and many other fun gimmicks works on so many levels and will entertain many. Yet it isn't the most exciting film of this universe, nor did it need to be over 2 hours long. Still, it's a great addition to the library and one I look forward to seeing continued and integrated into the rest of the films. Worth a trip to the theater? Oh yeah (as if I can stop you), it is worth it. My scores: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5",8,6,13,7 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," More NOS, Less Plot
","What has beautiful women, fast cars, comedy, and action? No I'm not talking about a college spring break in Miami, Florida; I'm talking about the latest installment in the Fast and Furious Franchise. Last night two of my buddies and I had the privilege of seeing an early showing of Furious 6, and like always I have plenty to say. Let's get started.For those who saw Fast Five, you know that Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) were expecting their first child, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew were all millionaires and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) was 'searching' for them. Number six picks up pretty much two months later, showing how the heist crew, minus the two demolition experts, are enjoying their well-earned rewards. In F&F world though, nothing every remains quiet for long as a ghost from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) stirs the embers of intrigue and revenge in Dom resulting in the team coming together to find her. Now let's start the review.The opening of this movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but provides enough laughs and information to refresh old fans memory of the plot, while making a small foundation for those new to the series. After a ridiculous interrogation scene, a rushed planning scenes, and some more jokes later, bam we get to our first action scene. Now you might be thinking, oh great another loud sequence of cars rushing through the road sending pedestrians and bystanders dodging to the sides. For the most part you are right, but this time they are chasing after a band of mercenaries led by Luke Evans attempting to steal some government secret weapon component. While this goal is not the most unique, it's at least a slight change up to the typical motives behind the adrenaline pumping, engine roaring speed fest that we've seen for the last thirteen years. The stunts are still impressive, the cars so sleek and beautiful it hurts, and the music so aggressive that it blends into an exciting ride. Of course this wouldn't be worthy of being an F&F movie if there was only one chase scene right Don't worry number six has a few more car scenes that continue to show off the world of stunt driving, CGI and mediocre plots centered around finding ways to make cars go fast.One should note though that the action isn't just limited to cars. Nope F&F6 opens has taken the liberty to add more diversity in their butt kicking arsenal. With the Rock taking more screen time, fans get to see a few more fist fights and body slamming that allows you to see what the Rock is cooking. When Johnson isn't putting the hurt on someone, the rest of the gang takes their shots at either putting a cap in someone, or pulling out some martial arts skills to defeat their opponents. Some of these fights rock, while others are merely meant to have you laughing as the heroes throw out witty banter. Despite some of the ridiculousness and over the top stunts, the action will still have action fans on the edge of their seats, hooting for their favorite characters.Putting the action aside though, the movie does have other qualities that help balance things out. For one thing the comedy in this movie is still strong, especially when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) takes the stage. The feisty, self-involved, ladies' man is the center of the comedic pillar pulling all the other characters in to a friendly rivalry that symbolizes the brotherhood between the team. From my standpoint, I think Gibson must make these jokes daily, as the acting made it seem that it was just an ordinary day, especially when going toe to toe with Tej (Ludacris).For me the comedy also helped make up for some of the plot holes this movie had. The lack of reasoning behind Evans attacks left me feeling as this guy was just crazy. The plot revolving around Dom and Letty though was the better developed of the story, with much of the movie focusing on the internal struggles occurring between the two. While the romance is not my favorite part, the movie does a good job not rubbing love in my face, and actually uses the plot to bring in other ghosts from the pasts to strengthen the movie. Laughs and love aside, the movie also does a nice job keeping you on your toes as to who will survive the ordeal. Many times there are close calls where you are not sure if someone will live, and yes there are even some deaths that upset my friends, despite how predictable it was. All in all though, the plot isn't the worst thing I've seen, it just was lacking in some areas that I felt failed where the fifth one succeeded. Luckily we still have a nice balance of characters/actors in the movie, with the exception of a few who took a major back seat to Dom and Letty, (i.e. Mia, Tej, and Elena). While the action was impressive, the camera work still had a few spastic moments that were either a bit dizzying or a bit annoying. As for the villain, again the guy had skills and a lethal team, but they failed to really build him up or give him some pizazz to make him stand out as a great bad guy. Regardless F&F6 is a good movie and keeps the series alive for at least one more movie to come, watch the credits. Acting is just like before, the action is still rip roaring fun, and the comedy is golden to keep you laughing the whole time. Yet some weaknesses in plot and centering on Letty/Dom hindered this movie to make it less enjoyable for me. My scores are below: Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.5 Movie: 7.0",Null,0,1,24 May 2013
Black Mass," Depp Leads the Mob Acting, but Depressing and Dull at Points
","Icy Blue eyes stare at you, their cold, blue gaze promising fear and death with every blink. Who or what do these eyes belong too? None other than the notorious criminal Jimmy Whitey Bulger, one of the most notorious crime lords in history. OkayÂ… so maybe it was Johnny Depp playing the mob legend, but regardless of the source, those eyes sum up the tone of the movie Black Mass. This film kind of snuck under the radar for most, but I'm here to help shed some light on what it beholds. Returning after a three-week hiatus, it's Robbie K with another movie review. As the title suggests, Black Mass is a tale that is perhaps one of the darkest movies I've seen in a long time. The visual portrayal of Bulger's rise to power is one without filters, where violence, threats, and death rain in high definition splendor. Unlike older mob movies that resulted to gunfights and quick, clean kills, Black Mass gets its hands dirty with detailed torture and gore painting the silver screen a sickly red. Those with weak constitutions will need to avoid this picture, especially during the instances where Whitey results to other means to deal with the 'rats' of Boston. I give props to Scott Cooper and his team for unfolding a portion of the mafia world, but like so many took it a little too far than was necessary. How many random characters being shot in the head does one really need to see to get the message? The major component that I felt was the greatest aspect of this movie was the acting. Once more Johnny Depp has impressed me with his talent, temporarily chucking the whimsical and wacky for the dark and dismal. Depp brings a level of unease and terror I never thought possible in both looks (great makeup) and delivery of his lines. Like many of my fellow reviewers have stated, this could indeed be an Oscar worthy role for Depp and while he was the main pillar of this movie there were other supporting actors who need a little praise. Joel Edgerton as the corrupt CIA officer packs a pretty mean punch, oozing with festering greed, as he feigns ignorance for Whitey's services, while trying to cover his hide. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of a politician to the T, with the confidence, arrogance, and cheesy grin to sell the crowd. The movie could have been even better if Cumberbatch could have been more integrated in the film, but he made the most of his time. And of course Kevin Bacon uses his familiar tactics , which although not impressive, did help tie the story together. Now what about the story? Whitey's tale is very detailed, showing the life changing events that shaped him into the threat he became. Even more detailed is the corrupt deals Whitey makes, and the drama that unfolds with each shot. However, despite all the attention to detail, the tale isn't all that exciting. Black Mass felt more like an upscale documentary, devoid of any movie magic or exciting choreographed scenes. The pace of the movie is slow; at times feeling like it's going nowhere, primarily due to a lack of suspense. Maybe if there had been a rival in his history, or at least some glimmer of hope it could have had a little more thrill to it. The details also make things a bit convoluted as well and hard to follow until they literally state the purpose a few minutes later. What does this boil down to? A need for editing, to not only assist with the clarity, but also keep the depression to an absolute minimum. However, if you are one for the facts and wish to avoid the fluff that Hollywood thrives on, this movie's dynamics will more than entertain you.Black Mass certainly has some of the best mobster betrayal seen for some time, capturing the ruthless nature of the Boston underbelly. However, if you can't stomach intense violence, and you are looking for some more exciting twists to a film you need to pick another option. This film has a lot of quality to it, but overall it wasn't the most entertaining or impressive film to grace the silver screen. Being a biography, this movie probably would have been better suited for a TV special on the History channel. My suggestion is to wait for this one to come to Redbox to watch in the comfort of your own home, unless of course you are an avid mob movie fan, or Depp enthusiast.

Suicide Squad," Fun, Funny, and Fierce. Suicide's journey i as crazy as the cast.
","It's here, it's here, the long awaited antihero movie has finally reared its rather odd looking head into theaters tonight. With all the justice filled men and women in sparkling underwear, Hollywood's superhero sea needed a little color added to it. Suicide Squad looks to be just the ticket to provide that color and the trailers only fueled my excitement. But one always wonders if the movie will be as good as the trailers, or if it will bite the big one. Hi, Robbie K here, and I'm here to share my opinions on the latest movie. Let's get started. The GOOD Â• Comedy is spot on Â• Decent action/antihero theme Â• Margot Robbie is awesomeThere is so much to say about this movie, and I wish to start with the comedy. If there is one thing superhero movies deliver on (outside of flashy outfits) it is usually a good comedic kick. Suicide Squad ups that factor as the band of rogues provide their views on life, often in a pessimistic jab. The lines are well written filled with a combination of whit and pizazz that are blended into a potpourri of themes that are very entertaining to hear. Our writers were also able to balance these lines throughout the movie, and mix in some additional comedic styles to further blend in the mix. And he delivery, alongside the timing, maximized the punch and delivered the intended relief in this rather somber tale.But you didn't come for comedy alone (this isn't Bad Moms). NoÂ…you came for action with an antihero twist. Once again, the movie delivers as our assorted criminals tear through the CGI generated villains with their various gadgets and styles. These moments are exciting, giving a decent balance of everyone's abilities from Quinn's use of a baseball bat or Diablo's computer animated fire. The first battle in particular was my favorite of the bunch, but the other fights weren't bad and provided some exciting (often explosive) fun. And it's all nicely packaged with that living on the edge, careless joy that bad guys seem to enjoy and we expected. It's dark, it's vicious, and it certainly is funÂ…at parts (more on that later).Yet one of the biggest positives of this movie both my friend and I agree on is Margot Robbie. The beautiful actress certainly brings the sex appeal, which is highlighted by the trailers, and she certainly got a response by the audience members in the stage. Outside of looks though, she nails the role of the psychotic Harley Quinn. Her high pitched screams, the ecstatic enjoyment of danger, and the devoted passion for violence were all captured by her and she certainly brought the edge we longed for. In addition, the movies performed by Quinn matched her personality and completed the deadliness of Mr. J's assistant. She was a major carrier of the film and certainly a well-casted member of the crew. The BAD Â• Story was kind of lacking Â• Action crosses into cheesy and unbalanced territory Â• Emphasis on only a few characters One thing that a lot of movies can't seem to get is the balance of story with action. Suicide Squad's tale doesn't feel much like a comic book tale, and fell short on some levels for me. A random opening that drops into a long winded origin tale whose pace became very erratic. From their the tale rushed at parts and then dragged at others and prolonged dialogue prior to the fight didn't help things along. The 'twists' behind their missions were kind of lame (and somewhat random) and was not impressive despite the buildup of the trailer (I was hoping more Joker and less gargantuan beast). It wasn't the worst story of a hero flick, but this reviewer thinks it needed some tightening up. Something else that didn't stay consistent was the action. Remember I said the first battle was exciting, fast, and truly rocked. Well that momentum gradually gets lost as the movie progresses. Exciting romps become quick skirmishes where overdramatic theatrics are the weapon of choice instead of choreographed numbers. The exciting conclusion at the end is probably the least engaging of the fights, and dropped into the uber theatrical, symphony driven sequences that Hollywood loves. In addition some of the comedic irony in the film made the battle almost pointless and only further took away from the action. And finally the balance on the characters was a little skewed considering the trailers announcing the line up. Deadshot and Harley Quinn took center stage in both story and action, and although they portrayed it well kind of robbed the involvement of the other characters. Pyro and Sorceress had their own contributions to tale, but even those were a cheesy subplot that fit awkwardly in this tale. As for Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, and other members of the team, they fell into comedic relief positions that either started a laugh riot or fell on deaf ears. Again, everyone played their parts well, but the disproportionate representation of the characters and the unorganized tale robbed us of potential magic. So much for teamwork I guess.The VerdictDespite the cheesiness, uncouth, and disproportionate aspects of the movie, Suicide Squad is certainly a fun movie to kick August off with. I feel you many will certainly enjoy the laughs that the gang will provide and the action sequences are sure to get some applause until they fall into corny territory. Again it doesn't seem like they could decide on the route to go, but DC studios is getting closer to getting the formula right. Is this movie worth a trip to the theater? I think it certainly is, but not in 3-D if I do say so myself. My scores: Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",Null,4,8,4 August 2016
Life of Pi," I Like Pi's Visuals
","Next up on my Thanksgiving weekend reviews is the newest novel based movie called Life of Pi. This past summer I was captivated by the wonderful trailer that was visually stunning and had a killer soundtrack that matched the flow of the trailer. When I found out Ang Lee was directing it I got even more excited that this film was going to be an artistic wonder. Since I hadn't read the book though, I had no idea what else I was in store for other than a modern version of the Cast Away movie. So what did this movie have to offer? Read on to find out.For those who haven't seen the trailer or read the book, Life of Pi is the tale of a man named Piscine Patel, known by most as Pi, an Indian boy who likes to question many rules and discover new lessons. On the voyage to a new home in Canada, the boat Pi and his family are riding capsizes leaving him stranded with a few animals and some rations on a small lifeboat. The teenage boy will discover a world he never imagined, while struggling to maintain his life in the lonely world of the ocean.That's pretty much the plot, so you might wonder what makes this movie different from Cast Away, other than the main character is Indian and there is a tiger. I'll start with talking about the visuals of this move, which for me and a couple of my buddies was the best element of the movie. From the get go, the cinematography is amazing capturing the natural beauty of the Indian continent. As the opening credits start, the audience is treated to some well angled shots of the various zoo creatures, each doing their own thing as if nothing is happening. Once the movie officially starts though, the camera work continues to get better, with every angle being selected to get the most out of the scene. Even the chaotic scenes aboard the sinking ship were well captured, skipping the chaotic camera angles for the use of CGI and visuals to create the feelings of uncontrolled fear. When calm eventually returns the desolate world of the vast ocean is impressively recreated on the screen. Many of its inhabitants are well polished and designed to have you thinking they are real, that is until you get a closer look. Upon focusing on the actual creatures, you can see where the realism starts to blur a bit, as the animals become a little too polished and clean. Despite this though, the animation for the animals is still impressive, capturing their movements to the finite detail and adapting them to the interaction with Pi and the tiger. Thus the artistic aspects of this movie are definitely prevailing in this movie. A second big quality of this movie is the spirituality built into this feature film. Before even pushing out on the boat, Pi begins experimenting with multiple religions, each being explained in their connection to the deities. Those interested in religion will get a nice refresher course in theology; though will appreciate more of the practice in this movie. Scenes where Pi prays or talks to God are sure to strike up some feelings in fans, whether good or bad really depends on the person. For this reviewer, it did make me thankful for many things, and helping strengthen my spiritual connection. There are even a few other scenes that seem like a trippy experience into the spiritual realm that is visually beautiful, but still a little weird. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. What else is there to mention about this movie? Well I can warn you now that there are some graphic scenes of life that may disturb some people. I admit that some of the animal hostility in this film made me very sad, and could make little kids cry their eyes out. Despite this sadness though, I have to admit it is very realistic as when fighting for survival animals can turn into savage monsters. Those looking for a story with lots of twists and turns are also advised to skip this movie as well, since it is little more than an Indian boy fighting for survival and documenting his adventure. However, those who like movies that dive into the mind and character are going to be up for this film. Another thing about this film is the pace of the movie keeps things a little slow. Again this is a life adventure, but did we really need over two hours of film to see this? For this reviewer not really, as half an hour less could have helped with the long dragging feeling of this film. The acting by Suraj Sharma was very passionate at many points in the movie and well representative of the emotions. Unfortunately some of the scenes forced him to be a little too passionate in his yelling, leading to a little over-dramatic tension.To wrap this review up, Ang Lee and company have created a visually stunning masterpiece that makes you think about your spiritual beliefs. With award winning animation, polished creature design, beautiful settings and cinematography, and some well done editing, it's no doubt this movie will be a candidate for best visual effects. What could have made it even better though was adding a soundtrack like the trailer to further bring out the magic, instead of just using it for the sad scenes. Regardless this movie is best seen in the theater with the visuals, yet if you go for plot wait until it releases on Netflix. My scores for this movie are the following: Adventure/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0 please email rkarim11@su.edu for constructive criticism",7,4,8,22 November 2012
Interstellar," Familiar Adventure, Awesome Graphics and Lots of Complexity
","When you think of Christopher Nolan, you probably think of the Dark Knight trilogy that ended a few years ago. However you may recall a little number called Inception that had a little less caped crusader, and a little more mind twisting. Now that the dark knight has hung up his cape, Nolan and his brother may have produced another epic tale in the form of a space adventure called Interstellar. This genre has been absent in the movies lately, so I was excited to see what the director had in store. Was it good or did it flop? As always I'm happy to share my opinions. Interstellar's story is like most space exploration tales. The earth is dying and the future of humans is once again at stake. Pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is a farmer/engineer is drafted into the rocket program to find other worlds to start colonizing on. Of course this involves leaving his two kids behind, possibly never seeing them again. And just like most space stories, things start to go wrong. Interstellar's plot follows the formula of other space dramas in which things go well at first, but then quickly take a turn for the worse. Yes, like Apollo 13 and other space classics, the crew of this movie faces their fair number of challenges in the unknown. Fans will find themselves gripping the seats, or holding their breath as the drama unfolds, each scene filled with the spectacular orchestra work of Hans Zimmer. Most of the incidents you can see coming, but I'll admit there were a few twists thrown in that surprised even me. Interspersed with the action of the movie, is an intense dialogue that holds a lot in its well-written words. First off is character development, the backstories gradually being revealed as the group progressed on their journey. While some of the traumatic past seemed to be swept under the rug, fans will get plenty of material to help get attached to the characters. For this reviewer, I found that each of the characters got a fair amount of involvement in the movie, and the stories meshed well together to bring a good dynamic amidst the group. However, this reviewer also got a little annoyed about the constant complaining about saving the ones they loved versus completing the mission. WE knew the issues at hand, but Nolan's writing wanted to make sure that we knew how hard it was. This did allow for some good moral testing in the dialog, seeing how far Cooper and the gang would go before diverging from their goals. In addition to these qualities, the writing is also filled with a plethora of scientific jargon that will have the audience either impressed, laughing, or completely stumped. Theoretical physics and quantum mechanics are the backbone of the journey, explaining the principles to how this journey works and why it is such a challenge. I was able to follow most of the dialogue, but determining how accurate and realistic it is, lie beyond my skills. Also there were some well time comedy moments as well, in particular from the robots, that were clever and witty. However, the biggest strength of this movie is the phenomenal effects it has to offer. Interstellar is beautifully crafted to bring the exploration into the unknown to life, with high definition graphics and amazing sound. Planet surfaces are incredibly detailed, from the shimmer of light off the water, to the jagged crags of the icy wasteland. The spaceships themselves have a fair amount of realism to it, though at times things are a bit to blocky or bright to maintain the realism. Even the journey through the wormhole will impress fans as the dazzling lights and whooshing sounds put you right into the fray. Regardless of what part of the movie, rests assure that the visuals are impressive and a big part of what brings the excitement to the movie. Yet for all the good this movie has, including the fantastic acting, Interstellar did have a few weaknesses for me. For one it was a very morbid movie, with so much focus on the negative. This movie has you questioning a lot about the limited time span called life, and may be a bit too depressing for some people. A second weakness was some of the overstretching they did in this movie. I get that the genre is called science fiction, but some of the things they did in this movie were a bit too out there for me. Specific examples can't be shared, but you'll get what I mean when you get further into the movie. If it was meant to be ridiculous, I could accept it, but for the serious tone in this movie, it didn't fit well with me. I'm sure you can guess my next weakness is time length of the movie. Well three hours is a bit much for me these days, and with a slow beginning to set the situation up, it can really drag. However, most of the movie is very interesting and the situations are set up to an extent that most of the movie passes by quickly, though there are still some slow parts. There are a few other things to mention, but let's wrap this up. Interstellar is an awesome movie on so many levels. Yes many will see many similarities to the movie contact, and it does lack some originality. However, this movie is a welcome treat that stands out from the monotonous mess movies have become. I have no doubt this movie will be up for some Oscar awards, especially with the editing involved. This reviewer strongly recommends catching this movie in theaters, though be warned of the length when planning your day.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Does It Rise To Close the Saga? Skywalker's Return Has Balance Issues
","LIKES:
The Dialogue
The Symbolism/Emotions
The Nostalgia
The New Worlds
Better Pace
The Visuals and Sound Editing
The Twists (surprises)
The Action (sometimes)
The ComedyDISLIKES:
The Choppiness Of The film
The Story's indecisiveness
Too Many Characters
Trying to Please Too Many People
The Action
Not Enough Focus On The New
The Overkill On Things
The Lack Of Emotion At Times
The Impasses falling too easily
Too much in one film
The VERDICT:I did not love this film like some of the other installments, but I also did not hate it either. Rise Of Skywalker's main flaws are the inability to decide what fanbase they wanted to hit, and trying to put way too much into one movie. The attempt to conclude the movie faltered on uniqueness and cohesiveness, always hinting at awesomeness, but never quite getting there due to the coordination failures. It exceeds at the superficial ooh and ahhs of visuals, moves much better in terms of pace, gets comedy, nostalgia, and symbolism baked in, and does manage to keep dialogue smart to help twist some things up. Yet, as I agree with other fans, the movie needs to use this time as a reset for future installments, so that they may bring a new story out that takes the nostalgia, but allows a new legacy to build (see Rogue One Or the Mandalorian). From there, the story can get back to the adventures we loved, and still gets those overcharged heroes that seem to motivate costumes of the 21st century. That and please stop making the grandiose ideas be the stars, please find something better to do instead.My scores for the closing chapter are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5

Pacific Rim," Action Packed Fun on the Pacific
","Action fans rejoice, for Pacific Rim has come to deliver the robot vs monster goodness the trailers tempted us with earlier this year. With stunning visuals, this movie does what its predecessors failed before to focus on the titans and not on the supporting humans, well at least not all the time. Battles involve adapting combat strategy and blending weapons with martial arts leading to some epic challenges that span for minutes at a time instead of a thirty second blast to the spark chamber. Combine this with the intense soundtrack and you get a collection of sequences that draw you into the adventure you've been craving for most of the summer. The plot isn't bad either, but movie goers like me will see how much they knocked off from other films. These mashed dynamics were nicely edited together, but I'll admit there are some tie-ins that are a bit overstretched for my taste and a bit lazy on their part. Unfortunately, the team failed the challenge of balancing combat between robots. Once again they built up an epic arsenal of robotic warriors, only to fail on giving them screen time, many having about four minutes of glory. Sorry, but what's the point of making these things if you're only going to focus on Optimus, I mean Gypsy. There are a few other things that this movie fails on, but overall it's a fun time at the movies, and in my opinion worthy of a trip to the 3-D cinema.

Ant-Man," A Marching Start for The Next Wave
","Marvel has entered its third wave and the intended schedule shows a lot of 'origin' stories in the works. When it comes to these starter films, Marvel has been hit or miss, in my opininon, and sometimes can leave you a bit disappointed. This weekend we got Ant- Man in the works, a tale I didn't have much hope for in terms of quality Marvel movies. However, could there be surprises in store that will make this enjoyable, you never know. Hi I'm Robbie K and this is another Robbie Review. When you hear the name Ant-Man you might just laugh at the lame title he holds. I mean how can someone like that be a real threat? Well don't count him out yet, as those of the lore know that big things do indeed come in small packages. Ant-Man surprisingly has quite an array of powers, the classic one being shrinking to the size of an ant to infiltrate whatever fortress he is assigned. Yet by reaching this size he obtains heightened speed, strength, and agility that when combined with a training montage led by Evangeline Lilly leads to a top notch weapon. The pint sized hero also gains the technology to communicate with ants, and use their versatile nature in his assignments, which again might sound like a wimpy power but holds incredible potential. This leads me to my favorite part of this movie: the action. Director Peyton Reed has coordinated his team to make an exciting film that has plenty of fast paced, punch throwing moments that will have you wheeling in delight. Ant- man's action starts with a comedic training sequence to warm you up, but then cascades into some big stunts filled with numerous shots of Paul Rudd disappearing and reappearing in front of his opponent. Sure this gets stale, but fortunately they mix things up as the camera dives into artificial scenes of war, which are often simple areas like carpeted floors and grass but from an ant's perspective. And speaking of ants, the team brought a great dynamic with the ants, establish a foot soldier motif with them and having them coordinate strikes. I felt like I was back in Star Wars again as flying ants led ground troops into the heart of danger, often with accompanying laser sounds to add more galactic atmosphere to it. All of the graphics involved with this are impressive, solid movement, good definition, and some bright special effects as well. Overall the action is decent. The big factor that most are going to enjoy I feel is the comedy. Ant-Man does a great job of relieving the stress with multiple comedic moments that range from situational slapstick to well timed quips. Paul Rudd leads the comedy with his acting, managing to bring his typical self into the part and leave you chuckling. The writing is clever and delivered with just the right intensity to sell the line and maximize the laughs. Michael Douglas also brings a set of laughs to the mix and his blunt mannerisms are welcomed as he zings the characters with witty dialogue. Michael Pena helps with the simpler comedy, using his talents to please the audience members who love the more ridiculous and exaggerated moments. His voice was probably the funniest aspect of his moments and the director limiting the number of jokes with him was also a smart move. Outside of the actors, Ant-Man has some other fun trinkets, including turning a toy train set into a 'death' arena, anthropomorphic qualities in ants, and a few comic surprises that cap everything. This film is certainly one of Marvel's most humorous projects, and did a nice job balancing the laughs with the action. But alas there were a few things that fell off the scale and could have used some tweaking. At the beginning the plot is very rushed, with little hindrance and in depth character development. His initiation is practically dull, his training almost devoid of any real struggle, and even the magnitude of the crime he committed was blown over. Another weakness was Hank and Hope's tale, the tension and drama are there, but the details remain hidden and suddenly are dropped in at once. Then the second half of the movie happens and that is when the entertaining and intriguing moments happen. There is also a lot of predictability in this tale as well, lacking any real twist or surprise, but that is only a minor thing. This is when connections to the other movies happen and the plot development and tension occur. Outside of the plot, the action does get a little repetitive with the whole shrinking and expanding moment, and I could have been happier with more ant moments. I got to say that Ant-Man is a well done intro film that has a little something for everyone. The action is fitting, the comedy clever and balanced, and the movie overall fun and entertaining. The story needs some tweaking, and it definitely has some other areas that weren't the jaw dropping experience we've had in the past. Yet I feel it is a good and fun blockbuster for the summer. I encourage many to go have fun with this movie, but avoid the 3-D aspect because I don't see it adding much to the film for the extra cost. My scores are:Action/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",8,3,10,18 July 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Pop, Lock, and Jab At Hollywood. Popstar is Clever, but a Bit Over The Top
","You see them on E network. You read about them in the popular tabloids. The life of a star is on display for everyone in this world and we eat it up like pies in a fair contest. Heavy are the heads of those who wear the crowns of stardom and many will do anything to keep the light on them. This weekend, Samberg and his crew release a movie that attempts to poke fun at the silliness that is music artist drama. My review is on Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. Let's get startedThe GOOD: Â• Clever presentation. Â• Lots of jabs at Hollywood trends Â• Lonely Island Songs Filling The AirThe first thing I loved about Popstar was it's clever presentation in the form of a documentary, or in this case a mockumentary. Popstar is a tale about Conner, a former pop sensation who is trying to go solo in an attempt to keep his fame high. To help promote the album, the arrogant, naÃ¯ve boob hires a crew to capture his life on tape to portray to the masses (the audience). In this format, we didn't just get to see Conner's screw-ups, but observe the thoughts of those involved in his entourage. Various celebrity cameos riddle the interview scenes, making hilarious comments that show the fickleness of the Hollywood scene. This dual approach kept things interesting, and provide a variety of comedy styles that shows some people still have originality. Popstar's plot also allows for opportunities to jab at Hollywood stars, who enjoy a few too many benefits due to their status. I can't tell you how many times I smiled when they threw a celebrity under the bus, or parodied an incident that some dopey star has done in the past. You know that what is being done is stupid, and Samberg's overacted antics only make it more ridiculous. But it's satisfying to hear someone bash a celebrity for acting so juvenile. While I can't say they hit everyone, Samberg and company cast a wide net to cover a lot of musical entertainment follies while also extending into the obsessions of the general public. YesÂ…you the audience also get to be jibed as they emphasize just how absurd fans can be about everything and hurtful they can be thanks to the Internet. And what better to way to poke fun then a Lonely Island musical number in all itsÂ…interesting qualities. The vulgarity and aggressive nature of their songs remains just as colorful as their albums. THE BAD:Â• Offensiveness Â• Banter gets old Â• Overacted at partsDespite how much fun the movie is though, someone is sure to take offense to some of this movie's more assertive jokes. The opening number about Not Being Gay is sure to rile up some community's twitter account that will black ball Samberg. I agree that there are some moments that cross the line, but audience members need to put their big people pants on and realize most of this is a joke, or don't see the film. Still Samberg and his crew need to watch where they travel to in terms of their comedy, especially when it further stains the image of America to foreign countries. As I mentioned earlier, the comedy is very diverse and spans a number of styles that keep it fresh. One of those happens to be the banter routine, where Conner and some poor schmuck get caught in a rousing game of idiot tennis. Much like the T.V. shows that plague cable these days, Popstar has plenty of these moments, where the characters go round and round on an issue. Some of these arguments are pretty good, especially with the writing. However, there are other times where these banters are annoying, or a bit too stupid to be enjoyable, (which happened around the third or fourth time), as they rant on and on (much like this review). This was especially true in the TMZ parodies, which was a farce that needed to be two minutes and dropped like a scalding cup of coffee.And much like the banter, sometimes the acting itself goes too far into the overacting territory. One certainly sees the SNL roots at times, particularly in Samberg's moments of overemotional whining or screaming. Some may like this silly style of acting, but when it is drawn outÂ…well that's when I lose interest. Even the supporting actors trail in this territory, but fortunately the writing bails them out and we move on with the film. There are even a few stunts that didn't fit well into the movie, depriving the more emotional parts by hamming it up with a cheesy interlude. Fortunately, much of these weaker parts are short-lived and the low running time only further helps. The VERDICTI was pleased with this movie and for the most part found it entertaining compared to half the comedic crap that comes out of the woodwork. Popstar's creative presentation and diverse comedy style will surely bring a little something for everyone. Sure there are moments that things get out of hand, and there are lots of moments I wish were cut out or edited down to say the least (especially more mature male organ parts). However, Popstar indeed stands out and certainly deserves a chance for those wanting a laugh. Worth a trip to the theater? Heck no, it lacks pretty much everything I praise for a movie. But I encourage a rental when you get the chance. My Scores:Comedy/Music: 8.0Movie Overall: 6.0",8,5,25,4 June 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," I see An Oscar Win In the Near Future, Go See It, Go See It, Go See queen's movie this weekend!
","The musical legend that took the world by storm. A man's whose voice is immortal and rings through the halls, rooms, and cars of today. The legendary band of Europe with music for the people has been waiting for a movie to represent their majesty, and everything they brought to the world. Tonight, after months of advertising and media promotion, the wait is over and the movie is upon us. With it, yours truly is back to give a later review, in hopes of helping bring justice and some help in determining your movie viewing pleasure. So get your concert boots on, your voices warmed up, and your hearts open for Robbie K's review on:Movie: Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)Director:
Bryan Singer
Writers:
Anthony McCarten (story by), Peter Morgan (story by)
Stars:
Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee
LIKES:The Acting: You've got a legendary character, you need to be ready to step up to the plate, and the casting call nailed the pick with Rami Malek. The Mr. Robot star continues to shine in his acting, apparently doing his homework to resurrect the legend for the modern age. Watching clips in preparation for the interview, Singer's direction with Malek's skills are incredible to watch. His mannerisms, his flair, his passion, and his approach match the various resources I picked up, and is the strong, central pillar to lift this movie to new heights. Malek's portrayal brings so many emotions to the screen to get you embedded into the movie and the actor's life. In addition, the rest of the cast is amazing, each contributing member of Mercury's life given incredible screen time and involvement to craft the family that got him through so much. The incredible involvement of everyone in this production really crafted the perfect cast to bring you into the full experience at hand.The Direction: Musical biographies are always a challenge for me to review, because I go for the concert experience and a little for the life. Sadly, the balance often shifts in the second half to the life, leading to usually a slower, depressing story. Bohemian Rhapsody though, manages to break this mold and keep the energy of the movie going from start to finish. Singer managed to find the perfect entanglement of personal story, band drama, creative process, and concert experience, leading to an energetic, cinematic experience that make syou feel like part of a VH-1 behind the scenes experience. It crafts something for everyone and should be entertaining from start to finish for whatever type of story you want in this genre.The Costumes/Setting/Craft: You've got the director and the acting, but now you need the look and this is where Rhapsody's crew excels at once more. While not the most complex makeup at times, this film's has managed to take us back in time to the 70s and 80s in setting, fashion, and look of the actors. My friends and I agreed that they brought the band back in exact replica detail, from the hairstyles, to the looks that evolved over time in aging and appearance. Transformation of the setting and decades keeps you immersed into the character's evolution and further invest your interest to the story and movie at hand. Of course Mercury's recreation gets the top honors over all, but nevertheless, it's a sensational piece of makeup, costumes, and detail worthy of an award or five.The Concert Experience/Art/Music: The biggest delight of this movie, outside of the balance of story to music, is the music itself. Bohemian Rhapsody highlights the music creating process, showing the struggles and inspiration of their work as they crafted what they considered the perfect tracks. As the music comes to completion, the film jumps right into the performance, bringing the legendary vocals and music back to full, theater stomping delight, and unleashing it to the brim. Rhapsody hits almost all of the classic songs without overplaying the work, and making sure to give you the concert experience you've been dreaming of. This is especially true with the final scene, where the legendary 20-minute performance is recreated, almost every detail painstakingly recreated to pay honor to the legend. I hope many appreciate the hard work in this movie and more importantly the epic fire of Queen's music.The Class: When it comes to Queen's and the band's interesting history, one should expect a lot of topics and scenes that can make on uncomfortable. A nod to the direction again, because in this film all these very sensitive topics are portrayed in a very dignified manner. Rather than sexually aggressive, dirty, gritty portrayals and over the top dialogue, Bohemian Rhapsody manages to portray the darker moments in a dignified light to explain the history without detracting from the experience at hand. Even the comedy is magically crafted into the scene, not forcing itself upon the audience for a laugh, but instead flowing naturally with the personality of Queen and the scenes at hand. It's movies like these that make this reviewer smile wide and realize that Hollywood has not been completely lost yet.DISLIKES:The length: Hard to find fault in this movie, but I can say that the movie was a little long at point, a few scenes that could have probably been left out to minimize the run time to just about 2 hours. A small dislike indeed, but I'm grasping at straws here.A Little Less Of The Dark/Slower Moments: The scenes to be removed would have been some involving Paul, who's manipulation of the system crafted a good antagonist, but sometimes was a little long winded. If I could have substituted these scenes with more of Mary and his family components I would have, because it may have shed a little more light on that aspect and kept in the positive energy of the movie. I don't want the darker moments erased completely, after all they made the band shine at times, but still a little less loss of momentum was my preference.The VERDICT:Surprised that I don't have more dislikes? Well utilize that to note how much I loved this movie and how well put together it was. Queen's epic legacy is captured beautifully in this movie, though how much is dramatized and real is something I don't know. Note however, that this is the musical biography that currently holds the throne in this reviewer's eyes. A balance of story and drama with music is the key, with direction to keep the momentum of the film going and the energy alive. Fantastic acting and costumes further the experience, bringing you into the throngs of Queen's struggles and drama, while paying homage to the craftmanship of their work. Bohemian Rhapsody is the concert movie I've always wanted and with it, yours truly hopes to see it win big in the awards to come, not only for the movie itself, but for the legacy of Queen. I strongly encourage everyone to see it in theaters, this weekend if possible, to get the most out of your experience with this film. So please check it out asap.My scores are:Biography/Drama/Music: 9.5-10Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",10,8,14,3 November 2018
Baby Driver," Go for A Drive with Baby Driver
","Baby Driver! When I saw this trailer months ago I had no idea what to think about it just from the title alone. Yet seeing a star studded cast that included Jon Hamm, Lily James, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, I had hopes for a good movie. So, with it rushing into a midweek premiere I managed to finally check it out this weekend. What's the verdict on the action/crime movie to hit the screen. Robbie K here always appreciating your views on his blog. Let's get started!LIKES:The Acting: I don't say this too much, but this cast was aces across the board. Let's start with the lead Ansel Elgort who plays Baby. At first I was only impressed with his ability to be the awkward silent type, but as the movie progresses Elgort is able to bring a little more to the screen to round out Baby. His range broadens as more characters are introduced into the film and he has to balance between the two worlds that he lives in. As kind of his looming shadow, the master villain Kevin Spacey continues to play that cool, calculating, manipulative role that he made famous in House of Cards. Not too much to be annoying, but not too little to be cheated Spacey really brings depth to a clichÃ© role and keeps things heated up. As for Foxx, well his acting continues to improve me in spectrum he can cover. Taking more of the jaded thug approach, Foxx adds the comedic heat to the film with the darker theme taking hold. I could spend the whole review on the chemistry of everyone, but Baby Driver's cast is stellar. The Action: For a crime thriller toting about the stunts and guns, the movie certainly delivers. Baby Driver shifts the gear into R for reality and manages to deliver sequences that are exciting chases through obstacle laden courses with all the bells and whistles. Unlike the Fast and The Furious, this movie keeps things on a believable level, requiring actual stunt driving instead of high tech gadgets. Even the gunplay is exciting, finally adopting the crime motif we had in the mafia movie days instead of the explosion loaded productions famous of modern cinema. The action is well directed, and used as a supporting tool to keep the film exciting and fast paced without being the only aspect of the movie. The Story: Most crime stories bore me these days because they get too caught up in either sex or malicious violence. While Baby Driver is certainly darker in its own accord, it has a story that doesn't dance in one area. A combination of love, action, and crime drama, the storyboard writers get props from me for crafting a decently balanced story. Baby's character is complicated (though the trailers might mislead you), and they managed to gradually peel this character apart and help him transform into someone completely new. To do this all while bringing forth a story that doesn't put me to sleep but keep me on edge is certainly worthy of two thumbs up. The Music: The theme of Baby Driver is music (he is always wearing headphones if you haven't seen the trailers), and that means you need a strong soundtrack. Mission successful on this part too. While I'm not quite familiar with some of these classics (yes boo me), they music directors selected a fantastic spread to entertain us with. Across many genres and decades, your ears will be swallowed by a deluge of classics, each fitting with the tone of the movie and providing great sound support to the impressive visuals. And if you don't know these tunes, well the internet is still a wonderful thing when used appropriately. DISLIKES: No unifying crime plot: In many crime movies, there is a big score, a key target, or some unifying goal. Baby Driver though doesn't have that big, impending doom I often like to see, choosing instead to focus more on Baby himself. While certainly a small dislike, I felt the unifying theme or grand plan could have provided a little more oomph to the story and a way to integrate Spacey's character even more. Romance Aspect: I'm not saying this is bad, and again I'm grasping at most straws, but Baby Driver's romance component needs a little work. Lily James and Elgort have some decent chemistry and work well together in the scenes where they are paired. However, I feel that this component was a little glazed over up until the climax where the crap starts to hit the fan. Expanding this role again would have tied some things together and integrated the cast a little better to complete the story. Part of the Ending: This dislike is again complicated, but I'll do my best to explain. Baby Driver's ending is certainly unique and took many directions I liked in the form of being non- clichÃ©, artistic, and exciting on many levels. Yet about fifteen minutes of the ending was dragged out entirely too long and started hitting that ridiculous level Hollywood often hits. The vicious parts were a little overdramatic and the predictable twists just led to more run time that wasn't really needed. Still it wrapped up nicely and had a self-gratifying finish, it just didn't need to be that complicated. The Verdict:I agree with many that Baby Driver is one awesome film. Despite the weird title (which yes is a song title), it works on many levels primarily in regards to a suspenseful action tale with strong story elements. Baby Driver is an example of what movies can be if done right and I for one recommend hitting this movie in theaters. Of note, use caution when taking younger audience members due to the violence please. My scores:Action/Crime/Music: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9,15,28,1 July 2017
Justice League," Super Cast, Brings Justice To This Franchise
","LIKES:Casting: A movie relies heavily on a cast, especially finding those worthy of holding the mantle of our iconic heroes. Justice League's director gets an A+ from me for the cavalcade of talent crammed into the new super team. While Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are still not the best fillers for their roles compared to others, they did well in their involvement in the film to warrant applause. Gal Gadot reprises her role fantastically, bringing everything we loved in her stand- alone film and delivering it in spades to this installment in looks, demeanor, and kick butt fighting. However the highlights are Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa, and Ezra Miller. Fisher has the chip on his shoulder, passively destructive role down pat, showing the struggles of new power. Momoa has that brashness/arrogance of a rogue who feels he is above the rules, who soon begins to understand the limits of the lone wolf. However, Miller was spot on for the role of The Flash, capturing all the charisma, comedy, and nerdism I've enjoyed with the modern telling of the fast hero. The cast works so well together, bringing the roles to life in a very entertaining manner that feels like the League of the past on Cartoon Network.The Comedy: The hero movies are starting to shift from adventure to comedy genre for me, and Justice League took a major turn down this avenue. Much of the writing is well-timed, comedic goal, utilizing well-timed cursing, witty sarcasm, and a sharp edge banter that many love, especially when the characters fence with their insults. Of course, the Flash, has a major hand in the laughs, his geeky, naÃ¯ve admiration of the heroes laying the groundwork for other comedic devices that involve both physical and mental qualities, seriously his face is hilarious. With this comedy laid out throughout the movie, one will find it hard not to chuckle quite a few times in the movie. The Action: If you've read my reviews on previous DC movies, you know that the action is often weak for me when comparing to Marvel's masterpieces. Happily, the comic book battles that hooked us from the comics have finally started arriving. Justice League, much like Thor, have a number of exciting moments that act as stepping stones to the excitement at hand. Much of these brief stints are more entertaining than some of Marvel's skirmishes, able to grab the serious tone of DC and deliver a darker fight to ensnare us. The semi-diverse fights bring out the technology bangs, and really deliver an action-packed punch that much of this universe has lacked. Finally, this studio is getting things right. DISLIKES:Shallow Story/Characters: There is a reason Marvel divided their universe into multiple, single character focused stories, in that it builds up the characters for one to latch onto. With their failing enterprise, DC skipped a lot of steps to go directly to the group movie and as a result the character development is lacking. Enough ground work has been laid to get the gist, but Justice Leagues has too many story elements in it to give that satisfying feeling of accomplished storytelling. With little mystery, buildup, and sometimes even challenge, this film's adventure is a little rushed for this reviewer, culminating into a rather bleak, predictable mess. Snyder-Vision: The slow moving special effects were great so long ago, and still have an emotional bite to them that really maximizes the kill. Yet Snyder can't seem to listen to the audience members/critics, or is rebelling because he won't stop overusing it. Justice League continues the trend of utilizing the tactic for nearly every exciting scene, sometimes in good taste, and often in more egotistical, eye-rolling displays of drawn out cinema. Hope you like seeing every detail at half speed, because you are going to have your fill. The final battle: After all the preparation, all the little battles to tease you, one hopes for that defining climax that really puts the battle over the top. Justice League dropped the ball on this for me, not in terms of being lame (like Suicide Squad), but instead not being much different from the trailers. This final battle has had much spoiled in the advertising, and rather than building upon it, like the Avengers, the movie held little flare outside of the battle with the Steppenwolf. That gigantic army you saw in the trailersÂ… doesn't really do much, which was so disappointing with all the hype they placed. It was a good start DC, now finish with that bang we all want to see. The VERDICT:If you read other reviews, you'll see this movie was panned, but this critic found much to enjoy in this movie. It's fun, funny, and a rather good introduction to future team movies with an incredible cast to boot. Sure, it still has some rough story patches, and they haven't quite understood the execution of a good finale (or the balanced use of slow-motion). Still, it's the best movie of the DC universe for me overall, and a good comic book movie to boot. Naturally, I'll recommend this for the theater, and implore you to enjoy the comedic ride and chaotic action at hand in what will hope be a starting point to the next wave of DC movies.

Man of Steel," Origins and Action, Rejoice for The New Age Of Superman
","It's a bird, It's a plane, no it's another movie review from yours truly. As you can tell from the opening, my review is on the latest Superman movie, a project many of my friends have waited for since it's trailer debuted about a year ago. Now if you are like me, you have grown up with various media of the caped hero from the comic books and cartoon series to the real life films and Smallville. With such a broad range of media though, one may wonder just how they can make another new story, especially when the last movie failed to meet many expectations. I'm Robbie K and I'm here to give you the scoop on the latest hero movie.Man of Steel (MOS) starts off exactly as a Superman beginning should with a shot of Krypton that last more than five seconds. From the get go the beautiful computer graphic imaging has designed an exciting opening that not only introduces Kal-El (Henry Cavill), but gives us a glimpse of the world he was forced to leave. The opening left me feeling confident in the coming action, and set up the bad guy and story in an exciting manner that had me hooked. Now you might be thinking, the momentum from strong openings is often lost within seconds of a movie, and I would agree with that statement. MOS however, doesn't, or at least minimizes the loss, by balancing Kal's, now Clark's, past with the present day. Instead of getting a 30-60 minute montage of him growing up, Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan chose to use flashbacks of his childhood, often integrating them at parts that either answered Lois Lane's (Amy Adams) questions, or served as a portrayal of the struggle Clark had to face. I liked this approach, as it allowed for us to see Clark grow up without getting a slow extra hour added to an already 2 hour film. This approach also worked on another level by keeping Lois involved in the story. Let's face it in most of the movies, TV shows, and comics she primarily is a damsel in distress who only serves to drive Superman's emotions and be leverage as a hostage. In this movie, Lois' reporting skills help chip away at the suppressed emotions/and story of the man of steel. After getting past the formalities she actually does other things that make her a much stronger character than in the past, which is always a plus for me. The rest of the story is then well driven, showing the evolution of a reluctant man changing into the icon of hope for Metropolis.Despite the developed and driving story I'm sure there is something else people want to know about, the action. Well with the last Superman movie relying on stereotypical flying, holding up crashing buildings, and stationary combat it was hard to get excited about this film. This movie has revamped the fighting to finally push out of the slow 90's style and gives it a modern style that I welcomed with open arms. Both hero and bad guy go toe to toe using their superb strength to deck it out in fast action that is surprisingly caught well on camera. Another positive factor to throw at you is that the contest isn't an isolated event like some movies seem to abuse. Instead the battle has both parties interacting with the environment, using both living and non-living obstacles to force the combatants to adapt to the situation and use the situations to their advantage. Throw that in with the heroic music and sound effects and you get a number of sequences that get the blood pumping and the crowd cheering.Perhaps the last topic I have room/time to mention are the characters of this film. As mentioned earlier Lois has a much deeper role in this movie other than a damsel in distress. This might be due to Amy Adams strong personality, but I liked the involvement she had, though maybe not the accustomed look. The approach they took with Clark in this movie was also a welcomed change for me, because he actually had qualities that made him a more believable character than another hero knock off. This realism made the character more relevant and made the situations more dire because he wasn't a perfect being who severed all human emotions and attachments. Plus, it was nice to see the morally perfect, holier than that attitude dropped which although admirable has been overdone. Superman's father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) was also a fun character to watch due to the balanced nature they took with him. At the beginning he seems a bit of a stiff who can kick butt in the pursuit of his noble goals. However, as the movie continues we get to see that attitude applied in other ways, from teaching lessons and showing love, to subtle comedy in the delivery of lines that breaks up some of the tension. The villains are not bad either, there moves are certainly impressive, but General Zod (Michael Shannon) was not as balanced as I would have liked to see. More so an egotistical general who screamed more than led, Zod was at least combat ready for this film and not a pansy as some other villains have proved to be. As for the other characters they are good, but I have to wrap things up.Man of Steel was a large improvement over the other superhero movie I saw this summer. Action, excitement, relevant characters, and so much more was wrapped into a movie that was entertaining and fun to watch. Yes, there is a bit of a drag at parts, and some of the issues he deals with take a little bit longer than I care to see, but these are minor changes. So I say this in caps, SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",Null,1,2,14 June 2013
Split," Not a Splitting Shyamalan Headache.
","No please not that, anything but that! This might be the screams you hear when another M. Night Shyamalan film rolls into theaters. The man who started out so strong, only to fall so far has tried his luck at horror once more in the featured film Split starring James McAvoy. Will a movie about split personalities kidnapping girls be the step he needs to climb back to top notch director, or will his movie be laughable at best? Robbie K here with yet another review, and as always I appreciate your reads. Let's get started!LIKE: Â• Creepy kind of horror Â• Decent plot to keep it interesting Â• Complex morals Â• James McAvoySummary: Fans of my reviews know creepy horror is better for me than jump scares, and Split is a prime example of spine-tingling chills. Shyamalan and his crew get incredible effects from such simple tactics, using isolation, subtle piano background music, and gradual information revelation to keep you in suspense. By using a believable human as the monster instead of some cheesy creature, the creeps are only further amplified by how horrible such a thing can be. But scares alone don't make a movie and Split does a decent job of crafting a tale to keep you hooked into the movie. While certainly not original, Split's plot is a culmination of smaller stories that detail the background info of a majority of our characters, helping to develop them in the short run time. All of these tales have a moral twist to it, but one story in particular raises an intriguing concept that may provide some food for thought, or at least an ethical dilemma for future talks. However, the piece de resistance is the leading actor James McAvoy who carries much of the movie. The man can play multiple personalities well, tweaking his mannerisms and dialogues in subtle ways to craft an entirely different identity. His talents, as well as the direction, kept all his characters in the realistic zone, which while creepy, also made engaging characters to grab on to. There are few actors to which I could see doing the spectacular job he did.DISLIKE: Â• Predictable Story Â• Trailer has shown much Â• Don't see all the personalities Â• Mixed on the endingSummary: Despite the story being very well-developed for a horror story, it also isn't the most unique either. Outside of the twenty-three-personality quirk, you can guess much of the backstory of each character and where the film is going by about the 30-minute mark. Part of the predictability can be attributed to the trailer revealing a lot of key details in the short collection of scenes, including the big revelation at the end. The trailer also harbors on the twenty-three personalities, but in reality, it's more like four with a few cameos from the others. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing (as too many personalities could be very sloppily done), it also was a wasted gimmick. What do I mean by this confusing statement? I mean, why make twenty-three, instead of say ten, or even five? What was the significance of twenty-three outside of a nickname if you weren't going to integrate all of them? This dislike comes from the trailer's focus on high number only to once again let it fizzle out. And as for the ending, it's a very open-ended finale that leaves a lot of questions up in the air. Perhaps the potential sequel will answer these components, but only time will tell. The VERDICT:Split, to my surprise, was much better than I thought and was a horror movie worthy of the franchise. If you are looking for realistic chills, a satisfying plot, and fantastic acting of someone with a mental health disorder then certainly check this movie out. In fact, in regards to the horror genre I would warrant this movie earns a trip to the theater. However, as a movie overall, it still has its shortcomings, especially in regards to the twenty-three-personality gimmick. Yet one thing is for certain, if Shyamalan can continue this trend he may fall back into the favorable director field once more.

Kung Fu Panda 2," Furry, Ferocious, and Fun!
","Furry, Ferocious and Fun!This Memorial Day weekend I watched Kung Fu Panda 2, the sequel to the action packed comedy starring Po (Jack Black) and the fearsome five. The first movie was a fun kids movie that had a lot of catchy one liner phrases, a few kick butt actions scenes, a lot of situational comedy, and a story that was about working hard and finding your inner strength. Now three years later, the fellows at Dreamworks have presented a sequel to this animal centered comedy, which follows after the two duds we saw in Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After. Is this sequel following the same path that the last Shrek films took, or does it shine on its own? My answer to this question is that it does indeed shine on its own.The story starts out with a background story about the villain Shen (Gary Oldman) and his lust for power to rule over China, eliminating any forces that try to stand in his way. Not long after the introduction, Po and the gang come back into the picture before Po is called to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to learn about finding inner peace. However, the peaceful air is soon disturbed by a pack of wolf soldiers and an action fight sequence soon starts that puts most action movies to shame. As the wolves retreat Po, along with the fearsome five, set out to defeat Shen and find inner peace. Over the course of the journey, Po provides that classic comedy that made him famous in the first film as he uses phrases like awesome, so hardcore, and freaking in providing that awkward and childish enthusiasm that makes him stand out. His enthusiasm is still balanced out by his lack of stamina and large girth comedy which is cleverly integrated into both combat and non combat scenes. Clumsiness also plays a role in Po's ability to make us laugh, as what starts out as the stylish moves of a kung fu master quickly turns into a blundering mistake that somehow seems to work for Po. All of these aspects are brought together by Jack Black's voice work as he finds a way to bring a juvenile tone to the comedy, while still sounding wise and honorable during the serious scenes.Perhaps one of the strongest aspects about this movie is the balance of story, action, and detail. The story, or should I say stories, are detailed enough to provide character development that older audiences will like, but at the same time is catchy, simple, and fun enough to allow younger audience members to get a gist of what's going on. The integration of action and chase scenes keeps the pace of the movie going while also keeping the attention of the audience glued to the screen, a plus for those that have a hard time sitting through a movie. What really brings all of these strengths together though is the camera and musical works that add that finishing touch to the movie. The camera work is smooth and not really jumpy and allows one to see what's going in almost every scene. An exception to this style occurs in some of the fighting seen at the end, but it's not too bad so most should be able to slide ignore it. While the camera's capture the action, the music that plays during every scene has been selected to bring out the emotions of the scene and make you feel it deep in your heart. Whether it be fast flying punches, sad flashbacks, or the findings of inner peace and the acceptance of the past the music catches all of these emotions in a brilliant combination of strings, percussions, and other orchestra instruments to make you feel like you are in the movie.Although this movie has a lot, and I mean a lot of good aspects, there are still some weaknesses that one may find. The comedic styles of Po can get a little stale at times, especially hearing the word hard core about ten times. A second thing is that Po pulls off a little too much Yoda at some points in the movie, I won't say too much more to avoid ruining the movie. Perhaps a third thing one might not like is how long it takes to finish off the final battle. Although the movie is only an hour and half long, some might find the final battle dragged out a little too long and want it to just end, this was not a problem for me however.Overall Kung Fu Panda 2 is a sequel that is a must see, especially for kids and fans of the series. Even if you haven't seen the first one yet, which was the case with my cousin, one will be able to find some part of this movie to enjoy. Laughs, actions, drama, story, and heartfelt emotions are all in this movie and the wide appeal to many audiences makes this a great movie for a youth group or friend outing. Thus my Robbie Rating for this movie is 9.8-10.0. I hope that you enjoy this movie as much I did. Recommended audience members: Kids, Dreamworks fans, Kung Fu Panda lovers, action lovers, comedy lovers, etc. People who should avoid this movie: Horror fans and fans looking for a movie with blood, because it doesn't have any of it.",10,74,101,27 May 2011
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Slinging In Style
","In the modern era, the superhero movies reign supreme in the world of the cinematic, blockbuster films. While Marvel studios universe continues to reign in dollars, there are many who state they could be getting burnt out given the 4-6 movies that release a year. As lines blur, and franchises continue to blend together to the modern public, the series needs some extra oomph to help them stand out. Welcome to another Robbie movie reviews and we are down for another review as we get set to review a massive movie week to come. Let get cracking on:Movie: Spiderman Into the Spiderverse (20180Directors:
Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey
Writers:
Phil Lord (screenplay by), Brian Michael Bendis (Miles Morales created by)
Stars:
Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld
LIKES:Animation/Design: The rest of the reviewers are correct in saying that the animation of this movie is superb to say the least. Design wise the movie nods to a number of art styles and comic book references to please many eyes of the comic book lover. It's a living comic book that has all the edge, frames, and references, but yet has vibrant color and clever use of contrast and color to stand out from the typical live action film. This dynamic only continues to evolve over the course of the film, adding more styles to the mix and integrating them into a true piece of work.Story: The movie is certainly geared towards the comedy route, doing its best to make it a slap happy, geeky trendy, kid friendly comic movie for the holiday season. While zany and certainly silly, the movie surprisingly has a deeper lore to it then I was expecting. A predictable plot, this movie dives deeper into the darker dynamics of the hero, the important lessons of self-belief, and the character development that many superheroes lack. Into the Spider-Verse's compelling story makes for a solid foundation to build much off and the writing helps integrate comedy with story in a wonderful equilibrium.Voice Acting: Not much to expand upon here, but the film's characters really thrive in this film with the acting contributing much toe the part. Sure the design and animation brings a piece of them to life, but the voice work adds that extra level to fully bring their inner workings to life. As the voices further integrate and play off of one another, the characters evolution begins to soar to new heights and somehow further develop the relationships between each other.Clever Wit: Perhaps the biggest like of all, is how the movie just works to please a variety of fans both comic loving and general. It's got well integrated slap-stick that is simple and yet layered, mixed with a nod to a number of references and gimmicks comic fans are used to. The use of sarcasm is tactfully wielded to help add that aspect our spider heroes often wield, alongside the fantastic one-liners to be printed on T-shirts. Spider-Verse is a plethora of witty banter and it works when balanced with the rest of the likes mentioned.DISLIKES:Jokes a Little Too Far: The movie has a number of gimmicks into the mix, and while many of them are well-timed, they ran with one a little too far for my taste. A constant origin story beating you over the head was a nice ace up the sleeve, but that tactic got a little stale for me and my colleague as well.Blurred Lines: I'm not sure if part of the art style, a reference to a style, or perhaps just editing to not smooth out the parts meant for 3-D. Whatever the case, the outline was a little messy for me, and perhaps a poor attention to detail if not purposefully crafted to have a point. If so, then kudos, but if you see this one in 3-D, I don't think this will be much of an issue.More Integration of bad Guys: Understanding this was meant to be about Miles Morales origin story and the integration with the other spider-verses, I appreciate the work done for this team. Yet, the bad guys ready to face off against the team were a little bit of wasted characters for me, mostly just oddly shaped punching bags for our webslingers. One villain got the royal treatment, but the others needed some character overhaul to help them stand further out. I'll admit there is potential for a sequel to expand upon them, but for this film, a little more diving into them could have helped spruce things up and again give us characters we cared bout.The Action: The action is there, don't chew my head off, and in truth it works well with the theme and atmosphere of the movie as it caters to the family atmosphere. However, being an action junkie I would have liked a little more choreography, integration of heroes, and traditional battles that this odd adventure helped. Yet, the biggest thing I wanted with the action, was a less dynamic camera angle so I could actually enjoy the animation at hand. I again admit that it felt like a comic, with action taking place off screen, but tidying up the spastic camera could have gone well. And just as the battles found its stride, the movie was over.
The VERDICT:Overall, Into the Spiderverse, is the breath of fresh air that the superhero industry needed to help regain interest. With surprisingly deep lore, well themed comedy, and a design that is flashy, stylized and dynamic, it's certainly going to appeal to many viewers. Yet, it's not the traditional Marvel movie and some limitations in regards to jokes, lack of hot actors, and nonlinear presentation may not ring well with the normal super hero audience. Throw in a little unorthodox action and you'll see mixed reviews coming in depending on who attends the showing with you. My scores for this movie are;Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0

We're the Millers," Hilarious, Fun, and Stupid
","Robbie K is back with another movie review and boy what a fun movie it is. This time I share my thoughts on the latest comedy, We're The Millers, a movie that seems to have fans raving. With a cast of NBC veterans like Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis, the funny factor for this movie seems potentially high, well that and the ridiculous plot the trailer hints at. Yet many comedies prove to be rather stupid or so vulgar that they become garbage polluting the movie pool, yet still seem to be so popular. What's my verdict on this film? Find out below.In case you haven't seen the trailers, We're The Millers centers on dysfunctional family situations, which have been beaten to death in various media. Yet the creative minds behind this movie managed to salvage this overused concept and instead give it a modern twist to make it enjoyable for the masses, while at the same time crossing into uncomfortable territory for some. What is this twist? Essentially a ridiculous adventure of a drug dealer named David Clark (Sudeikis) being sent to Mexico to pick up an obscene amount of drugs for his supplier (Ed Helms). To achieve this rather risky operation, he decides to make a fake family consisting of a stripper (Anniston), an abandoned virgin (Will Poulter), and a runaway (Emma Roberts) to assist him crossing the border. Sounds hilarious doesn't it?Well in truth I indeed laughed my head off at this movie that had a bit of comedy for all to enjoy and relish in. While most comedies I prefer to watch are kiddier, involve bathroom humor, or clever uses of geekiness, We're the Millers somehow had me laughing at the more mature and drug centered themes. The sexual innuendos, awkward situations, and crossing into uncomfortable territory were gradually increased in intensity as the journey continued, instead of cranking the awkward level up to max at the very beginning. Perhaps what I liked even more was the fact that all these situations were cleverly integrated into the faÃ§ade of the dysfunctional family, instead of just having idiotic characters mouth of and randomly spouting out disgusting and awkward phrases. Unlike many modern stoner/alcoholic comedies, this movie also broadens its humor to not just focus on sex and masturbation, but again cross into uncomfortable subjects without turning into an R rated light porno. Was I the only one who enjoyed this? Not even close, the entire audience laughed the night away at the constant insults, references, and reactions of the faux family and their surrounding cast. Of course what also helps bring laughs is the stupidity of just about every cast member on set that allows the insanity to occur. I'll admit many of these things are jabs to humanity and the government, but it's still fun and one hast to let go of how ridiculous the concept is. Those who can't, well take a break and look for another movie, as well as those who hate sexual and drug based comedy. Of course no good comedy can be done without a good dialog and acting. We're the Millers definitely isn't the best when it comes to these things, but it's certainly built for the fun adventure to be had. Sudeikis for once isn't a complete pervert or idiot as I've found him to play in previous roles, and somehow curses his way past my low tolerance level to be funny, yet sometimes annoying. I guess it's the time limit David has keeping him grounded, as well as the predictable 'story' forcing him to be a little more balanced and less stupid. Roberts is enjoyable as well, not only very beautiful, but brings some edge to her insults that remind me of my roommate's quips. Yet for me, it has to be Poulter and Aniston who got me to laugh the hardest. Poulter's character Kenny is like a white Urkel, geeky, innocent, and big hearted, whose qualities counter the selfishness of the other three. While some will find this annoying, this good Samaritan attitude keeps the comedy balanced and adapting as Kenny's experiences, and in some cases inexperience, leads to the family having to shove their morals aside and do something funny to save the day. Kenny also has a few embarrassing moments that will speak to geeks and 90's pop junkies to have tears rolling down their eyes. Aniston is just as good as she always does, using her beauty and talents to create a believable, and often-lovable character. The actress uses her body, words, and reactions to drive every scene, often stealing the show and causing the most laughs for me. Her ability to use sarcasm is fantastic; the way she slings her curses sparingly and well timed to get the most laughs and not be annoying. The awkward moments I have mentioned often involve her in some way, and her character (Rose) does a great job adapting to the situation, while still requiring assistance to help her out. Of course alone these characters are good, but together they really shine, and when combined with the extras, makes for a fun, albeit crude adventure. As for the cursing, well this summer must have helped me develop a tolerance, but We're the Millers dialog is full of many F bombs and other words I try not to say, though the dialog is not solely the foul mouthed slang. While definitely not a masterpiece in terms of story, character development, or really fantastic editing, We're the Millers is very fun and enjoyable. Many will love the ridiculous adventure, the stupid laughs, and the cheap blows Hollywood has prepared for us. Go see it if you are looking for something fun, but avoid if you have lower tolerances for any of the things I've mentioned. My scores for this movie are:Comedy/Crime: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",8,4,13,9 August 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Number 5 keeping it alive
","It's the weekend and time once again to undertake a mission. That mission is to go to the local movie theater and review yet another film to be released upon the mass media. If you haven't guessed from my lengthy introduction, our film today is Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, the fifth movie in the ever-popular spy series. Hi I'm Robbie K and it's my job to give you the information and help you decide if you should pay a visit to the theater to catch the movie. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to read my review.Mission Impossible is a series that has had its ups and downs, varying in the plot, delivery, and overall presentation of the movie. Yet there is usually one consistency in the series, an adventure filled with suspense and action to bring the excitement to the former television series. Well guess what, MI5 has all of that and fortunately presents it in a well- balanced manner. Director Christopher McQuarrie has led his team to develop a fantastic spy movie that holds all the elements one is looking for in a spy film without going too far down the dark side. Let's start with the plot. MI5's plot starts out with gusto; an exciting opening that reintroduces our team before dropping Ethan (Tom Cruise) and company into their next mission. From there the plot only gets more suspenseful from there, becoming a conglomeration of manhunt, espionage, and uncovering the truth amidst the complicated organization known as the Syndicate. Now it is still the typical plot that we've seen in previous installments, but MI5 keeps the story exciting by the numerous twists thrown into the mix. The tale keeps you guessing at what is going to happen, surprising you with some unexpected angles you might not see coming. But the story isn't just about the mission; it throws some other plot elements into the mix particularly around Ethan and the newcomer Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) who take the center stage of this adventure. All these tales are well integrated into the main story, adding depth to what could be a one-dimension plot and anchoring you back to the team. By connecting with the team, I felt part of the squad trying to take down the ruthless, cunning, skilled terror that is the Syndicate. The plot is greatly supported by the action, giving you some variety and keeping the plot moving. MI5 does have technical details, governmental jargon, and planning moments to help set things up, but the action helps bring the heat of the moment to life. The chase scenes in particular are the most exciting, rip roaring fun with over the top stunts lighting up the screen with explosive sound effects. The hand-to-hand combat even throws a few impressive moments, with Cruise in particular showing some dexterity and strength in his stunts. Unfortunately gunplay is a little lacking in this film, very simplistic and often short lived thanks to the near perfect accuracy of our team. Perhaps my favorite component of the action is the cleverness behind it, where the flashy moves are traded for a more strategic approach to which you expect of elite spies. Unfortunately for me, the ending scene was a little anticlimactic; the epic buildup kind of fizzled out with the rather boring, and somewhat drawn out chase in the end. In addition to all of this, MI5's true strength is the team of actors that bring the story to life. Cruise, despite all the weird crap he has done, still does well with his role as Ethan. All his personality quirks have bestowed him the ability to bring a wide array of qualities to his character that you look for in a protagonist. His character is smart and somewhat sociopathic, yet can be crazy, overemotional, and funny, which leads to an entertaining character. Ferguson doesn't have quite the emotional spectrum, but the femme fatale edge she brings and mysterious disposition help keep suspense into the movie and offset some of the crazier moments. Simon Pegg as the ever-lovable Benji reprises his role, a character that is sort of a comical version of Q that relieves the tension with his klutziness and well- timed lines. Much of the comedy in fact is due to excellent timing and a clever script. Jeremy Renner and Pegg really had me laughing with their execution of very simple lines, just casually reacting to the heat of the moment like friends do. As for the villain, Sean Harris was an excellent choice, an actor who captures the true evil mastermind without overacting like many due. You get the creeps from his quiet disposition, his cold calculating tactics mirrored in his steely gaze and soft manner of speaking. The cast was super fantastic and I wish I could go into more detail, but let's wrap this up. Mission Impossible 5 is a great installment into the series, and may be my favorite of them all. While not the most action packed, this tale keeps moving and integrates a lot of great components into the tale. It is definitely not the most original tale, but they have kept it fresh, interesting, and funny throughout the movie and crafted a great spy tale. There are a few things that could have been cleaned up or let out, but overall it is a well-done movie. I encourage everyone to go see this movie into the theater, especially those looking for a good Thriller this summer. Just suspend reality a little and you will be able to accept some of the limitations of this tale. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.5-9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9,1,3,1 August 2015
Dunkirk," Dunkirk, Dun Realism Right
","War, huh, yeah, what is it good for? Entertaining movies, that is what it is good for. Hollywood has numerous examples of wars from the various historical times in our human legacy. Many of these installments focus on a hero who saved the war, or a band of brothers that bravely faced the odds to hold the line. In most cases though, you can bet there will be violence, explosions, and often graphic portrayals of the hell contained in our squabbles. I finish my weekend reviews with Dunkirk, which is the latest installment in the Christopher Nolan library. Can the Dark Knight director work his magic in war? Or does it fizzle out like a dud bomb. Robbie K here to give his opinions. Let's get started. LIKES:Layered Story: Many war movies are the linear tales of the hero who will win the battle. Dunkirk diverts from this main path and instead presents its plot from three viewpoints that overlap at various times. A cryptic opening doesn't do much to explain this, but eventually the plots coincide and your mind is blown by the presentation. This element, though confusing at times, adds that unique flare to the movie that keeps your interest piqued as you connect the journeys of those involved. In addition, the multiple viewpoints give you a more complete picture of the war, further bringing the history to life in a manner Hollywood special effects is famous for. Realism: We know the doctoring editing and story writers can make to score big bucks in the box office. These moments often lead to overdramatic, eye-rolling moments that war dramas can be. Dunkirk again shines in the unique department in terms of crafting the story to be realistic in many details. You'll be pulled into the war in this film, grounded in the nightmares that plague the battlefields and the internal struggle that all involved face. I felt plagued with the emotional guilt in the choices made in this film, while also concerned with the consequences that could follow those choices. The film's focus on the people and not the battle works on so many levels, and makes you interested in the characters more so than the special effects. Nice choice again Noland!The Cinematography: Dunkirk doesn't have a lot of lines, award winning dialogue, or even one- liners that we as humans like. Instead it is the cinematography and editing that bring Dunkirk to life and make it shine in the theater's dark halls. While the special effects are certainly impressive (though not that showy), it's really the camera work that brings the mood out in the form of hope seeking faces that are suffering through the onslaught dealt to them. Throw in the powerful musical score and mix in the little line delivery and you get that recipe for emotional bombardment that brings respect, empathy, and pride of the sacrifices made by troops long ago. Short run time: Such a dynamic, sounds like it would take foreverÂ…fortunately Nolan's direction kept the movie under 2 hours and brought quality out in that short time. This is an example of good directing and editing, and proof that you can have a quality film in a short time limit. DISLIKES:Missing that Hollywood Story: Realism is good, but I certainly missed having a flared-up story to grip onto. Dunkirk is a quality movie, but it isn't as much fun as I have had with other war movies. It lacks some of the big, bang excitement made famous in other war movies, and the realistic psychological approach can drag at times. The result is not the action-packed survival I had hoped for, but I can always rewatch Hacksaw Ridge for that. And while I enjoyed the layered story approach, I again think it was confusing at times to piece things together without a central story, plot, or goal (outside of survival/rescue) to hook onto. The placement of certain scenes: My buddy and I agreed that there were points to this movie that were difficult to follow. Much of this came from the odd placement of clips in the movie and the rapid transitions between these various stories with little guidance. Things do get better when the lines start to come together, but there are still scenes that still stay confusing at points until the end of the movie. In addition, the pacing of the stories was uneven at times, with a couple of stories rapidly concluding (so you think), only to reappear after a prolonged gap. Not the biggest weakness, but things could have been a little better oriented for me. Depressing: We know war sucks, and this movie's portrayal of the loss of hope amplifies those feelings. There are so many elements of depression in this movie that you may feel a little down following the opening. I felt a little tired during this movie, especially during the drawn-out moments that were more depressing and less stressing. The VERDICT:Dunkirk is certainly one of the more artistic and clever portrayals of war, dropping Hollywood flare for realism. Nolan's impressive directing opens up new worlds of war theater and keeps things fresh with the impressive displays of heroism. Yet all the good the cinematography and directing isÂ… I missed the Hollywood flare that cinemas bring. Without that story/entertainment value to itÂ… Dunkirk has some confusing presentations and dragged out moments that can weigh heavy on you. Still, this movie has plenty to qualify a visit to the theater, and one of the better movies of the summer. Not the epic wartime thriller, but certainly one of the more realistic, war dramas I have ever seen. My scores:Action/Drama/History: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9,5,13,22 July 2017
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher Is Predictable but Not Bad
","I'm not going to lie; my first thought after seeing the trailer for this movie was, 'Oh great another movie about a provocative teacher that is addicted to drugs, drinking, money, and sex.' My judgment was mostly correct for this movie, but I am happy to say that there was a little more plot and surprise to this movie then I expected. As one has seen time and time again in the trailers, Bad Teacher centers on the very attractive Ms. Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) a middle school teacher who has no interest or skill in teaching who is bent on leaving her school after just one year of working. However, after her rich fiancÃ© breaks off the engagement for her money seeking ways, Elizabeth finds herself back in the trenches of the JAMS staff. The cheap laughs begin to pour in from the first day of school as Halsey has the class watch movies about amazing, honest, and inspirational teachers providing that humorous irony. However, the laughs are also provided by various other characters such as Ms. Squirrel (Lucy Punch) providing that quirky, ridiculous, and energetic one liners and Lynn (Phyllis Smith) who brings that innocent and ignorant comedy to the table. Halsey's immature, drunken slanders, and clichÃ© one liners intimidate the kids in the movie, but seem to charm Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) the lowly gym teacher with a heart of gold. Gettis, and most of the audience during the show, found Halsey's constant jokes to be hilarious, fun, and rather entertaining. Although I found it funny at first, I grew tired of the same comedy and words being thrown at me over and over again, never really deviating from alcohol and drugs. When Mr. Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), arrives the floodgates for sex and boob jokes opens up and is introduced to the audience. Although Timberlake may have performed a fantastic role in The Social Network, his character has been greatly diminished to a naÃ¯ve, impressionable, boob obsessed nerd who provides a little bit of comedy, but really nothing special. Instead Delacorte acts more as a tool used to spur jokes from Squirrel and Halsey, typically centered on rivalry for the watch heir's heart. Despite the flood of vulgar comedy, I did laugh at some other comedic styles found in this film. In particular I enjoyed Segel's comedy as the dialog was well written and perfectly timed, though a few of his lines matched the same style as Diaz's character. I enjoyed his interactions with the kids, in particular the sports argument with one of his students. The comedy styles of Diaz were okay for me, but nothing really new of what we have seen in the past. Diaz still brings that don't mess with me/don't care attitude that grew stale with her constant repetitions. However, her sarcasm, devious nature, and her delusional view of herself were entertaining at most times. Lucy Punch played her part well as the annoying, chipper, and over achieving teacher, but I did grow tired of her as well. Many times I think the dialog was written to make her too air headed or attempting to be too funny, which annoyed me more than anything. However I must admit her Al-Gebra terrorist line was very hysterical for me and cleaver. Perhaps the most entertaining comedy for me though was a combination of Lynn and Kirk, Halsey's roommate. Lynn in particular relieved the audience from Diaz/Segel's comedy by saying some of the most innocent lines ever. Other times, she would take forever to make a decision and her reactions to the consequences were hilarious. Kirk on the other hand provided that dumb and ignorant comedy that made me think of Joey or Chandler from F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I was in tears from some of his lines and although he was only in a few scenes, he somehow managed to steal the show for me and make him the highlight of the movie. The last thing I wish to mention is the large amount of predictability in this movie. Many times I could see the jokes coming or see the direction the thin plot was heading, which made the movie less enjoyable for me. Most of the shenanigans the cast pulled were not the most original and even the changes in character could be seen thirty minutes before they happened. However, I am happy to say that the ending to the movie did catch me off guard and I applaud the film crew for the twist in the movie, though I will not reveal it to you.Overall Bad Teacher is not that Bad, it's just definitely not original. The comedy is slapstick, beat you over the head comedy, the acting is lots of fun, and it's a movie with a good fast pace that keeps it interesting. Throw in some great comedic timing, a little comedic diversity, and of course that classic car wash scene from the trailer and you get a fun Friday night movie. The bottom line is I give this movie somewhere between a 6.5-7.0 and highly recommend it for NetFlix/Red Box. My only advice for those who wish to see it in the theaters is to get there before the trailers start, because I found a lot more laughs in the trailers than I did in the movie. Until next time my friends, enjoy!",Null,5,12,25 June 2011
Now You See Me," Magical Fun and Clever Schemes
","Abra Kadabra my friends, and like magic another weekend is upon us and another round of movies. This week I start my reviews off with a Crime/Thriller that chooses to use stage performance, illusion, and trickery to pull off the heist. That's right I'm reviewing Now You See Me, a movie that promises to be magical, just not Lord of the Rings magical. So put away your wands and spell books, and get out your deck of cards as I give my two cents on this movie.Let's get right into some of my likes for. First thing has to be the clever plot/execution of this movie. Now we have seen plenty of crime movies over the last decade that use the same stale plot of a highly skilled team pulling of an impossible task of bringing a corrupt man to justice. Now you see me takes that stale plot and reconstructs into something that seems fresh and new. Instead of an elite band of mercenaries, we have four misfits who practice different tricks of the magic trade. They are pulled together by some mastermind who opens the door with a rather shady invite and a year later the adventure starts as the Four Horsemen are forged. Cue the Vegas scene, made famous in the trailer, where the audience, both fiction and real, are dazzled by an elaborate show where the eyes are fooled by the sleight of hand. Only rather than making a simple toy appear, the result is money robbed from a city bank miles away. This allows me to transition into another aspect of the movie, the design of the tricks. In this film, many things were planned out, every detail intricately laced into an adventure that is both intense and impressive. While there are some classic magic tricks done, pick a card and making rabbits disappear, there are some other acts that have more complexity to it. Although these CGI heavy stunts are a bit fake and far-fetched they still were creative enough to wow me. Even more impressive to this reviewer, was the fact that the tricks were linked to the master plan, many specifically chosen for a purpose other than entertainment, cleverness at its finest.Another trend you might notice in other crime movies, is that nine times out of ten the police force are either ignorant or idiots. Well good news, they still are, but this time there is a little more ingenuity to some of their force. Led by Mark Ruffalo, the police actually learn a little from their mistakes and with a little guidance from an outside source, attempted to change their strategy. Ruffalo and company not only bring on the opposing force to the Horsemen, but also provide an opening for other characters to enter into the movie, often to explain how the tricks work. You heard me right, the magicians' secrets are revealed in this movie, but done so to help tie together the loose ends left behind after the excitement has passed. How could this explanation get any better? Simple bring on Morgan Freeman, an actor whose voice and talent bring the retired magician bent on deciphering secrets to life. Like many of his roles, this character has humor, wits, and a little input into helping with some of the shallow character development. With this in mind, if you don't want to find out how the connections fit you need to either leave the theater at points in the movie, or avoid seeing it altogether. Bottom line the movie is connected and all the characters are involved in some form or manner. So with a bunch of characters you may wonder how the acting is in this movie. In a nutshell most of the actors are playing the same roles we've seen in other films. Jesse Eisenberg still plays the arrogant jerk, who is incredibly clever and gifted, and insults everyone else. For some reason though, I do like his character in this movie, as the attitude goes with the theme of the movie. Isla Fisher is still bubbly, but this time she isn't some shallow air head who only cares about sex and shopping. Ruffalo does a good job as well, acting as an integral cog for most of the movie. Similar to what we saw in Avengers, Ruffalo has quirky one liners, a smart ass attitude, but still retains a serious demeanor that rounds the character out. My favorite actor of the night though is Woody Harrelson, who has all the qualities from the Hunger games, minus the drinking and add some running. Overall there are really no surprises when it comes to acting, I enjoyed all of them and I am sure you will find someone to latch onto in this movie. This movie is definitely a fun summer movie with creativity bursting at every seam. Yes the plot is fairly predictable, and I do agree the plot is a bit old. Yet this movie has many good things about it that makes it worthy of taking a trip to the theater. It is exciting, with a plethora of chase scenes and fight scenes to keep the pace going. Although some of the mystery is ruined by Freeman's deductive reasoning, there are still some underlying secrets that keep you intrigued into the movie, like who the mastermind is and what are the motives for pulling off the pranks. Yes there is a bit of cheesiness in the plot, and some of the stunts they pull are again a bit far-fetched that some people may roll their eyes, but for those who like a lot of imagination and clever execution, this movie is for you. So what do I give this movie? My scores are Crime/Thriller 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5",Null,2,5,31 May 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Three tales unite into one, well done Singer
","Happy Memorial day weekend my friends, and what better way to welcome the weekend than with another movie review. Today we cover the new X-men movie, a series which over the last 14 years has split into three story arcs that has led to a mixture of receptions. Yet director Bryan Singer has returned to the project to hopefully clean the mess others have made, hopefully returning the spark the first two movies held. Did it work? Read on to find out.From the trailers, X-men Days of Futures Past is a time traveling adventure that sends the rugged Wolverine back into the past to meet up with the youthful, though distraught, X- men. The goal of this mission is to stop the construction of the legendary mutant hunting sentinels, and prevent a dark future from arising that could mean the end of humanity. I know a bit clichÃ©, but despite the stale time traveling story line the latest X-men feature has a lot of great qualities. We'll start with the acting. Days of Future Past has a lot of characters that fans will recognize and perhaps be excited to see. Hugh Jackman has stepped back into the Wolverine role, still bringing the tough guy with a big heart and even bigger edge back to the screen. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender reprise their roles as young X and magneto, bringing back some of their chemistry, while bringing other qualities to their characters. Of course most are interested in Ms. Popularity herself, Jennifer Lawrence, playing the young, and deadly, Mystique. Of all the characters, she has the broadest emotional spectrum, which Lawrence once again brings to life in her typical fashion that makes many lover her. The rest of the group does well, but due to space limitations and the fact they are secondary, I'll move on. Despite the story being just another time traveling tale, X-men Days of Future Past has great delivery to pull it off well. The first twenty minutes set the stage in an explosive opening, setting the pace and time limit of the movie. Once back in the past, Wolverine sets out to accomplish his goals, bringing in the rest of the crew gradually. This is where Singer's work speaks for itself as he somehow reveals more of his character's, while still keeping the film moving. I didn't see too many scenes where the mission had to stop while the group had a heart to heart *cough Batman *cough. As these characters changed, for better or for worse, the story twisted, keeping the plot fresh and more unpredictable than some of the tales in the past. It was great trying to figure out what the characters would do next, wondering how far some of the mutants would go to destroy the evil without throwing the events further into chaos. Of course, there are plenty of hints that take away from the surprise that, if you pay attention, will help you predict what is coming next, with a few exceptions of course.Yet the thing I really loved about this movie was how balanced everything was. Singer once again brought a blend of traits to his project that was done in the appropriate amounts. The comedic timing was top notch, having both old, new, and X-men reference styles present that were not overdone nor rubbed in my face. Drama was spread out evenly, not focusing on one character's drama for too long nor was it focused on a single type of drama (i.e. just on romantic affairs), keeping me interested instead of asking when will this end. Even the action was done well, with the opening getting the pace of the movie started, and ending with heated excitement to wrap up the intense story line. Such balance is key to many movies my friends, and something that many other genres lack. Of course there is no perfect movie, and X-men does have a few flaws for me. While they did a great job tying the three stories together, Singer and company had a few story stretches that were a bit too far-fetched for me. The explanation for how Xavier could walk, or how the X-men could so easily sneak about were just two examples. Another flaw included how some of the characters, primarily first class, were written off, requiring some close attention to detail to determine their fate. I know there are probably good reasons for this approach, but they best be careful for their next films to avoid any conflict. As for the action, while very balanced I wanted more. Special effects wise it was great, but the scenes lacked some excitement, and were surprisingly shorter than I had anticipated from the trailers. Overall Days of Future Past was one of, if not the best X-men movie I've seen. All three stories are integrated into a tale that will keep you on the edge, and is one of those suspenseful movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a balanced plot line, well done action, and some great acting, fans of the series may have their faith restored that this series can be good. Yes they still have some things to work on, but I trust that the next movie can be just as good, especially with the end of the credits scene. Just make sure to bring Singer back for that as well!Score overall: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0 Movie overall: 8.5",9,1,1,24 May 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Magically entertaining and Fantastic Visuals... Though Something is Missing
","Harry Potter, a series that so long ago took us on an adventure none of us would ever forget. Years later, it is still the talk of the town and despite the books essentially ending, the Hogwarts Express money train is still charging ahead to bring out more ideas. This weekend J. K Rowling brings you another installment in her ever expansive world in the form of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Seeing that they were making a movie on what was essentially an encyclopedia of made up creatures, I couldn't help but wonder how good this movie would be. What is the verdict? As always read to find out. LIKES: Â• A J.K. Rowling story Â• Funny and Intense Â• Fantastic visual effectsAfter the recent 8th book and half of the movies, I feared Rowling's quality had been wrung dry from the constant demand of her fans. Glad to see I was wrong. Fantastic Beasts recaptured the magic we fell in love, bringing back the storytelling she started all those years ago. This film has mystery, suspense, and a character driven element all beautifully integrated together, crafting an adventure that is certain to enchant. While the main quest seems to be a simplistic game of hide and seek with gigantic creatures, this tale has many more depths to further draw you into Scamander and friends' life (potentially expanding into more movies should they decide to pick up the option). Story aside, the film has the other elements you die hard Potter fans want in an adventure. For one thing there are plenty of laughs to go around: such as Scamander awkwardly solving a problem (e.g. doing a mating dance that is a bad rendition of the Thriller dance) or his No Mag friend Kowalski having a few one liners and slapstick to get a laugh. These moments keep things fun and fresh and help relieve some of the darker points of the movie. The intense moment isn't so much in the movie itself, but for me in the hopes that Scamander will find his creatures before any are hurt or killed (which you know Rowling is famous for doing). Other moments are suspenseful, but not at the level the other Potter tales have. However, the biggest win for me are the visual effects of the film. Many of the spells you've seen before: white lights for blocking projectiles, or colorful lights before a door opens. However, my favorite spells involved repairing broken objects, which we have seen before but never to the city rebuilding scale. But all the magical quirks pail to the design of the diverse beasts that inhabit Scamander's suitcase. Many of the creatures are exactly what you expect from Rowling's imagination, a combination of deadly and cute in a variety of colors and shapes. Their animation is flawless and their integration into the tale, for the most part, makes up most of the adventure. DISLIKES Â• Something is missing Â• The evil element was lacking Â• A little cheesy in dialogueDespite all the fun I had in the film there still is something missing that the first installments of her series had. One element was a lack of grandiose palaces and magical alleys that we love to get pulled into, or perhaps it was that most of the spells were simplistic and old hat. Or maybeÂ…it was wanting more creatures to involved in the tale to bring further suspense or drama. One thing is for certain though, the 'threat' of this film was more diluted than I had anticipated. Fantastic Beasts primary baddie still has the mystery behind it as you try to uncover what thing runs afoul in New York. However, when it is finally revealed, it disappoint me as it lacked the menacing quality most Potter villains possess. Oh sure the circumstances about its' origins scream Rowling, but the design, execution, and threat were dropped in this film. And yes there is a twist that was very welcome, but it wasn't enough to save the unimpressive bad guy after all the buildup. As for the dialogue and script, this too is another element that could have used some tweaking. At times our characters deliver lines that bring back the nostalgic feeling of the first installments, being both entertaining and empowering to fans. However, this film felt a little more overdramatic and preachy, dropping the clever for emotional, cheesy bologna that took away from the scenes rather than add to it. While this dislike is minor at times, there are some really hokey moments that had my eyes rolling. THE VERDICT:Overall, Fantastic Beasts is a grand adventure, with beautiful special effects and a dynamic tale that is sure to entertain the masses. However, there is still something missing from this movie that makes it pale to some of the predecessors Warner Bros have made in the past. Regardless, this reviewer encourages you to go see the magnificent specimens of merchandising (the beasts) in theaters by the effects alone as this film was better than many of the latter movies for me.

The Conjuring 2," Well Done Wan, Well done
","The horror genre, a movie category that tries to be good, but often ends up a joke during most movies. Occasionally though, we get a film that provides a good thrilling scare and is actually worth the admission price. For me, The Conjuring was one of those movies able to provide the chills I was looking for with a story to match. When I heard a sequel was coming, I feared that its good name would be diluted by the Hollywood haste to make money (remember Annabelle?). Hi Robbie K here, and today I review the Conjuring 2 and share my thoughts on the latest film. Let's get started. THE GOOD Â• Story Â• Integrated scares Â• Acting/Recurring CastSeldom do we get a horror movie with an actual story, instead focusing on how to make people jump. This is not the case with this film my friends. Director James Wan and his team have managed to craft a tale that is both entertaining and interesting to watch. Conjuring 2's story takes place a few years after the first with the Warren's continuing their investigations of the paranormal. Meanwhile, across the ocean, the Hodgson family begins to experience their own paranormal activity that will eventually warrant inspection by our detectives. Sounds simple I know, and in truth it is, but Wan's delivery is fantastic. He manages to build suspense in his tale, using a gradual series of scares to build the tension and slowly reveal the truth in the haunting. And to throw in the few twists they did, only added more depth to the story. But Wan goes one step further and decides to bring some character development into mix, helping to add depth to all involved to help us connect with the film. The Warren's story was great to expand on, discussing the origins of our detectives, while also dropping in a little bit of love to sweeten the deal. And if that weren't enough, he even manages to keep all of the scares pertinent to the story, integrating them into the plot rather than dropping a random scare moment that Hollywood is famous for. By having the scares have a purpose, they removed the corny aspects and added an edge that made the only that much better. Of course, having a great cast to act out this story is the final piece of the puzzle. The repeat performance by Wilson and Farmiga was just as strong, the chemistry between them solid that I believed they were a couple. Newcomers to the series Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor played their roles as a terrified family to the letter, while also having another side to them that made you feel sorry for them. Finally Simon McBurney as Maurice Gross added some finesse to the cast, with a little comedic relief when the going got tough. But while fantastic alone, the chemistry between everyone was on point and only made things that much better.THE BAD: Â• Still another horror movie Â• Dropped some plot points/unexplained Â• Predictable scare tacticsIt was difficult to find weaknesses in this movie for me, but there are a few things that took away from the movie for me. First is that this is still another horror movie that fits in well with other films of the same genre. We've had some unique horror films in the past, but this one is just a good old fashioned haunted house story. Again this is a picky weakness, but the originality could have used a bit more tweaking in my opinion. A bigger weakness is some of the plot points and presentation in the film. Wait a minute, I just said the plot was good didn't I? Yes it is, but it's not perfect and the Conjuring 2 has a few moments that I was still wanting closure on. I have to be sparing to not spoil anything, but one major detail lacking is why one particular thing has a vendetta against the family. A second limiting plot point is how two of the characters sort of drop out of the story without so much as a blink when they had played a key role in the film. But even with these limitations, the story itself was mostly complete and had a good closure, again I'm grasping at straws here. In addition there were some melodramatic moments that were a bit drawn out and somewhat cheesy to me. Oh well can't be perfect right.Finally the scare tactics are still predictable as ever and didn't really get me with the exception of one time. Camera angles giving away something, music eerily going silent and the occasional getting out of bed to walk in a dark hallway give away the horror from a mile away. But while I'm used to it, other members of the audience were still howling in fear, so again this may be a moot point. THE VERDICT:Overall, The Conjuring 2 is a sequel quite worthy of being called just as good as the original. Wan and his group has shown that a horror movie can have a story and still be scary despite the beliefs of Hollywood. The engaging characters, the well timed suspense, and the integrated scares are surely the best selling points. With few weakness to point out, this reviewer can't help but recommend this one for a theater visit for you horror fans out there. My scores for this movie are:Horror: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5",8,0,2,12 June 2016
Inside Out," From the Inside Out it is all Pixar
","We all are victim to our emotions, always susceptible to a tantrum or sobfest that overruled our logical side. The trigger for these outbursts can vary in form, a bad day at school, a breakup with a boyfriend, or in my case sitting through bad movies. Whatever the cause, have you ever stopped to picture what is going on in your mind to cause this? Pixar has, and their latest film has brought those thoughts to life in a way only their studios can. Today I review Inside Out and take a look at what creative sparks lie in their studio. Pixar has been on the sequel train for quite a while, so I was thirsty for a drink from the original pool. Inside Out emerges from that source we fell in love with years ago, and brings it back ten fold in the world of young Riley's (Kaitlyn Dias) mind. Inside Out is a beautiful personification of the inner workings of the mind, filled with colorful visuals that pop off the screen. A high tech 'head'quarters for the cortex looks like something from Star Wars, where futuristic control panels govern all the memories and thoughts that govern our being. Outside command central, Pixar gives you more of their magic in their creations; forming a maze for long term memory, a movie studio as the source of your dreams, and an obvious train for your train of thought. Tacky as some of the puns are, Pixar puts their wit back into the game to design a unique world that is sure to entertain many, as well as become the next theme park attraction. As the emotions transverse the chaos that is our brain, Pixar not only takes you on a physical adventure but an emotional one as well. Of course being a kids movie there are a lot of comedic moments that had me, as well as other audience members, laughing. Slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one liner puns that will appear in memes, and plenty of witty dialogue that represents the internal struggle of indecisiveness. In particular Anger's (Lewis Black) ranting had me laughing the hardest, as the simplistic yelling and rash threats to curse were to my tastes. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) had to be my second favorite, more so in how she presented her lines with that perfect twist of depression to make it funny, and yet sad at the same time. Yet while comedy is a big portion of this movie, Pixar/Disney always manages to bring other emotions into the mix. Seeing as one of the emotions is Sadness, you can guess there are a few moments that can bring tears to your eyes as Riley's memories unfold before your eyes. Joy offsets these moments though, with beautifully crafted sequences that cover those special times in life. And all of it is edited together at just the right times to make the emotions hit home, building slight tension, but delivering a satisfying finish. Pixar represents this emotional instability both inside Riley's mind and outside in her actions, really capturing the look and feel of someone troubled, hence the title. It's balanced well with the humor, and gives older audience members a tether to the film to keep their interest. Voice acting though is the factory that really brings things to life, as each emotion is matched with their voice counterpart. Poehler's optimism shines bright in joy as she rambles off her ideas to keep Riley happy, and you can feel the actress in the character. Phyllis Smith brings her character to life, her whispy voice selling the hopeless emotion, and yet still bringing a comedic edge to her lines that made her humorous. Lewis Black is perfect for anger, his ability to play heavily angry roles where his character consistently yells has been established, and he fits right at home with the emotion he plays so well. Mindy Kaling as Disgust was another good choice, the shallow, image obsessed emotion playing strong to that sassiness we love from her. And Bill Hader cleans up with fear, bringing the anxious tone of fear, while also providing that dry sarcasm. For all the good this movie has there are a few quirks that took away from this movie. The first is a few of the jokes are beaten to death and lose their comedic intensity. In addition the trailers have also given you a lot of the funny moments, which for those who are heavy Disney watchers will be lost from the constant barrage of commercials. As a movie overall, Inside Out has some decent editing, but there are times where the editing needed to be tweaked. The ending of the movie was very drawn out at times, and lacked suspense for me because of the obvious ending to come. I would have liked them to sacrifice some of the prolonged and slower scenes, and give us some glimpses at the personality islands they kept bragging about, or perhaps more time in the darker recesses of the mind. Diving into that creativity may have offset the predictability a bit, and played to the strengths of this movie more. Overall I was impressed with Inside Out and loved to see Pixar's classic performance shine once more. Audience members of all ages are sure to enjoy this film, with the younger generations laughing in high shrills and the older appreciating the emotional side of things. It holds that creative magic we love of Disney, and keeps you entertained despite some of the longer moments. While not the best, Inside Out certainly shows promise for the studio's future works and more fun adventures to be had. I would say it is worth a trip to the theater for any age group and strongly recommend you see this film. My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9,12,37,18 June 2015
Yesterday," One Day Meets Beatles: Yesterday's Charming Balance And Music Saves The Lackluster Finish
","We all know music and many of us love it without so much a whim so long as we get the tracks we love. The artists who work to make music often are recognized more for their abuse of money and fame, rather than the motivation behind their music. So what would happen if you could be that artist you admire so much? What if you could take credit for their work and nobody had a clue they even existed? Well that's where tonight's movie comes in, and yours truly is here to cover the film to let you know whether or not the film is worth a check out. Let's get started as tonight we look at:Movie: Yesterday (2019)Director:

A Little Preachy
Not Quite The Revelation/Tension I thoughtSUMMARY:Much like Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle's work once again manages to capture a charming tale that holds so much in the simplistic story telling. Yesterday was able to bring a lot of fun into the tale, taking the idea of living life as a rock star and using the covers, which are of a good quality, to maximize much of the Beatle's legacy without the masters themselves being present. Despite the seriousness of the movie, Yesterday is funny, selecting a drier, English wit that is occasionally spritzed with some American antics including several cameos that are fun to see. However, Boyle's accomplishment also is finding a way to incorporate the true film art style by sampling some artistic messages into the love story at hand. Yesterday's alternate reality is awe inspiring in terms of pulling the blinds of fandom down to reveal the moral testing sacrifices that the music celebrity world requires, managing to test the boundaries of love without diving too far in Hallmark territory. And it's actually thanks to the acting that I was able to become entranced by the magic of this film. There are plenty of actors to talk about, but in reality it's Patel and James that take center stage, each presenting balanced performances that work in tandem and craft the tale that many will enjoy, again making a believable romance story.Yet there are a few limitations for me that I have to say I was surprised to see, at least for some of them. One thing that is not quite a shocker is how much the trailers have given away in the mass franchising, with many key parts and comedy hits revealed in the television spots. Amidst the predictability, Yesterday starts to lose some of its balance in terms of several decisions they made with the characters. One thing is Kate McKinnon, the comedic queen holds the same personality quirks that people loved, but for me her style of comedy was forced and a little too extreme for the tone this movie set. It's SNL like presentation worked sometimes, but like a few Sheeran moments felt out of place from the components I liked. And much like many films, Yesterday's secondary characters we are introduced to sort of feel lost to the layered storytelling, dropped in the background for more comedic one liners. Sure a bit realistic, but again I'm about utilizing the characters as much as you can. Oh well, I guess that decisions goes with the themes of the movie about fame vs everything else, which although artistically presented sometimes got a bit too after school special for me. However, the biggest 'let down' so to speak was the lack of mind-blowing, or even suspenseful, revelations that the trailers suggest lied in the wings of this mystery. Yesterday's concept is interesting, so you were hoping for some secret to be revealed that would not sweep the film off of the beautiful presentation he put together. Not the case, for the concept sort of fizzles out in favor of pursuing the character arc stories that were built in the 2 hours.Overall, Yesterday worked for me and was fun to watch. A beautiful balance of love, music, and charming artistic quality, Boyle proves to still have the eye for alternative storytelling. It's an entertaining film with a lot of heart that many should enjoy and I feel the acting performances and direction give you the characters you want to invest your time in. There are some forced moments into the movie, primarily in altering the comedy to add a little more moisture to the drier comedy, but it's really the lack of that giant revelation punch at the mystery that really stood out for me in terms of areas to improve. Still, the charming tale is one that can be enjoyed in theater, but the fact it doesn't have enough flash bang boom components means that a home viewing is most likely in your future.My scores are:Comedy/Fantasy/Music: 8.0

Toy Story 4," Unnecessary But So Good On Levels. Two Thumbs Up On So Many Levels
","Pixar, one of the two big animation studios vying for the spot of number one in the great world of movies. In competition with Walt Disney Studios, though supposedly working together for the big company, the studio that blew our minds long ago is back with another 'new' movie. Having difficulties launching new ideas, Pixar seems to fall back on their time-honored films in an attempt to expand upon their timeless characters. While often good, how far the movie can go is always the question, but these guys have managed to find the magic time and time again. So I am here once more to review the latest installment to see if Pixar can keep in time with their storytelling. Robbie K here and get ready for another review this time on:Movie: Toy Story 4 (2019)Director:

The Ending Makes The Points In Three Pointless
The Older Characters Are Not Utilized WellSummary: It's Disney and It's Pixar, you know the animation is going to be awesome as beautiful, and improving, graphics are integrated with color and sound design to bring the world to life. Throw in the voice acting and once more the movie has crafted the usual media to bring their characters to the forefront of Disney heroes and heroines. And through their magic they have crafted fun characters, their army finding a way to bring comedy and emotion to the movie and produce a fun paced movie that entertains many ages and preferences. Yet what impresses me in this movie, is how well they developed some of their characters once more. Bo Peep, a character who had little involvement out of snarky comments and a crush in the first two installments, is back with a complex story that is balanced, poised, and realistic to really latch onto. Woody's ever evolving tale matches perfectly with it, a lock and key that push these characters to new levels and somehow bridges the issues of the first installment. Even more impressive is Pixar's way of adding depth to the villain, somehow managing to put more layers in outside of just megalomaniac personas that are famous in Disney movies. This utilization of storytelling and character development, is the example of Disney's ability to make emotionally gripping tales that pulled me into the adventure once more, keeping my interest and I believe pulling younger members in as well. It's those emotional moments that somehow seem to complete the movie and leave you with yet another satisfied conclusion, until they need more money and make the fifth movie.
Yet, the movie still runs into the art of predictability, not entirely, but certainly enough has been ruined by the copious trailers to have given much away. And much like the trailers and specials, Toy Story also has a new cast of characters to merchandise off to the younger wards. The new characters are fun, and serve their purpose of bringing laughs, quotes, and new ideas for toys. They contribute their points, but unlike the original bunch, the involvement with them is not quite as engaging as previous installments. Through in that the older characters we have grown up with over the last two and half decades are rather poorly integrated and you have some disappointing components to me. I'm from the school of if you are not going to keep them integrated into the story meaningfully, why put them in to begin with, and this was especially true for Toy Story 4. Finally, and probably picky, the conclusion of this movie sort of overwrote all the hard work of Toy Story 3 for me. Certainly there are new lessons to learn at a new stage of the journey, but given the time frame between three and four, I would expect them not to so quickly displace what the gang did in three. But hey that's just me.Overall, the movie is still a work of art, showing that despite ending the movie well, they can find way to keep it going. Toy Story 4 has heart, class, and does such a good job of expanding its main characters to continue the supposed hero's journey. The new characters are fun, the world is still colorful, and it's all presented in an entertaining and meaningful pace that I thoroughly enjoy. Sure the tale is still predictable, the characters are imbalanced, and the ending did offset three for me a bit, but the truth is the movie is a fantastic tribute to the art of the animation studio that is Pixar. No surprise it is worth a trip to theater so take the family, or yourself and get out to enjoy it as the emotional tale of the summer hits theaters this weekend. Otherwise, it's definitely one to go on the must see at home list for me.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5

The Fault in Our Stars," There is Very Little Fault With This Movie
","Movies about terminal illness, so passionate, so well done, but somehow so sad. Yet for some reason we are drawn to them like moths to a flame, often for the quality tales they spin, and the emotions they stir up. This week The Fault in Our Stars released, another movie based on, yes you guessed it a book. So naturally after coming off my latest science fiction high, it was time for me to return to my local theater and calm myself with this drama/romantic tale. What did I think? As always, please read on to find out. For those who haven't seen the plethora of trailers, or read the book, this movie is the story of Hazel (Shailene Woodley) a girl who suffers from cancer and the associated depression that follows. Just when everything seems lost, a charismatic man named Gus(Ansel Elgort) enters, whose positive outlook and bright spirits send them on a journey of self discovery and wonder. I know, the story sounds like all the other terminally ill stories, but that doesn't mean it's not worth checking out. The Fault in our Stars is an incredibly passionate movie, filled to the brim with amazing scenes of beauty, wonder, and emotion. It all starts with the characters, who at first are like yin and yang, opposite approaches to the same situation. Woodley's portrayal of Hazel was fantastic, the dismay and depression flowing out of her so naturally, it was as if she herself was suffering from the disease. It was so refreshing to see her not playing an overly whiney, teenager as I've seen in her past roles, instead showing the true abilities she had beneath. Yet the character that really brought the movie to me was Gus. This man's positivity and will were infectious, brightening up the negative energy of the situation and keeping the movie fun despite the dire outcomes that awaited. Elgort was like a low key Jesse Eisenberg, arrogant, but not as much of a jerk that makes him lovable. The characters are strong on their own, but together they evolve into a duo that breathes so much life into the movie and hooks you into the two-hour ride. Even when they are not speaking, these young actors portray their feelings in simple gestures, an eye roll here, a smirk there, that translates the thoughts going on in their minds.Supporting the characters is a some creative dialog, that was synthesized from a variety of styles to help get the point across. At first it is nothing more than the ire filled thoughts of a cancer patient that reflects the suffering they face. Depression eventually turns into casual conversations when Gus arrives, balanced in comedy, romance, and other emotions that continue to shift as the story unfolds. What could be a laugh fest at one point can turn into a sobfest at another, but one thing that holds constant is the realism of the movie. Unlike some movies, there is no magical word, saying, or moment that erases all the hurt, but instead a realist approach to handling the cards life deals you. I for one can learn a thing or two from what this movie preached, and perhaps if you open your eyes you can see it too. To help sell the point, the cinematography exploded with symbolism and emotion at the time of the scene. When the characters were down, the camera maximized emphasis on the face, if they were trying capture love, the scene focused on finding romantic imagery to bring out the scene. The musical score they selected only further enhanced the feelings, somehow working behind the scenes to synergistically pull at your heartstrings. You would think I would have gotten annoyed by all of this repetitive themes, but somehow they balanced all of this and kept the pace going, avoiding the cheesiness many romance movies contain in my eyes. Of course what I consider cheesy, others find to be inspiring and beautiful. Being the robot I am, I did not cry in this movie, mostly because I knew what the ending would be well into the movie. Despite the lack of tears, I'll admit that the movie still moved me sending my emotions on a roller coaster ride. As for the other audience members though, the water works flowed through the entire movie. What do these observations mean? It means that you can experience a variety of emotions and learn a lot of things from this movie, which can mean multiple watches of this movie, though the tale will still remain predictable. Another warning is that there are some very tough struggles in this movie, perhaps not appropriate for those with a personal connection to this story. If you're like me though, you'll be able to find happiness in this tale, hopefully being inspired rather than depressed. Surprisingly The Fault In Our Stars impressed me despite the fact it is a story I've seen before. The balance in it impresses me the most, brought to full force with the wonderful acting the cast has to bring. Yes, it is a predictable ending, but the delivery is so solid, I can't really dock it too much. I strongly recommend checking out this movie, hoping that you will take away something from the messages crammed in this movie. Those who have less control over their tears, are warned to bring tissues, or at least the supporting arm of a loved one to get you through the journey.

Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck on Ralph, Wreck On!
","Disney has been busy this week with its business transactions. Not only have they just acquired Lucas' studio, but this weekend they decided to release their latest animated film Wreck-it-Ralph. For those of you without Disney Channel/ABC family watchers, or have missed the trailers before the movie, this is a film about video games. It starts out with a large hand, wild haired, bum look alike named Wreck-it-Ralph (John C. Reilly), who has been programmed to destroy a hotel complex that overtook his home. Fixing his path of rampage is a high pitched, repairman with a golden hammer named Fix-it-Felix (Jack McBrayer) who at the end of the day gets the glory, while Ralph gets the heave ho into the mud. Constant lack of Recognition though leads Ralph to leaving his game though, all in the pursuit of a token of glory he feels will change his life. So what did this reviewer think of this latest chapter in the Disney media? Read on to find outTo start my review off, I'll start with one of the movie's biggest strengths, the comedy. Many people who might be thinking, 'This comedy is just for gamers,' are sadly mistaken in this viewer's opinion. Yes, there are plenty of video game references to please my fellow electronic players, many of which are cleverly integrated into the story to keep the film fun and exciting. References like Mario Kart, Metal Gear Solid, and Pitfall are thrown throughout the movie that will have any seasoned veteran laughing in their seats and perhaps even calling out the reference in the theater. However, if you're not that big on gaming, or have a very limited experienced in the game department don't worry there are plenty of other things to make you laugh. The writers of the movie filled most of the dialog with a load of puns that are both cute and clever. Many of these puns are jokes you've probably heard a thousand times when hanging out with friends, but for me they still made me laugh. Even the scenery and world design was quite punny, taking brand names of some products and turning them into environmental hazards and traps. Of course if you don't like puns, then this movie might annoy you after the sixth or seventh pun. However, for those who are young at heart like me, you won't be disappointed. Not a fan of puns, well there is one last humor style in this movie that may persuade you to see the movie, a style I call Sue Sylvester style. Those who love the hot-blooded cheerleader coach from Glee will be happy to see her essentially digitalized into this movie in the form of Calhoun the army leader. Out of the hallways and into the battlefield Calhoun insults every single game entity that crosses her path, crossing into the word cover up lines like pussywillows at times. If you're worried that her character will play a minor role in this movie, have no fears for Calhoun is in most of the movie.The other thing this movie has going for it is the cute fun adventure that was laid out by their studios. I found very little, if any slow parts in this movie, as the directing team kept the adventure fast and on the move going from world to another. Each of the worlds added another element to Ralph's character helping him discover the dormant hero sleeping inside of him. This adventure first has promise of dark, awesome action in the first person shooter world, which I can't lie I wanted to see more of. Once our team gets to Sugar Rush though, the cuteness floods out into the theater. Not only is the world itself a cute display of candy coated puns and Disney cartoon citizens, but it also unfolds the relationship part of the story between Ralph and Venelope (Sarah Silverman). The pint sized driver has some spunk to her lines, but also has the ability to melt your heart with big eyes and even bigger heart. Her character's background is a story of its own that integrates smoothly into the main plot, though it may bring a few awws out of you. Both stories have the same underlying message, and may even inspire you in some manner, either that or make you roll your eyes at being too cheesy. Despite the fun cuteness though and evolution of Ralph's goals, the story is still predictable lacking very few twists from the trailer. However, if you're taking kids to see it, or you're a kid at heart you might not mind it. What else is there to say about this movie? Again there is pretty good balance between the characters staying on the screen, which of course keeps the laughs fresh and new. On top of that the animation was very impressive for me. The characters moved based on their video games, such as the classic 8 bit blocky movements that were the precursor to modern games. What also made me happy was that I was able to follow all of the action scenes in this movie, instead of watching glitch filled, shaky camera shots that take away from the detail. Well at least most of the camera work didn't take away from the detail, unfortunately Hero's Duty was a little chaotic to follow and the brief screen time for the battle with the bugs was a little disappointing. Even the soundtrack was quite enjoyable and most of the songs fit perfectly with the scenes they were representing, especially Owl City's theme at the end.Wreck it Ralph is definitely a fun family film, and quite clever in many aspects. However, if cute and punny isn't your cup of tea, then you best sitting this one out for now. My scores for this movie are the following: Comedy/Family: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5",9,7,10,3 November 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," My Favorite Of The Middle Earth Tales
","Hello my friends! It's Robbie K back with another review after coming off of a two week dry spell, and what a movie to return to. As many know, this weekend belongs Peter Jackson's newest installment The Hobbit, another tribute to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings world. Now The Hobbit might be one of my favorite fantasy books, so I was very excited to see Jackson taking on the challenge of bringing the Middle Earth to life once more. Yet with his plans to make three movies based on this book, I was worried that Mr. Jackson may have added some extra footage that took away from the movie. So let's get to work as I review The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.With a good book, comes great characters and with great characters come big expectations, and in my opinion, this movie meets those expectations. While the Hobbit has many characters, I have limited space to complement on a few actors that brought the traveling company to life. My first actor to talk about is Martin Freeman, who played the protagonist Bilbo Baggins. Freeman has already had experience portraying legendary characters like Sherlock Holmes' Dr. Watson, and has impressed me with his work in the past. I'm happy to say that Freeman has done his job again, using his natural awkwardness to bring Bilbo's shy and cowardly nature to life on the screen. I felt that Freeman's facial expressions were perhaps the strongest tool in his arsenal, using it to represent the internal emotional struggles Frodo faces in the book, while solidly delivering his lives. The legendary Ian McKellen returns to play Gandalf, using his enchanting voice to bring the wit and wisdom of the wizard out to entertain the masses. Of all the characters, he was the most diverse, as McKellen manages to deliver well timed lines with just enough emphasis to make it funny. Even McKellen's look portrays wizard, as he goes from joking, lovable hermit, to wise and fearless warrior. To finish up the actors section I'll talk about Richard Armitage playing the lead dwarf Thorin. Bringing a hero of the dwarf world to life was no easy feat I'm sure, but the casting crew did a great job picking him for the part. Not only does Armitage have the look of headstrong, proud warrior, but he also has the voice that I pictured the character having. Armitage managed to capture pride, emotional recklessness, and determined nature of dwarf leader, which kept me hooked into the story Jackson was portraying.However, acting isn't the only strength of this movie. Like many fans, I wondered how Jackson could extend this story into three parts. I feared that like some of his other movies, Jackson was going to put in extra detail that was a dragged out boring mess that was merely used to extend the movie into some obscenely long time. With the Hobbit though, I think he managed to get the balance right, as the extra scenes I saw made the story even more interesting. Though I do not remember everything about the book, the film contained some plot elements that were new to me. Jackson managed to integrate these scenes well, making them key parts of the story that set up more adventure for the later installments. Some of these scenes though are a little tough to understand at this point though, as some of these extra scenes are left unexplained leaving them a little out of place in this movie. Despite these extra scenes though, Jackson did a decent job capturing the immense detail this book contains and in a decent amount of time. Although there is almost a three hour price tag with this film, it didn't feel like I was in the movie for that long. Unlike its predecessors, The Hobbit's pace stays decent moving from one challenge to another quickly, yet making sure to address the backgrounds and plot elements that are necessary. Yet like the book, the beginning is a little slow, with Jackson taking a little too much time on the Baggins home, especially the unneeded Frodo cameo. Yet my friends and I agree, once the quest has started, there are very few lack of a better phrase 'long feeling' scenes that will bore you out of your mind. I'll go ahead and answer the question of how is the Action? Like the earlier installments, Jackson's crew has gone above and beyond bringing the battle to life. Whether it is flashbacks or troll bashing, this movie had a decent amount of sword swinging, axe smashing, and arrow shooting chaos to open up a new trilogy. Fans will be pleased with the teamwork of the dwarfs, and may appreciate the focus on individual combat styles of the party instead of the clashing army swarm fights many movies like to use. What else is there to say about the Hobbit? One thing is the camera work, which captures the beautiful wilderness frontier, though a few scenes may cause some motion sickness. The digital art and creation of the various Middle Earth kingdoms was also impressive, as the computer generated lands were stunning. The intricate details of the dwarven halls, the polished finesse of the elven castles, and the rugged waste land of the frontier were all designed to capture the emotion of the scene. Though what are visuals without music? Fear not my friends as the Hobbit has another award winning soundtrack that will take your breath away. Overall this was my favorite movie of the four Middle Earth films. With great balance, a fantastic pace, beautiful visuals, and some entertaining characters I have no doubt the other two movies will be great. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie in theaters, preferably 2D, and enjoy the world Peter Jackson has created once more. My scores for this film are the following: Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",9,5,15,15 December 2012
The Favourite," Will This Be Your Favorite
","Robbie K with another quick review as he hits the more artistic nature of the film this holiday season. With a wonderful reception at the various film festivals, this movie held high hopes for being a winning masterpiece for the late year. With a promising cast, good direction, and a unique twist to normal films, I went in eagerly to see what awaited. What was the verdict? Robbie's reviews here to share his opinions as he reviews:Movie: The Favourite (2018)Director:
Yorgos Lanthimos
Writers:
Deborah Davis, Tony McNamara
Stars:
Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz
LIKES:The Acting
The Setting
The Costumes/Makeup
The Character Development
The Strategy
The Presentation, mostlySummary: Film festival features are seldom squandered out of acting, and the Favourite is no exception. Rachel Weisz succeeds in her abilities as the lady of the manor, with poise, regality, and a cunning nature fitting of the character designed. Stone's transition throughout the movie is admirable, starting on end of the personality spectrum, yet showing the evolving psyche of the players of late century politics. Colman as well is an integral piece, ushering in the role and acting as the key pillar for this mad state of affairs.
But acting aside, The Favourite stands out for it's beautiful setting, with the location team and set crew working hand and hand to fashion a fitting battlefield for our femme fatales of the silver screen. The manor and all its hallowed halls and manicured lawns will take you on that international trip to historical England, immersing you into the themes at hand. As such, the characters themselves are quite dashing in their costumes, every politician, maid, and governmental officiant a welcoming tribute to the paintings of old. The leading women in particular have ravishing costumes and makeup, helping to unleash the full effect of the movie.
Yet it is the character centric story that really takes all the aforementioned strengths and pulls them together. The Favourite's focus on developing all the characters, including a few secondary characters that at first seem mere parlor tricks. As the film progresses, the strategy at hand also starts to evolve in a Game Of Thrones like technique without so much blood and murder, as inner wants and jealousy lead to some rather interesting choices. And all of this is presented beautifully in the film work's techniques. Odd angles and dark hallways mirror the tone of the movie, as a haunting soundtrack of European orchestra plays in the back adding more to the emotions of the characters. Presenting all of this as if it were a Shakespearean play only adds to the ambience of the movie, and helps this film stand out a little more in terms of artistic wonder. Yes, it certainly feels like a Thespian tragedy at hand and a nod to this approach and helping it shine in victory.DISLIKES:The Pace at times
The Animal Cruelty
The Inclusion Of Seedier Culture
The Ending's FinesseSummary: While artistic and brilliantly presented, the movie for me ran a little slow at times. The opening of the film did its introduction well, with the first couple of acts taking time to introduce the world in appropriate detail. Eventually as the rivalry develops. Things really start to take off, only to slightly take a rather large detour that offset the pace disrupting the very thing I fell in love with on the movie, with the end probably being where the steam was fully lost. Certainly some of the loss of detail comes in with the focus of documenting every move in this game of human chess, which I didn't mind.
Instead, the real loss of pace came from some of the extra details added for more of a cultural reflection of the times (details Shakespeare loved). While some of the animal cruelty showed the off the past times of the British high life, I did not need to see the repeated defeat of the small creatures, while other times were just unnecessary quirks that seemed forced and rushed in at the end. In addition some of the seedier shots such as rape, self-pleasure, and other acts of hazing didn't quite add anything to the story or feel of the movie, when my main goal was to see the power play between the two champion actresses. Sadly, this semi-focus on the animalistic side of the characters sort of deterred from the plot for me and added unnecessary length to the movie.
And like my fellow reviewers, I do agree that the film's ending did not quite suit me given all the build-up. It ends rather vaguely, and although it mirrors the Greek Tragedy's delivery, it did not quite have the same satisfaction that those ancient playwrights had. Instead, it seemed that the Favourite had a rather rushed, messy finish that gives you all the pieces you need to draw up your own conclusions of what occurred. Outside of throwing off the pace in the final two acts, the ending just didn't deliver that last punch I had wanted, or at least in the manner I wanted.
The VERDICT:Overall the Favourite is worthy of much of the praise it received from the festivals. The presentation is beautiful on many levels as it deters from the usual linear fashion, and it seems to really pay tribute to the tragedies that this tale is based on. In addition the story really speaks out to the culture and darker parts of history that sometimes don't get told in the text books. Yet, it's ironically that very presentation that took some of the flair away from the movie, as getting lost in the grimier aspects of human nature threw off the pace of the film and left the ending a semi-complete telling that could have used twenty minutes more to flesh out the final number with that woman's scorn I think we wanted. Overall, the movie gets points for its presentation style, but it may not quite have all the categories needed to warrant a trip to the movies in my opinion. Still, give this one a try at home if you are looking for something.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Origins of the ape war are not what they seem
","It's hard to believe that it has been forty three years since the first Planet of the Apes movie came out and we had our first look at Earth when controlled by the simians. Although an attempt to revive the series was made ten years ago, the Planet of the Apes series seemed dead to a lot of my friends and me. However, this weekend the latest Planet of the Apes installment, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, has debuted. The question you may be asking now is, 'Robbie is this movie worth seeing, or just another sad attempt to revive this series?' In my opinion, I believe this movie is worth seeing, but overall it's your call. So sit back and relax as we take a look at this movie.The premise to this movie can be deduced from the title alone as we see the origins to how the apes became the dominant life form of the planet. A journey to cure Alzheimer's disease is the spark to the war between ma n and ape as Will Rodman (James Franco) attempts to synthesize a drug to eliminate the disease that plagues his father (James Lithgow). After some chaotic and wild intro scenes, Franco ends up with Caesar (Andy Serkis) a baby chimp that has inherited the cure from his mother. With the positive results Caesar is showing, Will gives the compound to his father and brings him back from the brink of losing his mind. Eventually we see Caesar growing up and becoming even more intelligence as he begins questioning his role in Will and Caroline's (Frieda Pinto) life which soon leads down a path that we all see coming. See trailer hereThis prequel to the series was surprisingly done well and was much better than I had originally anticipated it to be. Franco for the most part shows off his talent as he captures the brilliant and motivated scientist determined to better the world. In a manner similar to his character in Spiderman, Franco is not an emotionless shell, but actually has a heart of gold that drives his actions and character. However, Franco as well as the rest of the supporting human cast all pale in comparison to the character development of Caesar, the main ape of the movie. In a series of stunning camera work, CGI animation, and wonderful writing we see the evolution of Caesar from lab experiment to leader. It's quite scary how Wyatt and company were able to put such human emotion into a digital chimpanzee, which brought the audience and me, further into the movie. I was able to relate to Caesar on a number of levels from protecting family and friend to the question and searching one's purpose in life. There were plenty of moments in this movie that pulled the strings of my heart and other times that left me satisfied at the actions that had just taken place. Again I will state that the CGI was excellent and perhaps was the best used medium for this movie, instead of the makeup we've seen in the past. Unlike other CGI movie we've seen this summer, i.e. Transformers 3, Green Lantern, Captain America, and more) the CGI was not overshadowed by things like action, over-dramatic live action, or slapstick comedy. Instead it was used to tell a science fiction story that felt real, relatable, and representative of a chimp in a foreign world. Serkis being the master of motion capture technology, has once again simulated creature movements to perfection. Although Caesar has so much human character to him, the movie still does a good job at showing that he is still has ape origins as he continues to run, communicate, and even play in ape like mannerisms. The combination of both ape and human qualities gives Caesar a quality unlike any well trained or animatronic animal I've seen in the past. Despite how strong the CGI tells the story, it still doesn't help with how predictable the story is. Throughout most of the movie, I was able to predict where the tale was going. Whether it involved Caesar's next actions, who was going to be attacked next, to what problems were going to occur, all of the actions were easily determined. An exception would be an unexpected killer of the human race, which I do not want to reveal. Perhaps another problem some may not enjoy is that once again humanity is the enemy and the source of all evil. Countless acts of greed, jealousy, fear, and various other attributes force the humans to make irrational decisions that are driven by emotions. While it does help drive the story, it did cause me to roll my eyes a few times. Yet a third weakness in this movie could be the lack of action that the trailers painted for us these past few months. Although it did not bother me, fans who are looking intense ape action will be strongly disappointed, as only the last twenty minutes or so has actual fighting. The story and character development were perhaps stronger due to the slower pace, but the action at the end is a good release of the suspense that builds up throughout most of the movie. Overall I applaud Rise of the Planet of the Apes and believe this to be a movie worthy of your time in the theaters. These days it is rare for a sci-fi flick to have such character development, emotion, and story as most are now mainly drowned out by explosions and flashy action scenes. However the superb acting, decent pace, and phenomenal combination of CGI and camera work really give the movie character and emotional drive. I'll give this movie an 8.0 for surprising me and am looking forward to seeing what's in store for the series next. Check in next time my friends for movie reviews on today's modern releases and soon classic movies. Take care!",Null,0,1,7 August 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," Infincible?
","The event is finally here, and boy does it have big expectations to live up to as the culmination of ten years of movies comes rushing in. With perhaps one of the biggest expectations to meet, can Avengers: Infinity War meet everything we die-hard fans love, or does the over expectation syndrome come into play. Robbie K with a spoiler free review coming at you to shed some light on the subject. Movie: 
Marvel: Avengers Infinity War
Directors:
 Anthony Russo, Joe Russo
Writers:
 Christopher Markus (screenplay by), Stephen McFeely
Stars:
 Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo
LIKES: Character Development: It's always nice to see character evolve and while the 18 installments before this movie have laid strong foundations, Infinity continues that trend. Not everyone gets the full red-carpet treatment (with all the characters at hand), but those that do have some deeper trenches we did not expect. You'll certainly feel things resonate if you've been following the story so far and a fantastic means to tie you into the story. Story Twists: We all have theories about this movie, most centered on who would survive the war for the Infinity Stones. Despite everything foreshadowed in the trailers, you have no idea what is coming. Infinity Wars is a universe filled with twists, throwing in suspenseful moments with ease and doing everything to keep you on the edge of your seat. The trailers were certainly edited to leave out key details, and that mystery was very well appreciated as the revelations began to drop and the story began to click, up until the very end. Be ready for some answers to lingering questions you may not have realized you have, and some surprises that will have you cheering in delight and excitement. Acting: A small quality to comment on, and way too many actors to hit up in detail, the acting still lives up to the potential we had set up. All the contenders easily reprise their roles, bringing delight, fun, heroism and heart wrenching moments to life with no hesitation. Mixing the team together, really did feel like an awkward, weird family trying to save the galaxy one minute at a time. Despite all the characters crammed into this mega hit, the chemistry works fantastically. Comedy: Marvel's writing continues to lean towards the comedic stick, trying to garnish the comic plots in a more expansive way to net more audience members in the box office. Infinity War has plenty of moments mashed into the space epic adventure, a mixture of slapstick, insults, well-timed cursing, and comical references that keep the giggles, guffaws, and laughter coming. Don't worry of the darker atmosphere overshadowing the laughs, there will be plenty to try and keep things as bright as possible. Action, somewhat: The special effects are hands down impressive, especially seeing the stones powers better utilized than just exploding like previous films. All the sound editing and CGI are worthy of the theater spectacle, perhaps the biggest reason to come see in the theater. Infinity War has some decent brawls that deliver the fist pumping, adrenaline rush you wanted to see as new tricks are unleashed and styles mix together. Especially near the end, there is one particular fight that feels much like an epic video game battle with all the bells and whistles ringing into one. A little eccentric at times, but hey it is a comic book movie. 
DISLIKES: Lulls in Action: While there is good storytelling in this movie, an Avengers movie is known more for the fast pace and battles. There are some major lulls in the action, as the three-story trails attempt to connect all the pieces in the quest for uncovering the stones. These gaps are by far entertaining, but at times I felt another battle needed to be integrated, or others extended to keep the pace going. I liked the emotional warfare in this movie, but come on, a little more resistance. The Black Order: This is only a semi-dislike, but Thanos elite guards were not as 'elite' as I had expected. Gross and creepy looking, definitely. Deadly and threatening in design? Absolutely. But in regards to their skills, these masters of destruction were kind of... weak and under developed. It doesn't mean they don't get their 15 minutes to shine, but let's just say these characters really needed more integration in the story for this reviewer to enjoy. Too Many Characters?: So many people mixed into one movie, brings with it the threat of potentially denying your favorite character the time you want him/her to hold. It happens in this movie, so take what you can get and run with it as best as you can. They do a nice job with most of them, but three of the characters got a bit stiff armed that I wasn't expecting to see. So, this element could have been tweaked to get a better immersive story in my opinion. The Ending: I can't say much about this, but the ending to Infinity War is almost as mixed as the characters in this galactic quest. There will be many questions generated from it and even more theories as to how the next wave will proceed, which I guess is good to keep interest coming. However, it kind of felt cheaply delivered and rushed over, in a manner that was sort of a cop out to be honest. Based on that last sentence, this component is why the ending was not as well-received, not for the questions it generated. The Fight at Wakanda: The biggest selling point of the trailers was that war on the Wakandan plains, where Wakanda soldiers join the elite squad to fight thousands of CGI aliens. With all the storytelling elements building up to the climax, I had very high hopes this battle was going to be the climactic piece to bring it all together. I'll admit, there are some parts that are true creative genius, but much of the battle was glazed over, dull, and missing so much of the battle chemistry I had expected. Quick finishes to semi-suspenseful moments, and much shorter than I anticipated, this battle was certainly the element I was most disappointed with. The VERDICT: Infinity Wars didn't quite live up to the hype that the marketing brought with it, but this does not mean it was a bad movie. A very edgy tale awaits the theaters, with twists and character development waiting to evolve our characters to the next level, with a few flashy battles to liven things up and comedy to ease the tension. Yet, this project may have been a little too big to tackle, leading to many things being glazed over in trade for others. Try to lower your expectations and I think you will be okay, just try to accept that there will be answers to come, one just has to wait. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.5

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon A Long Winded Review
","Hollywood, the glamorous place that holds the dreams of so many aspiring to be rich, famous, and fashionable. It's a place that has changed faces much like the stars change make up, and to keep on top of modern trends to keep the ever-consuming monster satiated. Yet, in the shiny metropolis lies stories that aren't so flashy or happy, dramatic tales that are sad and filled with anguish that some can't handle. Yet, for directors like Quentin Tarantino it's a medium that holds potential to open the eyes of the blind. That story, or at least a comedic rendition of it, lies in this movie of our review with hopes of being a contender in the quality film industry. Robbie K here ready to give you a taste of another review as we take on:Movie: Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (2019)Director:

The Ending... sort ofSUMMARYThe wow factor for this movie is the homage Tarantino paid to the glorious mega studio in so many aspects. In particular all the movie magic of effects, wardrobe, settings take you back to the classic world where so much changed, as the 60s/70s. In the fantastic setting of retro Hollywood, smart writing that is blend of drama, comedy, and smart dives into the psyche of those famous people we admired. By tempering down the Tarantino cascade, it allowed for a different film that wasn't overwhelmed by the flash in the pan effect this director flourishes in. To help further bring this message to life, the acting of the three tiled characters gets big acknowledgement, with heart throb DiCaprio bearing much of the load of the tortured actor trying to find his way in a changing world. Pitt's character was my favorite of the supporting character that was a blend of looks and comedy that went well with the supporting story, while Robbie's dive in the star trying to gain new light sort of provided the intensity relief. Yet, all of this is overpowered by the bouts of nostalgia from the various entertainment venues this time period had. Radio shows, famous songs, television programs, and all the memorabilia that referenced this was the real factor that made the movie a fun adventure filled with messages and meaning.Yet, the movie does have some cleaning up for me that would potentially make it more favorable to the general public. First of all, while Tarantino's energy has been tempered, it's not eliminated and the moments where it comes out in full rush did little for me. Minor dislike aside, the story telling, while good, is a little imbalanced, primarily in Margot Robbie's character who felt more like an incongruent tangent that only touched on the graph of this film's main plot. Because of this sort of unbalance, the movie seemed to fall in to a frame of being too slow, the pace for a nearly 3-hour film was dragging and very tiring. Much of this had to do with the bloated sequences of lots of driving, or dragged out bits of conversation that could have been left for a director's cut. Throw in the incongruent story of Margot Robbie's character and you get extra time that is not really need. Perhaps it would have been worth it had the ending gone the way I had expected, the buildup of the incident ending in that comedic violence that is both satisfying and not quite the terror I had expected. Thus, the long-winded journey did not quite have the finish that I think he was getting at.Overall, Once Upon In Hollywood is smart writing, diving into the lives of the fleeting fame that is Hollywood and how the transitions can affect one person. The special effects and settings will be the ultimate nostalgic for fans to dive into, and the acting is certainly going to have candidates in the Oscar running. Yet, the films suffers from bloated storytelling and disproportionate focus on each aspect leading to a very drawn out tale that may not be for everyone. Thus, if you are looking for the entertainment factor, this one is not worth a trip to the theater, but if you want the artistic love letter to the thing that brings so many hits, then check this one out.My scores are:Comedy-Drama: 8.5

Gone Girl," Going, Going... Gone!!!!
","My second review this week is on yet another book translated into a movie. In what is sure to be the leading movie in the box office this weekend, this next film is all about drama, suspense, and thrills. Pre opening reviews showed promise for this thriller, most critics stating how good the production of this film is. Can it be true? Have we actually achieved another good rendition of a book? I'll do my best to not spoil everything, as I review Gone Girl. In a thriller, we expect a certain quality to hook us into the tale. Unfortunately, many movies either go so extreme that the story is ridiculous, or lose our interest because they can't keep the flames alive. Not the case in Gone Girl. This story grabs your attention from the get go, forgoing a prolonged introduction and diving right into the scene at hand. We've all been hooked into movies with missing people, the inquisitive mind wondering if that person is alive and what nightmare they are going through. In addition to this curiosity, Gone Girl does something else that keeps you into the madness; it slowly reveals the aspects of the plot. Scene by scene we are treated to another piece of the puzzle that sets up the history of the characters and the secrets they hold. The order to which they present is logical and strategically planned, culminating in a mass of scenes that are well designed and emotional. For this reviewer, all the scenes made sense, and all of them were relevant to the story, a thing that is very rare to see these days. Of course the brilliance of this movie is the changes in direction this movie takes. Not too drastic a turn, Gone girl's plot elements are fantastic for keeping you involved, changing up just enough to keep things interesting all around. I think what I loved the most is the cleverness behind the entire movie and the strategic plot development that takes place. Those who have read the book know what I'm talking about, but for those who haven't I assure you that a majority will be pleased. Of course the drama is only one aspect of this movie, in truth Gone Girl's tale is truly brought to life by the acting. Ben Affleck surprised me greatly in this film, for once not annoying me with his choice of style. Young Affleck plays the part of sociopathic disturbance quite well, bringing about a quiet intensity and intense edge. What I thought would be a rather boring role was a surprise with the emotional roller coaster his character goes through. Sad, angry, mortified, all of these qualities are nicely mixed together in his performance, and well acted to the point where I believe he is this character. Playing his opposite is Rosamund Pike who also surprised me in this role. Pike's sexy voice is seductive, smooth and elegant yet strong enough to induce doubt in the relationship. She also did a great job playing a character I really hated, the flashbacks of her enough to drive me crazy and define her as the five letter word for a female dog. Pike made a great commitment to her role, bringing all of her qualities to life with a natural flare and edge. Tyler Perry steps out of his Madea dress, and back into the serious role as he plays the ace attorney. No surprise, Perry is good at playing the stereotypical expert lawyer, filled with arrogance and overzealous discipline to keep the game of strategy going. However there are a few things about this movie I didn't necessarily like. First thing is some of the over the top dark moments. I appreciate the dark humor in this movie, the movie showing the fickleness of humans one of the most entertaining aspects. Yet, they overstep their boundaries in a few scenes, going into the land of the demented and gruesome in some of the characters behaviors. One scene in particular is rather graphic, the blood covering the scene in a rather disturbing display. Those who love such an edge, such as what is seen in Game of Thrones, will be desensitized to this madness, but others want to be prepared for the carnage. A second weakness is the length of the movie. Again I state that all of the info presented fit well into the movie, and most if not all was needed. Did it need to be over 2 hours long though? I don't think so. At times you don't feel the length of the movie, but there are some points that bring the fatigue on. Some editing would have been welcomed, but I can live with the extra scenes if I had to. Finally the language is not my favorite either. I know I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to language, but this movie said a word that I can't stand, and even though it is completely appropriate, it still gets me a little bit. Overall Gone Girl is a fantastic tale, filled with an engaging story that keeps you on your toes. Fantastic acting helps bring the world to life and the dark elements to it are more than welcome. However, it is almost a two and half hour investment and a bit long winded at points. Worth a trip to the theater? I think it is, though there really isn't any quality to this movie that is augmented by the bigger screen. What are my scores?

Django Unchained," Funny, Yet Uber Violent and Crude
","'The D is silent!' a quote that made so many people laugh and applaud. It's Robbie K again, this time reviewing Quentin Tarantino's latest film Django Unchained. The plot for this film is about a slave named Django(Jamie Foxx) who is rescued by a German bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz(Christoph Waltz). Apparently Django is one of the few men in Texas who knows the identity of a band of outlaws named the Brittle brothers. As payment for helping him, Schultz promises to track down Django's wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington) who is currently owned by a chauvinistic plantation owner named Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). If you've seen Tarantino's work, you know that the man is very extreme in his movies and makes no attempts to censor his work. Django Unchained follows the same path, which for some will be enjoyable for some and rather grotesque for other. From the very beginning, Django starts off with blood as gun shots paint a messy shower of red. Yet the madness has only begun, as Shultz takes Django under his wing and helps him develop the killers edge needed to be a bounty hunter. As Django evolves, so too do the kills as the dynamic duo updates not only their arsenal, but techniques as well. The end result of this training are numerous scenes of gun blazing goodness, usually resulting in some sweet kills and bloody bodies. Are you sickened by the description? If so, then skip this movie as the cinematography captures enough detail to make some stomachs turn. Head shots, knees exploding, and a shots in the neck are common scenes in this movie. Some of these kills are not quick though, and the poor victims who suffer usually have some ugly wounds associated with them, some of which involve a person being torn apart or tortured. For me extreme gore isn't my cup of tea, as violence doesn't always have to mean a river of blood to follow. Despite the messiness though, Tarantino does still provide some other entertaining qualities that somewhat made up for the weaknesses. His choice of actors was well selected as both Foxx and Waltz work well together as the bounty hunter duo, each balancing out the other's character weaknesses. Waltz in particular uses his charm to not only swoon the various extras, but also as a tool to make his lines even funnier as he adds a pompous atmosphere to the conversation. Foxx on the other hand sticks more to the rough necked outlaw motif, saying little to his victims before firing the shot, though the little he says is more than enough to get a few chuckles out of the cast. Washington is just as lovely as ever, but doesn't get to do much other than scream and cry. While she can play a damsel in distress very well, this character was a little lacking compared to some of her other work. As for Jackson, his character is both fun and malicious. Jackson's overacted rants and cascade of stereotypical insults were hilarious to me for the most part, yet his character too sometimes overstepped the appropriate boundaries. As for DiCaprio, well the man is still on top of his game. Stepping out of the somber detective role, Leo's portrayal of the pompous plantation owner is incredibly captured in every detail from the rich debonair look to the heavy southern accent. The strongest aspect to his character is the viciousness he has to develop throughout the course of the movie, which starts with simple enjoyment at a blood sport, but turns into an anger that can't be controlled. Yet like many movies, Django does have its faults. For one thing the editing and filming require a little more polish to meet the qualities of his other films. Various settings don't match up with the areas they are supposed to be in, for example a rocky outcropping in the state of Tennessee, or a dried up wasteland for Mississippi. The grainy nature of the film is also a little harder to enjoy, though it may have been used to help develop and depth to the Western world. Pushing past the editing, the time limit of the movie was a little hard to deal with at times. While the pace of the movie was rather quick for the most part, there were a few times where I felt the scenes were pointless or overdone. The end of the movie in particular could have been modified to deliver the same entertainment in a fraction of the time. What may have contributed to some of these 'slower' parts was the episodic element this tale seemed to have. Instead of having a nice linear plot with twists and turns, Tarantino sort of divided the story into 3-4 tales some of which lasted for minutes before the plot was just dropped. Perhaps it was just a means for introducing more satire and laughs, or just another excuse to add more gore, but some of these short stories could have been replaced with something to make the story deeper. Yet my biggest weakness was the uber amount of crudeness, Tarantino put in this film. I know that he designs this movie without a care to criticism, but his rebellious nature was a little out of hand this time. In particular the bloody savageness and filthy language were excessively overused to the point where it was no longer enjoyable, but annoying, despite the cultural relevance to the time period being portrayed.Django was a fun movie to watch, but it still has some flaws that need to be tweaked. Perhaps when the movie comes out on DVD the editing can hammer some things out. While it is not his best work, it's still enjoyable and will please any fan of his work. Just make sure to exercise caution when planning to take younger audience members to see it, as the crudeness factor has stepped up a bit.",7,7,21,26 December 2012
Get Out," Should You Get Out and See This Film?
","Another February weekend, another time for a horror movie to hit the silver screen. Tonight, my review is on Get Out, a simplistically titled tale that is from the mind of Key & Peele's Jordan Peele! How well does a film directed/written by a comedian fare, as always, it's my job to share some thoughts, insights, and opinions on the latest film. So, stay in, grab a drink and read my thoughts on this 'epic' film. LIKES: Â• Good Central Character Â• Comedic Relief Â• Well-Paced Â• Decent StorySummary: It's always good to have a character you can grip onto if you are going to watch them face the nightmares of this film. Chris is one of those protagonists that fulfills that role containing all the elements you want in a character: backstory, level headed decisions, not annoying, etc. Daniel Kaluuya is certainly one of the better horror genre actors, and portrays his role in a manner that doesn't want to make you roll your eyes, outside some emotional flatness the team made him portray. Yet the other actor to steal the show (not based on looks) was LilRel Howery as Rod the TSA. Rod's scenes are purely comedic, serving to relieve the tension the movie builds up and keeping it decently integrated into the story. These scenes, in addition to lightening the mood, keep the pace of the movie flowing to avoid that prolonged dragging feeling that many horror films seem to have. Such a pace kept the film interesting to me by keeping the suspense at a maximum. Perhaps the biggest strength to me, is that Get Out has a decent story laced with some originality. While not the scariest tale to hit the screen, this film has some hot topics built into the story (primarily racism and its wrongdoings) that go alongside the character building moments of the story. In addition, there is a nice twist to the tale, which may please many fans of this genre. DISLIKES Â• High Political Points Â• Unnecessary Scenes Â• Not scary Â• The ending being a little too easySummary: While Peele's writing is certainly impressive, tasteful, and clever at times, it also falls victim to being overly political for me at times. Get Out has many scenes were the extras throw the multiple judgmental stares, the rude, overstep their boundaries with too personal (and insulting) questions, or out of the way monologues about skin color that were more eye-rolling than necessary. It's not that I don't believe this issue exists, I just grow tired of directors deviating from the cleverness and pace of the story to make a point in these movies. Another unnecessary deviation was some of the comedic relief moments. Don't get me wrong, Rod's comedic relief was very welcome and had some of the best dialogue presentation of the film. However, there were moments where his scenes felt out of place, randomly thrown in there where they felt more like an SNL intermission than being pertinent to the story. Guess a comedian can't fully drop his roots. His comedic background may also be the reason this movie wasn't too scary either. Again, Peele has done the genre justice in terms of making a thriller with a decent plot that has some substance to it. But this movie failed to scare me at any point of the film, outside of maybe a few creepy stares from the brother or other staff. I think Peele tried to make it creepier from the realism aspect, but outside of that the jump scares were poor, the extras presentation was more annoying than scary, and the theme of the movie takes a different twist. Finally, when the movie reaches its exciting climax, Peele's writing definitely leaves you feeling fulfilled on many levels. However, much of that ending seems to be a little too conventional that takes away from what he built. Things happen in random succession and there are a few moments where logic (and realism) are dropped like so many hot potatoes it again becomes more humorous than fun. The Verdict:Despite my doubts, Get Out is a movie that stands out (in a good way) from many of the horror movies unleashed in the last few years. I always find value in a film has a good central character that has development and a well-paced, intriguing story to support it. In addition, while the comedy does have its out of place moments, the comedy is also a welcome diversion to make you laugh, fortunately in a manner that isn't overly stupid. However, if you are looking for a movie that will haunt your dreams and make you jump, this isn't the movie for you. Whether it is the lack of scare tactics or the overly political moments, Get Out's horror aspect is highly diluted in this film, feeling more like a mystery than anything else. Worth a trip to the theater? I'm on the fence about this one, but I have to say wait on this one until it hits home in a few months.

Aladdin," A Carpet Ride Into A Rushed, Familiar, World
","Disney cartoons in the 90s were the stuff of magic, and the foundation of my love for their movies. The animated adventures and their accompanying soundtracks were able to permanently embed themselves in my mind, heart and soul defining what Walt's imagination established years ago. Then came the live action versions and things started getting mixed up in the modern day of representation, realism, and trying to spin these tales in a way of being new/yet familiar. There have been plenty of ups and downs, but they have found their place and tonight they try another milestone with big shoes, or in this case sandals/moccasins to fill. Can it work?

Let's put it out there, Aladdin cartoons have set much up for quality in many ways, and yours truly is a big fan of it. Yet this spin on it managed in a way to accomplish the goal of appeasing many audience members. Guy Ritchie's take on it holds the core story with the nostalgia nicely baked in making sure to hit the highlights of each moment with a new visual style. The reimagined world holds nice visual effects and some beautiful attention to detail in the infusion of cultures bringing the beloved cartoon to life and making it semi realistic. Yet, when some people recreated these wonders, the magic of the film is lost to the darker tale and grittier atmosphere, sort of draining the enchantments the cartoon films held. Fortunately, Ritchie and his crew succeeded in keeping the funny and cute moments in tact primarily in the form of clever one liners, Will Smith's take on the genie, and relationship of Abu and Carpet, the former of which you want to adopt. Yet the film also succeeds in bringing those relationships we love to life and somehow putting some new charms to it, to help them stand out. Mena Massoud has the charm, naivety and wonder that Aladdin held to be the adventurous lad. Naomi Scott's voice and strong attitude pave a new Jasmine that will speak to the modern female audience, yet also enchant others. As for Will Smith, he makes the Genie his own character familiar yet also different to not attempt to copy the late William's work. His take was fun, almost like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air meeting Disney and it worked beautifully for me, primarily in the chemistry between him and Massoud (very touching at times). And as for the music, while not quite the same as the 90's songs in terms of energy, some of the tracks have their new spin work out well that is a blend of old and new and having charisma, my favorite being a Whole New World and Friend Like Me. New Songs by Jasmine though might be my favorite though, a new addition that fits well, delivers the messages, and showcases the Scott's wonderful voice.
Yet for all the good there are some things still lacking for me. First the world that they made was not explored enough like the original version, reduced to feeling like a close set instead of the epic kingdom of Agrabah and the Arabian desert. In fact, the movie feels very rushed at times, with the opening ran very quickly, that in no time we are at the cave of wonders instead of the buildup I was expecting. This pace sort of robs the charm of the world and characters, sometimes getting lost in the all the new political moves and new gimmicks in place of the story telling. For me this was especially true for the take on Jafar. In terms of looks, it get realism, and ambitions it is there, but this Jafar did not quite have the devious nature of the traditional villain. That suave, sophisticated and cunning air, was lost to grandiosity and whining rather than that meticulous planning of the wise wizard. And when it came time to fight him, well the anticlimactic moments were lost again to new themes and takes, including the design of his genie form. Much of these limitations came from shoving the political components into the mix that were both endearing and then forced/beaten over the head. The Dream Big Princess movement is alive and while respectable did not feel like it should have been as large a focus. As for the other songs, many of the tracks did not have the same flow, energy, and agreement with the scene like the movie, the new take changing the pace and energy of the scene that did not fit as well with the scene.
Overall, Aladdin's live remake is one of the better ones for me because it tried to accomplish blending nostalgia and yet being different to not compete with the classics. I had fun with this film, loved the relationships and acting between groups, the dynamics with CGI and some of those songs that took me to a whole new world. Yet, the movie just did not explore the Agrabah as much as I wanted, rushing through various moments to not be quite as complete or suspenseful of an adventures that the 90s version held. It's that lack of scenes, songs, and acting all working together that is probably the biggest miss for me, and while not awful, was not to the full extent it could have been. Still, the film is worth a visit and appropriate for most little ones given much of the fear inducing scenes have been removed. Overall my scores are:Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7

A Quiet Place," You won't remain quiet for long
","Horror Movies continue to flood the theaters, each one hoping to stake its claim in the Hollywood world and actually get a decent rating. One such candidate comes out this weekend, with a well-received preshowing, and a festival to support it, this movie holds high potential to accomplish the goal of a good horror movie. Tonight, my second review hopes to bring good news on this movie and promote it for being a horror film that will leave you reeling. Robbie K back again, as he reviews: Title: A Quiet Place
Director:
 John KrasinskiWriters:
 Bryan Woods (screenplay by), Scott Beck Stars:
 Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Millicent Simmonds 
LIKES:Editing: Horror movies miss the mark quite often in this category, usually adding unneeded details to increase the length of the movie. A Quiet Place manages to really tighten this element up, with almost 100% of the movie holding pertinence to the movie's storytelling. The result, is an immersive horror tale that doesn't dive too far down the hokey realm and instead towards the quality thriller tale we've been seeking. Acting: For a movie with few words, the small cast was able to maximize their screen time with their nonverbal acting. Blunt and Krasinski (the actual married couple) play their roles to the T, unleashing all that primitive rage of protecting their offspring from the elements. There is love, passion, and fear all rolled up into the mannerisms and facial acting. As for the kids, again impressive openings as they portray kids stuck in a dangerous wilderness where life hangs in the very balance. The family dynamic reigns strong in this small cast, including all the interpersonal dynamics and drama that comes with a close knit group. Creepy: The movie wins points in the scare department for being a realistic fear factory that delivered on two levels. One is of course the good use of jump scares that had a number of people jumping in their seats, not over utilizing it as many films in this genre do. However, the real chills come from the creepy atmosphere contained within the deadly frontier our world becomes in this reality. The creatures themselves are horrific, mutated abominations that are the stuff of nightmares as these alpha predators hunt our heroes. Even creepier though, is the feeling of isolation and being watch (or heard in this case) by the threat looming out there. That delicate balance brings with it an inherent suspense that will keep you locked up until its all released in one giant flinch/scream depending on the audience member. This energy carries on throughout the whole movie and is more than a welcome factor this genre needed. DISLIKES:A Few Unnecessary Scenes: A small dislike, but there are a few scenes/ideas that didn't pan out for me in the film. Some of these scenes seem to be nothing but an opening for a death or to provide a passing glance of the creatures (which they tease for a lot in the first half of the film). Others, I think try to add a little more tension to the scenario (such as an injured foot), only to not prove pertinent in the long run. The Pregnancy/Baby Dynamic: On the one hand I liked this component because it helped add more to the family dynamic/character building this genre often fails at. Past this symbolism of hope though, the whole dynamic adds a slight cheesy flavor to the tension more so at the speed, ridiculousness, and semi-cringe worthy handling of this factor. I can't say much without ruining the story, but the direction took a steep drop in believability for me when this gravid plot line came into play. Trailers: Given the only 90 minute run time, the other factor that provides enough glimpses to ruin the surprise are the trailers. Depending on how many times you have seen the trailers, you can see the twists have been ruined and the movie become predictable. So be prepared my friends, because the more you watch advertising, the more you have revealed before the movie starts. The VERDICT:  A Quiet Place has accomplished the goal of good storytelling meeting the thrills of a pending game of cat and mouse. The movie has heart, character development and a number of the positives, but nothing is more important is how well the movie manages to ring in terms of tis advertising and how focused they were for a 90 minute scare fest. While those who have seen the trailers a lot may be at risk of a so-so movie, A Quiet Place reigns high in my horror genre and is worth a check out if you have the time/money, all flaws and other thing setc. My scores are: Drama/Horror/Thriller: 8.5

The Bourne Legacy," A New Trilogy Begins
","Another weekend ,another movie and this time I'm reviewing none other than the latest additions to the Bourne series, the Bourne Legacy. Now while I am a fan of the original trilogy, I had my doubts that a fourth installment would be able to fit in with its predecessors. However, the action I've seen in the trailers for the last few months held some promise that the same adrenaline rushing scenes would be in this movie. So is this Matt Damon lacking sequel worth the hype, or should the series have stayed concluded as was promised years ago? I hope to answer that question below. I guess the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the Bourne series is Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Well aside from a few photo ideas, and a brief shot of his gun, there is little to do with the agent who caused so much chaos. Although his actions are the cause for the plot of this movie, the movie instead focuses on Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) an agent who has been deemed one of the best agents in his project. Although he has been complacent in his training and missions, the head of the department and new villain Eric Byer (Edward Norton) has decided to clean up their mistakes by eliminating the other Bourne agents. Cross however, manages to elude his captors and soon becomes the prey of the organization alongside one of his creators Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). Despite what you might be thinking, Cross was a fitting character to enter the series. Like many of his roles, Renner did his homework for this movie and settled into the spy occupation just fine. However, instead of being the elite, stoic, plays by the book agent we saw in Mission Impossible 4 and goes into the rather clever and improvising killer. Renner uses his calm demeanor to ruthlessly execute his victims, which adds a layer of terror and threat to an already dangerous position. The fact that he knows how to deliver his lines with a deep intensity also makes him a little more bad-a$$ than Bourne. Unfortunately the directors decided to also make Cross a drug addict in this movie, so Renner had to practice being a little psychotic dependency as well. Unlike Nicholas Cage's acid trip in Ghost Rider though, Renner happens to act dependent without going overboard. The dependency just makes his mission more urgent and gives his character a weakness to his otherwise superman persona instead of making him do stupid antics that mimic the entire Project X movie. It's a good character development skill, but there could have been other weakness Bourne could have had. As for Weisz, well the actress still has her moves down and still looks stunning in just about every scene with her element withstanding hair. Fans of hers will be happy to see her return in full glory; essentially she is a non-British Evie minus the ancient Egyptian weapons. As for the action of the movie, well there have been some cutbacks in that department. Legacy is a bit slower pace at the beginning focusing on more back story and catch up than actual action. A few shots of Cross' training are interspersed through an opening dialog of readouts, medications, statistics, and of course how deadly Bourne is. The background information that was missing from the first installments was nice to hear as it explained a lot about the political games involved in this project. Even the science made some sense, though a lot of it was Hollywood magic at its finest, but those who don't like the biochemistry jargon and techniques will find it boring. Despite the interesting information though, there was no reason editing couldn't have tightened up the dialog and made some cuts to the two hours and fifteen minute film. You may even find yourself dozing off here or there as you count the minutes until the hunt begins. However once the prolonged introduction is done and the wheels are set into motion, the pace of the film picks up. Cross' skills are even more creative than Bourne's as he uses his superior ingenuity to outsmart his superiors. Those who have seen the trailer may remember the nail trap, but that is just the tip of the iceberg, as Cross has more moves than a DDR dancer. Combine his ingenuity with fast paced kung fu, expert wielding of high powered guns, and a fitting soundtrack to add some depth, and you get some decent action scenes that the world has missed. Perhaps the only thing that could have made the action better was to extend the fight scenes a little longer than they were. What they lacked in fights though they made in chase. Renner and Weisz must have practiced their sprinting techniques for this film since most of the action was involved in navigating streets at top speed. A few of these chases were exciting, most likely due to the use of vehicles and loud instrument music, yet some just felt a little over-dramatic or pointless. I guess when you up the skill level of the enemies, i.e. replacing an army of civilian cops with some elite members of the squad, you have to know your limits. Regardless fans are sure to enjoy Cross's moves and be satisfied with where the series is going. Bourne Legacy is a decent sequel that helps fill in some gaps while opening new uncertainties. The writing staff has some questions to answer in the next film, which there is sure to be, and also needs to do more with what they introduced in this film. Perhaps then my wishes for action scenes will come true, but until then this is satisfying enough. My scores for this film are the following: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5",Null,5,11,10 August 2012
Cars 2," The Name is Mater, Tow Mater
","So yesterday I decided to hit the latest addition to the Pixar Family Cars 2, and see if Pixar could still make a good sequel. I'm happy to say that Pixar has once again crafted a fun, adventurous, and entertaining film that will please a lot of fans of the studio's work. However, I must admit that I was surprised by this movie is the amount of maturity in this film and the fact that it is only rated G, but we'll talk about that later.Cars 2 starts out with a fast and flashy sequence of spy car fun as we watch the skilled spy car Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) infiltrate and oil rig fortress. After some exciting chase scenes, clever use of gadgets, and a catchy spy action tune, McMissile escapes and wonders who in the world can help save the world. Cue Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), as we see the happy go lucky tow truck ride down the road and helping people in that innocent manner that made him famous. As he helps tow a poor broken down car, Mater gives us the back story of what Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has been up to in the past, which mainly involves racing and winning the Piston Cup, now named after the Hudson Hornet from the previous film. By chance McQueen just happens to be in town allowing the tow truck and race car to meet back up, in a brotherly fashion, and embark on their classic adventures we saw in the previous movie. After a few minutes of nostalgia, a couple of glimpses of an upgraded Radiator Springs, and that rekindled relationship between Sally (Bonnie Hunt) and McQueen, Radiator Springs is ditched as McQueen, thanks to the assistance of Mater, accepts the challenge of the international race competition. It doesn't take long for McQueen and Mater to begin their international adventure, starting in Towkyo, Japan. Once they arrive in Japan, Pixar's classic moral story begins to come to fruition as we see a classic friendship face the tests of the judgement of society. While McQueen kind of reverts back into the selfish car obsessed with image and reputation from the first film, Mater still provides us with a bounty of laughs as his stupidity and clumsiness is introduced to the world. Here is where I wish to tell you that Mater is the focus of this movie and fans of Mater will not be disappointed by rust covered country bumpkin car. Whether it is mistaking wasabi for pistachio ice cream, spilling stuff on the floor, or awkwardly participating in conversations he is confused in Mater is still as lovable as the first film. The twist to this film though is more about the spy business integrated into this story and Mater's role in the organization. I was impressed by how Pixar recruited Mater into the organization and how they kept his true identity a secret from McMissile throughout most of the movie. Pixar also made the effort to add another level of detail to the movie by also developing the relationships between Mater and McMissile as well as Ms. Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) the new agent in training. However, this is also a kids' movie and most of the younger audience will not really appreciate the character development Pixar has in this film. Instead the younger generation was more interested in the action and excitement the movie had the offer. Pixar's clever mind has once again found a way to make an idea work as they have brilliantly integrated weapons, martial arts, and gadgets into the car universe. I was impressed by how Pixar kept the scenes interesting and pretty diverse which kept the action and gadget use fun. Mater's idiotic use of gadgets and innocent humor was also well balanced and fun which kept me and the rest of the audience into the movie. This brings me to my next topic: the action has made the movie more mature. I was surprised by the amount of explosions, gun use, and death in this movie. A lot of the darkness, evil plotting, and shooting I felt was a bit too James Bond like for younger audiences and seemed to make this movie shift more towards adults. Also I felt the action in this film took away a lot of the emotional buildup the first movie had, which was one of the aspects I enjoyed most about that film. Although Pixar still had emotional development between Mater and the spy cars, it still was as impacting as McQueen's emotional journey with Radiator Springs. I also was not as impressed with the racing scenes as in the first film. The spy action took a lot of screen time, which resulted in the actual race being replaced with small snippets of high adrenaline, engine roaring, or race car taunting, mainly from John Turturro.Overall Cars 2 is one of the better sequels I have seen in a while and is still as fun and brilliantly shot as its predecessor. The voice work is well placed, the action is fun and exciting, and the comedy is still the same throughout the movie. However, I still miss that emotion between McQueen and the radiator springs crew, especially from Doc and wished they would have put a little more involvement with the rest of radiator springs. Overall I give this movie an 8.0 or 8.5 for that same Pixar magic. I again wish to remind parents that there is a little more maturity in this movie than expected and would probably say this is more of a PG movie than a G. Regardless it's definitely worth seeing, especially for Mater fans, and would even be worth seeing in 3D assuming you don't get sick and are willing to pay the price. Until then keep enjoying the movies!",8,2,5,26 June 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Set Sails For Calmer Waters!
","Avast ye scurvy scoundrels, it be Captain Robbie of the S.S. Review, sailing the seas of the cinema in search of the treasure known as a good movie. Alas, this weekend Admiral Bruckheimer's armada set out on a fifth voyage with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)taking the wheel once more. Will this adventure be smooth sailing and reward us with a crown jewel, or will we be drowned in the sea of sorrow at another hand me down adventure? Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A pirate's life for me, drink up me hardies, sit on your captain's chair and read my thoughts on Pirates of The Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Summary: When it comes to the plot of these movies, one never knows if they'll find gold or mere rocks. The fifth installment is fortunately back on the path to good storytelling, focusing on the characters instead of wellÂ… immortality. Among the number of scallywags, we get some background on about five of the cast, each with a unique angle to help them stand out. While certainly not the best story, it is miles above the mess number four was. The story is a nice component, but the acting is really the aspect that brings the pirate's life to wellÂ…life. Newcomers like Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are a welcome addition that have spunk, class, and a number of other qualities that many will latch onto, (especially the cute factor) and they aren't bad to look at either. Scaring is way into another antagonistic role, Javier Bardem brings his bag of tricks back to the screen, including the suave accent and cantor that oozes evil. Of course the main two you are probably coming to see are Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, the legendary captains we fell in love with in the first movie. Rush is incredible, bringing the sea saltiness and arrogance that is the famous Captain of the Black Pearl. Depp on the other hand is as enigmatic as ever, capturing the goofiness, lackadaisical attitude of Sparrow with a dash of heroic charm. Together, the two actors lead not only the character development, but the comedy. Yes Pirates 5 certainly has the laughs in spades, using every in their arsenal to get a chuckle. I loved the clever word play, idiotic banter, and comedic timing in this movie, which helped relieve the darker aspects of the film. Of course, it wouldn't be a pirate's movie without incredible special effects. Yes Disney and Bruckheimer combined their studios to bring the magic back to the screen. Chaotic maelstroms expand across the vast screen, as ships sail across dead infested waters, firing explosive cannons at the specters that haunt the blue. The journey is certainly beautifully illustrated in a mix of art and excitement, all under the unifying banner of the epic orchestra work we all have come to love. Summary: Alas, despite the jewels that sparkle in the distance, the story still needs some work. With five main stories, each a different motif to quest for the elusive item, the plot gets spread thin and deprived of real sustenance into the character's history. Sure, one of the stories has more bite than the others, but this Pirates took a hit in the rich depth we have come to expect. Therefore, the bland characters were lacking at times and not as strong as I had hoped. Even more bland are the action scenes that they tried to bring to the movie. Don't get me wrong, there are some beautifully animated battlegrounds in the movie, it's just that they lack the same sting I feel in love with. Where were the epic sword fights between two swashbuckling men amidst dangerous landscapes? Where were the notorious ship to ship battles where a well- placed cannonball and evasive maneuver meant the difference between life and death? And where was the suspense and thrills that kept me on edge all those previous installments? I'm not sure, but Pirates 5's action scenes were malnourished forms of battle I loved, with many scenes reduced to pan over shots of extras fighting CGI enhanced ghosts. A few scenes were gaining the potential to be awesome, but comedic relief set in and reduced it to some quick ended scuffle that quickly turned to running. Glad to know our pirates could have run track. And finally, the cameos. While certainly a great tool for nostalgia, most of the cameos were shallow shout outs to the characters we have wondered about. It allows for some neat little tie ups at times, but these less than 5 minutes screen appearances were missed potential. Only Paul McCartney, the legendary beetle, was able to pull off an appearance that was worthy of being includedÂ… well done Paul. VERDICT:Pirates 5 took a step in the right direction with its returned to character driven story, comedic style, and special effects that scream pirates. However, it still has room to improve to get back to the glory of the first film. It's unbalanced at placed, and lacks the excitement of the battles, or an exciting conclusion at all to wrap up the supposed final entry. Seems they wanted more of a comedy than anything else, and one will certainly enjoy the laughs, and most likely the movie, if you go in for the comedy over everything else. Worth a trip to theaters? I'm sure you would still go regardless what I said, but the special effects are certainly worthy of the theater's sound and video. Yet you could still hold off on this film and check it out at RedBox, because this finale sets up the series for yet another installment.

Magic Mike XXL," Straight Up Eye Candy That Lacks So Much
","We all remember that summer three years ago, when that masterpiece of a movie known as Magic Mike gracedÂ… *has to stop writing because he is laughing so hard* I can't even begin to describe the faults with the stripper movie, yet someone thought it was a good idea to make a second one. Yet here I am on the first of July jumping into review the latest woman targeted film, which had plenty flocking to the local theater. Gear up my friends, and get set for another wild reviewing ride from yours truly. As a disclaimer, I'm looking at this movie for quality, not on it's ability to entertain, two terms many seem to group together. Thus, you can bet that Magic Mike 2's quality certainly doesn't bode well in terms of a good film. One more the plot is slop, a culmination of shallow story writing to flimsily support the sequences of shirtless men dancing in numerous settings. The theme of our taleÂ… SEX masked in the constant iteration that it's all about respect and living your dream. I applaud their attempt to put other aspects in the film to develop Mike (Channing Tatum) and his crew's characters, but to me the writers couldn't figure out what path to take so just hastily pasted them into the script. These tangents did nothing more than waste time, as they conveniently provided opportunities for our strippers to show us their talents, while 'helping' out the community in the process. What made the tangents even worse is that there wasn't good dialogue to save the stupid, pointlessness that they were. Many times I expected some kind of romantic banter, or some hot insult that helped sell the 'tension' in the group. Instead, the writers fail again, filling our boys mouths with cheesy innuendos, horrible pick up lines, and a bombardment of F words. Glad to see such talent coming our way for future movies. Most of the time the dialog wasn't funny, and they had Gabriel Iglesias in the film, and he can really dish out some memorable quotes. The excuse of this movie wasn't targeted at being funny is a shallow explanation for two reasons. First, Magic Mike XXL is characterized as a comedy and that usually means laughing. Second what woman doesn't like to laugh? Instead, the team decided to ditch the fluffy man early in the movie, and open up space for Jada Pinkett Smith, and her link to Mike. The acting itself didn't help either, with only Smith, Tatum, and Donald Glover really doing anything I can consider decent, the former of which still surprises me she agreed to this movie. You can see there is a lot of bad to this movie, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't address some of the positives present, despite how limited they are. We know most are going to this film for the gorgeous beefcakes lighting up the stage. You'll be glad to know that Mike and his buddies are back in all their sweaty glory, six packs and all glistening in the lights. Women in my theater were grinding into their seats, making accompanying noises, as the men grinded about the women. The stripper squad will tease female audience members in many ways, some involving syrup, sprinkles, and even stuff at out of 50 shades. Women will scream, giggle, and drool, while men will shake their head, groan is dismay, or like me try to gouge their eyes out. However, past the bumping and grinding, the dance numbers are actually impressive, especially when Tatum busts out his moves and shows some impressive feats of strength. I have to give the design team some props for their creative numbers as well, the choreography quite impressive at times when you see the coordination, before it transforms back to light porn. A music soundtrack helps out as well, all of the numbers capturing the mood and going with the setting. Unfortunately most are hip-hop and rap tracks with a focus on guess whatÂ… SEX, which has become stale for me at this time. Overall, Magic Mike is a bumping, grinding, stripper experience that does its job of being eye candy. It's got moves, it's got tunes, and it's got the sexual hard core drive though with a little more finesse. Fans of the first one are going to most likely enjoy this installment, perhaps to the point of a third installment 'gracing' the screen. The movie lacks in a lot of things though including story, acting, comedy, and class; plus it could have used some major editing to bring down the time limit. No surprise that I can't recommend a theater trip for this one, except for those looking for single minded body thrills and gawking at abs the size of a wall. Factoring in everything, my scores are:Comedy, Drama, Musical: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.5",5,13,37,1 July 2015
Coco," Coco Will Have You Scream Aye yeeeeeeeee
","LIKES: The Animation: Pixar/Disney are the kings of animation, and they have proved themselves again in this CGI masterpiece. Coco's characters are dynamic, presented in so many forms that give the family a spectrum of characters. Despite a majority of the cast looking carbon copied version of skeletons, Pixar managed to inject subtle differences to make primary and secondary characters stand out. The living members also got the anatomy altered as well, going so far to represent all stage of life (i.e. old and senile, young and energetic, and even pregnant). Past designs, the movement itself is incredibly detailed. The subtle gestures in walking/running, the accurate capture of facial gestures for conversation, and more importantly the incredible finger motions of Miguel and cast playing the guitar. A statement of Pixar having incredible attention to detail wasn't kidding, because this thing was gorgeous. Spirit animals: One stand out feature of this movie are the cool spirt animals that inhabit the land of the undead. The flying jaguar, while one of the most outstanding displays, is only the tip of the iceberg, and these creatures are sprawled out in the world. I found it cool to see the creativity of blending common animals into a piÃ±ata like creation, each feature designed to add finesse and flare to mix and represent the culture of Mexico. The Culture: Disney movies always have a way of capturing an element of the real world. Coco's theme is all about the Mexican culture and the various customs that we as viewers only have an inkling of understanding. Pixar managed to bring that culture to life not only in design, but in the story, they have developed in this tale. Their belief in the afterlife is the foundation this tale is built on, allowing other things like soap operas, fiestas, food, and the western film culture. And within all these elements are the important customs of family, the passion of music, and the pursuit of dreams through hard work. All of these are beautifully integrated into the mix, occasionally crossing into cheesy territory, to craft a very stirring tale. The Music: By far the biggest element for me though, has to be the music of Coco. Disney is always spectacular with their soundtracks, but Coco stands out to me as one of the more unique sets of music to come out of the studio. Instead of grandiose symphonies, or Oscar designed symphonies, Coco's music is all about representing the musical culture of Mexico. Each song builds around the acoustic guitar as the primary instrument in its calm, yet vibrant strings. Such a simple instrument packs an emotional kick, especially once the supporting instruments and the voice bellow out to unleash the pent-up emotion of our characters. The songs build into the story, and are used as the primary tools for accomplishing Miguel's goals and represents a variety of artistic styles this culture has. It's dynamic, it's fun, and its relevant to the story, all big points in this reviewer's eyes. DISLIKES:The opening short: While separate, the opening number is still part of the show. Olaf's frozen adventure, while cute, was just another compilation of short songs to refresh Disney's cash cow for the last few years. Sure, some of the songs are powerful (the ending in particular), and the message tugs at my strings, but it lacked a lot of sustenance for just more songs. Thank goodness Coco's music redeemed this quality. More with the creatures: I like the spirit animals, I just didn't like how much of a background they were. With such cool concepts, you think that Disney would have found a way to capitalize on these monsters' involvement in the world whether it be searching for clues, chasing our heroes, or having more bang in the final setting. Even without their integration, the studio downplayed their powers a bit, showing inconsistencies with the potential they developed in these creatures. Lackluster Excitement: Thinking back to Pixar's previous works, there are usually those edge on the seat moments that have you questioning the fate of the heroes (Toy Story, Incredibles, even Cars). Coco not so much for me. The movie stays pretty safe, with predictable antics, calm action scenes, and a final obstacle that didn't do much for me in the suspense role. This film blows the cultural relevance out of the water, yet it still missed its potential for a complete package without the action. Many Book of Life elements: This movie stands out on its own in so many concepts and the songs are much more original. Yet, there is a lot of this movie based off of Book of Life, and in many cases less vibrant and unique than the predecessor. In my opinion, I felt the Book of Life was the more exciting of the two tales and I like this design more than the scale this one took. Still, Coco holds a lot of finesse that the Book failed to have. The VERDICT: Coco is certainly one of the more culturally relevant Pixar movies to come out of the studio. It's design and animation are gorgeous, the creativity is on point, and so much of it is packed with tasteful portrayals of this beautiful culture. Yet, it still has a few shortcomings for me to make it a perfect movie. They dropped some of the potential they built up and the excitement element could have been amped up with more struggles as well. When all is said and done though, Coco is by far one of the better films to hit the theaters this November and I strongly encourage many to flood the theaters and scope it out. And for those with little ones obsessed with Frozen, this movie is only going to be better for them. My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5",9,4,21,21 November 2017

A Little Dense
SUMMARY:When it comes to a focus on British history and acting, there is always class injected into the presentation of the movie. In this war movie, that same focus has been curtailed to present the familiar concept of war into a new light. For one thing, this movie is much more about the acting compared to other battle ballads. Chapman and MacKay are fantastic in bringing the young cadets lives to bay, acting as the mirror to Britain's involvement in the war. The turmoil, the dedication, the friendship, and even the courage to face potential death are portrayed beautifully to cover the wide range of emotions involved with serving in the first great war. While we have seen great performances bringing out the nightmare that is war though, 1917 manages to bring a new way of telling the story through the frontier itself. The harsh landscapes, destroyed villages, and lighting are all coordinated to provide the true menace of the war and that beast is often scarier than the fighting itself. Like a Quiet Place, it's the silent nature of the vast landscape that adds the true emotional tensions. And as it all progresses the movie continues to show that artistic approach of capturing all the deep messages, emotion, and angles that come with war. I can't say much to minimize spoilers, but let's just say the mission to deliver the messages changes face and approach various times to display one of the most dynamic approaches to war theater dramas. This even bleeds over into the few fights that show up, trading the flashy Michael Bay sequences for simpler battles that rely on strategy, timing, and fewer shots. It may not be the most jaw dropping battles to date, but it fits so well into the presentation that it adds to that deadliness this film is showing. Finally, the real star is the cinematography. The specials did not lie, the movie is shot beautifully, an almost seemingly continuous shot that immerses you into the experience. You will feel a part of the brigade to deliver the message, and as a result you'll get the full amount of terror, intensity, and other components that they directors wanted, and it's all done with stable camerawork.Yet, this opera also has a few things that did not quite work for me, that while not worth too many point deductions was worth mentioning. First it's not for the faint of heart, as the saying of war is hell is true, those with weak stomach may not handle a few things that are displayed. I can't say much, but just picture the worst part of war and get yourself prepared, a few of which were a little too drawn out for my tastes. Past that warning though, the action junkie in me wanted a little more bang for the buck. I get the realistic approach they were taking, but a little more combat and coordination would have helped spice some things up for me and get the pace moving. While artistic and realistic, I can't lie that the movie is rather dense, relying so much on visuals that it leads to a slower paced war tale. Again, this keeps in time with the artistic nature, but there were some slower parts that had me battling to remain conscious. And when the movie hits about the middle of the film, the dynamic they take sort of uproots what the trailers promised. It's not a bad twist at all and really captivates on the experience of war, but it's just not what I had intended to see.The VERDICT:The rumors about this movie are true, it's an amazing display of war visualization that was able to break free from the traditional war story movie. British acting alongside award winning cinematography are the key components for this film, setting the screen for that wild war frontier where emotions run wilder than the bullets from guns. True, I would have liked a little more war sequences and excitement, and I could have done with a little less dense dialogue, but overall it's a solid movie and worthy of the praise. Again, not for the faint of heart at times, but this reviewer encourages to catch this one in theaters when you can.My scores are:Drama/War: 9.0

Big Hero 6," Big Hero Sick!!!!! Great Action, Emotion and Comedy for all
","The beginning of November usually means a few things, the beginning of Christmas season, lots of food, and of course at least one kids animated movie. This weekend opens up the season with another work by Disney Animation Studios, or Pixar's rival to some. With the gold mine that was their last movie, Frozen, the cavalcade of animators have once again churned out another animated feature that looks to be fun. Yet can it match the success of their last film? As always read on. The tale of Big Hero 6 is about a boy named Hiro (Ryan Potter), a kid with a knack for robotics. Through the encouragement of his brother, Hiro is inspired to pursue higher education of robotic design and change the modern world. Unfortunately, an accident though, turns Hiro's world upside down, with only memories and his brother's creation Bay Max (Scott Adsit) to help him carry on. However, a new threat surrounding one of Hiro's projects rises from the shadows, and only the dynamic duo can uncover the secrets at hand. So what did I think of the film? I'll start by saying this reviewer loved the film more than Frozen. Yes I know I'm probably shouting blasphemy, but let me explain why. It starts with the story. Big Hero 6 has many of the familiar elements that we love in a Disney film. Hiro's story starts out exciting from the get go, throwing pizazz and excitement into the mix early to grab your attention. But it doesn't stop there, as this story, like any good story, changes up things when you start getting comfortable. Audiences will get to see Hiro's world change as one event happens that completely changes the dynamic of the movie, yet keeps things grounded. Mystery, drama, character development, and more are all built into this tale, intricately weaved to help bring the characters to life without going into too much detail. You might be saying Frozen had that too? Yes, but what's different between these two movies is that Frozen built it's story around a soundtrack and sped through some valuable qualities. Big Hero 6 doesn't do this, and focuses more on the story, with the soundtrack supporting the film during its montage moments. What I liked even more is that Big Hero 6 had a great character development as well, which remained throughout the whole movie and wasn't lost. Let's get off the plot though and talk about some other things this movie has to offer. For one thing the film has plenty of excitement. Hiro and the gang get into some thrilling situations that are packed with high adrenaline. Car chases, fights against technological baddies, and infiltration into quarantined zones are just some examples of what you get to see. Now just because there is action doesn't mean you get ninja warriors beheading their foes, or guns lighting up the city. No, Big Hero 6 has more family friendly action that has some impressive moves that will thrill all ages. What's even better is the creativity in their technology, cleverly designed to integrate science, fun, and technology into one package. Kids will get a little education, albeit a little stretched,, in science that shows how cool physics and chemistry can be. Geeks like me will appreciate each characters design, and the masses will appreciate the animation this movie has to offer. I just wished these scenes were longer and had a little more diversity to them instead of the repetitive moves. However, the big thing kids will remember is the comedy of the movie. Big Hero 6 is full of moments that the younger audience members and I found hysterical. Juvenile actions like letting out air, klutzy stumbles into buildings, and well timed screams had me laughing. Of course being Disney, you can expect some clever dialogue and a few antics that will surely be repeated a thousand times by the population. In particular the fist bump joke and low battery comedy were my favorites, the latter being a cute way to integrate some adult drunk humor into the mix with some good voice work to boot. Yes some of the jokes are repetitive and simplistic, but the timing and delivery are well enough that it makes up for the limitations. To tell you the truth, it's actually the voice work that really makes most of the humor and emotions come to life in this movie. Okay let's wrap this up. Big Hero 6 was a great adventure that is entertaining for all ages. The story is balanced, with an ever-changing story, emotional character development, and action to keep things exciting for you. Yes it lacks the original songs that Frozen did, but the story and creativity in this film more than make up for the lack of top of the chart tunes. Is it worth a trip to the theater? You better believe it as this movie has all the bells and whistles for the silver screen, and has a story to support it as well. So if you are looking for a movie that all can enjoy, get on down and catch this treasure before it leaves.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force is Mixed With This One
","Well it's finally here! The epic movie that television has bombarded us with for the last three months has finally appeared from light speed to grace us with another epic installment, or so we hope. Episode 8 has held the promise of the return of story telling, matching the epic lore of the originals told to hopefully breathe life in a series that has struggled. Rumors even say it surpasses Empire Strikes Back, the movie that holds the throne of Star Wars quality. Can this be true? Has the Force grown strong once more? Robbie K here to shed light on the rumors and hopefully provide some wisdom. Get Started, Let's!LIKES:The Cinematography: My wise friends stated right off that this movie may be the best filmed of the bunch. The Last Jedi is a beautiful example of camera work meeting state of the art technology, helping bring the world to life with spectacular visuals. The various angles keep you engrossed in all the details, and paints a very dynamic battleground to which our cast fights in. And unlike episode 7, the sound score is back to Williams' creative work, a blend of old and new that fits into the scene and adds the life to an already vibrant setting. The Acting: A large cast of characters, requires acting to bring them to life, and the Last Jedi has recruited a phenomenal crew to accomplish this goal. I can't go into great details, but here we go. Mark Hamill brings the fire back into Luke Skywalker with both classic and old Luke style clashing into a complex character. Daisy Ridley takes the simplistic Rey from last time and unleashes her character in full 'force' expanding her into a fantastic character that is full of spunk. Carrie Fisher another victory when on screen, that has the vim and vigor of the wizened princess we loved. Newcomers Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran were welcomed additions to the cast. Dern's chameleon like abilities continue to craft respectable and honorable characters that fit well in Leia's legacy, with a nice edge to keep things tense. Tran on the other hand is the hopeful character, that has nice delivery of inspirational dialogue, with a dab of rebellion on the side. Everyone worked quite well and I wish I had more time to compliment everyone, but trust me it's good. The Comedy: A nice quality to have, the comedy in this movie is a nice relief to the darker atmosphere on this side of the galaxy. The Last Jedi's writing is a combination of good timing and wit, that beats in time with all the characters. The ever changing ploys also keeps things fun to watch and had my mentor and I guffawing through much of the movie. The Storytelling: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the Last Jedi is the presentation in terms of plot in this movie. Director Rian Johnson dug deep into the lore and ignited it in full form in installment eight, bringing with it rich details that answered much of our questions. Much of the tale is character development, pushing them hard to expand upon their hastened roles of seven into more complete soldiers to partake this journey with. The three tales were balanced quite well, spaced out to keep things relevant and each connecting to the big plot as a whole, much like the classic tales were in. These tales are not only adventurous, but filled with strong lessons that this series is famous for preaching. And yet the biggest part of this I like are the twists integrated in this film. Many surprises lie in store for this movie, and many of them fit nicely to take the story deeper down the dark hole. These surprises are perhaps the most engaging parts of the movie, the likes of which weren't expected much like Empire. DISLIKES:Salvaged Plots: Despite the strengths I have mentioned in the plot, this modern trilogy still has issues with being too close to the classic series. A blend of episodes five and six, much of this film is a retelling of those classic arcs that is a little disappointing on their dependence to the old and not trying out new elements. At least it is executed, well right?Unnecessary Tangent: One of the story points almost didn't feel needed, or at least one section of the tangent wasn't that big of a hit for me. The world of Canto Bight makes statements, has a connecting point, and a memorable scene, but this small adventure felt out of place in the grand design. It will bring merchandise opportunities, one of which is a book, but this world didn't hold much value to me outside of a few laughs and some cool beasts. Perhaps a little more struggle, or intensity could have redeemed it for me, though it still isn't too bad for me. Suspension of reality: I get it, it's Star Wars and that is Sci-Fi/Fantasy. Still, there has to be some consistency in regards to how you are going to ignore the physics of real life and the lore that came before. There are moments you will roll your eyes at in terms of the inabilities of the technology, or how uneven the skills seem to develop. While we could ignore these if they were minor, the movie's key situation relied on this suspension and it was a little too big of a stretch for me. The Action: Star Wars is a series that relies on action to pick things up and make add the fire that makes the story shine like the stars. With a rather intense start, Last Jedi had potential, but soon that potential was lost to the void. Much of this movie is dialogue, development, and connections, and with it one of the slower paces of the series. Yes, there were a few moments to help pick up the pace, but much of this was short lives or lacking that laser packing punch I loved in the first installments. Say what you want about the prequels, but they had some incredible fight scenes that livened things up and the Last Jedi really needed this element for me. The VERDICT: The Last Jedi is indeed proof that the universe still has life left in the void of the galaxy Lucas created. It's got emotion! It's got character development! It's got twists! All of this is important in developing characters and making them fly off the screen. Throw in great acting and beautiful cinematography and you have a really, well done film. Yet, this generation still is not escaping the salvaging of the classic plot points, while their unique aspects need a little tweaking in terms of relevance. However, the biggest improvement has got to be the action, working to bring the ship to ship combat back to full strength, and really getting those lightsaber battles back up to snuff. Still, it's a fantastic film to catch in theaters and definitely a worthy installment to Lucas's world. My scores:

Guardians of the Galaxy," Comedy and Decent Action make this worth a trip
","What would you think if you saw a raccoon, a walking tree, a scarred wrestler, a green skinned woman, and a lazy intergalactic thief? To the general public, you would probably think this was the stupidest and most ridiculous idea to be put into your head. However, to those that are fans of comic book lore, it sets you on a path to excitement as Marvel's latest creation is released into the theaters. Yet this late in the summer does the superhero flick still have the same spark, or have we been served a lackluster filler until the next Avengers film releases next year? Read on to find out. Let us start this review with saying that Guardians of the Galaxy will not disappoint. The incredibly fictional team of anthropomorphic aliens brings a lot of diverse aspects to a series that has been rather consistent over the last few years. Stepping away from the heroic images of rock hard abs and blaring percussion music, the protagonists in this film are your run of the mill vagabonds of the galaxy. This fresh hero image is hilarious, and sets the stage for the humor that fills this movie. That's right you heard me, Guardians is filled to the brim with laughs of all kinds using the ridiculous character designs as a foundation to make you scream out in delight. In particular is the raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper), whose wild, enigmatic edge comes out in full force. Rocket is a feisty little cyborg animal, whose pent up rage leaves him with a short fuse that leads to explosions of cursing and well timed insults that are so amusing coming out of a little animal. Cooper does a great job with his voice acting, using the right balance of emotions to give us laughs and yet not overdo it to get annoying. This may also be because of the character design, but the casting made the right call getting the talented man the role of the raccoon. Yet the furry little rodent isn't the only source of humor in this movie, but the rest of the cast provides some other quips and treats. Chris Pratt is the same egotistical idiot he plays so well, though this time trades his mindless, dribbling shouting for some well-written dialog. Zoe Saldana is the femme fatale, whose gorgeous looks guide the group along the adventure. While not the funniest of the bunch, Saldana's acting is spot on, and her character plays off the others to provide some awkward relationships and a few zings that had me chuckle. The large and in charge assassin Drax (Dave Bautista) is surprisingly funny, mostly due to his literal take on every single thing the rest of the crew say. Combine that with well timed execution of his lines and you have a good mixture of fun, though his action scenes are surprisingly lacking and simple. Even Vin Diesel's animated avatar Groot has some laughs, despite saying five words the entire movie. Like an infant, Groot tends to put himself in situations that are harmful, often relying on others to bail him out and apologize with his catch phrase 'I am Groot' that while simple, is again delivered at just the right times. Yet as the adventure continues, the lovable tree alien does many other things that will have you laughing, many of which I don't wish to reveal to avoid ruining the movie. My preceding paragraphs state that this movie has a lot of humor, but what about the action. In truth, Guardians of the Galaxy is not as much hard hitting, fist slamming, mystic weapon slinging that we've seen in the past. No Guardians instead puts a bit less slashing and more laser blasting explosions into the mix, allowing for an adventure that feels like part Marvel, part Star Wars, and part Independence Day. Many movie fans will be picking up references from Star Wars over the course of the movie, with tweaks to the scenes here and there to avoid copyright infringement. While this may lack some originality, the creation team did a nice job balancing the action with the comedy, giving us just enough fighting to quench our thirst before an exciting conclusion. Well exciting for the most part anyway, the ship-to- ship battles were my particular favorite, and the infiltration scene was rather good. Unfortunately some of the epic build up fails and becomes anticlimactic fighting that was merely an attempt to get their money's worth. In particular, the villain Ronan (Lee Pace) was not that threatening, but more so a pompous windbag who merely spoke loud and carried a big stick. Sure he had a menacing glare, but he spoke more than he acted and had little skills in the art of fighting, especially when you compare the size of him to Drax. Maybe that was the point; maybe the lack of edge was to go with the comedic theme of this film. Yet it was still a little disappointing to me, though the ending did make up for it. Despite the lack of seriously threatening villains, Guardians of the Galaxy was well worth the wait. The blend of comedy with action is incredibly entertaining, and the cast of characters bounces their styles off one another to keep you laughing with a well-written dialog. Add in the nostalgia of geeky science fiction and retro movies and you have a fun adventure to fill the superhero gap from this summer. Of course there is some dark and mature themes in this movie, especially with some of the cursing, but this movie should be okay for kids as well. So go have some laughs, enjoy the special effects and make sure to stay after the credits for another classic scene. My scores for this flick are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.5",Null,1,4,1 August 2014
Jurassic World," Welcome Back To The World:
","The year is 1993, you go to the theater for Dinosaurs and get the thrill of your life watching humans run from mega sized monsters with the urge to kill. Spielberg's classic Jurassic Park instilled in us a sense of wonder, excitement, and for some of us nightmares as the monsters devoured our cast. Following that, the series hit some rough patches that while visually impressive, lacked the quality the first one did. After a fourteen year hiatus, a fourth installment has finally emerged from the primordial soup to bring us back into the adventure. Tonight I review Jurassic World, so let's jump into the excitement and see if it lives up to hype. Jurassic World reintroduces the park, which has been upgraded with the latest toys of the modern era. This installment brings us back into the excitement of the park, as you become part of the crowd and experiencing the exhibits first hand. Stunning CGI visuals have once more brought the prehistoric monsters to life, animated beautifully to parade about the park. While not as realistic in terms of textures as the animatronic cousins from the 90's, this reviewer was impressed at the detail they put into making Jurassic World pop off the screen. You've seen most of the magic unfold already on the trailers, but trust me that there is still plenty of sights to behold on the big screen. Seeing the Mosasaur leap out of the water, or watching the terrifying Indominus Rex storm across the fields, the terror you felt back in the day returns with it. When combined with the special effects and sound editing, the scenes are even more thrilling and immersive, so much that you forget you are even watching a movie. The visuals aren't the only thing that will have you reminiscing back to the original trilogy though. No my friends there are plenty of tributes paid in Jurassic World that had me smiling in delight. It's obvious the design team went back to the roots to craft this adventure, (finally), and managed to pull some of the best qualities from World's predecessors, such as locations, kills, and plot elements, and put a new twist on them. Most of the twists often have are involve action, exciting moments where the orchestra's melodies booming over speakers as our heroes strive to survive. Yes, you read right, Jurassic World is certainly not boring or slow, with almost the entire two hours thrilling in some aspect. And believe it or not the filming and editing itself is on target as well. Camera work is stable, all details captured to maximize the carnage and chaos of the digital images while also capturing the emotions of our group. While most of the movie is action, don't think that is the only thing you will get in this movie. Amidst the excitement are plenty of touching, emotionally heavy moments that are sure to move you in some way. Some of the scenes involving the dinosaurs and Chris Pratt's character had me almost tearing up, while other times I rolled my eyes at the preachy messages they painstakingly made. Fortunately there is humor thrown into the mix that had me laughing more times than not. Most of the comedy was intentional, some of the dialog timed at just the right moment to break the tension. Some of the jokes were a little pushed on me, but I must say that overall it works, especially with Pratt leading the group in his dynamic ways. The emotional spectrum is well done in this film, and goes back to all the aspects of the first one you love. Like always though there are some pieces to this movie that aren't all there. First off the build up in the park wasn't there for me in the film. Normally there is an epic buildup to the inevitable dinosaur busting out to hunt, but this film didn't have quite that much thrill that I was looking for. Things progressed too fast before the crap hit the fan, it did leave me a little disappointed. That minor point aside there are times where the ridiculousness of Jurassic World gets stretched a bit much, and no I don't mean the raptor training bit that actually worked. Sure this is a movie where dinosaurs are no longer extinct, but there are a few moments that are a little too stretched or hard to swallow, but again this is a minor moment. The major weakness to this movie is how predictable it is. World's plot writing team really laid out the plot of this movie in the first half hour such as: who would die, how they would die, and how the problem would resolve itself. Thus you can guess I wasn't too terrified or surprised by most of the moments in this movie, though there were some nice surprises. I don't think this will be a problem for most, but this reviewer has to dock some points for this weakness. Jurassic Word is on point as my friend would say, and is a great reintroduction into Crichton's world. That excitement you felt visiting the park returns once more, and despite the lack of suspense build up, the tale has a much better story than I expected. It certainly is one of the Action/Adventure movies I've seen in a while, and the visual effects are certainly worthy of a big screen visit. Do you see it in 3-D? I can't answer what it did for the movie, but the 2-D movie was certainly great. So my recommendation is go see it soon.

The Adjustment Bureau," Message in a movie
","Review for Adjustment Bureau On Saturday March 5, 2011 I decided to do a double movie day and see two promising blockbusters. The first on my list was the adjustment bureau, a drama I thought would be a mixture of the matrix, inceptions, and a little bit of titanic drama. In a sense that is what it is, but favored more of the romantic tale than anything else. The movie opens up with an intro to Matt Damon's life up to this point, which is done in a similar manner to most political based movies. After the intro, the movie starts off a little slow, but the plot is intriguing as the men in hats begin talking about plans and looking at their agendas. Questions like what's in the book, what is the importance to the matter, and why him are running through the brain and you wonder what is specific about a few agents. Eventually things get suspenseful and focused, but it all revolves around the romance between Matt Damon and the girl. Within the suspense lies constant situational comedy that keeps you laughing at the challenge Matt Damon provides the bureau. The peak of suspense is reached towards the end of the movie in my opinion, when we see Matt Damon take action. So what are the high points of this movie? The first is the message that this movie brings about the challenges one can face when it comes to being in love. It's funny how many times love can blind people and result in nothing more than turmoil, anger, and misery. In this movie, Matt Damonis willing to do anything for the woman he loves, and makes decisions for her good. Their bond and relationship is constantly tested with things most relationships never have to face, and still they make sacrifices to be together. I know it's a movie, but still when one looks at the love they share, you can't help but feel empowered to make your relationship work. A second message is about how life cannot be planned and requires one to take risks and carve a path of their own. This doesn't mean you should go out and break the law, destroy property, or do something radical, but instead shows that life really can't be planned out. Constant challenges will change the best laid out plans and the truth is you have to take a few risks and go down some uncertainties before you arrive at a life you will be happy about. It's scary and hard, just as portrayed in this movie, but with determination and courage you can overcome those challenges. Yet the challenge can be easier when you have a friend as loyal as the character Harry. People who will stick by you through and through, willing to sacrifice their own careers and reputations to help do something that is right, is a crucial factor that can help success come easier. The various scenes with Harry's conscience and his determination to either help or hurt is something I could relate to with my everyday life. Choices will come and challenge you're plans, but in the end you must do what is right for not only yourself but for other people as well. That's the message this movie conveys. Outside of that the acting is good, the pace mostly moderate with a few slow parts here and there. The story is good, and as I have already stated there are strong messages that can be learned if one keeps an open mind to the movie. Okay so what's bad or iffy about the movie? For one thing it's predictable from the foreshadowing that they do early on. You will see constant signs and hear constant messages that will tell you what is coming up. There are not really any big surprises that jump out at you except for a few scenes that can make you jump if you're the kind that startles easily. The next thing is that there is a strong religious theme in this movie that may or may not offend you. I'm not going to reveal much, but the movie can possibly suggest things of tyranny, cruelty, and mistakes in plans and that might get underneath some skins in the audience. One must again be careful and make sure that the messages I got are not misinterpreted to lead to total anarchy and disregard to rules or plans. Still some may be disappointed with the ending of the movie, thinking it's too rushed or too chopped up. Overall though I really enjoyed the movie and got a big lesson out of it. It's suspense makes it fun, its plot predictable yet enjoyable, the acting superb, and the pace just right for this kind of movie. Normally love stories bore me, but this one did not. In my opinion audiences who will like this movie are the following: Huge Matt Damon fans, romance and suspense lovers, and anybody who is looking for a quick film. Fans who will not like this: action lovers, chick flick comedy lovers, science fiction fans, or anybody who thinks it looks like Inception or the Matrix. Overall I give this movie an 8 or 8.5, and hopefully this review helps.",8,3,5,5 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," Was it as strong of a hangover?
","Was it as hard of a hangover?Memorial Day weekend opened up with a bang yesterday as Kung Fu Panda 2 and The Hangover Part 2 opened up. It seems that this weekend was destined to be sequel weekend and I'm here to discuss one of the sequels and whether it's worth your valuable time. The Hangover Part II fits the formula that its predecessor did two years ago. Despite the pact that is made early on in the movie by Stu (Ed Helms), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) , the guys get drunk on alcohol, wake up in a hotel, and start their journey off to find the missing friend, the bride to be's brother Teddy (Mason Lee) whose finger is currently the only clue they have to the mystery. One phone call later from Doug (Justin Bartha) and the gang hit the Bangkok streets in search for the answers they so desperately seek. So the question is, was this movie worth it? Is the same plot and different location worth $8-$10 of your hard earned money and nearly two hours of your valuable vacation time? To help you make this decision let's cover some facts about this movie. First of all the movie is raunchier than the first installment of the film, especially a particular scene where transvestites and a night club are involved. The graphic depictions of police rioting, coke snorting, and the male genitalia are constantly thrown into your face throughout the entire movie, which depending on your humor can be a good or a bad thing. This graphicness even carries on to the credits, which provides a lot of information that the movie itself does not provides, and some of the pictures can be a little extreme, even for this movie. Constantly interspersed throughout the chaos of this movie, is Stu's constant whining, Phil's constant use of the F word and Alan's random comedy lines. The first two aspects are funny to a point, but quickly get annoying and predictable. Alan's contribution is kind of a 50:50 mix of funny and annoying for me. There are points in the movie where his one liners and actions are perfectly timed which made me laugh, or at least chuckle, during the movie. Yet there were times where I felt the movie centered too much on his comedy, and his lines were stale and annoying. As for the situations they were put in, I wasn't as surprised, shocked, or entertained as I was in Vegas. Most of the scenes were incredibly predictable and didn't seem as dire or extreme as what we saw in Vegas. With the exception of the nightclub, most of the places they visited were not really that exotic or scary, which left me somewhat bored throughout the movie. In fact if it were not for the monkey or Mr. Chow, then I believe this movie would have been absolutely dead. This brings me to my next point, fans of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) will not be disappointed, as the maniacal, lack of morals, outspoken, Asian gangster is back. The stand-up comedian returns in all of his glory as his obnoxious voice fills the screen for probably a good thirty minutes of the movie. Mr. Chow makes a good portion of the plot and even when he is 'chilling' somewhere off screen his actions are driving the plot. Yes if you thought the comedian was bad news in the first movie, then you have seen nothing compared to this film. Overall Hangover Part II is a diluted version of the first movie. The potential for the experience in Bangkok was just not reached, and it felt like this movie was somewhat rushed in the past two years. Again the acting is fine, and the comedy feels sort of the same, but it seems to me that this sequel could use a revamp. Despite some witty comedy and a very adorable and crafty monkey, this movie really did not deliver to the expectations I had for this movie. Thus my Robbie rating for this movie is about a 7.0 for this sequel. Intended audiences for this movie will include: Die Hard fans of the series, Bradley Cooper or Zach Galifianakis fans, people who like cute monkeys, and fans who like a lot of Oriental Humor. Avoiding audiences: People who are taking 8 year old to the movies, yes I saw a dad bring his son to the movie, people who are easily offended, and those who don't want to see genitalia on screen Until next time, this is rgkarim signing off.",7,0,4,27 May 2011
Logan," Three Slashes For Wolverine! Slash, Slash, Slash HOORAY
","The X-men series is a story that on many levels is close to my heart in the form of comics, games, and the 90s animated TV show. In the movieverse though, there have been some triumphic downfalls and surprising successes in Fox studios' telling of the mutant force. This weekend, Logan attempts to breathe life back into the series, with what looks to be a different take on the hero genre. What's the verdict? Unless you have clairvoyance as a super power, you are going to have to read to find out. LIKES: Â• Fresh Twist Â• Comedic Relief Â• Strong Character Development Â• Strong Villain Â• Action we Really WantedSummary: Fox seems to have realized that twists can be a good thing (Deadpool) and have decided to integrate the anti-hero switch-up into the mix. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) journey dives into the darker corners of the X-Men world, to a place where allies are few and hope is practically nil. This more forlorn setting opened up avenues for greater storytelling, primarily in developing Logan as a character (which seems to have been the goal for most of the X-men movies). One will get to dive into his inner character, facing the specters that haunt the supposedly invincible Wolverine from media past. It is in this regard that X-Men finally got the villain quality right in regards to Logan being his own worst enemy. Logan's inner doubt is perhaps one of the strongest villains this universe has known, and provides a constant challenge to the development and well-being of not just him, but the other characters of the film. And it is thanks to this that Logan has a lot more emotion packed in than other superhero films have had in the past. To my surprise, Logan has a nice balance of comedy to relieve the darker moments, timing most jokes perfectly to emphasize the simple dialogue. Biggest relief from the 'darkness' though comes in the form of the action, which finally delivers the promised fights we've been waiting for. That five-minute clip in Apocalypse was a sample of the high-adrenaline fights in this movie. Logan traded flashy CGI light shows for a choreographed chaos that involved blending martial arts with classic Wolverine claws. The intense dances of death, mixed with the exciting score and sound effects, will make up for much of the lackluster fights of the past and match the expectations are imaginations set all those comic books ago. And while I wanted more action (because I always do), Logan does a nice job spacing the fights out to be mostly relevant to the plot of the story. A small side note, I wished there had been a little more diversity to the fights, but it's a small critique. DISLIKES: Â• Boring at Times Â• A Weak Villain Â• Language at times Â• Animal Grunting Â• The Psychic moments Â• Unnecessary Gore?Summary: You're probably laughing at my contradictory statements, but Logan is a movie that is kind of boring at times. Character development takes time, dialogue, and more 'peaceful' moments of not tearing someone's throat out to do right. Unfortunately, Logan's dark atmosphere mixed with these dialogue rich moments can drag at times. Their cross-country journey has more than a few unnecessary sequences, where detailed tangents added little benefit other than a few whimsical jokes or build up to a fight down the road. It's not that these scenes didn't need to be deleted, just shortened to be more relevant (and time efficient). But much like a Western, which this movie feels like, these slower, moral filled moments are the deserts that span between oases. What also didn't help was how the villains in this film were still kind of lame. Inner Logan is deadly, but the ranger with the metal arm and his employer's other 'elite' projects still fall into the lame category. Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) is all bark and little bite, barely doing anything but making threats and occasionally firing a gun, when his more effective lackeys were spent. It's fortunate these bad guy roles are limited, including the mediocre twist to the mix. The other biggest dislike is the unbalanced aggressiveness this film has with it. I know, Wolverine is an aggressive character. Does that mean we have to reduce his normally clever dialogue with an unhindered use of the F word? Apparently in this film it did, and the lazy dependence on the cursing still remains a tiresome ploy for me. In addition, this film really dipped into the animal grunting and roaring of not only Logan, but Laura (Dafne Keen) as the two continuously (and at times annoyingly) scream. Also overdone were some of the aggressive psychic moments that became drawn out sequences of torture that is both fulfilling and unnecessary at the same time. And as for the violence, Logan steps this game up (which is why the fights rock), but the level of gore involved has been upped as well. Those thinking of taking younger audience members need to note the R rating, because you'll be subjected to maiming, decapitation, and other blood filled moments that for me really didn't need to be to that level. The Verdict:Logan is an improvement over many of the X-men films in regards to storytelling, action, and character development. Yet it's failings for me come in the form of some editing quirks, unbalanced dialogue, and overly aggressive gore. It matches the themes of the modern graphic novels, but I felt with some balancing the movie could have been even better. I feel the movie is worth a trip to the theater though, but please think twice before taking kids to see it. My scores: Action/Drama/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",Null,0,3,4 March 2017
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Fifth Time's The Charm
","Hello, Hello all, I'm here with another movie review. This time I'm covering the latest in the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2, and I hope to shed some light on the final episode of the series. Now you've seen plenty of debate in this series with many hating everything about this series, while others think it's the best vampire series to ever exist. With all the bias towards this series, it may be hard to determine whether this movie is worth spending time in the theater or should just be blown off. Let's see if I can shed some light on the subject.With last year's rather over-hyped prequel, I'll admit I wasn't looking forward to the second installment of Breaking Dawn. Although the trailers showed some interesting direction, I had my doubts that they could actually do something to extend the last few pages of the book. However, the directing team was able to accomplish their goal, in what may be the most impressive movie yet to hit the series. Just what makes this movie so great though. My first strength was the dialog. While most of the movies lines are overemotional, lovey dovey, one dimensional quotes from the book that made me roll my eyes, this one was a little different. I found this installment to have more balance still sticking to some of the classic lines, but throwing in some well-timed comedy. The insults and banter between Jacob and the vampires were quite entertaining to the audience and me, and I thought some of the extra characters even had some funny moments with the parts they played. Charlie (Billy Burke) in particular had me laughing the most, with his awkward comedy and real facial gestures combining to be very funny. Aside from the comedy, the movie did have some good dialog play on other parts, particularly when it involved making plans involving the Cullen's battle against all odds. Of course being Twilight, this movie also had its share of romantic dialog, many being lines quote from the book, which should comfort die-hard fans of the series. While some of the romance was captured in these mooshy quotes, some of it still made me laugh or roll my eyes at the cheesiness that still remains. Aside from the dialog what else was good about this movie? I guess my next biggest thing is the balance this movie has. While this Twilight still has that romantic feel that will have fans crying awe, this film had other things to keep the movie going. For one thing there was some suspense to the movie, as all the behind the scenes of the book were brought to life on screen. The Vultori's movements, the attempt to control hunger, and even the training scenes were all well shot to keep the suspense building. Between these scenes, fans are certain to enjoy the love dynamic not only between Edward and Bella (which includes a seven minute love scene), but spread amongst the other members of the family, especially Renessmee. I felt that there was actually a family dynamic between the Cullen's this time instead of them all just being in the same room and just hugging each other's mate and giving that Abercrombie and Fitch smolder. Throw in the extra vampire's backstory and loyalty, and well you have quite a story builder that keeps the movie going forward much faster than the other films. Yet there was still another dynamic thrown into the mix that helped bring this movie to a full circle, the action. Now many reviews and commercials are going to say it's the most action packed, which is true, however don't think this means its Cullen slam fest 2012. Most of the 105 minutes stays true to the romantic soup I previously mentioned, but there are a few scenes of fast running and fighting thrown in to pick up the pace. However, the action to mention is the battle at the end, which takes up ten minutes of the film and has plenty of impressive moves that impressed me, and some simple punches that didn't. While the fight is impressive, there are some things that needed some work to make it better, the biggest being some rather spastic camera work during the fight.Still not impressed with the movie? I have a few other points to cover that might change your mind. The soundtrack for this movie was rather good, with many of the musical scores fitting the scenes' emotions perfectly. As for the acting, well it has somewhat improved, but still remains the same model poster, cardboard acting that has made the series famous. Kristen Stewart continues showing her unemotional acting skills off delivering most of her lines in that awkward monotone way, and fails in her attempts to be angry, which is rather funny. However, most people going in know the acting isn't the best, but go for the looks of the characters. Yes, my fans there are still plenty of hot body scenes to go around, as both Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are still present. Unfortunately for you girls, Lautner keeps his tight shirts on for most of the movie so you might be disappointed in that aspect. Guys , you're not out of the loop on this one though, as the new vampires not only bring guys, but a few beautiful girls as well, especially the blonde cousins. Breaking Dawn 2 finally has the balance the series has needed and wrapped up the series impressively. Although the acting, editing, and dialog still need some tightening up, most of the mistakes from the previous films have been corrected or improved upon. My opinion is to catch this movie in theaters as it is worth a second trip for me, but definitely hit it up on Netflix. My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5 Series: 9.5 Contact me at rkarim11@su.edu for more discussion or constructive criticism.",8,123,141,16 November 2012
Mama," Not Jump out at you scary, but creepy
","Horror movies are indeed a genre that is always a hit or miss for me. Sometimes they deliver the chills they intend, but many of the modern scary films are filled with too much cheesiness to make me jump or shriek in terror. So once again I went to my local theater to check out the latest Hollywood horror entitled Mama, starring one of my favorite actresses Jessica Chastain. Like so many of her films, I looked forward to being entertained by the lovely redhead and hopefully by the movie as well. So what does this movie have in store for you? Read on to find out.From my experiences, many horror films today prefer to use the art of making people jump with things suddenly appearing out of nowhere. While some directors know how to pull this off, many give away the surprise jump with camera work and audio tricks to warn you when something is coming. Guillermo del Toro's films though throw in some of these scenes, but instead focuses on another scare factor that affects me a little more: creepiness. Yes my friends Mama is creepy indeed using a combination of many things to create a world that has a good chance of giving you goose bumps. One factor that was a major contributor to the scare factor was the use of shadows. From the very start of the movie the houses are covered in shadows hiding the mysteries from within. In some cases, the camera is pitch black with only the haunting sounds and shifting shades to give insight into what lurks within. Yet many scenes involve using various sources of lights to provide a false sense of security that leaves you wondering if something will happen, which sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't. This unpredictable behavior kept the tension high for me and kept me wondering just where the movie was going. Of course these techniques would be nothing if it weren't for the human imagination. What I mean is that hiding Mama's true form for most of the movie allowed my mind to paint a picture of the specter that lurked within the halls and walls. Oh sure a few glimpses of her here and there provided some input, but there was still enough mystery left to allow me to envision some horrible nightmarish creatures. Of course once Mama's form was revealed it didn't agree with my imagination, but surprisingly still was quite a sight to see. The dislocated joints, malnourished limbs, and disproportional faces were painted with a sickly brown color that gave it an added touch of realism to send tingles down your spine. Unfortunately some of the scenes relied too much on the CGI to bring her to life and her exaggerated movements blurred into mediocre CGI effects. What they lacked in the looks department though was made up for in the way Mama moved. At first nothing more than distant floats and occasional bursting out of the wall, Mama's behavior quickly evolved into something I hadn't seen in a while. The damage to her body gave it incredible flexibility that allowed her to contort into numerous positions that had the audience screaming in horror despite how fake it looked. For me though the scariest movement was her rapid dislocated walk she performed as she reached out to grab the little girl at the same time. A few additional creep factors had to be the little girl Lilly and the background music. Lilly is the creepier of the two sisters as her silent demeanor and large eyes are a combination that will affect most. Most of the movie involves her stalking around the house, watching from the shadows silently like a creature on the prowl. When someone confronts her she says little as her large eyes seem to peer into your soul to shake your core. As for the music factor, well it's nothing spectacular, but it fits well with the scenes of the movie. The piano in particular provides a spectrum of sounds to match the emotions sometimes implying doom, while other times giving an extra sound that somehow provides the desired effect. Besides creepiness though, this movie doesn't have many unique strengths that boost is score. The acting is fine, with Chastain once again doing a nice job with her part, but other than sounding and staring creepily at the camera there wasn't much to comment on. Many of the characters were fine and had a little more development than I expected in a horror movie, yet their development was very linear and predictable despite the emotion they portrayed. As for the story, it still falls into one of the tried and true plots that have been overused in Hollywood. However, the way the story was developed was entertaining and well done in my opinion. Instead of Chastain and the gang making random discoveries, the history of Mama was uncovered through a series of dreams, research, and hypnotic interviews with one of the girls. While it certainly isn't the best, I did enjoy the nice change in the delivery. Mama is a horror movie that does its job right. Keeping it PG- 13 was indeed the right decision as it allowed the crew to make a movie that could mess with your head instead of drenching the screen in gore. Wondering if it is worth seeing in theaters? I'll say it is, but more for the horrifying screams and sounds, instead of actually story. I also wish people precautions as this movie may have some flashing light moments that may cause seizures if not careful. My scores for Mama are the following: Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",7,28,52,19 January 2013
Snowden," Hero or Heretic? You Decided in This Riveting Drama!
","Robbie K back for another review. This time we jump into the biographical/drama realm in the film of Snowden. The theme of this tale is on Edward Snowden, the former intelligence officer who quickly became a hot topic of debate in the span of five days by revealing the secrets of the government. So does this movie stand up to the hype, or will it be lost to the high flying tale of Sully that came out last week? Let's get to it!LIKES: Â• Great acting Â• Decent pace on the story Â• Technical insight into spyingFor a movie focused on one man, you need a good actor to portray the title character. So casting Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the key character was a brilliant move to say the least. Once more the man impresses me with his ability to capture a character's nuances and bring them to life. For someone in Snowden's environment you expect intelligence, moral dilemmas, and most likely some paranoia when dealing with classified secrets. Gordon-Levitt is able to portray it all, selling that he is a revolutionary programmer capable of changing the world one code at a time. He played geeky well, but he portrayed paranoid even better with all the symptoms common of the disorder. Shailene Woodley again gets the super dramatic role, trading revolutionary leader to concerned liberal girlfriendÂ…who happens to be an exotic dancer/artist I give the girl props for her ability to maximize a limited part, selling the morals well in her short screen time. Everyone else is pretty much a government extra and adding intensity to the movie and making for big bad enemies. When it comes to biographies, you often get very slow paced tales that tend to be overdramatized and slow for the most part. I didn't feel that way in Snowden, or at least I didn't feel that way most of the time. Snowden keeps the tale going, laying out the foundation of how Snowden fell into his predicament in all the glorious details. One will get immersed in all the technical details and moral dilemmas Edward went through, accompanied with the stress and suspense it brings with it. However, I do fear that such a movie may spur the flames of cyberterrorism with how people are inspired these days, but we won't hold that against the movieÂ…much. DISLIKES: Â• Overdramatic at times Â• Slow at parts Â• One side portrayal of SnowdenThe threat of having Hollywood portray your story is running the risk of movie magic overwriting fact. As there was a warning at the beginning of the film, safe to say there was a lot of dramatic intervention in this film. This does bring an entertaining factor, but it is a little disappointing to wonder what is fact and what is overdramatized fact. Some of the drama also gets a bit eye rolling at times and robs the film of the emotional punch they were trying for. The excessive drama in the movie also makes for some slower moments that you may or may not appreciate. While much of the movie was pertinent to explaining Ed's rise, there were times when this got a little excessive. This was particularly true for meetings with certain supervisors, moments of jealousy and a delayed explanation of his 'flight' that did little for me than extending the run time. Yes, these are minor dislikes, but editing could have cut a little more and save things for the director's cut of the film. Finally, the movie took a one-sided approach to this story, focusing on making him a hero. I'm not calling him anything negative, but we all know that there are two sides to most tales and it would have been nice to get the antagonizing side of things. I'm giving the guys props for standing up for his morals, but I feel the drama portrayed things on a grandiose level than what actually happened. The result was making the government eviler, which will certainly split the favor of the audience depending on your like of the audience. A balanced approach may have expanded the audience liking, but hey to each his own.The VERDICT Snowden certainly has the dramatic flair that will rope you into this story about the morals behind secrecy. His tale is certainly intriguing and most will appreciate the added spice the drama brings. This is certainly one of the better (and more entertaining) biographies I have seen, but most may not find it as gripping (or exciting) as the others. In addition, the one sided portrayal of this political topic may also curb your enjoyment of the movie so I again say take it with a grain of salt. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I can say only if you are looking for a biography or have strong interest in Snowden's story. I'd say save this one for a rental.

Rio," Cute, funny, and musical
","The most recent CGI comedy opened up today and one word to definitely use to describe this movie is colorful. From scene one, this movie is filled to the brim with a wide variety of bright colors that bring energy, excitement, and positive feeling to the movie. After we get a little bit of intro into the lives of Blu and Linda, we meet Tulio who takes us to the wonderful world of Rio de Janeiro. Here is where we get a CGI look of this country and some of the culture that it contributes to the world. Not long after arriving we meet about seven major characters in about ten minutes. From there the movie takes off. To start with the positives of this movie let's start with the characters. The voice cast for this movie was well selected with Eisenberg making the perfect choice for a smart, well read bird that is socially awkward, after all he nailed that role in the Social Network. Anne Hathaway plays the snappy, headstrong bird Jewel who provides a lot of attitude that many girls will love. George Lopez's soothing voice and his comedy talents made him the perfect role of the toucan that was funny, but also a wise mentor to Blu. The sidekick bird duo, voiced by Will.I.am and Foxx were a welcomed comedy duo that provided those one lines constantly seen in kids movies and many will appreciate that funny nature. I guess you could say the second strength would be the character variety. As I already mentioned the diversity of the two blue macaw's makes for an interesting combo that sort of portrays a kid odd couple mix. The two sidekick birds make you laugh with quips, which can also be seen in the two henchmen of the main villain, who remind me of a Latino Horace and jasper. Regardless there is also a malicious cockatoo that is reminiscent of Scar from the Lion King. His devilish nature really helps bring back the idea that even the most cuddliest of creatures can be truly evil on the inside, which they have captured well in this movie. Finally we meet the mysterious Louis who is mentioned throughout most of the movie, and turns out to be a dog that reminds you of Sid the Sloth from Ice Age.They have also captured the beautiful scenery of Rio in their CGI work, which allows one to feel like you are in a cartoon version of the city. The divine statues, white buildings, fiestas, beaches, tropical jungles, and slums are all portrayed beautifully, which made a lot of the surrounding audience want to go there. Perhaps one of the strongest aspects of this movie though, is the musical numbers integrated into this movie. Each song fits well with the characters that are singing it and again captures the mood like we have seen in many Disney movies. My favorite was the toe tapping song that the birds party to, sung by Foxx and Will.I.Am. Surely there is a song that everyone can get hooked to in this movie, you just have to look for it. So I have mentioned a lot of good things about this movie, but what about bad. Well this movie is definitely not slow, but the comedy is not the is not the same as it was in the first Ice Age. One big thing I loved about the Ice Age comedies was Sid's dumb nature and unique ways of saying things that made you laugh hysterically. However, in this movie I didn't feel that same kind of comedy and felt it was a little more juvenile in nature. Despite the constant amount of one liners and situational comedies, I was not laughing as hard as I did in Ice Age, which may or may not be an issue for you. Perhaps the only other weakness I could find was that it was pretty predictable and simple in design with no real surprises, twists, or ideas thrown into the mix. Again I don't know if this is really an issue, but it's worth mentioning that it is no new CGI comedy. My rating of this movie would probably be somewhere between an 8-8.5. I would recommend this movie to those that want a fun, colorful movie for their kids that like singing and dancing. People who like colorful and fun, happy comedies will also like this movie, but again i don't think it is a modern ice age comedy. Finally those who like cute movie, like UP, will like this movie and will not be as sad by the end of this movie. Until next time my friends, keep enjoying the movies.",8,2,3,15 April 2011
Limitless," Limitless: Is a little more limited then expected
","Review for Limitless Okay this movie can be summed in one major theme: drug addiction! This movie is a film that glorifies drugs and the rewards that they seem to offer. The film starts off with a quick shot of the current predicament our protagonist is in, played by Bradley Cooper. After that we get into a quick introduction into the messed up life of our character which is shot in a grayish and dismal tone. The setting and camera work are appropriate for the introduction, but in a dark theater setting can make you more tired than interested in the movie. However, we are quickly and randomly introduced to his ex-brother in law who quickly gets him hooked on the miracle pill. This introduction is very random and not strong suited, but again it's about being addicted to drugs not how he gets into it. Things pick up from there and the effects of the drug are seen in a quick flash of color and light. A majority of the scenes show him studying his business work or partying with various drunks and clients, which reminds me of an expensive take of Jersey Shore. Eventually Robert De Niro's character comes in and plays the role of the arrogant, harsh, over the top business man who becomes the man focus of Cooper's character. Once we see this guy, things begin to pick up and we start diving into the harsh reality of a drug addict, which is extraordinarily portrayed by the characters in this movie. The movie then becomes a portrayal of fighting the greed and drive for success and the desire for breaking the addiction which can be exciting and boring depending on the scenes. Throughout the movie we also see a random guy who is a combination slasher/stalker throughout the movie, that really isn't explained well in the movie. The first strength of this movie is the makeup and acting that combine to make characters who look and seem to be dependent on drugs. This combination draws you into the story and setting and keeps you interested in the character and helps relate to the struggle. Combine this with the strong musical score and the fantastic camera shots and you have made a fantastic scene that captures the suffering the characters have. Some of the scenes that show the enlightenment of the drug are creative as well, but mainly weird and a little confusing at some points when we see multiple versions of the character on the pill. The suspense of the chase scenes makes the film exciting at some points and the 'action' scene at the end gets your heart racing and your pulse up. There were also some fun one liners that kept the movie fun, and helped relieve the depression that hit at some points in the movie.The biggest weakness is the glorifying of drugs and that they can be beneficial to your overall success in the world. This motif is not true, at least not on this level, and this approach could make people want to do drugs. Unfortunately many people who see this movie may be easily swayed into taking drugs that promise benefits, which could lead to some problems. Just like Glee makes fun of serious issues, this movie makes fun of drug abuse and seems to reward such careless use of the drugs, which I disagree with. Another thing that was not appealing was some of the camera work used in this movie. Although most of it was good, there were some computer camera effects that could make people dizzy or give headaches if you are affected by this. The zooming in of the various walkways and streets is a creative representation of getting to the destination, but may be more of a motion sickness curse than a blessing. Continuing on, it was surprising to see that De Niro's character had such a minor role in this movie, really being nothing more than a greedy business man in search of power. It's not his best role in my opinion, but he does play is solidly capturing that greedy eye with a strength he had harnessed. Next are some of the cheesy solutions and actions the characters made when on the drug, as it made them seem superhuman. I guess if you had access to a 100% of the brain you would have great processing power, but that doesn't mean they can run faster or punch with super karate moves. That to me was a little cheesy. Another flaw is the grotesque and ridiculous scene near the end of the movie where a big fight breaks out and the character has to drink blood to get his dose of the drug. Some may like this sort of scenario made famous by SAW, but that's not my cup of tea. Some of the characters introduced, such as the stalker, were either pointless or extremely compelling, but the movie did not really tie them to the story very well. Finally the ending is a little bit cheesy and fake, which mocks the tone the movie was setting up and again further glorifies that drug abuse and addiction lead to better outcomes in life. Overall the movie is just fine it is suspenseful and intense at many times, yet really slow and dragged out at other times. Some of the scenes are very graphic and intense; sometimes leading me to believe it should be Rated R not PG-13. Still the acting is superb and most of the camera work brings the movie to life for the most part. Overall I would give this movie a 7 for a solid capture of drug addiction, yet not fulfilling the promise that it made in the trailers at the beginning of the movie.",7,0,2,19 March 2011
Don't Breathe," Don't Turn a Blind Eye to This UnScary Thriller
","The end of August is usually full of blunt films that are meant to fill spaces, but sometimes Hollywood knows how to close out the summer in style. The promise of this weekend is the latest horror film called Don't Breathe. Robbie K here, and I'm back to share my opinions and advice on the latest movies. Do we have a champion horror movie? Or are we fooled once again. As alwaysÂ…read on to find out. LIKES: Â• Suspense Â• Plot twists Â• Good paceWhen a trailer promises suspense, my experience has been a few on the seat moments often deluded by cheesy plot lines and over exaggerated monsters. Fortunately, Don't Breathe decided to cast its die another way to deliver on what was promised. The movie is filled with suspense from the moment the 'heroes' enter the house and begin their journey to rob a blind man. Using very simple, though well planned, tactics our main cast of three traverse the dark corridors in hopes of escaping with their lives. Many of the audience cringed with the creak of a rogue floor board, waiting for the military man to appear and hunt his prey. One doesn't realize how silent things are until that sudden sound effect pops out. Yes, the presentation certainly gives you the suspense you are craving, but that's not the only thing they did right. In terms of plot, horror movies often have quality components, but as a whole are mundane, unoriginal, and formulaic. This movie is very similar to many films, but stands out for the plot twists thrown into the mix. You can get some of these twists from the trailers, however our screenplay writers dropped a few bombs into the mix that take the story down a new road. These surprises keep things fresh and add more urgency to the moment to further bring the thrills you sought with the trailer. And even better its presented at a quick pace that adds more energy to the scenes and a since of adventure that you often miss in horrors. It all feels like a visual version of the most dangerous game and doesn't dawdle to deliver the good stuff. DISLIKES: Â• Overly drawn out at times Â• Not that scary Â• Uber cheesyOkayÂ…I know that horror movies are always a stretch of the imagination and there are a lot of overly done moments. Don't Breathe, while more on the realistic side, certainly drops into many moments that sometimes feel like it won't end. While some of these moments are focused on narrow misses in the basement, or dodging shots from a gun with seemingly infinite ammunition. My main issue has to be with some of more violent moments, watching the buff military guy beat down the trespassers in vicious fury. Yeah, it delivers some swift justice, but hearing the sounds of squishing blood and grunts of pain gets stupid after a while. I can't say most of it was pointless, but our director may need to get checked out for how much he seemed to enjoy the violent moments. In fact, it seems that the violence was the focus that the scares were left out. Speaking of whichÂ….The scare factor of this movie was not really there for me. Oh sure, a whacked out marine sergeant with a wicked temper and skills is a scary thing to witness due to the realism factor. However, it is not the thing to keep me up at night, minus one of the scenes near the middle of the film. The Blind Man is not the creepy, nightmare inducing monsters/demons/spirits that the genre is famous for. In fact, you kind of feel sorry for him at times which dilutes the scary/creepy factor for most of the film. And the movie fails to use the creepy edge and replaces it with those jump scare moments you can see coming from a mile away. Maybe if they had added a serial killer edge, or a creeped out mental patient moment it would have sweetened the pot.Finally, the last dislike is the cheesy moments in the film. Before you rip me a new one and say this review is useless hear me out. Yes, horror movies are cheesy it's what allows for the monsters and situations to exist that fans want to dive into. Unfortunately for me that cheesiness took a turn down the wrong avenue for me. First of all, the whole situation wouldn't exist if the main characters weren't overzealous thieves trying to justify their action. The means for the movie made my eyes roll and I actually cheered against the kids in the beginning because of how much I disliked them. In addition, the convenient elements (e.g. guns with lots of shots, vents that are just the right size, and surprisingly resistant bodies) are just some of the other cheesy things they amplify in this movie. I'll give them props for resourcefulness though and managing to dilute the factors to fit into the suspense. The Verdict:When it comes to Don't Breathe, the word Thriller is the most appropriate way to describe this film. It provides the continuous suspense that your attention craves and throws enough surprises into the mix to make a decent tale. However, in terms of scary, I can't say it was the most system shocking of the mix. Still I have to recommend this one for the crowd who longs for a fast paced horror who like a bunch of close calls. Yet for the rest of the world, hold out for this one and catch it at Redbox in a few months. My scores:Horror/Thriller: 7.0 (Thriller alone a 7.5) Movie Overall: 6.5",8,4,10,26 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Visuals Are a Beauty, The Charm Is A Bit More Beast
","It's finally here, the live action telling of a beloved story that Disney made memorable years ago. Yes, I'm talking about Beauty and The Beast my friends, and tonight I'm here to share my thoughts. Now let's get this laid down now, I'm going to look at it as its own movie and do my best to minimize the masterpiece. So please don't cast aside the review if I tread on any ground. With that said, let's get started to see if the modern retelling has what it takes to stand out in the world. Summary: You may hear others say the movie is spot on with the 1991 telling. Not entirely true, but this rendition keeps about 80% of the Tale as Old as Time to please the classic fans, while adding some tangents to give it a twist. To quote a friend, 'the new spins are built around the fans from the 90s generation to entertain'. It works for the most part, adding depth to the characters and giving the emotional kick older audience members will appreciate. And while sticking to the story is good start, the next magical step is how well they brought it to life in the visuals. Beauty and The Beasts charming country side and castles, are brought out in spectacular detail via breathtaking scenery shots and detail oriented settings that are worthy of recognition. Next dress our characters in wonderful costumes fitting of the landscape, with special emphasis on the traditional Belle Dress and Beast coat that remains timeless, and you again get more magic. Finally add in the animation, realistic, fluid, and somewhat mirroring the classic style most fell in love with, and you have a great combination. Of note, there are times when things get trippy, or not done quite as well, but overall solid around. All in all, Disney's abilities to blend these elements together are impressive, and this reviewer gives them their well-deserved props. In terms of casting, there is a mixed response to the cast assembled. Again, they are not the originals (which I did miss), but that doesn't mean they aren't bad just the same. Emma Watson is charming, smart, and courageous (all elements we have seen just without the wand), which works for the protagonist. Dan Stevens I guess does well for the few scenes he isn't covered in CGI fir, but in his monstrous form delivers his lines with surprising depth. But it is Lumiere and Cogsworth who stole the show for me. I worried, I'd be robbed of their relationship, but that wasn't the case. Ewen McGreggor and Ian McKellan stepped up the role, delivering their well- written lines that had me laughing in delight. The rest did well, but I need to move on, so let's just say for the most part, this movie's casting was well-done. Summary: The music, a staple of Beauty and The Beast that is almost as timeless as the story. This rendition has put their own spin on it, while trying to keep the backbone of the original. Most numbers work, albeit obviously auto-tuned, with their own whim, but the song Gaston was a number I did not enjoy for everything it lacked. Ironically the original tunes I found to be better composed, packed with emotion and not seeming a diluted version, but its weakness came in how they seemed randomly thrown in (yes in an effort to add more emotional develop to the cast). Overall the changes aren't terrible, they just didn't have the same bite as the classics did, unless you count shock factor from either some cheesiness/trippiness). Other changes that I didn't quite like were Le Fou's changes. Le Fou is supposed to be his name sake, the fool who is comedic relief as the joke, before getting his just desserts. Josh Gadd's rendition wasn't so much a fool, as a smart alec, clingy, admirer who made slick comments and kept his idol at bay. Again, the deeper development is appreciated, but this drastic change kind of meant his name should have been changed as well, perhaps to Petit Malin? Changes aside, the acting is capable of bringing the characters to life, but there are moments where things are a little forced. Some of the Beasts Temper tantrums, a few of Belle's stoic speeches, and Gaston's attempts to be devious, all of these hit their overacted moments at times. And while this made me laugh, there were a few conventional moments that were a bit cheesy (as stated by some in the movie). Most of these coincidental moments are ignorable, but one scene in particular was an anticlimactic finish at the end where something just happened to break at the right time. All of these moments alone aren't too bad, but many of the changes brought into this film brought it more into the adult/realistic and took away from the fun, whimsical nature of the movie. The design of the characters, the emotional subplots, even the music were lacking that element of childlike fun that made the movie so memorable for me. Doesn't mean it isn't still entertaining, I just really missed that element. The VERDICT:With the big shoes the original left, this telling did a decent job appealing to many. It is a well- developed remake of the story, with a wonderful cast and setting to bring it to life and capture your heart. While the music didn't quite reach the same heights, and some changes took away the energy, this film certainly has much of the magic that rose promised years ago. Go in there with a clear mind and try not to compare, and you'll be fine. I recommend this for a theater visit (as if I could stop you) and hope you enjoy. My scores are: Family/Fantasy/Musical: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",8,16,39,16 March 2017
Jack Reacher," Cruise on Over And See Mr. Reacher
","You've seen him take on Impossible Missions. He's been able to master the art of the samurai and battle the tyranny of a corrupt empire. This man has even survived an alien invasion while babysitting a bug eyed little girl. Yes, he's Tom Cruise the man who seems to be a big contender for leading male roles. This weekend Mr. Cruise stars in another movie, one that involves him wearing more clothes and drinking less booze. Yes my friends, he has traded the shirtless role of Stacy Jaxx, for the incredible mind of Jack Reacher, which is the name of the movie. What were my thoughts on this movie? Please read on to find out.The trailer didn't make me too excited about this movie since it painted Cruise as the same character he has played in just about every movie. Now this may not bother you, but for me I've gotten a little tired of his calm, creepy, calculated demeanor that lacks any expression of emotion. In Jack Reacher though, Cruise's demeanor actually is a strength that gives the protagonist just the right traits to be likable. For those who haven't read the books, Reacher is sort of a loose cannon detective/soldier that uses intellect, rational thought, and intense training to uncover the truth. Of course such qualities require a dryer character instead of an energetic idiot. Does this mean that his character is boring though? On the contrary, Reacher is actually a character almost everyone will like due to his many qualities. He's very blunt when it comes to speaking the truth and has no fear telling others what is going on in his head. While some may find it rude, most of the audience and I found it funny due to the timing and delivery of the lines. Even his facial expressions are funny, not because they are goofy, but because they are realistic reactions to some of the situations he faces. However blunt humor and witty dialog isn't the only quality of this character/movie that was enjoyable to watch. The story itself is interesting and provides a good mystery that many movies have been lacking as of late. Again assuming you haven't the read the books, the plot starts off with a horrible killing spree that seems to set up the villain of the story. However, I was fooled and instead it becomes a mission to discover the motif of the crime and leads to a much deeper rabbit hole. To help uncover the mystery, Reacher's character is used to analyze the various parts of the city, attempting to discover clues that were hidden in plain sight. What I liked best about this, was it wasn't some random discovery of clues like Scooby and the gang can find, but instead Reacher goes to the scene takes the info collected and expands on it. The connections and concepts he finds are rather impressive, and were details that I had trouble seeing. Plus, for once I found this story to a more unpredictable, constantly turning a new direction that wasn't too radical of a turn. As Reacher continues to piece the puzzle together, the world continues to grow and incorporates more of the characters into the story, who used their skills to further expand the plot. This involvement and integration is something I love to see done in a movie, as it provides multiple opportunities to develop the main characters and keep them diverse and interesting. Yet detective work and crime solving are still only a few pieces to Jack's complexity. Although he stalls casual and calm during most of the movie, there is a hidden beast within ready to break free when the time calls for it. Of course this means some action is involved when the aggression is unleashed, but this doesn't mean we get into a kung fu fury. Reacher does have some moves, but his opponents are fairly untrained in the self-defense arts and fall within a few seconds. While this isn't bad for this movie, fans should not expect much from fist to fist fighting. Instead Jack's action skills involve using speed, intelligence, and guns. While these scenes aren't nearly as fast or detailed as other action films, they are still quite enjoyable and good support for the story. Fans will find themselves tied to the action to determine how the outcome will affect the story. These scenes are still exciting and suspenseful, but may still be a little slower for the action cravers that are out there. Yet something many will appreciate is that for the most part these scenes are real. When a person gets shot, they don't stand perfectly straight and keep gunning, but actually have to favor one limb or go into hiding. Now some of the car chasing is still a little far-fetched, as how many impacts can one car take before it no longer moves. Still the action is fun, relevant, and has some laughable moments from Reacher's nonchalant attitude. I'm impressed with Jack Reacher and happy that my initial doubts were misplaced. I believe that many fans will enjoy this adaptation to the book series. Cruise really brings the character to life and Reacher's multiple qualities drive the story and keep it decently paced. Yes there are a few things that may have been edited out to make the film a little shorter, but this movie is a pretty strong one in my books. I suggest this one be seen in theaters either by your self or with friends. However, should you not have time to see it definitely catch it later on Netflix/Redbox. Here are my scores for the movie: Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",8,4,11,23 December 2012
American Made," Made Okay, About the USA
","American politics is a theater that continues to garner more attention than even the biggest award shows. The players in their games can be just as interesting, especially in how far they go to accomplish their tasks. My second review of the weekend focuses on one such person named Barry Seal, a famous American pilot who was a cog in so many aspects. What does this movie have in store for us? Robbie K here to fill in on the latest biography and give you insight into another silver screen story. Let's goLIKES:The Setting: Technology's progression allows us to do many things, and one is recreating the past. American Made is a shining example of Hollywood's ability to recreate the trends of the decades, from what towns/cities looked like to the fashion and cars that filled them. You'll be pulled back in time with this film, and become integrated in the world and fully diving into the world crafted by Seal's actions. In addition, it's also fun to see old news' broadcasts integrated into the mix, further amping up the story. And for all you nostalgia lovers out there, feel free to have fun remembering the adventures you back then. Cruise's Acting: Say what you want about Tom Cruise's personal life, but the man can certainly play his roles well. Cruise comes in spades with this film, capturing arrogance, coyness, and that adventurous spirit all in one sitting. His skills will bring out the emotions of the time period, the fear of being that pivotal chess piece that so many depend on. Cruise's chemistry with all his co-actors is favorable, resulting in a performance that feels natural. In addition, his dynamic abilities to transition between sub roles, further brings the character to life, an essential for a key role. Thorough Tale: Biographies are only as fascinating as the story presented, which often requires details. Our directors/screenwriters have got you covered in this movie, sparing no time cost to hit all the deals that Seal was involved in. Their presentation keeps guides you well in this movie, using captioned slide transitions and Cruise's comedic dialogue to set the time and place of the next adventure. It's an easy tale to keep up with and hits so many qualities of Seal's life in tandem to his antics (including family, friends, and even sanity). I felt that of all the books brought to life, this was one that hit the closest to home. DISLIKES:Magic vs Reality: The challenge with these films is determining what is real and what is overdramatized. There are plenty of moments where that question comes up, as the cast of characters appears with grandiose gestures and presentations to corrupt the system. As the story progresses, the whole conspiracy gets even larger and the drama amps up to levels that are hard to believe. The over dramatization gets a little cheesy at times, and made me roll my eyes at the extremes the legal system went to and how untrustworthy they were. Fans of this style though, will easily be hooked into the escapades of the movie. Skimped on other factors: While American Made touches on many aspects of the film, there was an imbalance in how much they would focus on those other aspects. The family aspect was so heavily influenced at the beginning, but then gets diluted down to background noise and occasional shots. Same thing goes for a few business partners he contracts as well, a rather focused opening, but then runs out of gas. While I give them props for keeping things concise, the disjunction between these aspects is a little disappointing to me, especially how one would affect the other. In addition, these rushed elements took the suspense away from me. The wasted sequences: The most annoying thing for me though, were the tangential flashes that occur in this movie. Seal's memories are fascinating to see, but there are a few of them that were pointless to have sequences for. An example is him randomly saying he had kids, only to flash to a scene of her in labor for a brief comedic relief. While a noble attempt, it was nothing a well-placed line could have done as well. There are other examples as well that all could have been left out, thereby further reducing the run length. The VERDICT:American Made is a great biography that has some flare other biographies have lacked for me. Cruise leads the way in terms of strengths for this movie, but the world and tale itself are an entertaining venue to watch. Yet, there are plenty of overdramatic moments and wasted shots that have made this a glorified Netflix/History Channel worthy production. If you are looking for a good biography though, scope this one out, otherwise wait for next week's releases before going to the theater.

Jersey Boys," Beautifully done, but drags at times
","The Four Seasons, a musical sensation that lasted throughout the years as one of the greatest bands of the 20th century. With uptown beats, a blend of instruments, and a high pitched Frankie Valli; this group led the charts for many years. So what is the entertaining world's current trend in recognizing their achievements? Simple, they make plays and movies about the group, in particular about the origins and underlying story of the singing sensations. That's right, my movie review is on Jersey Boys, the latest work of director Clint Eastwood. Like most movies about singing legends, the underlying tone is dark, often the glamorous lifestyle of fame a mere cover for some tormenting background. If you didn't get this from the movie trailer, or the title, I'm here to tell you that Jersey Boys is a tale of dark and dreary times. Right from the start we are thrown smack dab in the middle of a depressing neighborhood, filled with citizens whose dreams seem dead, with the exception of a few, as Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) introduces us to his life. In a curse filled, angry tone, one already gets a feeling the movie will have a more somber tone than any of the films I've seen in the past few weeks. Over the course of two hours, the tale grows darker, every ounce of happiness offset by seedy greed and selfish desires of one or two characters. While realistic, it became slow at points and bored me to wanting to take a nap. Now maybe it was the double feature after a day of work, but the truth is this movie dragged at points for me, especially in the beginning where I was waiting for them to actually sing something. Luckily the film picks up pace when the first song leaves Frankie's golden throat, but after the brief span of nostalgic tunes, it hits a low point again. Yes, it sets up a tale that has lots of character development, but shorten the movie by a half an hour and you will still make your point. Putting story aside, the recreated world of the 60's was well executed, as various trends and commodities returned from the shelves of time. Various couples in the audience lit up with delight at being dragged back in time, commenting on how much fun establishments like that used to be. Regardless, the setting is well done, both costumes and makeup blending in with the artificial towns that changes, as the seasons grow older. While I am no expert in how the seasons looked, I felt the cast did a nice job of recreating them, styling hair and casting actors who looked and played the part. While the characters can be real sleaze balls, I think the fantastic four did a great job filling the epic shoes, and blending Jersey edge with Italian loyalty. Frankie (John Lloyd Young) in particular was my favorite character, a wide variety of emotion and qualities that made me most interested in his story. Of course seeing as the tale was more focused on him, I can't tell how much was glamorized to make him look good, but still I rather enjoyed his character. As for the other actors, well I applaud their talent as well, each playing an integral role in 'moving' the story along and providing a different angle on things. Let's talk about the part I enjoyed the most about Jersey Boys. No I'm not talking that it ending, I'm talking about the music. The one shred of light in this story is getting to hear the gang sing some of their big time hits. Is it live singing or well-rehearsed dub overs? I don't know, but regardless I was moving my knees and bobbing to the rhythm as the Four Seasons played their melodies. The elaborate stage shows with their bright lights brightened the mood and temporarily eliminated the cloud of dismay I was feeling. Getting not one, but four songs as well, made me feel as if I wasn't being gypped, and the fact they played the entire son, or at least most of it, was another plus that Eastwood did right. Of course, the only thing that I wished could have been different, was that these songs were not so clustered together, to help relieve some of the latter dramatic tension and depression, but Eastwood cant' change history any more than we can. Jersey Boys has the magic of bringing a world to life, however depressing that world may be. With a great cast, beautiful setting, and music that continues to span the test of time, Eastwood deserves applause for what he has done. Yet, it is slow, and not really a movie I can say deserves flocking to the theater to see, when it can be appreciated from the comforts of home, and cheaper as well. It may win an Oscar though, so if given the chance to see it take it, but hold your money for some of the other films coming in the next couple of weeks.I give Jersey Boys:Drama/Biography/Musical: 7.5 Overall: 7.0",7,0,17,24 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Chastain rocks, The Rest is Decent
","Zero Dark Thirty is another addition to the historical movie genre. This time Bigelow has decided to glorify America by focusing on the hunt for the greatest manhunt of all time, the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. While the realism and constant evolution of the quest are impressive, this film still has some pace and balance issues to sort out to be almost three hours long. While some of the meeting scenes were interesting to me, there is only so much political bickering and repetitive complaints one can take. Despite this though, Bigelow and company did a nice job integrating the driving motives of the manhunt within the planning stages, bringing one into the CIA's world. Yet the biggest strength for this reviewer is Ms. Jessica Chastain, who once again graces the big screen with not only her charm and looks, but with her amazing talent. I felt this was her best role yet, but that's just me.

Sausage Party," Crude Comedy, but Original Spin. It hits the target audience
","The mission, write a review. The movie: Sausage Party. Robbie K here, and I'm back with another assignment to give you the 411 on the latest movies to hit the theater. Tonight the latest animated 'masterpiece' is my subject, one crafted by the masters of raunchy comedy. Let's get started.LIKES: Â• Originality Â• Clever writing with wit Â• Killer Soundtrack Â• Short run timeIf the trailers weren't enough to convince you, then let me assure you that Sausage Party certainly is a more unique film than most. The idea of food coming to life and navigating a supermarket is not something we get these days. Add on the sexual characteristics and personify to add depth to their characters brings even more shine to the movie. I mean making an antagonist who is an actual douche is new to me. And with originality often comes cleverness, which this movie manages to bring to the mix. There are plenty of movie references and stereotypical humor integrated into the movie, much of which is well times to have you laughing in your seats. I myself enjoyed seeing warzones unfold in Saving Private Ryan manners, or seeing science fiction movie plots breaking into the spot light. But most of you are probably looking for the sexual innuendos promised in the trailers and to your relief it delivers on its promise. The focus of the movie is certainly on promiscuous side with so many descriptions for sex jammed into the 90 minute run time. So many people lost it to the aggressive insults and descriptions for genitalia that it was sometimes hard to hear the movie. There were also plenty of cheesy puns thrown into the mix to relieve some of the dirtier comedy. And for the moments where they broke the fourth wallÂ…that too was a very good choice.While you certainly don't care about soundtracks in a comedy movie, Sausage Party gets points for the songs they chose. Various classics over the last few decades grace the speakers such as Three Dog Night's Joy to the World, Meatloaf's song (sung by a meatloaf) and a few other tracks to fit into the deranged mood. It's fun, flashy, and a nostalgic twist to only amplify the comedy of this film and well placed throughout the movie. And did I mention that it is only 90 minutes long. A perfect run time to get the message across before going into the overdone territory. DISLIKES Â• Disturbing Â• Jokes that cross the line Â• Some lazy dialogue Â• Some tactics that went staleIf you didn't catch the trailers you might have missed some of the more graphic scenes of the movie. Seeing perishable characters be brutally dismembered while hearing screams of despair, anguish, and suffering drowning the theater certainly wasn't the most enjoyable thing to see. Some might find the destruction of food laughable, but the presentation was a bit more disturbing to me than anything. But these fail in comparison to some of the violent fates other characters fall into. Despite the corny, comical theme, those who cringe or feint of heart might want to steel themselves for the chaos at hand. And as for the orgy scenes, well seeing food do it really isn't my cup of tea. But if death and violence aren't enough to cross the line, then perhaps some of the more inappropriate jokes will do it for you. Our writers certainly set out to poke various snakes, making fun of various cultural references that had me sometimes laughing and other times wondering who it will set off. Surely many people will find this movie offensive, especially when customs and traditions are adulterated with sex and monogamy. I won't lie I laughed at it sometimes, but some of the things certainly hit below the belt. Throw in some lazy dialogue moments and you add further insult. Why cursing must become the key ingredient in a comedy, I don't know, but nevertheless Sausage Party doesn't hesitate to haphazardly add swearing to the point of getting annoying. As for jokes growing stale, surprisingly it doesn't happen much in this movie, but there are some gags that lose their punch. Random food popping up at their mentioning is one example, arrogant bragging of the douche was another. To their benefit though, the jokes were pretty well spread out and the short time prevented them from going too overboard with some of the jokes. VERDICT:It's hard to score this movie as it isn't the comedy I might prefer. However, keeping in mind its intended audience and joke style, I have to say the movie certainly delivers on its promise to be sexually slanderous and mind numbingly stupid. The story certainly isn't the greatest (or that strong to be honest), but this tale is certainly original in many ways and so creative. However, all the insults and disturbing moments, not too mention the cheaper, low key dialogue moments, take away things for me. So who do I recommend this movie for? Fans of Seth Rogen movies, those who can't get enough raunchy humor, or those who want to see food do it. Worth a trip to the theater? I have to say it is for the audience it delivers for, but hold out until the RedBox if you can wait. My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 5",Null,12,26,12 August 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Time Loop, Butt Kicking Action
","Science fiction is a genre that is by far my favorite to watch and review. The worlds and creatures created stretch the imagination and allow for a variety of qualities to be built into the story, i.e. horror, action, etc. Of course, many recent sci-fi films fall below expectations, with the trailers often more entertaining than the actual movie itself. So when I saw the trailer for Edge of Tomorrow (EOT), I was entranced, but skeptical as to what they would bring to the table. Would it be repetitive? Would it have the action promised? Would Tom Cruise annoy the heck out of me? What did I think about this most anticipated movie? Read on to find out. If you haven't seen the trailers, EOT is a time paradox movie centering on Major Cage (Cruise) and his battle against the metallic Mimic army. After a failed operation, the first time, Cage develops the ability to relive the day before the invasion over and over again, training under super solider Rita (Emily Blunt) to stop the invasion. Now like most scene repeat movies, there is a looming threat of becoming bored with the repetitive scenes and sequences. Some movies know how to keep up the entertainment value, but others use repetition as merely a tool to get more length at a fraction of the price. In this movie, the movie remains entertaining, only occasionally becoming drab as Cage fails training, often in some comedic scream or landing. Yet, director Doug Liman manages to keep the other elements intertwined with the repetition, allowing the story to unfold in a rather efficient manner. The fact that he keeps the scenes funny as well makes the repetition relevant to the story and actually worth watching.Of course comedy wasn't what I was going for mainly in this movie; I was all about the action the trailers promised. I'll admit in the beginning I was worried that I would be disappointed, as the first battle was merely a sequence of running, death, and convulsive, dizzying camera work. Luckily, both aspects improved, the first battle merely a diluted taste of what is to come, the camera work occasionally getting unstable at parts. As Cage grows stronger in the art of war, becoming adrenaline-pumping carnage that fans will love. While the scenes are nowhere near as long as I wanted, they are well adapted to drive the movie, allowing for strategy and planning to be integrated with gunplay. There were a lot of similarities to the final battle from the Matrix Revolutions, but the story and strategy helped EOT stand out on its own. However, Rita and Cage are primarily an army of two against the swarm of machines, while the other soldiers are merely CGI cannon fodder for the glowing beasts, which brings me to my next point. The movie focuses on pretty much only these two with a few cameos and interjections from others here and there. Now surely this comes to no surprise, so there should be no complaints right? For the most part I agree, Blunt and Cruise work well together, their chemistry was very good, almost as if being two soldiers caught in an infinite time loop was their job. The main complaint I had though was that despite the amount of screen time they had, the two characters didn't have much development past fighting the war. Bits and pieces of their lives unfolded, more so Rita's, yet half of the pertinent information was kind of blown over and pointless. What was the point of such intricate details if you weren't going to use them in the first place? I guess in such a limited time span and such dire circumstances there is only so much bonding you can do. Luckily the story to uncover the secret of the machines has enough suspense and 'mystery' to make up for the lack of character development. However, it cannot make up for the introduction of the J squad and doing practically nothing with them. The squad does have some comedic relief and has a few useful moments, but I felt they were rather useless in the grand scheme of things. Oh well, when you get decent, graphic technological warfare, you probably don't care much about the other infantry. Edge of Tomorrow has a lot of good qualities that make it one of the better science fiction movies in the recent years. While the action is not what I expected, it is well balanced with comedy and plot to help keep the movie suspenseful. The acting is pretty solid, and fans of Tom Cruise will enjoy the scientologist's latest project of whipping CGI butt. Just don't expect much detailed character development in anybody else, or any life lessons because it is not there. As for watching it in 3-D, I could see a lot of potential, but truth is the 2-D was awesome, and you save yourself a few bucks. Check this one out in theaters. My scores for this film are:Action/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Overall: 8.0",8,1,3,6 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," An Aca-Awesome Sequel, Though Lacking in Some Areas
","Hey there it's Robbie K, back with another movie review to help you get some insight into the latest movies. Today I throw my hat into the ring of the latest singing movie Pitch Perfect 2, a sequel that has been most anticipated for quite some time. With it's predecessor becoming an instant 'classic' in the A capella world, going so far to inspire singing competitions, surely this sequel had some potential to rock the ear drum world. From the trailers, here is what you might expect:1. Comedy 2. Toe Tapping Tunes 3. A cute storyHowever, in the world of sequels you never know what will come out of the woodwork, so here is what you get:1. Comedy In terms of Comedy, Pitch Perfect 2's greatest strength is the ability to make you laugh. The trailer showing Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) showing off her lower anatomy is only the tip of the iceberg in this installment. You will be bombarded with one liners that are sure to be the next T-shirt or picture meme, including that famous use of Aca into vocabulary. The writers spared no expense to cram this movie with ridiculous quotes, often having our Barden Bellas go to extraordinary lengths to deliver their lines. What was the result? Most of the audience was rolling on the floor laughing, some even to tears at the comedy at hand. Wilson in particular takes the cake for the most laughs, using her weight and her blunt way of speaking to land well-timed, hilarious, dialogue. Even the slapstick comedy involving the setting is fun, especially when you see the responses of the other girls at what occurred. But perhaps the third factor that made the comedy so fun, was integrating some of the jokes into singing. Whether it was Fat Amy performing an act, or someone screwing up a lyric, Pitch Perfect 2 adds some quality comedy in their song numbers to give us a small break from the other comedy. But for all the good of the comedy, there are some limitations. For one thing they did too much of a good thing in the jokes, and for this reviewer some of the one-liners got stale. I mean how many weight jokes or sex references do we need in a two hour time frame? The second mistake was not balancing the comedy between the Bellas. Oh sure each of them got at least one line into the phrase, but this sequel focused heavily on Fat Amy and left some of the others in the dust. I always used to enjoy Becca's sarcasm as a joke, but even that got drowned by the simple slapstick of this movie. Finally the writers went a little too far with their racial/sexist jokes in both intensity and number. Some of the jokes are more insulting than funny, and the constant bashing throughout the movie had me shaking my heads and praying that no protests or boycotts would come underway. 2. Songs:So if you saw the first movie, you know that covers are the other life force of this series. Pitch Perfect 2 does a great job bringing their versions of popular songs into the mix, and making you want to sing and dance the night away. Songs are mashed together in a recipe of success that covered all genres, somehow being spun in a direction that made me like a Taylor Swift song. They even did a better job integrating our girls into the mix, helping to expand the track horizon. Best of all, I didn't have to hear I Saw The Sign performed ten times in one movie, which was perhaps the most annoying part of Pitch Perfect 1. Throw in the filler songs that helped transition the scenes, and you have one soundtrack I'll be looking to buy down the line. HoweverÂ… the music still pales compared to its predecessor. Despite Pitch Perfect 2 having some really good tunes, the numbers still weren't as impressive as I had hoped. The final battle in particular was rather lackluster and simple, though the Bellas number did rock, and I found myself bored with the performances of the other groups. 3. StoryWe all know this movie isn't about the story, but take a look back at what we had in the first movie. Pitch Perfect brought college life to the screen, helping introduce a new world for Becca that included getting involved, music, friends, and love. It was simple and predictable, but done well that tied the other aspects together. Not the case in Pitch Perfect 2. This sequel sacrificed a lot of plot for extra laughs, essentially shredding the foundation to which I enjoyed in the first. Sure there was the establishment of a rival team to help spur the plot, and there was even a moral filled tale of embracing change. Heck there were even a few cutesy love stories thrown into the mix. But this movie really diluted their character development down into a rather basic mashup of half baked plot lines. I didn't feel quite as attached to the characters, my mind only wondering what the next stunt or joke would be. So from my skewed review what can we take away? Pitch Perfect 2 is a really fun and enjoyable sequel that is sure to entertain a majority of the world. The comedy heavy theme and dialogue is going to make you laugh, and the soundtrack will have you tapping your toes away. Despite the lack of balance and weaker story, I have to recommend you go and see this film in theaters (like you actually wouldn't).

It Chapter Two," Floating Through Nearly 3 Hours with Decent Story and Fantastic Acting
","Two years ago, the relaunch of yet another series started, taking modern day technology and using it to put a new face on it. Stephen King's legendary book titled IT came back in a new light that felt like a Stranger Things Episode with a little more demented/horror element added to it. When the ending came and the credits finished, the promise of part 2 lingered in red, setting the stage for the second act of the book. Two years later, the adventure arrives and the question is... will the movie live up to the potential or are we waiting for nothing. Robbie K coming in for another review of the latest film to hit the theater, hoping to give you some spoiler free insight on the film. So let's get set as we look into:Movie: It: Chapter 2Director:

The AssistantSUMMARY:
The genius of the film is that although a sequel it's also a stand-alone film that manages to take the tale in a new light. Chapter 2, at least this version, manages to make a multilayered story that holds part horror and part soul searching as our characters developed. In a decently compact way, It 2 accomplishes the task of bridging the 27-year gap and keeping to the horror element all why pushing some heavy political issues and moral tasking topics in a classy way. Not just a drama, the horror element still stands true in this film and Pennywise's new tactics are a step up in the form of nightmare motivating images that will stay in minds for a long time. Not the most realistic at times, IT's new forms for the most part have enough skin tingling factor to them to make some squirm in their seats, especially given how they made Pennywise a much bigger threat than I anticipated. A small subtle component that I quite enjoy are the small references to the book or popular phrases about the book. It's nice balanced humor and a clever ploy to sort of justify the decisions made in this film in regards to changing the story, which gets a nod of respect from this reviewer. Hands down though, the best part is acting, which I can go on for hours about. All the adult forms mirror the kids in many qualms, take the baseline characteristics and maximize them, and play off of each other so well that I can't help but praise the casting direction. As for the clown himself, Bill SkarsgÃƒÂ¥rd again redeems his role as Pennywise and takes the nightmare amalgam worthy as a legendary villain. He manages to add new levels of creepiness without trying too hard, achieving that skin crawling factor to new levels.In regards of areas that are still working on improving for me, well the film did not quite scare me like I was hoping. Again, I'm used to much of the scare tactics, but It Chapter 2's use of computer effects and other designs did not quite scare me as much as disturb me at times (that scene at the Chinese restaurant). In addition the stepped-up game of Pennywise sometimes crossed levels that I wasn't a fan of, primarily in some of the more torturous aspects that this film took. Those that have a low tolerance for dragged out beatings or torture may want to avert their eyes at these points. In regards to the plot much of the overall arc is wonderful, but the presentation at times comes off a little more convoluted than I had hoped. During the middle of the film the constant intertwining of past and present did not quite make sense to me, until the end when the explanation came. Not that it was not entertaining at times, I felt this approach sort of added fluff to the movie, almost as this was a director's cut. This brings me to the length of the film, while certainly not the slowest movie (Midsommar anyone), the nearly three hour run time did not quite feel necessary given that the first part was nearly an hour shorter. Again it is entertaining for the most part, but it's a commitment I don't think was quite needed. A small nuance again for most, the cursing sometimes goes down the avenues of being lazy writing, primarily in the overuse of the F bomb when there were better lines that the first film capitalized on. My biggest beef is the assistant to the mad clown, to which I don't want to ruin. A concept that starts to hold potential, the assistant is a wasted character in my eyes that serves for only a little bit of plot development and a few comedy moments. So much could have been done with this character, but I think the squad found this character the one to cut out most of in favor of the other focus points of the film.The VERDICT:
Wrapping this up, two years gave the movie enough time to make a horror movie that is familiar, yet has enough flair to be its own. Sticking to horror roots, the movie focuses on the story and does a nice job integrating most characters into the film. It may not be scary to me, but Pennywise is still creepy and has upped his danger level with new forms and references that should have fans smiling. Yet it's the acting that holds the key to success and brings the movie to levels that are super entertaining and deep compared to most horror genre casts. Still, the movie is a little long winded, with a convoluted presentation at times that adds a little length, and a character that felt like a waste. Otherwise, a semi-cheesy ending and some darker tactics are the only things that really didn't impress me. The summary though is that this film is definitely a worthy edition to the horror genre, and I believe it's worth checking out in theaters. My scores are:Horror: 8.0

12 Strong," A Little More Development Could Have Made This Movie 12 Stronger

-Too Long
-Hard to Differentiate Characters
-Army Of One With the new year starting, 12 strong opens the gate for action movies this January. Fans of military dramas will be entertained by the fast pace of the film, outside the first hour, once the bombs and guns begin to roar. Interspersed between the battles, is a rich dialogue that is broken into categories that represent: natural conversation between teammates, military jargon to get you caught up in the action, and more importantly an honorable exchange of words that represent cultures well. The messages in this movie are charge up with the special effects of Hollywood, and with it a great presentation of the cultural dynamics in war. And of course, there is plenty of action to keep things intense and exciting, laden with all the war time theatrics that portray the American Hero we all love to see. 
 Sadly, 12 Strong suffers from too little editing and trying to get everything into one movie. Much of the length comes from trying to cover every detail of the war, including such small gimmicks as an air drop gone wrong. These moments are immersive, but add little to the movie that couldn't be read in a book. Any details of the soldiers' lives are rushed over, feeling incomplete and irrelevant to the story, a shame given that these components could have helped each member of the team stand out. Unfortunately, the cast of this movie look very similar, with only a few visual features to help them stand out from each other. Chris Hemsworth is the man who gets most of the attention, with the studio relying quite heavily on him in both character development and action fields. The other members got their pitches in, but they weren't as strong as the captain of the group. 
 While not the best war movie to grace the silver screen, it still has plenty of theater worthy qualities that make this worth a visit. It's an exciting, special effects spectacle complete with cultural prowess and band of brotherhood moments that you like to see in these movies. And while it paints the pictures of heroes, the movie needed some more fine tuning to really get all 12 heroes the portrayal they deserved. A little more development and a little less time at the opening may have further strengthened this movie, but ha good shot nonetheless.",8,4,12,21 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," The King Has Returned!
","Giant monster movies are always toss up when it comes to quality. They either really impress us, or turn us into monsters as we tear the movie apart. Tonight, the 'King' of monster returns to the silver screen, in what looks to be a high-definition adventure made for the theater technology. With an all-star cast including Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, and John Goodman this could be the giant monster flick we have been hoping. Robbie K is back with another review, hoping to shed some light on Kong: Skull Island. LIKES: Â• Human perspective Â• Awesome Visuals Â• Awesome Soundtrack Â• Action Â• John C. ReillySUMMARY: Most monster movies are often focused on the monster (or man in a rubber costume) wreaking havoc on the environment, only occasionally panning on a human actor. This rendition of Kong shifted that balance back to the humans, putting the tale more from there trek across the killer island. Don't get heated though, because Skull Island has plenty of moments centered on the big ape and all hisÂ…naked glory. Kong isn't the only visual the movie has to offer though, as the team is able to create the nightmare that is skull island in fantastic displays of CGI and real life setting. The environment has a culmination of setting that capture both the beauty and horror that an isolated, prehistoric ecosystem has to offer. The flora, and inanimate stone structures, aren't the only impressive visual though. Skull Island's fauna are also stunning to watch, imaginative creatures that fit well into habitats they call home. Both my friend and I agreed the team did an awesome job crafting monsters that dwell in your darkest dreams, giving them bark, bit, and in some cases slime to truly be deadly. Visuals aside, the soundtrack also has some diversity to it. Our humans theme song seems to be songs from the 70s that will have you classic rock groupies smiling with glee. While those who like powerful symphony work, will enjoy the edge the orchestra brings to the more exciting parts. Speaking of excitement, Kong: Skull Island brings the action to the full front. Unlike Godzilla (2014), Kong doesn't skimp on the monsters actually doing something other than walk around. Much of the movie involves the humans lighting the creatures up with their guns as they dodge lethal appendages. Yet Kong himself has his moments to shine, in heart pounding, special effects laden sequences that will have you screaming in delight. I myself was impressed with Kong's sweet wrestling moves, including the epic finishes our WWE guys only dream of copying. Sound like too much action? Not to worry, John C Reilly has got you covered with well- timed, well-delivered comedy to lighten the mood. DISLIKES: Â• Story is okay Â• Uneven characters Â• Rushed Scenes Â• Cheesy MomentsSUMMARY: The story of King Kong has been told in so many iterations, but most of these renditions give the beast a lot of character outside of wrestling champion. In this telling, the story takes a major dip in favor of the action. As laid out in the trailers, Skull Island's main premise is survival, with a majority of the plot focusing on our human casts journey to get off the land. Oh sure, they try to inject a few other morals into the mix (including vengeance and love) and they do try to give Kong some other qualities in an attempt to develop him. However, many of these extra points shallowly developed, lost to the special effects and battles waiting in the jungle. I missed the deeper nature to Kong's character, but I give props for venturing off the traditional path. In addition to the simplistic story, Kong's Skull Island also has some editing/developmental issues for me. First off, the uneven characters. Our band of humans is a little skewed, with some getting decent development to others being just another pretty face (that may or may not get devoured). It's the problem when hiring big casts, but this reviewer would have liked a little more backstory to add some emotional turmoil to the mix. The shallow character development paints predictable targets on most of their backs, leading to rushed moments where a character is abruptly, and in some cases pointlessly, eliminated. Sure, it keeps in theme with the island is always hungry, but Skull Island's team needed to go in a clean-up these hasty moments. Ironically, the one thing (outside of the action) they focused on was the anger/hate between Kong and Jackson. Yours truly found the intense stare off and peeing contest between the two to be a touch overdramatic and drawn out. Suspense building? Maybe. Ridiculous? You bet it is. The VERDICT:Both my friend and I agree that Skull Island is one of the better portrayals of the King of the Jungle. With impressive visuals, dangerous environment, and fantastic battles, this is the monster movie we have been waiting for. While there are some story elements that need tweaking and some balance restored, the film gives me faith for future giants vs. human films and the inevitable sequels to come. With all the special effects and action, yours truly recommends this one for the theater, and could see it having some extra oomph in 3-D. And despite what you may expect, one should stick around when the lights go down. You might just find yourself stoked for what is to come.

Murder on the Orient Express," All Aboard For Another Mediocre Adaptation
","Mysteries, a genre that intrigues so many with complex tales, intertangled deception, and often drama to help build suspense before the big revelation. While many people try to combine mystery with other genres, there are those who choose to focus on mystery alone. One of these artists is Agatha Christie, a forefront writer who continues to tease our brains with crimes that dive into deeper levels. And with great literature, comes great grounds for Hollywood to make movies from it. This particular tale has gotten a remake this weekend, one with a star-studded cast to try to bring people into the movies in this modern telling. What's in store? Please read on to find out as we review Murder On The Orient Express. LIKES: Setting: Start off with a simple like, this film is a shining example of green screen visuals blending with real world shots. The snowy wilderness of the mountains is a dazzling spectacle of symbolism that mirrors the foreboding crime that hangs over the Orient Express. It's a breathtaking display of technology that keeps the darker spirit of the movie alive, and may leave you chilled at the menacing nature hanging in the air. But the highlight is the train and the recreation of those elegant cars and cabins the locomotive industry was famous for. This recreation takes you back in time and immerses you in the classical setting, while also designing a death trap to which our players partake in. The Mystery: For a movie that focuses on the classic question of who done it, Murder on The Orient Express did a nice job keeping the mystery going. The screen adaptation drops enough hints to throw one off the path, all while keeping you engaged in deciphering the identity of the culprit. As our detective interviews all the characters, you will start getting an idea of how complex the whole case is, further shrouding the scene in a veil that tries to keep you from the answer. It works, keeping suspense going and the film moving, which isn't easy in mysteries these days. Kenneth Branagh: Acting wise all the cast do their jobs very well, some better than others in terms of screen time, elegance, and of course capturing their accents down correctly. Yet of all the groupÂ… it was Kenneth Branagh who I enjoyed watching the most. True, he is the main character and thus gets the most screen time, but his acting was very enjoyable to watch for nearly 2 hours. His French accent is not the best at times, but he gets the OCD detective role down pat, catching the nervous energy and single minded focus that comes with the disorder. His explanations of the crime are delivered in such a serious tone, confidence filling the voice as he presents his logic and convinces you of all the facts. Finally, his comedic delivery is also very well done, not too forced and well-integrated into the conversations, Branagh carries a lot of the movie on his sharply dressed shoulders. DISLIKES:Slow: We know mysteries have to go slow to build things up, but Orient's wheels really slog at times. Primarily when it comes to linking a few backstories together, the movie sort of derails into from the path at hand. Losing this momentum takes away from the suspense, and sort of gets a yawn if you don't pay close attention to the dialogue. And even when they resume chasing the mystery once moreÂ… they drag things out in a grandiose display that does hold emotion, but steps far over the line for this reviewer. Unbalanced Characters: A star studded cast again calls for time management and using your resources well. Orient took a nice shot, but they failed to really give the characters equal time on the screen. I don't know how the book is written, but it was obvious the casting favored certain actors over others. Certain characters really get the shaft in this installment, brought out of the shadows for mere seconds and a few answers, before dropping off the screen. This happened with at least four characters for me, brief introductions that were certainly important, but almost confusing at some points. Certainly, Christie did better in displaying her suspects in the book, but they didn't do it as well as I think they could. Rushed development: It's a plus to have a mystery that moves, it is not so much a plus when your key development areas move like a blur. Murder on the Orient Express involves one having to listen to the dialogue extensively to piece things together, primarily in the alibis of the characters. For me, there were a lot of rapid dialogue exchanges that hastily were spilled out in an attempt to give our characters some background. This background information is incredibly important, so perhaps they should have shifted to a lower gear to clarify this information and establish that depth they were going for. Such a shame to have all these details smeared in a half-sloppy manner when there was such potential to be had. The VERDICT:Compared to the book and the older rendition of this movie, Murder on The Orient Express 2017 is not the shiniest noire in the box. Great visuals, a luring mystery, a phenomenal main character will carry the audience far in this film and provide the main source of entertainment in the film. The main problem is that the team didn't deliver on the potential that this story/cast had. It was unnecessarily slow at points, characters were lacking in a very character centric plot, and it was rushed in areas that was the sustenance. Therefore, the movie overall is mediocre, and better left for a free pass/RedBox in this reviewer's opinion. My scores are: Crime/Drama/Mystery: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",7,0,6,11 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Pets on the Run, Make for Silly, Family Fun
","Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen. The GOOD Â• Cute/Kid Friendly Â• Funny Â• Good animationWhen you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored. But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats. And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities. THE BAD Â• The Story Â• Lack of Uniqueness Â• Trailers showed you a lot of the movieWith the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. UnfortunatelyÂ…it didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale. To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is definitely a disappointing factor. The VerdictThe Secret Life Of Pets is exactly what the trailer promises, fun, entertaining, and wildly adorable. Younger audience members, as well as those very young at heart, are the target group for this movie hands down. It has the laugh factor certainly, and the cast of characters are a motley crew that I certainly enjoyed. However, the story is very simplistic, the lack of emotional suspense, and that much of the movie is told in the trailers make this movie not the most memorable of the summer. I can't say it is worth a trip to the theater in comparison to some of the other kid movies, but it makes for a good family outing.

Finding Dory," aDORYable
","The Disney magic has been unleashed once more, and this time they bring us yet another sequel. Today's review takes to the depths of the ocean, to a reef that ten years ago served as the stage for the adventure of three fish in a great blue ocean. Yes, today we review the ever anticipated Finding Dory. Will this sequel be everything you wanted? Has Disney cheated us out of quality once again? Please read to find out. Is it any surprise that Pixar has surprisingly managed to bring comedy to their works? If it is, then shame on you for not watching more of their films. Finding Dory has a little bit of something for everyone that had the audience (including yours truly) laughing up a storm. Kids will love the exaggerated, goofy, slapstick comedy and guttural noises, often repeating the words over again as if a second time will make it even funnier. Adults, however get the better end of the deal for once, with plenty of references that older audience members will relish in, while their kids will just stare at the pretty colors and cute fish. Speaking of cute, despite some of the more adult references this film maintains that charm and magic that Disney brought with the first film. Dory is adorable, her innocence and sincerity by far the most endearing quality of the film. Her flashbacks to her younger self had everyone in the audience going awwwwww, and her moral compass brought the emotional tearjerker to the eye. Outside of the blue tang, Nemo is still as cute as a button and the new addition Destiny was sweet as well. But all of this factors down to the legendary talk show host Ellen providing amazing voice work. Ellen's dynamic personality carries over into Dory and keeps the film fun and energetic (yes like a dog). Her delivery is jokes is perfect and very Ellen like and the more emotional moments are laced with a strong talent Ellen has. Yeah, the other actors did a great job, each providing their own zing, spin, and emotion to the mix, but Ellen as the headlines was the thing that won me over. In particular, the interactions between Hank and Dory were by far the most entertaining of the bunch. As for the animation, there are no surprises that Pixar did a fantastic job as always. The fish move just like fish, delicately floating in the sea until something massive attempts to make dinner out of them. The water itself is also fantastically brought to life, each component of it looking incredibly realistic in terms of texture and fluidity. These detail even carry over to the environment itself, as the reef, wreckage, and the marina are brought out into the high definition detail Pixar is famous for. If only the humans looked better, then everything would fall into place. Okay, I know I'm probably committing a sin by calling out some of the weaknesses to the film, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't provide a full report. Finding Dory's story is one area of improvement that Pixar should have looked into a little more. Think back to Nemo's tale, his dad transversed the whole ocean with Dory facing dangers and uncovering areas of the reef we only saw in documentaries. It was exciting, it was exotic, and it was incredibly detailed. Not the case in this one. Finding Dory had a lot of emotion and the comedy was there to make it fun, but it wasn't as exciting as its predecessor. The dangers of the deep were a little more lax, and the aquarium while stunning, didn't have the same edge we got all those years ago. Seeing Dory's flashbacks were great in the character development strategies, but the obvious foreshadowing and diluted suspense had me feel something was missing. In addition, while the comedy was fun for all ages, it got overdone at times. Yes, little kids can't get enough of anything and from a market standpoint it makes sense. However, in terms of quality, blasting the audience with whale noises, silly sounds, and smacking into walls begins to lower the scores a bit. Most will probably be okay with beating the dead house, but for me I like a little more balance in the comedy than what I got in this film. Jumping back to the story, I felt manay characters got the short end of the stick in this film. No surprise that Dory takes the center stage, hence the title, but does that mean that characters like Marlin and Nemo have to be reduced to a shell of what they once were. Again, think back to Finding Nemo, a good balance between Marlin's adventure and Nemo's struggles in the tank. In this film, Marlin and Nemo are more side characters with some humorous moments, but seldom important for the story. I'm sure this was to help give the movie a different feel, but they could have done better to balance their characters. Finding Dory is still a great addition to the Pixar library. It's fun for all ages, very sweet, and packs the same animation punch this studio is famous for. Unfortunately the story is not as exciting as the first travel into the blue void and some of our characters get the short end that is disappointing. Overall though, I'm happy with the adventure and I hope that many will enjoy this movie as much as I did. Worth the 3-D showing? I can't say it makes the total experience, but the visuals promise even better detail in 3-D. Is it worth a trip to the theater? YesÂ…yes it is.

The Conjuring," Conjure up some bravery for this scare
","The trailers have ranted about how good and scary this movie is. Of course trailers often lie and overexaggerate on how scary something is. Well that's not the case for this movie, as The Conjuring has all elements that a good horror movie needs. Rather than filling the movie with gore, overacted screaming, and ridiculous killing as is the trend these days, this movie has a story that drives the horror within. Fans will be creeped out by the gradual introduction of the spirit, and further terrified by the subtle things done to the family. Of course creepiness isn't the only scare factor they have, there were plenty of times where the movie made you jump with a sudden noise or character. Those who ar ereligious will get an extra scare factor added to the mix, as the spirituality embedded into this film might get you stirred up at points. All of these factors make the movie feel realistic, which again makes it scary to so many levels. The scariness was built around the story, allowing for the tried and true methods to not be overdone/ overstretched, or sloppily integrated into the movie to get a scare out of the audience. Even the characters were integrated into the story well, and once again the horror was built around them, although not as well with the girls. Overall this movie is one of the better horror movies. Go see it, but don't set your expectations to high to avoid getting disappointed as often happens. Do yourself a favor though, DO NOT bring any kids to the film, or you're asking for trouble.

Prometheus," So Many Unanswered Questions
","Science fiction and horror, two genres that when mixed together usually wind up in Scy Fy channel massacre that is predictable, cheesy, and often generally boring. Despite the sea of mediocrity though, some directors know how to make a scary science fiction movie, i.e. Alien and Predator. So when I saw Ridley Scott was making an attempt at the genre I couldn't help but think another winner was upon us. Was this movie, titled Prometheus, a worthy addition to great science fiction/horror genre? The answer for me is not really. To hear more about my thoughts please keep on reading.If you've seen the trailers then you will see that Prometheus is tale about a group of human scientists and engineers who set sail for the stars after discovering an ancient map. The goal of their mission is to discover the origins of the human race. Upon arrival to the coordinates, the team discovers something much more sinister and terrifying than they ever imagined, something that if left unchecked could destroy the very foundation of human life. This is the tale of Prometheus. To start this review off we should answer the question as to whether this movie lives up to the fear potential the trailers promised. Hate to say it, but it was not really that scary, and for me was more humorous than anything. Many of the jump at you scary scenes were predictable, which took away from the scare factor. The dark and dismal tunnels were actually well lit for a horror movie, and didn't hold many terrors within its shadowy walls, making the movie feel more like a spelunking adventure than anything else. What replaced the horror was instead a creepy and sometimes cringing atmosphere that at some points was very disturbing to see. The creatures within had more graphic and primitive kills, which the movie was happy to show every detail. A few scenes in the movie I felt took the graphicness too far again showing a lot of detail, and blood, to turn a lot of stomachs. There were also a few attempts to scare/creep out the audience that failed to be anything, but cheesy violent outbursts that were used to do nothing more than kill off crew members. What other weaknesses can I pick out for this movie? I think the biggest weakness of them all was the lack of explanation for a lot of things in the movie. At various points in the movie, Scott and his team touched base on a variety of topics that had the potential to be interesting and shocking. However, this slight scratch of the surface was all that really happened. Instead of elaborating or explaining any origin to the various incidents that happened, they left the audience in the dark and left to piece out the information on their own. While some things can be somewhat figured out, there is a lot of uncertainty and vagueness that leaves the audience wanting more, which hints at a possible sequel. Perhaps what makes this lack of explanation even more disappointing is the potential the movie has as the crew prepares to disembark the ship. In a manner very similar to Aliens, the crew preps very familiar weapons and equipment for the unknowns of the barren world. However, rather than live up to that potential, Prometheus marginally uses these tools for anything and instead is filled with nothing more than screaming scientists. This brings me to my next point, a majority of this 'smart' crew didn't make the best decisions and instead they felt more like airheaded teenagers in a slasher movie. The exceptions to the rule were the characters played by Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Idris Elba who did good work portraying competent and noble characters. Fassbender in particular had the most diverse character of the crew, capturing the deceptive, curious nature to a letter, while still managing to add some comedy to the mix as well. Rapace's character did a little more crying than I expected, but she still managed to play a scientist who uses logic until pushed to the breaking point. Those wondering about Charlize Theron in this movie may be disappointed to learn that her character really doesn't have a big role to play in this movie, at least not a very deep role. Although she had the serious captain attitude down to the letter, Theron really didn't do much other than walk around the ship and scream for the crew not to do anything. On the occasion she actually did something, well it was okay, but they made her character pretty stupid at points. Okay so other than some decent acting there are a few positive aspects to this film I wish to share as well. For one thing the team did a nice job with the visuals and settings to really paint an alien tomb that is somewhat freaky. Combine this with some well-fitting orchestra music and some well edited shots and you get some strong feelings of pride, curiosity, and some creepiness. A few of the creatures were even well designed to look real as opposed to looking like some digital blob that is obviously fake. Some of the dialog is fitting for the characters as well, as the writers used jargon and lingos that were accurate of a scientist/engineer.Overall Prometheus is okay, though its vague information really leaves you wanting more by the end of the two hours. With very little horror and use of some of the Alien series props, this movie for me was not worth the wait. So my suggestion is to wait on this movie for Netflix or Redbox before giving it a try. My scores for the movie are the following: Action/Horror/Science Fiction: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0 So until next time my friends, keep enjoying the movies and check back soon for my next review.",6,1,3,9 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Wander Over To Wonder!
","It's a brand-new month and you know what that means right? Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn't Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn't gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today's review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios? Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter, so let's get started, shall we?LIKES1. Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise, pizazz, and acting talents. A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty, ferocity, and bouts of heroism (a.k.a. kicking bad guy butt). Acting, stunts, and an on-point delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book!2. The action is on point (for most of the movie) filled with impressive displays of weaponry, martial arts, and historical warfare. Wonder Woman's battles held such emotion, managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good, post battle high, you might have gotten from reading a comic book. The team brings some fast-paced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half.3. A good representation for girls. I may have already said this, but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner. Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything. 4. Comedic timing: It's not going to be a super hero movie (at least in this day and age) without some laughs to break up the tension. Wonder Woman continues this trend, filling the void with well-timed one-liners, a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex, and some slap-stick gimmicks that do the job well. 5. Character Development: I know most super hero movies have this element, but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me. This film managed to spin Diana's character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up. Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed, using multiple angles to get the job done. It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack, the visual effects, or maybe Gadot's acting, but it really worked for me. 6. Fast Pace: We all know those movies that drag (and yes, I'm talking much of DC's library). Not the case for this film. The nearly 150-minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying, 'Dang, it's already been 90 minutes.' Not something I often say. DISLIKES:1. Unoriginality: You'll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America: First Avenger. The set-up, setting, and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves. Certainly, not the biggest limitation, but something that others have been bothered by. 2. Almost pointless crew: The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture, but it was dropped so hard in this movie. Outside of Chris Pine, the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws, some 'tracking' and mainly comedic relief. There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics, but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July. I know, this movie is about Wonder Woman, but why even include these guys if that was the goal. 3. Preachy: Some reviews state the whole feminism/males are pigs is overdone, and to an extent I agree. Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film. A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of self-reflection, which is great, but not in the midst of a battlefield. Some of these moments also had that eye-rolling factor for me. 4. Overuse of CGI: I like special effects, I like stunts, but I don't like overuse of a gimmick. The slow-motion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Woman's skills (alongside some cool finishing moves). Somewhere along the production, someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me, and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do. In addition, there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman. Learn from Michael Bay people, too much of special effects makes for many jokes. 5. The ending: Don't turn away, hear me out. The ending is great on many levels (emotional, prowess, role model, and morals). However, it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them, trading suspense for flashy special effects, drawn out banter, and unimpressive choreography. Sort of felt like the ending to X-men apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite. The VERDICT:Wonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year. It's emotional, it's dynamic, it's fun, and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes. I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product. It's far from perfect though, and still has a few things to tighten up (like developing other characters, balancing the CGI use, and keeping the momentum going). Still, I have to recommend this one for a theater visit, especially you comic lovers out there.",9,125,291,1 June 2017
Taken 2," Less Bite to this action flick
","I've been gone for a while so I apologize to those looking for my reviews. However, I am back with my latest review on Liam Neeson newest film, Taken 2. Surprised to see a sequel from an already great movie? So was I and I was also a little disappointed to hear Hollywood make a sequel of an already complete story. What were my thoughts on this movie? Read on to find outWhat is the story for a movie about a girl being kidnapped and an elite operative father going into the underworld to find her? Simple another tale of kidnapping and rescue, with a little vengeance thrown into the mix to help find a justifiable, though cheap, reason for a sequel. Yet the directors decided to throw a 'twist' into this movie to barely escape robbing us of a good tale and that is the mother and Liam Neeson are kidnapped. Some difference huh?You might be saying, I go to see these movies for other reasons than a story Robbie, I go to see it for Liam Neeson because he is the man, the action of a fast plot, or in some cases to see a hot girl. Will I get my money's worth if I go for those things? I'm happy to share my opinion on that, starting of course with Liam Neeson. As you might have guess, Neeson once again plays the role of a stoic warrior with a mad set of skills, whose only weakness is a soft spot for his beloved daughter and wife. His ability to transform from a gentleman into a killer still impresses me and the fact that he can say so much with little dialog is a skill I continue to admire. Thus if you're a fan of his previous movies, where he pretty much pays the same character, you are going to love him in this movie again. However, something that was a little fresh in his role was a little humor mixed into his limited dialog. It wasn't the lines that were funny, but more of the delivery of the lines that had me chuckling. His reaction and facial expression as he spoke these awkward lines helped deliver a punch to a rather dry dialog, which may not be what you're going for in this movie, but is worth mentioning. I suppose I should talk about the action for this movie though, as this series banks its success on adrenaline pumping scenes. Well my friends, you're in luck, this movie still has the qualities that made the first film so memorable. Car chases, gun fights, and some martial arts are all mixed into a heaping combo of high octane action that will have young boys screaming wow, and Neeson fans clapping in their seats. The directing staff did a nice job integrating the physical skills of a special ops agent, a.k.a Neeson beating the crap out of a bunch of terrorists, with the more subtle and calm skills of a tracker. Just like in the first film, fans will most likely be saying Neeson is still a bad @$$ as ever, and shouldn't' be messed with. Unfortunately there are a few flaws to the action. The first is the jumpy camera work that is present throughout this whole movie. While it is not the worst I have seen, many scenes were too jumpy or not filmed in the best manner to catch the most detail. It might have been to bring a little chaos and intensity to the scene, my thoughts were more the camera crew had too much red bull and wanted to make the audience feel the same. On top of that, the action is not as creative/intense as it was in the first film. The urgency and suspense that kept us hooked into the film, was very diluted in this installment and the fact that most of the bad guys were not as sinister, evil, or threatening had me a little disappointed. The result of this new direction is essentially the same action from the first movie, with a little less bite to it.What else can I say about this movie? Well for one thing the actress who plays Kim named Maggie Grace, is just a pretty as ever. Instead of being the victim who is absent for most of the movie though, she instead has some guts that makes her worthy successor to her father's skills, which could possibly motivate the producers to make Taken 3 I fear. However, the additional screen time means more chances to view her beauty, something I think many male audience members will love. Moving away from Kim though, the movie is a decent length and pace so that the already shallow plot does not become boring. The musical score for this movie is also worth noting, as the orchestra work that plays during his gallant battles helps add that hope inspiring touch that helped pull me into the movie. Unfortunately the ending to the movie was a little bland for me and a little boring to tell the truth. Taken 2 is a decent sequel for the modern age. Neeson fans will still enjoy seeing him kick bad guy butt, while remaining calm, cool, and best of all not overacting. Without the suspense or urgency of the film though, the movie really lacks a key component to keep fans as in to the action. My scores for this movie are below: Action/Thriller/Suspense: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5 My suggestion wait for Netflix or Redbox before seeing this film, unless you need your fix of Neeson for the month. So until then this is Robbie K signing off and reminding you to enjoy the movies.",7,2,7,5 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Well Fitting End To An Awesome Trilogy
","Christopher Nolan has done it again with the latest Batman movie and has found a way to finish the trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is an action packed, dark adventure about finding redemption from past events. With sound acting from Levitt and Hatahaway, a well done version of Bane, and some high speed chases, fans will surely not be disappointed. However, for this reviewer the Dark Knight is the better movie of the two. In this movie Nolan has a tendency to make some of the characters idiots when it comes to discovering Batman's identity and a few of his dialogue montages are a poorly timed to be more ridiculous than appreciative.

Black Panther," The Panther King
","Another Marvelous weekend is here and it holds another Disney branded film to be released into the local theaters. The superhero theme of the weekend strays from the normal leads you've seen in the last few years, one who has more ferocity than the usual crew, maybe outside of the Hulk. Yes, I'm talking about Black Panther, and after much anticipation it is here and ready to unleash the cat within. Does this highly awaited film meet expectations? Robbie K is here to help out, with yet another movie review. Sit back, relax, and read on as I help out with your movie going pleasures. LIKES:The Cinematography: A good hero movie requires good visuals to bring it to life, and Black Panther reigns supreme on this level. After some unique storytelling art at the beginning, the movie resorts to beautiful blends of real-life, breathtaking shots and impressive visuals. The movie drops you into what feels like a technologically advanced city, complete with James Bond like gadgets that feel super in themselves. Black Panther's camerawork is also very dynamic, energetic enough to increase the action, but contained enough to not leaving you nauseous or confused. The Acting: Marvel movies sometimes tank in this section, but again Black Panther raises the bar on this level. Chadwick Boseman retains the regality of T'Challa from Civil War but adds more conflict and growth to the character as he struggles with the mantle of king. Michael B. Jordan comes back with a fire, once again showing that he earns his spot in Hollywood with an emotionally charged performance that seethes with that raw edge. Lupita Nyong'o brings the balance to the movie, portraying a character that acts as a solid bridge between all parties, keeping her dynamic performance balanced at the same time, while Danai Gurira grounds the characters down with her strong will and fantastic stage combat skills. Letitia Wright is the comedy of the film who has a fantastic delivery of the well-written lines this movie has. Almost all parties involved nailed their roles, with the chemistry between everyone favorably mixing to create what felt like a tribe. Fantastic job casting director. The Comedy: Marvel is all about making you laugh, sometimes making that the focus of the film and other times as a nice add-on. Black Panther took the latter for me and was tastefully done to perhaps be one of the best executions of the Marvel Universe. In this darker movie, there is a lot of tension and raw nerves exposed in the Savannah drama, with many negative emotions running rampant like the predators of the plains. Yet, intermixed in this intensity is comedic gold, or vibranium in this case, well-placed to maximize laughs and clever to avoid the usual slapstick staleness that plagues most movies. This style of comedy didn't detract from the movie but added another layer to help reset the tension and keep you engaged in the movie from start to finish. Plus, you've got a nice combination of styles in store as well, so two thumbs up for that. The Emotion in the Story: The movie does not have the most unique story, something hard to accomplish in this age of saturation. Yet this Marvel version of the Lion King is packed with so many moments to send one into an emotional fervor, sending you on a roller coaster ride of feelings. Black Panther will be inspiring to many, bringing approving claps and motivation to change the world. It's a moral filled tale that brings out the dynamic use of technology, the importance of family, and the dilemmas of a new king having to face. While I'm not the biggest supporter of dramas, Black Panther manages to make the drama feel less soap opera like that many movies fail to avoid. The Ending: Many f Marvel's movies often fail to find that satisfying ending to conclude the awesome tale. Black Panther, manages to keep everything going from start to finish and brings all the building tension to full boil with an exciting climax. All the characters are brought into the mix, having some involvement in the conflict at hand, as they fight in impressive choreographed battles. And while our combatants dance in the virtual field, the story continues to progress and the characters develop with each swing of the weapon. It utilizes all the elements that they had developed during the movie, which goes to show story telling is still alive. DISLIKES:Impressionable Hate: More of a warning, the main villain is not only skilled and deadly, but has a surprising amount of hate contained in his chiseled body. Killmonger is a character that has a lot of issues, and his plot to change the world is something that can motivate impressionable minds down the wrong avenue. Be careful when taking friends and younger audience members to the film who have difficulty understanding character flaws. Martin Freeman: The movie did an okay job with the former hobbit, but I expected a lot more from Freeman's character. Though there is some comic relief, and a little action with his character, Freeman really didn't feel that pertinent to the story until near the very end. Such a legendary actor deserved some more relevance to the plot, some extra comedy, or at least some better development to justify the price tag that comes with him. Not the weakest character mind you, but not what I expected. More Action: No surprise, Robbie want's more action in his Marvel movie. With Black Panther, I had worried that most of the excitement was ruined in the trailers, especially with a huge gap between those action-packed sequences. Had it not been for the ending, I would have been disappointed in this quality, but still I wanted more to be unleashed in this movie to put T'Challa's skills to the test. The VERDICT:  Black Panther is by far one of the better Marvel films to grace the theaters and shows promise for the future of the series. The tale has fantastic visuals to bring the world to life, alongside amazing writing and acting to further bring Wakanda to the playing field. It keeps its characters engaged and fills the 2-hour 15-minute run time with an emotional fervor to keep you integrated into every aspect until that incredible ending sequence. However, the movie still has a few limitations including needing a little more action, a dab more of Martin Freeman's relevance, and a slight decrease in predictability to make this a perfect film in the Marvel universe. Still, the film gets massive props for reviving the Marvel movement this year. So definitely get out there and see Black Panther and unleash the beast that dwells within all us comic book fans. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 9.0

Mother!," Oh Mother, where are thou?
","Horror movies continue to be a popular trend in Hollywood. IT's successful launch last weekend, surely inspires the trend to continue, so what the heck put out another one this weekend. Â Jennifer Lawrence takes center stage in what looks to be a psychosocial thriller to usher in a new age. Will the artistic styles of Darren Aronofsky be a welcome change to the milieu, or does its odd premise promised in the trailers might dive too far down crazy town to enjoy? Robbie K happy to fill in some gaps with another review. Let's get started. LIKES: Unique vision: Call me crazy, as many people do, but originality is something difficult to come by these days. Mother, certainly gets points for standing out, not only in the bizarre presentation and mind messing visuals, but also in the symbolism represented in the story. Amidst the mystery, drama, and other oddities in the film, one will get their fill of morals in that artistic manor Hollywood loves. One certainly won't forget this movie, or itsÂ…originality. Acting: The chemistry between Javier Bardem and Lawrence is perhaps the biggest selling point of this movie. Much of the mystery comes in the tension between the two protagonists, Bardem's deceptive nature and double speak is on point to keep you wondering what is going on. Lawrence's curiosity and desperation kept me intrigued as to how far she could go, before breaking and challenging his words. It's a relationship dynamic brought out in spades, further leading you down the rabbit hole into the mind meddling to be had. In addition, Lawrence also knows how to sell psychotic with screams, tears, and just enough raspy voice to sell suffering. Prosthetics/makeup: Grasping for straws here, but the team did a nice job with the prosthetics at hand. Injuries that arise look festering as if plagued by infection illustrated in text books. The degrading house seen in the trailers is only further detailed in the shots, black marks and degrading wood in all its glory. And Lawrence's pregnant belly is flawlessly blended into her normal skin, creating the roll that she could pop at any point. DISLIKES:Slow: Forgive me, but horror movies often move quickly to get to the scares at hand, even though they sacrifice story. While mother has a storyÂ…it moves dirt slow to the point of inducing sleep in the movie. The drama aspect takes more precedence than anything, and unfortunately it is dragged out relentlessly to the point of being annoying. This snail's pace doesn't do much for the quality of the movie, despite building up suspense for something never to come. Not Scary: Aren't horror films supposed to be scary, or at least try to get me to jump? Mother failed on this aspect much of the time, resorting to a few loud noises and people sudden turning a corner as their fright factor. The tactic grew old and soon became nothing more than a ploy to try to salvage scares. For me, the creepiest factor was seeing humans devolve into selfish, unthinking cretins makes me fear for the future. Outside of that though, not much got me on edge for this movie. Editing: I stated above the pace was slow, but that's because there was too much unneeded details for most of the movie. The drama was dragged out, the weird concepts were even longer, and there were a few scenes that I could have lived without and been just fine. Editing needed to jump in and get rid of some of this fluff, because it didn't work for me at all given the lack of scares. Yet, their hands were tied by the fact the writer was also the director. The Story: All the symbolism and artistic presentation doesn't save the audience from an incoherent story. Mother has a lot of weird subplots in it, many of which held little relevance to the overall plot. Additionally, there are lots of gaps in the plot, unless you like theorizing and reflection on the plot, because that's the only way to fill in the vague data points. The writer got so centered on its uniqueness, it didn't close the story the best I think they could do. Questions are great for discussion, but I like my films with a little more explanation than what I got in this film. And when you draw most of the conclusionsÂ…you can't help but say, 'Really? That is what this is?' Which reminds meÂ….The Weirdness: Mother started out artistically weird, but as the movie hit the halfway point it dove deep into the tortured artist route. What didn't make sense, quickly turned into a trippy, random display of negligence and rudeness, mocking the modern human while deterring from the mystery. Soon rapid time progression and sequence changes led to even more head scratching moments, that continued to shock me further to the point of asking what I was watching. The obscene violence and darker phenomenon only grossed me out, and again seemed pointless in the grand scheme of things. THE VERDICT:Mother is artistic and unique, I'll give it that, and certainly makes bold statements about a lot of cultural quarrels plaguing our world. But outside of that, it's not so much a horror movie as a though provoking, psychological thriller. A slow pace, trippy visulas, and just overall weird atmosphere, does not make for the best horror movie. So, if you had your hopes up for this one, do yourself a favor and skip this mind bender until it hits home theaters. Go see IT again instead.

Creed II," I DeCreed This One A Powerful Sequel
","The legacy of Rocky is an epic one that has etched its way into the hearts of sports movie fanatics until the end of time. Despite their outdated cinema work, the movies hold such epic bouts of fist flying destruction, brazen masculinity, and surprisingly deep portrayal of sport vs. life. It has worked super well for years, and with Creed reviving the series with a new, modern edge that showed a boxing movie can still pack the punches. So a sequel to continue the new boxer's legacy has emerged to challenge the rest of the Thanksgiving line up in hopes to win the championship of best box office. Will it succeed? Robbie K here to fill you in as I review:Movie: Creed II (2018)Director:
Steven Caple Jr.
Writers:
Cheo Hodari Coker (story by), Ryan Coogler (characters)
Stars:
Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson
LIKES:The Character Development: Adonis Creed's journey was soul searching and inspiring in the first film, and the sequel follows that back in spades. This film is dedicated to the torture of balancing pride of your career while trying to balance the other aspects of life. Adonis goes through a lot of tough mental burdens, which helps stretch the limits of the character. Of course Rocky himself still is finding ways to expand his own dynamic, still finding lessons to teach and learn as he himself goes through the throngs with his indirect nephew. A Rocky films has always been about expanding the character and the traditions continues in the 8th installment.The Music: You like rap, hip hop, and R&B, you've got yourself a soundtrack that captivates the essence of the film. It's edgy, aggressive beat mixes beautifully with the actions scenes, mirroring the fighting lion that is Adonis in his quest for reaching his goals. Be ready for some hard-hitting beats, with potential aggressive lyrics that can be offensive.Expanded Villain: Most Rocky movies do a poor job of elaborating on the villainous boxer who wishes to stop our hero. In this film though, the villains get a small subplot that helps to give them more details and appreciation. Balancing this tale with the main story, crafts a much better investment in time when it comes to designing the rival boxer that I really liked, especially when even Ivan Drago contributes significantly to the tale.The Rocky Feeling: Creed II continues the tradition of the boxing movies, by crafting a tale that is all about getting guys in the macho, masculine mode. Adonis' next tale brings the motivational force to full light, instilling the testosterone fueled training, hype, enticement, and whatever else you are looking for. Guys in my showing were hooting in delight, sometimes batting their hands together during the high adrenaline moments. As for the females, well plenty of shirtless scenes and chiseled bodies to get you swooning if you like that. Past these moments though, classic fans will enjoy the bonds of coach and trainee once again working together to face life gloves up and eyes sharp.
The Final Fight: We know the series is all about that final match, where contender and titan throw themselves into the ring in all their epic, sweaty glory. Creed II has the finale you wait for, filled with the high adrenaline special effects, sound editing, high energy shots magic that studios craft. As the bout progresses the raw emotion of both contenders is unleashed, in a manner worthy of the David Vs. Goliath status they were going for. It is an epic finish to all the buildup and lasts well enough to be worthy of inclusion.DISLIKES:A Little Too Aggressive at Times: For me the in your face, high adrenaline moments were sometimes perfectly executed. Other times it was a little eye rolling and overdone. The in your face moments, and fast to action attitude was fine in the first one, but at points in the movie it was a little sadder to watch. This plot point was supposedly conquered in the first one, yet they decided to harp on it as a recycled device. Small dislike, but we go with it.Some Unnecessary Subplots: Creed II has a lot of heart and emotion with it, working to integrate a lot of angles to take Adonis' life in to help shape the character. Some of these angles worked quite well for me, and a couple of them didn't. I won't say anything to minimize the spoilers, but there are a couple of tangents they took that didn't quite add to the movie as much as they wanted. I would have liked a few other subplots to get some more detail instead, but given the grand scheme of the movie it's not quite as noticeable.Carbon Copy: A point that might make or break the movie depending on the audience Creed 2 loses points for originality. While I understand that the first one wasn't unique in terms of stories, Creed 2 really modeled its structure quite closely to one of the original Rocky movies, guess which one. As such, the new coat of paint is quite refreshing, but given how much it follows the original in terms of main plot, it's a little disappointing given the predictability of the movie that comes with it. Will you be disappointed? It really depends on how much you hate carbon copy plots.
The Verdict:Creed II delivers on the attitude the trailer promised long ago. By expanding upon the rivals, portraying more life components with career, and maintaining the feel of a Rocky Movie it's going to please many fans of the franchise. Yet, the film still suffers from a tad too much modern aggression, some plot devices that didn't quite need to be there, and a rehashed plot that will make or break the film. Overall though, I liked it and felt it fit very well in the universe and holding quality above a number of other installments. So if you are looking for the testosterone driven plot line for the weekend, check this film out in spades this weekend, maximizing your experience in the theater. Otherwise definitely get ready for this one when it comes out to the wide public.My scores are:Drama/Sport: 8.0

Filled to the brim with energy, this movie will keep you engaged the entire time with its fantastic balance of story, characters, and special effects, this movie certainly breathes life back into the musical movie genre. The storytelling through song is a hard art to master, but this movie blows it out of the water with the magical numbers they have developed. Not only are the numbers crafted in amazing detail, imbued with energy and special effects that are worthy of representing the circus in all its oddness. Outside of the superficial aspects, the songs tell the stories and feelings of the characters, a different angle compared to the other movies I saw this week. This film's ability to illicit feelings is almost unstoppable, and one will go up and down on an emotional roller coaster that not only pulls at your heart strings, but inspires and motivates to change their way of thinking when it comes to looking at humans. 
 The weaknesses are minor, mostly wanting more to come out of this work of art, primarily in expanding the story of the characters and connecting the plots a little better to make them less like isolated events and more of a whole story. In addition, seeing the other characters get more expansion would have been nice as well. Outside of a little Hollywood glamour and CGI improvements, I don't have much that can be improved on this movie given the genres it's classified in. This movie was the champion of the holiday season, and a fantastic thrill for any and all families who aren't scared of the Circus and who especially want a true, inspirational musical. So of the movies, this one gets high regards for going to see in the theater, perhaps twice if you had as much fun as I did. My scores are:Biography/Drama/Musical: 9.5

Monsters University," Welcome to College... Monster Style
","Hello all and welcome to another review by Robbie K. This weekend we start our reviews off with the latest creation from Pixar animation studios, a company that has made many adventures for both young and old to enjoy. Like most animation studios, Pixar has had its ups and downs, but one thing that continues to shine through is the incredible animation their team puts together. Yet lately it seems that the design team has been running out of options, resulting in sequels, spin offs, or as we are seeing this weekendÂ…prequels. So gear up and grab something to drink as I share my thoughts on Monsters University.Many fell in love with the colorful universe that is Monster's Inc. and many more fell in love with the big fluff ball Sully and his lovable little human pet Boo. Yet from many of my friends and some reviewers, there was doubt that this movie would fail, since it's the dynamic duo of scaring, only this time going to school. So what did this reviewer think of the movie? I had fun watching this movie and had quite a few laughs with all the comedic punches it threw. For one thing the college world created by Pixar was very fun, colorful, and for me quite relevant that added that emotional link that can make or break a movie. The designers took great care in designing the various buildings, quads, and other campus qualities that decorate the numerous brochures and commercials. Yet the more impressive thing to this reviewer is the student lifestyle captured within the hallowed halls of MU. Hopeful geeks who want to be cool, jocks and frat bros who are stereotypical jerks, and those overzealous studiers who spend every waking moment learning the information provided in books. Yet the personalities aren't the only thing about these characters that made me laugh. Ridiculous voices, off the wall antics and hilarious faces are all in this movie. Combine this with a fun and kid friendly dialog and the fantastic voice acting, and you get a recipe for a fun summer movie Now if you think this is just going to be a cute movie that only kids will laugh at, then you've got some surprises in store. MU is filled with those stereotypical college situations that will have many laughing their heads off at the ridiculousness that arises. Don't flip out, this doesn't mean, for once, experimenting with drugs, getting liquored up, or going all the way with a female monster, this is after all a G movie. Instead Monster's University focuses on a Revenge of the Nerd motive, taking oddballs who work hard, or naturally gifted, and placing them in a world that ostracizes them for not fitting the scary cloth. Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully's (John Goodman) group are kid friendly version of the 80's group, having very unique personalities and talents that make you pity, love, and laugh at them all at the same time. Older generations will enjoy the jabs at the culture they may have experienced, while kids of all ages, and kids at heart, will giggle and scream in laughter at the embarrassing and ridiculous accidents that happen to them. When the scare games begin, the laughs get better as the montage training, accident prone competitions, and geek vs. jock rumbles begin. Perhaps the funniest factor for me though, had to be how I matched up the characters to my friends and their mannerisms. With this connection in made the movie even better for this reviewer. It wouldn't be a Disney movie though without those moments that make your heart melt, women say ooooooh, or somehow inspire you to do great things. Monsters University is filled to the brim with these moments, and like the comedy there is some relevance to the lessons they try to teach. While some may be cheesy, Pixar and Disney did a nice job building these moments into the movie to help add the dramatic effect in the silly universe. While the younger audience members will not get as much out of this, older ones will find the problems the protagonists experience, dare I say it relevant, that helps add more emotion to the film that doesn't involve a goofy face. Regardless the other reason for these moments is probably to help develop these characters further; helping to show how our lovable pals grew into the personalities we saw years earlier. As for fans of the series who have watched Monster's Inc. multiple times, you get to see some nice tie ins and references to the first movie that will make many scream with excitement. Of course there are some weaknesses in this movie that take away from the movie for me. One is, this movie is very predictable, most likely because we have already seen the fate of our heroes. Two, there are some very kiddy moments that, I know are meant to entertain the kids, but get a little overdone after the fifth time we have seen them. Three some of the other monsters we liked in the original movie get a little short sighted in this movie, including the protagonists. Finally, I was hoping to see a few other college aspects that I have experienced, though I guess we have movies like Pitch Perfect and Old School to cover those bases. With the exception of the predictability though, these weaknesses didn't hurt my score for this movieÂ… too much. Monster's University is a very fun prequel, and will be a definite for those with young family members or friends. Don't think though that this movie isn't for adults as well, because there is enough fun adventure that entertained most of the older audience members in my showing. With fun characters, stupid comedic antics, and some decent character development, I call this another victory for Pixar. My scores for this movie are:Animation/Comedy: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5",9,16,27,20 June 2013
Pitch Perfect 3," Third Time's the Semi-Charm
","It started with a song that roped a group together, and it has blown up into one of the most popular comedies to serenade the stage. The movie is Pitch Perfect and the trilogy comes to a close tonight as the Bellas take center screen once more to sing their 'potential' swan song. After copious media advertisements, does the third installment have the vocal chords to shatter our ear drums in delight? Or does it fall to bad singing in the shower.

<ul><li>The Hosts</li><li>The Random Dropped Characters</li><li>The Weak Rivals</li><li>The Other Parts Of The Story</li></ul>
Summary: Pitch Perfect 3 is a fun, comedic adventure that is packed full of laughs that we all fell in love with in the first installment. While not as good as the original, this tale toned down the comedic prompts and overacting, to deliver a nice little wrap up to the series as a whole. Beca's story is touching and not only ties the rest of the crew in, but also gives you the emotional finesse that this series is famous for. The musical numbers, while not as impressive as previous installments in terms of showmanship, has the same toe tapping power we adore in this series, so get ready to buy another soundtrack. Yet the movie still has room for improvement, primarily in utilizing its characters and the story. Many of my favorite characters were diluted in the movie, and the rivals continue to pale in comparison to the Trebletones this time in their limited screen time. Overall though, it's certainly a fun trip down comedy lane that is certain to entertain the masses both at home and in theaters. My scores: Comedy/Music: 7.5

The Ending AwkwardnessThe VERDICT:Jojo rabbit is a darker comedy, but so long as you can accept this and the ridiculous nature that comes with it, then you can expect to enjoy this comedy. It's acting is on point, the emotional levels packed within are touching and entertaining, and the comedy had me laughing extremely hard at the mocking this story told. Just like Thor Ragnarok, Waititi continues to prove his skills as a director and writer, finding ways to really bring comedy into a film, but never dump other qualities that a film needs. This art form he brings is why I recommend this movie be enjoyed at the theaters, and I hope you laugh as hard as I did. However, I'll warn people that the darker comedies, and focus on the evils of Nazi history may be too much for some audience members, so consider this before buying a ticket. Overall, this movie was a hoot and I implore people see it and have fun at the treasure trove of comedy that lies within.My scores are:Comedy/Drama/War: 9.0

Midway," Central Intelligence Leads To Accurate Though Choppy War Movie
","War is hell a wise person once said, and in many ways we the general public have no idea what it was like on those battlegrounds where so many sacrificed so much. Fortunately for many of us, the movies have offered a glimpse into the world, opening our eyes to the world that cares little of its soldiers in regards to decency and humane treatment. Many of these films are often about the action, and while not as prominent as they once were back in the day, they still offer some intense views of history. Past this introduction, this weekend, yet another historical remake is flying in to make a landing, in hopes of wowing the group once more with its depiction of the great war. Robbie K here with yet another review as we look into:Movie: Midway (2019)
LIKES:The Modern Technology Prowess
Multiple Aspect providing different viewpoints
The Intensity Of Some War Scenes
The Decent Acting
The Intelligence AspectDISLIKES:Disjointed Plot
Too many Perspectives
The Semi Forced Love Story
The Choppiness of the scenes
Semi-sloppy use of big names
The Action ScenesSUMMARY:Modern technology allows us to make things more realistic and engaging, and should in theory lead to better fights. In a way Midway accomplishes this by bringing the chaos with speaker booming effects, special effects that light up the screen, and dances with planes that once relied on plywood models. It is certainly the selling points of the trailers and should appeal to the modern audiences expectations as realism and style come together. This film though took a different approach compared to the previous theaters of war, not focusing so much on the action from America by itself, but instead dividing the focus between both parties involved. This dynamic is impressive to see because it helps show the strategy involved in something you have only read about in a history textbook, allowing for a different appreciation of the tactics in war. In fact, my favorite aspect, as well as my good buddy, both agreed that seeing the intelligence component involved with determining how to fight the Pacific campaign. Much of the film is dedicated to showing how codes were cracked, departments coordinated, and risks were taken to determine the best places to strike and this new perspective was very strongly placed. When the battles did finally occur, there are several moments where you get pulled into the intensity, feeling like you are part of the squad and in the cockpit during this operation. Nice editing on these parts, and quite an adrenaline rush at the times it works. Finally, the acting is not an issues in this film, as all personalities of war are brought in and everyone executes there roles quite well when they are on stage. I'm not saying Academy Award Level, but it's believable and appropriate for this film's approach.For all its worth though, there are several limitations for this reviewer that make the film a little less impressive compared to its predecessors. For one thing, the film feels disjointed, as our time hops and evolution of war occur a little too frequently to necessarily keep track of everything. All the pesrpectives, while again interesting, also have too much going on, leading to breaking up a lot of scenes just as they start cooking with gas. The result is a rather contained movie that struggles to find the approach it wants, with choppy scenes that sort of scatter the coordination rather than unite it. This is especially true for the romance story they try to put in here, which was unnecessary giving the presentation and could have been left out. Throw in several attempts at character development, the potential bonds that can form between a number of characters, and even the squad mates themselves and you again get sort of piece meal presentations that did not achieve what Pearl Harbor did long ago. Once more, this reviewer feels part of this is due to how many big names they have, trying to get the most out of the big price tags that come with them. Midway's crew acts just fine, but there were so many missed elements and character interactions that I feel many of these people were unnecessary. Certainly they were able to point out all the contributions they did, but to deny the full fledged chemistry and quality, well that was the disappointment for me. Finally, the action scenes. An action junky like me always crave for cohesive battle scenes that utilize their groups well, something that the early war movies, and even some films like Saving Private Ryan knew how to do. In this one, all the perspectives and heroes were scattered that the action scenes felt again very sloppy and short, chopped up moments that ended too fast or how long it took to start. Again realistically it accomplishes the portrayal, but at this point and with what the trailers built up... I wanted more out of a modern day, technological behemoth like this one looked to be.The VERDICT:Let's wrap it up then shall we? Midway accomplishes the idea of putting modern faces in traditional stories, and this theater of wars proves that trying new things does not always come together for this reviewer. Sure, the technological advantages are good and all the actors recruited do their parts to bring the group of heroes to life and retell the legacies of men who faced the demons of war. I'll also again give them props for focusing a lot on the strategy and intelligence required to pull off the miracle that we did. However, all of these perspectives and approaches to the story made for what looked like a difficulty to focus on the story they wanted to tell. The result is again a disjointed movie that struggles to bring A games to any perspective, and relies on B and C graded stories. Your truly would have loved a little more action to come together, as the trailers promised, but at least the intelligence parts work together to make for an engaging plot. For special effects it qualifies for a theater visit, but outside of that, hold this one for home viewing instead.My scores are:Drama/War/History/Action: 6.5

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Special Effects Awaken
","A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, George Lucas created a simple movie that would blossom into one of the biggest franchises in history. Over 40 years, Star Wars has managed to work its way into numerous media that keeps fans screaming in glee. After a corporate buyout, Disney has set their sights on reviving the movie franchise in the form of Episode 7: The Force Awakens. Yet with the mixed response to the prequels and dry movie spell, is the Force still strong enough to keep us entertained? Hi, I'm Robbie K and I'm here for another review on the latest Sci Fi Blockbuster, spoiler free. From the trailers, there were three questions I wanted to address in this review: 1. Is it action packed? 2. Is the acting better? 3. Does it feel like Star Wars. To answer the first question, Yes The Force Awakens is an action packed adventure that gave us a taste of nearly everything we loved from the preceding films. The strongest piece was the ship/space warfare that finally stepped back into the shoes of the original trilogy. Exciting dogfights on multiple fronts kept things diverse as both factions' ships flew about in a chaotic slew. The editing impressively brought you into the cockpit, maximizing the thrill of flying into battle against the enemy. Ground combat wise it felt similar to the original trilogy, skillful blasting with a touch of suspense to keep things exciting. As for the lightsabers, well they are off to a good start, but this movie lacked the finesse style the prequels saber fights held, sometimes being a little hokey and drawn out. Regardless, there are few dull moments in Episode 7, which may be the biggest strength of this film. Now what about the acting? You'll be happy to hear that the Episode 7 has improved on this aspect as well. This should be no surprise when regarding the prequels lack of chemistry between the leads, however in regards to the original trilogy this installment has managed to reach the same quality of acting. Our seasoned actors (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Anthony Daniels) once more bring their characters to life, just with a few more wrinkles and some digital editing for looks. Ford in particular steals the show, maintaining that charismatic, live strong attitude that we fell in love with all those years ago. Fisher's lost the majesty in her voice, but makes up for it in facial expressions and body acting that bring the feel of Leia with it. As for Daniels, well the man has not let age wear down his quirkiness, making the most of his screen time. Our new cast has stepped up to the task placed on their shoulders, and created new characters that fit into Lucas' world. Daisy Ridley leads the charge of the new generation, a nice balance of strength and vulnerability to craft a dynamic character. John Boyega drives the story and provides comedic relief to ease the tension of this movie. As for Adam Driver, he certainly has the arrogance and regality of his character down, but there are some qualities that need tweaking (either by him or the writing staff) to capture the ominous tone his predecessors had. Finally, does the Force Awakens feel like Star Wars? Yes. The Force Awakens takes the best of both proceding trilogies and mixes them into an adventure of spectacular quality. The opening crawl gets the nostalgia started, as Star Destroyers, alien creatures, and beautiful worlds emerged in high-definition graphics. I found myself laughing at the multitude of references to the classic adventures, primarily in the clever placing of small trinkets here and there. This installment also expanded the galaxy further, adding a variety of new planets, species, and technology to the mix that fit well in Lucas' world. While the nostalgia and classic references are a welcome attribute of this film, it is also the biggest issue I have with the movie. The Force Awakens has little originality to it in terms of story, essentially using recycled plot elements in this story. To me this plot felt more like a remake with much of the original story amped up to a grandiose scale that sometimes was a little too big for me. In addition, I felt this movie tried to stuff too many things into one movie, and the new additions to the film (many scrapped from the expanded universe books) felt rushed or greatly underdeveloped. Perhaps more details will come in the next movies (both main film and side stories), but for now their stories remain very shallow. I greatly enjoyed this new adventure and felt that The Force Awakens was a Star Wars tale worth the wait. It provided the whole Star Wars experience, especially in terms of the design of the worlds and the action packed plot. While the lack of originality is annoying, I think this movie sets a solid ground for any future films, one I hope to see flourish in the next five years. I definitely recommend a trip to the theater for this one, whether in 3-D or regular is your choice. My scores for this tale are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8",8,3,17,18 December 2015
Flight," Took Flight In A Different Direction
","Denzel Washington, a man of many faces, many talents, and many great roles. From football coach to psychopathic father, the man seems to be able to tackle any role and make it come to life. So I feel that fans other fellow fans of this actor were ecstatic to see his latest movie come out this weekend. The premise of this movie focuses on a pilot by the name of William Whip Whitaker who becomes a hero after saving the lives of countless passengers on a crashing plane. Despite his heroic efforts though, his blood work reveals he was intoxicated, which could lead him to life in prison if convicted of flying under the influence. What will be the outcome? I'll admit I had my skepticisms about this movie, especially the 2 hour and 15 minute time tag placed on it. In my mind I couldn't see how they could keep this case interesting for that long of a time period. However, the boys directing this movie took a different approach to entertain the audience, than an aviation version of Unstoppable. Instead the film is more a message bringing movie, one that has the potential to inspire or offend in so many ways. Unlike other case drama films, Flight immediately tells you Washington is guilty of intoxicated flying, and has some issues to deal with. Rather than working to uncover the truth of the case, this film works to see if Whip can run from his mistakes, all while continuing to binge on his guilty pleasures. Thus, one can imagine there isn't much excitement or on the seat moments in this film. That doesn't mean there isn't some emotional stimulation in this movie though. Washington once again brings a realistic edge to the character, portraying the sleaze ball Whip to a rather gruesome detail. Countless points in the movie you start to judge and despise his character, as he throws himself further down the rabbit hole. Yet at the same time, the various elements of the movie help you feel sorry for the character and somehow bring you into the mindset of someone trying to overcome his challenges. If you're looking for a film to help place you in someone's mindset, well then Flight is for you. Washington wasn't the only thing to help bring this tale to life. I'll say now that the casting director should get a pat on the back for who they cast in this film. Although Washington took most of the screen time, each supporting actor had just enough screen time and importance to continue driving the tale in different directions, helping Whip uncover more of his self. Kelly Reillydid a nice job playing a fellow addict who was going through her own problems and being Whip's crush, adding some well-timed drama to the mix. John Goodman'sacting also was well appreciated, as the big man managed to relieve the tension with his well delivered comedic lines. However the man to really help drive Denzel's character was Don Cheadle, playing the lawyer assigned to Whip's case. Cheadle's calm demeanor, and ability to act rational were perfect attributes to make the lawyer come to life. Overall, these actors are blended together in just the right amount to keep the story and laughs coming. Other than acting though, what else does this movie have to offer? For me it's again worthy to talk about the editing work in both sound and visuals. Flight's camera work wowed me as the crew found ways to capture the emotions of the scene. Whether it was a close up of the artificial red eyes, or a wide angle shot showing off the beautiful scenery of the movie, the camera was situated just right to capture all the details. I was especially impressed with the chaotic flight scene, which for once wasn't overdone in a cacophony of howling wind, explosive sound effects, and a fury of string instruments. The crew instead kept things balanced, calm, and easy to follow, while still managing to make one sit on the edge of their seat as they wonder who will make it out of this dire situation. Along with these visuals was again a well selected soundtrack to help add a little more depth to the scene. Some tracks were used to help add a sad tone to the movie, which had other audience members tearing up, while other songs were merely in the background to I guess be a stereotype to alcohol humor. Regardless, the editing is well done to make a drama like this more realistic and for me enjoyable.However, with realism comes responsibility and this movie may push the limits for some audience members. Although rather enjoyable and clever, some of the dialog will offend certain audience groups and perhaps take away something from the movie. Those who are easily insulted by religion dialogues, may not enjoy the constantly used line of, 'It was an act of God,' that seemed to be used as an excuse for every incident to befall man. Those who may be sensitive to alcohol situations may also need to desensitize themselves as well, as the realistic portrayal may strike close to home to again be offensive with their stereotypical visuals. Some of the dialogue, laced with some nice cursing, also may cross the line to make you very angry and distracted. Other than offensive stereotypes though, there are some other weaknesses to this movie. The pace of the movie is also slow and the long time tag on the movie might not have been the best decision to make. Editing could have tightened some things up.Flight has a good message, great acting, and some fantastic acting, but I can't say it is one of my favorite movies this fall. So those looking for a good drama take up this movie, but for most I say rent in on Netflix for a rainy afternoon. Drama:7.0 Movie Overall:7.0",7,5,9,2 November 2012
The Purge," To Purge or Not too Purge...
","Ever been so angry you wanted to murder someone? Apparently director James Demonaco has because today's review is all about the latest horror/thriller to grace the movie theater entitled The Purge. The concept of this is intriguing in which every year for twelve hours the government legalizes all crime, including murder. Such an idea allows for an ultimate game of cat and mouse, which if done right could allow for some scares and spine chills Of course with the countless horror movies that seem to pop up every month, it's hard to find one that is actually worth a trip to the theater. Has this movie scored a place in the hall of horror fame? Read on to find out.Despite the promises of the trailer, the Purge was not as exciting/interesting as I had hoped it would be. The explanation for the festival of the beast is rather lame as it really involves feeding the psychopath's hunger while also serving as population control. Yet for a horror movie the plot is often not what people go for, it is more so the scare factor. I'll give this movie one thing it has diversity in their attempts to terrorize the audience. For those who like a good jump, this movie has plenty of ear drum shattering sounds to try to make your body jump. The quiet halls of the house with the steady breathing of the characters sets it up perfectly, and if you don't see it coming then the sudden discharge or appearance of a hunter might make you squeal. Those who are immune to this tactic have another challenge to face though in which they are to resist the creepiness of the dark. Early on in the film the power gets cut, casting a veil of shadows in every room that seems to suck the all light and sound out. Seeing as the halls are rather spacious, well the simple suburban setting becomes a hunting ground that has you wondering what is behind every corner, until it gets overdone. Finally the last factor comes in the form of how realistic these killers are, for The Purge has ditched the zombified chainsaw wielders, aliens, and supernatural murderers for average people. While these killers are indeed overacted, more on that later, there is still something that sends chills down your spine when the killing crew arrives, especially those odd masks. Although I applaud their diversity though, the movie has a lot of downfalls that counter the angle they tried to take. For one thing, they overdo a lot of the scare attempts that it becomes rather boring and predictable. How many times am I supposed to be freaked out by a mask man or woman getting a close up? As for the darkness of the house, well that gets old too, because the size of the house is ridiculous and they tend to revisit the same rooms numerous times to again get things stale. Yet the biggest thing that I got tired of was the fact that the same dilemma happened not once, not twice, but at least three times in the movie. Kids ran off into the dark, the dad and mom got into shouting arguments, and I the constant monitor watching made it feel like I was in Safe house except without as good of acting. Despite the challenges this movie had though, there were some very symbolic messages in the qualities of movie setting. Perhaps the biggest message was the animalistic and barbaric nature that can overcome any human. The evolution of the characters into releasing their savage side as the situation gets worse brings up the question of how much does it take to give in. A battle of morals and ethics is fought at various points, mainly between the youngest member of the family and the adults who are years older than him. While a bit cheesy, overacted, and sometime pathetic, the points they raise are ones that many of us should continue to examine ourselves. Unfortunately a piece of you might die with this film as well, especially when the torturing and soulless decisions come on screen that, for this reviewer anyway, made me not only uncomfortable but pitying a lot of characters. Pushing past the morals and tests of whether or not you have a conscious the ending revs up the excitement to finish the movie fairly strong. There is some action, a few scenes that make you cheer, and some nice ties to the loose ends that form over the course of the movie, though it is not too hard to guess what is coming. Finally I'd like to make a few comments on the acting of this movie. In a nutshell most of the characters/ parts are rather shallow and simple involving nothing more than screaming, crying, and occasionally some actual dialog. Ethan Hawke was one of the better roles, had a combination of elegance and ruggedness needed for his transition. Max Burkholder was the moral driver of the story, and played the frightened kid who had a strong moral obligation to do the right thing. Rhys Wakefield had the creepy and psychotic role down pat, and despite how polite his character was, managed to drive some anger towards his character, which was I believe the intended goal. As for the rest of the cast, some aren't bad, and many of the killers/hunters are very disappointing, who at first are creepy but quickly devolve into mentally imbalanced teenagers who get rather annoying. In a nutshell, The Purge isn't necessarily the scariest thing to grace the screen. Those looking for a more realistic thriller will get their fill, but if you're looking for a quality film, avoid this until it hits Redbox. My scores for the following are: Horror/Thriller/SCi-fi: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",Null,7,15,7 June 2013
Life," Life, So Delicate, So Fragile, So Detailed In Terms of Death
","What is life? That is a question that so many researchers have tried to answer over the centuries. And what better way to try and answer that question than with a Hollywood movie production starring Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. My last review this weekend is on the movie called Life, a science fiction/horror film hoping to provide the scares of the March season. But will contact with this film give you the chills, or send you running to the illsÂ…with disappointment. Robbie K here with another review. Let's get started!LIKES: Â• True Science Fiction Â• Evolution of the creature Â• Creepy and horrifying Â• Good charactersSummary: We know most science fiction movies fall short of the genre, focusing more on the fantasy element and special effects (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.) Life though hits the genre right on the mark, dropping us amidst an international space station where research about Mars is underway. As the chaos unfolds, the crew has to use their training, knowledge, and science (and not gigantic guns) to try to outwit the beast before it gets them. And speaking of the creature, 'Calvin' as it is called has an interesting design at the start looking like a fungus. Yet the spores quickly evolve into a deflated looking star fish, and from there began to evolved into a truly destructive creature. Calvin's metamorphosis is perhaps the creepiest aspect of this film, as his search for the crucial ingredients (food, water, and oxygen) drives it to savagery (it will make you look at star fish in a whole new way).Outside of that though, some other factors that brought the thrills and chills start with the realistic setting. There rendition of the international space station looks pretty close to our own world's, minimizing the fantasy component to keep one ground in the horror the team tries to present, establishing a feeling that this could happen. To go alongside this, the other factor is how alone one feels on the station. Much like the first Alien movie (to which this pays homage to), you feel the isolation of the station as if you are the prey Calvin seeks. This added edge truly brings the horror aspect full circle Finally, the characters also help amplify the horror component of this film. It is nice to see the human cast not be a bunch of idiotic, shallow teens for once, but instead educated scientists fighting for survival (while also not being the single-minded buffoons that often take these roles). The cast was dynamic, each specialized but capable of covering their team members should something happen. Such development led to characters you actually rooted for, instead of against them as we often see in horror films. And the actors all played their roles fantastically, from Ryan Reynolds sarcasm, to Jake Gyllenhaal's scary accuracy in someone with social anxiety. DISLIKES: Â• Unneeded dramatic opening Â• More evolution of the creature Â• Predictable ending (though nice twist) Â• Savagery of killsSummary: A minor dislike I know, but Life's dramatic capturing of the capsule in the first twelve minutes was really unnecessary. All I gleamed from this opening was technical displays and a little excitement to get the mood going. There are probably a few other scenes that could have been left out as well, but these were minor compared to the big stink they made with this opening sequence. Unnecessary scenes aside, the other thing I would have liked was more development into the creature. Don't get me wrong, the final form was creepy, but after all the changes happening in the beginning (which were a stretch mind you), the team suddenly brought it to a halt. Yes, they tried to explain it via 'science', but this abrupt halt just broke pace/balance the movie was establishing, which felt a little off for me, right down to the end. Speaking of ending, Life's trailers hint at what the conclusion is, and based on my observations I had a good idea where it would go. I wanted things to be different, but sadly the ending can be predicted within 30 minutes of the show time (assuming again you haven't watched the trailers). Albeit there was a nice twist to try and throw you off, Life's directors didn't go the full distance to prove my observations wrong. Yet the biggest beef I have with this movie is the dark, disturbing, savageness the directors instilled. If you're a fan of watching gore filled deaths, suffering, and depressing looks this movie will send 'out of orbit'. For me though, these moments only take away from a movie if done too much or in the wrong manner. My biggest strike comes from the graphic death of a lab mouse (which broke my heart as most animal cruelty does). That's only the start of Life's grotesque hunt as Calvin finds disturbing ways to attack the band of researchers in immense detail. Why the directors felt the need to focus on such disturbancesÂ…I don't know, but in this case less would have been more, as the first Alien flick did long ago. The VERDICT:Overall, Life is one of the better science fiction, horror films I've seen in years. It drops the grandiose serial killers and idiotic victims, and upgrades to an adapting monster hunting intelligent people. This realism crafts a more suspenseful tale that kept me engaged, while crafting that horrifying atmosphere I love. While most of my dislikes are small, the mutilation involved, alongside some scientific imbalances, really didn't impress me in this movie and the predictable ending didn't necessary wow me as well. Is this worth a trip to theater? If you are looking for a good horror film, then by all means hit the theater for it. As for weak constitutions, skip this one and save some time.

Kingsman: The Secret Service," No Secret that This Is A Good Movie
","When you think of Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin, and Galahad you most likely refer to the knights of the round table lore. Well this weekend, director Matthew Vaughn brings to the screen another variation of the classical names in the form of Kingsman: The Secret Service. After seeing the cardboard standees for months before the first trailer I pondered what was in store. So when the trailer came a calling this is what I, and maybe you, might expect: Insane Action, Samuel L Jackson being himself, Comedic dialog, and hopefully an engaging plot. Probably more, but I have a word limit. What you get:1. The team delivered on their promise of action, as Kingsman is loaded with high adrenaline scenes. From the get go things start off with a bang, and quickly transition into shootouts that are custom to the Bond film franchise. However, shootouts in this day and age can't be like the days of wild west, but require some extra edge. Again this movie succeeds, integrating both hand to hand and gunplay into well choreographed bouts of destruction where both villain and hero make their moves. Now you might be thinking, oh great another movie like the expendables, just what the world needs. Not the case my friends. You see, Kingsman does something that is rare these days in which there is a purpose for the action. All the exciting scenes have a purpose in this film and each one is pertinent to the plot instead of just there to add some boom to the mix. Even better is that the action is not restricted to just shoot outs as well. No you're not having an auditory hallucination, the action extends beyond the bullets and bombs. The first half of the film is all about the interview, detailing training without going too extreme. However, just because our recruits are training doesn't mean the world stops, and the rest of the agents are out progressing the story as they try to solve the crime at hand. Regardless, the action is well done and proof that you can still have a decent story with action to support. 2. Samuel L Jackson is still the same man we have always seen: dark and funny. Once again he steps into his bad boy role, only this time dropping the forlorn intimidation for a charismatic homeboy trying to change the world. His delivery of his explanations are hilarious, playful and straight to the point, yet still carrying that edge he is famous for. Adding the lisp to the lines was also a great move, and his role was one of the more enjoyable villains I've seen in a while. 3. Outside of Jackson though, the comedy was strong throughout the whole movie and performed in a variety of ways. The dialog is very clever and quick witted making fun of a variety of cultural trends and themes. Big macs, sex jokes, even clichÃƒÂ©d spy movie references, nothing was left untouched by this film. Yet lines can only do so much. Fortunately with the cast they assembled the delivery of the screenplay was executed well. Colin Firth's sarcasm and prestige were excellent media to execute insults and observations. Taron Eggerton's bad boy, hard knocked life approach was perfect for the spy in training and carried a different type of edge that mixed well with the fray. Even the environmental comedy was fantastic, with multiple crashes, punches, and other acts of violence carrying a humor filled twist that had my roommate and I rolling in our chairs. However, the biggest laughs for me come from some of the darker jokes of the film, in particular one event that will have your head exploding with laughter. 4. This brings me to my next point of the movie; you get a lot of darkness to this tale. Audience members will be subjected to people being cut in half, bullets flying out of heads, extreme violence, and racist antics, and I'm still not covering everything. Now you might think this ruins a good movie, but it doesn't, as the darker nature of this film brought suspense into the movie. How you ask? Simple, they are not afraid to push their characters to the limit, even pulling a few surprises like the Walking Dead that may just have you saying 'What the f&(*'. The darker aspects of this movie help round out the film and provide some valuable story plots and action, that a lighter hearted tone might have limited. Nevertheless, I caution for squeamish and younger audience members to check themselves before seeing this film, or they might become haunted or sickened by the inhumane (and sometimes ridiculous) moments. As my buddy said, Kingsman is a movie that has a lot of qualities and all blended together in a manner that is balanced. The story is laid out quite well, the plot itself engaging and organized to allow for action and comedy to take its place. All of the action had a purpose and was dynamic as opposed to other films of the genre. Comedy wise, again the dynamic nature of it allows lots of jokes and bashing on just about every culture. Vaughn and his team have made a great film that was well shot, well edited, and packed with enough excitement to make the two hours fly by. Yes, the darker themes were not quite expected, and the cursing/ cultural insults were a little much for me at times. However, both my buddy and I strongly recommend hitting this film in the theaters, especially with the dry spell coming up. My score for this film: Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",9,2,10,14 February 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Getting Wicky with it
","The Boogeyman has had a lot of different forms over the years from grotesque features, grossly deformed into the vision of nightmares to a man with slicked back hair and aÂ… depressed look on his face? No, I'm not delirious my friends, but the reference I made is to the codename of John Wick, the legendary assassin of 2014. After a thrilling, and complete conclusion, one may have thought Wick's journey ended there. Obviously, Hollywood did not think so and thus comes Chapter 2 of the action adventure and whatever, random target that is assigned. Robbie K here, and today we take a look at John Wick: Chapter 2. Let's get started!Likes: Â• Dry sense of humor Â• Visuals and special effects Â• Stable camera work Â• Lots of action and excitementSummary: There isn't much in regards to John Wick, so finding a like outside of action, but one component is the dry sense of humor this film has. Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a man of few words, but the few he speaks are worth a good laugh. The writers win points for a dialogue that is both pun filled and classy, timing them at key points to maximize laughs while sticking to the stoic nature of our players. Yet the humor is just an added bonus to what is John Wick's strongest feature, the action. All the reviews are in agreement that Wick is back with more action than ever imagined, as this one-man army unleashes a storm of well-placed bullets, knife slashing (and sometimes pencil) stand offs, and Marshal Arts punches. Wick's skills with a pistol (among other weaponry) are intense displays of choreography, proving that you can coordinate extras dying to imaginary wounds in an exciting way. The hand-to-hand combat also gets points, not quite as developed as the 70s and 80s movies, but still an enjoyable element to mix things up. Helping support all the action is impressive special effects, which adds the extra flare and touch that gets our hearts pumping (e.g. explosions, crashes, and comic book bashing sounds). You can guess there is plenty of blood to go around too (for you gore seeking fans), which adds more to the chaos and violence at hand that somehowÂ… adds a bit of satisfaction to the mix. But even better, is the entire film has stable camera work that keeps you scoped on the action without making you vomit due to vertigo. Overall, this exciting package gets two thumbs up in its etiquette, design, and impressive work on the action. Dislikes: Â• Keanu's acting (at times) Â• Simplistic story Â• Overstepping boundaries at times Â• Some fights a bit blocky Â• Unorthodox presentation Â• Slower parts a bitÂ…too slowSummary: While we never expected an academy for this performance, there are times where Keanu's acting is a bit too lax. His lines are meant to be serious, but come out awkward, effortless, and sometimes bored at the unoriginal dialogue. While this certainly isn't a big weakness, there are moments where this acting took away Wick's awesome factor, or made me chuckle unintentionally. Acting aside, the story is another limiting factor that Wick really needs some fine tuning on. Yes, I know story isn't the main theme of this series (hence why I make a genre rating people), but movie overall this film's plot is a little less put together than its predecessor. A random guy shows up, tells a vague back story to establish a weak connection, and then becomes another revengeful chase across two cities. All the convoluted (shallowly explained) relationships and teases did nothing but make more targets for Wick and did nothing to add to the story for me. Finally, while the action is indeed awesome and well done, there are still a few limitations that hit this quality. First, those who aren't fans of repetitive gun play and headshots, need to skip this filmÂ…because that is a majority of the action. But outside of repetition, the action sometimes oversteps the boundaries of realism. A car mercilessly being smashed (and smashing) yet still running, a number of injuries that magically heal, and the inaccuracy of other assassins are just some of the eye-rolling moments of this film. In addition, some of the fist fights get very blocky, have awkward pauses, or lack the edge (music and sound effects) that make the fighting less exciting and more we just extending screen time. Another component I didn't like was how they reduced Wick's fighting of other assassins to a messy set of montages that seemed out of place and were lackluster compared to Wick fighting off nameless extras. Such missed potential for memorable rivalries, and more diverse fights. And even more missed potential, was the slower parts not taking time to advance a story, or establish better character dynamics, which made for some dragged out moments.The Verdict:Wick's journey of revenge and killing is certainly more exciting than his last ordeal. The emphasis is on the action, with a majority of the film geared towards the stunts, effects, and violence, so adrenaline junkies strap up and hit the theater. However, if you are looking for the complete package of story, dynamics, and balance, then this film isn't the right one for you. Wick still lacks a lot of other qualities in the movie overall category. Worth a trip to theater? Yes, as the special effects and excitement are made for the theater. But if you can't handle extreme violence then skip!My scores: Action/Crime/Thriller: 8 (for the action) Movie Overall: 5",8,11,21,11 February 2017
Annihilation," Annihilates The Mundane, but Still Needs Some Editing
","The Science Fiction genre, a group of films that often get wrapped up in other genres that they stray far from the roots established long ago. A true science fiction, is often a thriller that tests the limits of reality, dives deep into the psyche of the characters, and often brings a fictitious world that we can only dream of to life. And this weekend, another movie looks to fall into this category and actually belong into it. Annihilation starring Natalie Portman looks to be a movie that contains many strange elements, wonders, and thrills to warrant a venture into the movie theater again. What lies in store? Well Robbie K would be happy to share his thoughts with another review. Let's get started!LIKES:The World Building: Within Annihilation, lies the anomaly called the Shimmer and within it a world that has been mutated by some unknown force. As our 'heroes' for lack of a better word venture into the gasoline mixed with water looking border, the world contained within is a wonder in itself. Our world's natural flora and fauna are bizarrely twisted into these contorted visuals that look natural, beautiful, and a true representation of the genetic crossing that we all studied in school. The world's scientific art continued to grow only deeper and darker as they traveled further into the void, the animation and creativity being unleashed into the chaotic skew with no limitations. Some of these creations are stunning in terms of color, while other times they are the things of nightmares, whose movements and designs will leave you huddled in your chair. Science Fiction Thrills: In addition to the world itself, Annihilation is all about the true Sci-Fi adventure. An unending suspense hovers over the air, the tension always mounting at what lies within the glades of this weird dimension. The mystery of what is causing this continues to build across the course of the movie, as well as if our heroes will make it to find the answer. Annihilation's threats do exist outside, but even more dire is the psychological warfare the Shimmer plays on our girls. Disturbing imagery is only one assault to their psyches, as they are pushed from all fronts to confront whatever it is eating them inside. And in addition to bringing suspense, the characters get some major development, shelling out their background information and helping them adapt to the ever-changing world around them. This culmination is very entertaining and truly worthy of the sci-fi mantle in terms of plot. Deep: A good science fiction movie makes you think, and Annihilation has got you covered in this element as well. As you try to solve the mystery of the movie and the fantastic twists that get thrown in, you'll find deeper meanings behind the actions of the movie. Many of these are head scratchers, trying to figure out just what the Shimmer is doing. While not as complex as Arrival or Matrix, Annihilation still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve to bend your mind and get you trying to process all the weird information it throws at you. As you process this, you may uncover deeper, morale dilemmas, horror filled thoughts of the future, and even the fragility of order are all up for questions. This artistic flare is certainly a score booster, though fair warning that these deeper meanings are also disturbing at times too. DISLIKES: Savage/Disturbing: With a title like Annihilation, one needs to be ready for darker undertones and source material. However, this movie goes down a very graphic path that was able to penetrate my desensitized shell. Found footage reveals some rather violent outcomes for previous teams, with little to no censorship of details that are capable of causing some to lose their lunch. The savage nature of the beasts and the violence held within just about everything in this film throws no punches, again choosing to display the gory details that fail to dampen. Flashbacks: The flashbacks are certainly for character development and some of them set the story up nicely for the bombs to be dropped. Others however, are unnecessary details that did little other than show the suffering we already knew she held and expand the run time. Complete as it was, I didn't quite pick up on the significance of some of these wasted scenes and could have held better storytelling elements to help build the suspense. Not all of these have to be eliminated, but editing could have used some tightening up to make everything more relevant. Deeper supporting characters: The movie is primarily about Natalie Portman, shocker there, and at the start it showed some promise that the other members of her team would be more integral to the mission. Yet, things decrease fairly fast to where the other characters soon become rushed plot lines, trinkets to tax Leah (Portman)'s conscience and further push the psyche limitations of everyone. Had they given some better relationships, a little more teamwork, and integration of all characters, perhaps then we would have had even stronger development and thrills to enjoy. The Weird Ending: You know that feeling you get when after the big wait the ending turns out to be something you didn't/or maybe never wanted to expect? Well Annihilation was kind of like that for me. The twist at the end was great, bringing relevance to some of the flashbacks, and really blowing your mind. However, the entity itself is not quite as awe-inspiring or terrifying to say the least. The source of the trouble is abstract, creepy, and very hard on the ears as it tries to communicate in sounds you have heard in the trailers. This final scene is super prolonged, and quite uncomfortable at times to watch as this dance of perverted awkwardness commences. Is it unique? Yes, but it still didn't quite match what I wanted. And for those who don't like abstract thinking and deciphering the conclusion yourself, hate to break it to you, but you won't get all the explanations you might be looking for. Yeah, it's weird.
The VERDICT: Annihilation may have looked weird, and it's true it is an odd spectacle to behold to the general audience. However, it is a true sci fi thriller in meaning, thought provoking, stunts, and world building, to the level that fans of the genre will be pleased with what the studio brought out to you. It's weaknesses for me come in it went a little too far down the weird pathway, going too savage and abstract to provide a clear picture at times. The use of flashbacks was stylish at times but overdone as it sacrificed the chances for other characters to get some more time on the screen. Still, if you are looking for that dark, story that makes you scratch your head, then Annihilation is the movie for you to check out. For those who qualify, this movie is worth a trip to the theater, but for others kip this as long as you can to avoid disturbing those with sensitive constitutions. My scores are:

Minions," Cute, Minion Fun, Lacking A Lot Of Other Elements
","We've all had moments where we speak gibberish, but none of us match the skill level of babbling utter nonsense like the Minions of Despicable Me. The cute, cuddly, yellow bodied blobs have entertained for the past few years with their antics, communicating in their special language that remains undecipherable to me this day. Turns out they are so popular Hollywood has decided to give them their own movie, one that is sure to provide hours of fun for all ages alike. So with all the advertisement and hype, you may be wondering what this movie has in store. Fortunately I am here to help, so sit back and read the latest review. If I were to summarize this movie in one word it would be CUTE. The animation studio has managed to bring all the cuddliness of Gru's henchmen and unleash it tenfold on the screen. Sure there were some adorable moments in Despicable Me movies, but Minions takes it to the next level with squeaky voices, petite faces and huggable goodness. Boys and girls, men and women of all ages will be awing as our three heroes traverse the elements to find their new boss. Bob in particular was the cutest as he jumps into the adventure with eager eyes, and a beat up teddy bear. In truth it is like watching three small children go on an impossible voyage, constantly failing, but doing so in a manner that pulls at your heart strings. Minions is also a very happy and energetic movie, the youthful antics of the minions bringing a positive vibe to the theater that you feed on. The movie is simply fun, the pint sized aspiring villains living life to the fullest as they explore the city. Because of their enhanced biology, or whatever force makes them nearly invincible, the sky is the limit for what troubles they can get into. Normal devices that are meant to be horrifying, or extremely violent have now been diluted to playground level fun, sugar coated with the Minion cuteness to distract from their true meaning. Bombs, guns, bank robbing, etc, it's all just a big game run by naÃ¯ve munchkins and a world full of extreme personalities that make for very one dimensional characters. Surely you are asking one thing in your mind though, is it funny? The answer is yes, Minions is definitely a humor filled movie targeted for the young and young at heart. Slapstick comedy unfolds as the Minions pull off three stooges ploys as they slap, crush, and blow up everything around them. Their klutziness, and again their versatile bodies, allows reality to be shattered and for them to survive anything. As you can guess the Minions gibberish is also very entertaining, the random babbling made funny in the delivery as they add their voice modifications to the mix. Again Bob has the funniest sounds, as his high pitched squabble makes him my favorite. Voices and slapstick aside, the funniest aspect for me are the built in references to the movie in terms of song and movie numbers. I spent my time trying to figure out what movies the scenes were from, having to rely on my mentor to help fill in some of the details, especially those that were about classic bands or plays. Whatever source you find funny, let it be known that Minions is going to get you chuckling at some point in the film. HoweverÂ…Like everything there is a balance that is greatly needed in its film and the major downfall of this movie is doing too much of one thing. First the gibberish thing, it's nice to get that ridiculous language in spurts like in Despicable Me, but in this movie it took too much focus. A lack of dialog was annoying, the mindless gibberish losing its appeal to me, especially when there was a lack of supporting dialog to relieve us from the antics. The slapstick saved it somewhat, the variety in the comedic situations assisting with keeping things fresh. My friend pointed out that Minion antics are fun in small doses, which this movie abuses. The young and obsessed won't care, but I could have used a better story to ground the adventure a bit. The simplistic tale was also not the most thrilling, the tale very formulaic and lacking in character development. Even the villain Scarlet Overkill didn't hold much strength, and was thrown to the back behind the minions. In addition, about half the movie had been revealed in the six trailers they have shown, especially the fun opening, but the parts that weren't ruined are still entertaining. The limited voice acting is decent, but when all you are doing is babbling like an idiot, there isn't much to really be impressed with, even with the great Sandra Bullock leading the group. Minions is the adventure you are all expecting it to be, a mashup of cute, positive, fun that will have you chuckling most of the way. Chances are if you are obsessed with the little guys in Despicable Me, you are going to find no fault in this movie. However, Minions leaves a lot to be wanted, including story, character development, and some more clever humor that could work with the language. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed myself with a lot of the humor here, but my scores have to entail everything. I recommend a trip to the theater with a group, or taking your young ones, but please don't be persuaded to see the 3-D version. My scores are: Animation, Comedy, Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",7,8,14,11 July 2015
Incredibles 2," Incredible Follow Up
","It's another weekend and with it comes another attempt for Disney to sweep the box office with another 'masterpiece' to win the hearts of many. After 14 years (according to the pre-movie showing), my favorite Pixar movie comes back to bay with the sequel to hopefully bring spectacular adventure back to bay. Incredibles 2 is promising to be a lot of fun, but we never know what the studios of Disney will put into a movie to meet the expectations. Robbie K here back with another review, to help guide your movie watching pleasures. So, let's get started. Movie: Incredibles 2 (2018)Director:
 Brad Bird
Writer:
 Brad Bird
Stars:
 Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell
LIKES:Cute: If the trailers didn't paint this picture, take it from the reviewer that Incredibles 2 is chock full of adorable features to woo the hearts of many. Both young and old are going to find something to hook onto in the Super family's drama, whether it be the pint-sized baby or the warm feeling one gets of the strong morals of family, and it absolutely accomplishes the family friendly atmosphere. Balanced First Act: Pixar's team showed much promise of matching the first movie in regards to all the balancing it did long ago. The Incredibles 2's first half is beautifully crafted to include action, story, comedy, and morals into an engaging tale that accomplishes the goal of setting up for an epic conclusion. It's primarily run by splitting the story between the two plots of Elastigril (Holly Hunter) working to uncover the mystery of the ScreenSlaver and Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) trying to a parent, making sure to give each section their due focus and efficiently switching between arcs. Relevant: While I can't relate to some parts of the movie, I applaud Disney/Pixar doing everything it can to craft a tale that is relevant to so many people. For comic book fans like me, the dilemmas of heroes doing their job despite the prejudice of society speaks strong in terms of your values challenging others. Others will cope well with the girl power motif that Elastigirl's arc portrays, keeping it mostly on the down low, yet hitting hard where it needs to be. Yet, there will be many who will grip tightly to family moments and the challenges modern parents face given a changing society. By broadening this cope, Incredibles II is going to rope in a lot of fans of varying ages, all once again getting captivated by the arcs in store. Animation/Action: The movie is well animated, no surprise there from the masters of CGI storytelling. While Pixar always gets points for their world building, character design, and fluid motion, Incredibles 2 amps up the ante by including action sequences into the mix. Fortunately, they accomplish the goal of adrenaline pumping stunts, comic like combat, and making sure it remained pertinent to the story so as not to appear random. Your little one will be able to handle much of the stunts thrown in and become super impressed by all that comes with Pixar's approach to action. Comedy: Of course, you want to laugh in a movie, and the Pixar group is happy to deliver a variety of laughs to the mix. The first Incredibles have a number of inside jokes revisited in this installment, primarily in the obsessions of the characters. In addition, some of the melodramatic moments are going to be relevant to some, causing the age groups that relate to it to get the most laughs. Jack-Jack's cute levels are going to appeal to most of the bunch, as the baby with no limits defies just about everything to bring his high-pitched laughter out in full. My favorite though...Edna Mode whose attitude and mannerisms are back in full force, with little to hold back the Dahlings. 
DISLIKES: Predictable: The mystery of Screen Slaver is certainly the factor to keep you guessing, until you figure out the twist a mile away. Incredibles 2 doesn't do a good job of hiding the identify well, using some of the blatantly obvious dialogue to drop the hints long before the big reveal. In addition, the way they take obvious detours with some of the characters paints a bullseye on the back. It would have been nice to have a bigger twist, but sadly all the other antics took precedence in this movie. Inconsistencies in Story Components: The movie certainly establishes a lot of super powers to come in, but some of the gifted characters may have a little more power than one expects. During some of the action scenes in this film, a few of the characters could have easily solved things with these overpowered components. No limits are established to explain these components, and certainly that takes away from the suspense when you realize how easily they could have solved it. Most won't care about this dislike, but eventually as people rewatch it and tear it apart, you'll start to realize these moments. At this point, I'll state that some of the new characters didn't have the best utilization of the new characters, showing off some abilities, but never the extent of warranting inclusion, with the exception of one. Jack-Jack Balance: The first act broke the balance the first established, in order to bring more screen time to Jack-Jack's antics. Merchandising is going to have a field day with the pint sized hero, utilizing all his new modes portrayed in the movie for toys, books, and whatever else you can think of. The movie focuses so much attention on the little guy, that it soon started to go overboard for me. In addition, the trailers only show you a fragment of the little guys power, and despite the attempt to explain his abilities, Jack's-Jack's power is insanely overdone to the point he is almost like a deity. I said there were a few broken parts and this is the example. Anti-climactic finish: Remember the end of the first movie where you were on the edge of your seat as the family fought that giant Robot that held no qualms with destruction? Me too! Incredibles had done a nice job building up the giant antagonist and covering their bases to design a challenging, but doable end fight. The second installment however, resorted to some cheaper tactics that diluted what was supposed to be the most exciting moments of the movie. Part of it came from the predictability of the story, another part came from the focus on the comedy instead of the action/story. Yet for me, the action scenes seemed much shorter and simpler, not bringing the heroes to a conducive dynamic that the first one shined with. Why there could not have been more excitement infused in, I don't know, but I was hoping for a repeat ending that I saw all those years ago. 
THE VERDICT: Incredibles 2 accomplished much of the goals set out since the sparks of the first trailer showed up on the screen. It's a family friendly movie that appeals to both generations, the first part in particular absolutely accomplishing the level of quality the first had. With the balance of comedy, story, animation, and relevant plot elements it is going to appeal to so many and hook you into the film. However, the movie still didn't quite strike the chords the first one did as the plot was predictable, the power levels inconsistent, and the merchandising approach of the baby it just didn't maintain that balance I loved. Plus, the finish could have used a little more work to help pull everything together in a satisfying way. Still, this movie warrants a visit to the theater, and YES kids should have no problem handling this movie, though gauge their responses to loud noises, darker shadows, and one darker element of the plot about 45 minutes in. Well done Pixar for managing to craft something well, now just strive for the balance again and you have it down to a perfect. My scores are: Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5

Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Third Times the Charm!
","A kids movie is usually a reviewer's worst nightmare, not for the movie, but instead the audience. The constant chattering from kids, the excessive screaming and crying, and perhaps worst of all sitting behind a couple of adolescent's who think it's the best thing in the world to kick your chair are all annoying distractions. However, I decided to face this annoyance and review the latest kids flick Madagascar 3 on this beautiful Sunday. What were my thoughts on this movie? Read on to find out. With some of the recent disappointments I've seen this summer, I was thinking this sequel was a safe bet after seeing the trailers. For those who haven't seen the trailers, here is a quick summary. The crazy animal quartet of Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman (David Schwimmer) are tired of Africa where they traveled to in the last film. Their destination is none other than the central park zoo, but they must first head to Monte Carlo to pick up the penguins and the chimps that have the only plane. As expected, things don't go as planned and the gang is soon chased by an elite animal hunter named Captain Dubois (Frances McDormand) and her silent posse. In an attempt to elude her, they hitch a ride on a circus train, which is home to an energetic seal named Stefano (Martin Short), an aspiring Jaguar star Gia (Jessica Chastain) and a Tiger with an attitude named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston). What will happen to the gang?No surprise this movie was a safe bet, but at the same time was perhaps one of the most fun animated movies I've ever seen. What started out as a mirror of the trailers for the first ten minutes became a wild ride of fun, humor, and balance that kept me entertained. However, once the chase began the pace picked up and the surprises began to flood in. One major surprise was how well the chase scene was done and the clever use of penguin ingenuity. Although Dubois' moves were a little over eccentric and silly at points, it was still exciting and perhaps the best chase scene since the Italian Job. Another surprise came from the multiple stories embedded in this film. The main story like always is for Alex and the gang to get home, but within the main tale lie stories of passion, dreams, pride, and unity that connect all of the characters together. There are also a couple of love stories in the movie as well, one that is cute, the other more funny/ridiculous than anything else, both entertaining. All of these stories, mixed in with some diverse comedy, were very entertaining and I felt that many audience members will love. The other major strength of this movie is the animation. As I've said before, DreamWorks animation team knows how to make digital art come to life. Throughout the entire movie the movements of the animals were smooth, flowing, and well edited that impressed me once more. Even the lip work of the animals seemed to mimic the human way of speaking that is seldom seen in animation. Yet this movie also had something the other two didn't have, and that was being shot in 3-D. Although I didn't see it in 3-D, there were various shots that one could easily tell were meant to pop out at you, most likely to add another level of entertainment for the kids. While most of the 3-D seemed to involve things flying out at the audience, there were a few scenes and sequences I thought would be fantastic in 3-D adding more depth, color, and pizazz to what was already a good scene. The soundtrack for the film may have also helped with the entertainment values, especially one of the best uses of Katy Perry's Firework song, even though I had heard it three times in the same movie. Another thing I really enjoyed was that this was a fun, feel good movie that manages to give you an energy boost on some level. Despite how much I enjoyed it though, there are a few weak things to mention that may or may not be important to you. Perhaps one of the biggest weak areas is the lack of Mort, Maurice, and the penguin humor. Although they had some show stealing moments, fans of these characters will be a little disappointed to see how little their humor they have. Instead they shifted more of the focus on the new circus animals, in particular Stefano. My next warning is for those who are not a fan of Martin Short comedy as the movie is filled with his constant screaming and anxiety filled dialog that was humorous for me at some points, but at some points annoying. Perhaps a third thing to mention is how much the team focused on kiddy comedy than adult and kid comedy. Unlike Shrek or even the first Madagascar, this film didn't have the well-disguised adult humor and instead was more about juvenile bonking on the heads, and mindless screaming. As I'm sure you can guess though, the movie is very predictable and at points shallow, but that is what most kids' movies are these days.Madagascar 3 is definitely one movie I suggest you head to the theaters to see. Although you can guess what is going to happen, the animation and visual effects of the movie combined with the fun soundtrack are sure to keep you entertained. If you are looking for a film to see with a group of friends, a church group, or even just to take your kid to see this is the movie for you. Although not the most unique, it is still very entertaining and worthy of attention. My scores for this movie are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5 Tune in next week for more reviews.",8,2,4,10 June 2012
Hacksaw Ridge," Gibson doesn't Hack On Hacksaw Ridge
","American entertainment, most of us know it's all about the extremes these days (extreme crudeness, extreme drama, extreme stupidity). Well tonight an extreme director, Mel Gibson, takes a shot at making a movie that might defy the simplistic trend of most cinema is today. Tonight a buddy and I hit the theaters to check out Hacksaw Ridge, a war drama that pegs the life of a rare officer position (the combat medic). Will this interesting spin fit well in the library of battle based films, or has Gibson gone off the deep end. Let's get goingLIKES: Â• Action Packed Â• Balances faith with honor Â• Inspirational Â• Fantastic effects Â• Good charactersYeah, I have a lot of likes and it starts with the action this movie has to offer. Hacksaw Ridge can be described as the pacific campaign of Saving Private Ryan, with plenty of explosions, bullets, and flamethrowers to light up the silver screen. You'll be cringing as all hell breaks loose in high definition sound and incredible special (not cheesy) effects that will drag you into the depths of battle. You might find yourself at the edge of your seat watching your hero tear through the scarred land, jumping through the carnage to take down a bunker. Like realistic portrayals of war, this is the film for you. But Hacksaw ridge isn't just about soldiers getting dismembered or barbecued. No it's a tale meant to inspire people to believe in their values, defy the odds, and yes help people without killing them. Gibson and his team have designed emotionally packed scenes where the cinematography alongside the stunning orchestral work bestows the honor of our soldiers. The dialogue also preaches the message Doss' story is designed to tell, much of which involves faith being tested against tradition. Sometimes it got a bit cheesy with the blatant, overdramatic deliveries, but it fit so well into the film it really didn't faze me. Regardless, both patriots and religious zealots will love the balance of faith with duty, and have a character you latch onto. As for the cast, well Hacksaw Ridge has a little something for everyone to latch onto. Doss is the picture of a perfect, good spirited southerner, complete with hick like accent (thank you Hollywood stereotype). His morals, loyalty, determination, and overall nice guy attitude are qualities that many will find endearing. Too much of a good two shoes? Well then go for the gung ho Yankee who wields a gun like Rambo named Smitty. His character is all about the action, the adrenaline, and the war hero pride you love to see in these epics. Still too serious, then throw in Vince Vaughn as a sergeant who has action, comedy, and a bit of compassion to round out the cast. The company has strong heroes to lead the charge, amidst the extras whose names you might forget. DISLIKES: Â• Slow to take off/A bit rushed Â• Characters lost in the carnageHard to find fault in this movie, as Gibson and company did so well making this epic war drama. However, there were a few things my buddy and I found a little limiting. The main thing was how long it took the movie to take off. Sure we have to have an origin story and build up how are character had his coming to Jesus moment (a rogue brick to his brother's head). Despite how good they did with this, it doesn't help that it took a while for Hacksaw Ridge to take off. The first thirty minutes in particular are rushed relationships with his parents and girl, which although establishes Doss' life, drags at times as you wait for the training to begin. In addition, some of these arks get dropped into the background, left to simmer until the ending when the campaign is over. This was especially true for some of the soldiers, who after a five-minute introduction are dropped into a sea of extras almost never to be seen again. Doss and a few other troop members will get much of the screen time, while others will stand out only by looks before violently flopping on the desolate wasteland of the ridge. You would think a little more involvement after taking the time to name them, but no not the case. In addition, some of the romantic and family dynamics are dropped like a bad grenade, only to be tied up at the end of the show. Outside of these small flaws, the only other thing we agreed on was some random additions of Japanese customs, which while accurate was kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things. The VERDICT:Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best modern war movies I've seenÂ…period. The nice spin on the protagonist being a pacifist drops a whole new light on the war theater and provided a character who was deeper than the barrel of a rifle. Doss' story is certainly inspiring, and it's nice to see a movie where both faith and honor can work in tandem without being dragged out and dull (Unbreakable). Yes it does take time to get stoked, but once the spark ignites, it shines in suspenseful, well-shot delight. Of note, this movie isn't for the faint of heart. Weak constitutions may get sick, or have nightmares depending on how mutilated, bloody bodies affect you (PLEASE DON'T TAKE SMALL KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM). I strongly encourage a theater visit to this movie, perhaps a couple of times if you've got the cash. My scores are:Biography/Drama/Romance: 9.0Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",9,8,15,3 November 2016
The Great Gatsby," Gatsby I Presume
","Hello all, it's me Robbie K finally returning after a three month dry spell. I apologize for my absence but I return once more to attempt to inform you about the latest releases at the theaters. My first review back is on the book made movie/remake of a literary classic: The Great Gatsby. I'm sure if you are like me; you might have big expectations for this movie, or at least were hoping that Hollywood didn't screw it up. Well if you've got a few minutes keep reading to hear my opinions on this film, if not well hope to catch you next week.Instead of giving you a summary of the trailer, I'll jump straight to what I thought about this movie. Let's start with my favorite thing about the movie, the soundtrack. Rather than falling into clichÃ© of using the music of the era, this rendition of Fitzgerald's literary classic chose the path of blending modern, orchestra, and jazz into their music mix. Modern rap and hip hop opened up the party often showing the masses conglomerating into the house. Once inside the party zone, the music transitioned into the jazz to provide the ideal beat to support the various dances the extras performed. Of course the movie isn't just about partying, but also has a lot of emotion tied into the film as well. While jazz and other current hits, the orchestra track provided the extra kick needed to bring out the emotion embedded into the various scenes. Sure I may be too obsessed with the musical score, but the truth is an epic soundtrack can add an extra edge to make a scene more memorable. Of course what is a movie without stunning visuals? Usually not a very good movie, but luckily Gatsby has got some pep in its step. The parties in particular were what impressed me the most. All the partygoers were dressed in the 1920's fab, filling the screen with both chic fat cat swingers, and stunning women in gorgeous dresses. The setting of Mr. Gatsby's house was also detailed and dazzling filled to the brim with elegant artwork, beautifully crafted outdoor porches, and of course enough room to provide plenty of angles to capture the party goer's adventure into wild, alcohol infused fun. For this reviewer, I applaud the balanced mix of close up dance moves and wide angled shots that showed the masses interacting with Gatsby's house, especially for those that chose to dance and mingle around the pool. Now the rest of the movie was pretty well designed as well, but to my eyes it looked like the editing crew had a fair share of input in this movie. Often many of the car scenes looked fake, with many of the trees, buildings and coal piles looking a little too smooth and polished. My guess is this artificial environment was created for the 3-D version of the movie. Unfortunately there also seemed to be a rather fast, glitchy, movement to the actors in certain scenes that was a little odd to see. It could just be my old eyes, but past this minor glitch and over polished world, the world was well crafted. By now you might be saying, 'You idiot what about the acting? Did the acting do the characters justice?' I say yes, especially for that debonair man himself Leonardo DiCaprio who was a shoe in to play Mr. Gatsby himself. Leo's charming smile fit perfectly in the billionaire, containing a combination of confidence and arrogance that was offset by the kindness in his eyes. Over the course of the movie Leo not only added the stereotypical snooty tone of a rich playboy, but evolved to deliver his poetic lines with the emotion of someone who actually wrote those very words. And when the time finally came to display the last parts of Gatsby's emotional spectrum, he transitioned flawlessly into the anger and sadness that followed. Of course Leo isn't the only actor in this movie is he? Tobey Maguire, formerly Spiderman, surprised me with his performance in this movie. The role of Nick Caraway was perfect for him, playing the odd, scared, and rather immature stock boy that tell the audience the story. I must say I enjoyed this role a lot more than the last few roles I've seen, despite his insane rants and depressed writing. Carey Mulligan was a vision of loveliness as well, her looks dazzling and a pleasure to look at. As for her acting, I think she did a good job, though I don't remember the character of Daisy being so annoying. I don't know if it was the directing or what, but somehow Ms. Buchanan was a little too clingy, desperate, and annoying to really get attached to her. Then again I never was able to relate to soap opera drama queens who are stuck on love. As for the rest of the cast well they did fine too, but I don't have time, nor do you want to hear me describe every single character.I did enjoy this remake of Gatsby very much, and thought it was a good movie to continue drawing people back to the movies. The settings and music went hand and hand, and the acting for most of the cast I think did a nice job bringing the characters to life in the modern age. How well did it stick to the book? I can't answer that question as it has been 5 years since I last turned the pages, though I intend to read it again. My final comment on the movie is that the pace needed a little tuning up and probably shortened a bit to help keep my attention. My scores for this film are the following: Drama/Romance: 8.0 Movie overall: 7.0-7.5",Null,22,43,10 May 2013
13 Hours," Action, Emotion, but a few Shaky Elements
","Robbie K here reviewing the latest films to hit the box office. Today's write up is on the new 'true story' war film 13 Hours that looks to be a tribute to soldier heroism. As always it is my job to analyze, study, and grade the movie to help assist you with your viewing selections. Let's get started. When you think of war you think of action and sure enough this movie has plenty of riveting moments to rock the auditorium. Although the exciting stuff doesn't happen until about halfway through the film (thanks to a lot of talking and pokes at how stupid our government can be) the scenes themselves have everything you want in a movie. Bullets fly, extras spasm from fake gunshots, and fiery explosions bombard the screen as chaos unfolds. Being this is a Michael Bay film, the explosions are excessive alongside the pyrotechnics, but fortunately not to the point of a Transformers film. One thing I liked was the realistic feel of the battle, using strategy and position instead of movie magic to destroy the bad guys, although they did seem to have infinite ammo. While the action is the main part of the story, the movie has a lot of character development to help bring some relevance to the violence. The first half of the movie focuses on building up the tension for the climax, giving us some insight into the backstory and personalities of our heroes. It's slow, but Bay kept the suspense throughout the film to keep me interested. In addition they even do an excellent job of illustrating the weaknesses of our military and their inability to make decisions. Those with strong political beliefs are sure to get riled up once or twice in the movie. Our actors as well were believable as soldiers with John Krazinski capturing all the emotion and tension of a military man. James Badge Dale also does a 'bang' up job portraying the leader of the Special Forces unit, bringing a blend of honor, courage, and ironically rebellion in his steely gaze. Yet the true magic is when these two, and the other four soldiers come together, to create what feels like a unit of brothers is formed. Of course the true majesty of this movie is the editing. The special effects crew crafted a piece of work here that truly is worthy of an Oscar nomination. While the pyrotechnics were a bit overdone, they felt well placed and appropriate for the scenes at hand. Even more impressive is what the sound/music team has crafted together. While booms, crackling guns, and dying scream my not be the most unique thing to grace the speakers, this film does a great job executing them, making sure to not overpower the dialog and military jargon. For me it was the music that brought the main emotional fervor to this film13 hour. The graceful piano work combined with the camera work nearly brought a tear to my eye at the end, mirroring the emotions of the scenes. As for the camera work well that aspect is unfortunately not as good. On the positive side, Bay captures the war from all angles capturing the full effect of the hell this event was. Seeing men erupt into fountains of blood, or losing limbs is something that isn't easy on the eyes and brings out the true carnage. Yet Bay can't seem to hire a stable camera crew to his films. Once more the team has tried to immerse you into the chaos, but I found this ploy to be annoying, nauseating, and a bit distracting. Overall 13 hours is a solid military action movie filled to the brim with that pride filled portrayal of America's military. The action is solid and the emotional development adds an extra layer of depth that sometimes lacks in this genre. However, the movie isn't that original and uses the same ploys to glorify military prowess, though this movie does a better job of showing how ugly war is. Editing wise, the movie is solid, though I wished they dropped another half an hour off the runtime. Yet in the grand scheme of things this movie was well done and a nice adventure to start the year off right. Is it worth a trip to the theaters? I would say yes for the technical aspects of the film. Those who have weak constitutions to blood, death, violence, or realistic military warfare should skip this film. One thing I can report, this movie was very popular to older audience members, some having many choice things to say at the end, which I don't wish to repeat. Also those who have PTSD involved with military may not be able to handle the more emotional parts of this movie, as about five men left the theater in a hastened gait. My scores overall are:Action/Drama/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",8,4,16,16 January 2016
Sully," Don't Sulk at Sully
","It's a new weekend and that means a new wave of movies to flood the local theaters. Robbie K here starting the round with the latest drama based on real life events that centers on an American Hero named Captain Sullenberger. Yes, I'm talking about Sully, the film that once again delves into whether or not the pilot who landed on the husband is indeed a hero or a delusional zero. So fasten your seatbelts, make sure your trays are in the upright position, and cell phones off as we take flight into my review.LIKES: Â• The Realism Â• The insight into Sully's mind Â• Tom Hanks actingWhen you look into a movie based on true events you hope there is more truth than Hollywood fiction. Fortunately, this is one movie that puts reality before fantasy. Sully's 96 minute run time is a recreation of the treacherous nightmare that plagued the skies in 2009. Audience members will be wowed as they are dropped into the cockpit of the US airline flight as it soars into the Hudson. The combination of camera-work and modern computer technology will immerse you into the full experience, perhaps fooling you into thinking you are a passenger on the plane. In addition, the team manages to give you multiple perspectives of the flight, not only advancing the realism, but also adding more pieces to the proverbial puzzle. Yet, the other component that brings the realism is the airplane jargon that fills a majority of the dialogue. According to the retired pilot sitting next to me, Sully's writers were very accurate in the technology and maneuvers used to land the plane. Will most care about this component? Probably not, but this reviewer appreciated the extra effort to make this movie real. What helps provide more answers to the mystery though is getting a visualization of Sully's internal thoughts. Much like a book, our team was able to illustrate the dark fears that plagued our captain as he waits for the investigation to finish. These memories are well placed into the story, helping to develop Sully while also helping advance the plot in a timely manner. Those who have read the tale and hoping the movie will mirror it are certain to enjoy this presentation, and those who choose a less literature based approach will find this method entertaining and engaging. But of course the headliner of the movie is by far the legendary Tom Hanks playing Captain Sully. No surprise that Hanks is capable of bringing this role to life. Hanks certainly commits to his role and manages to mirror the reported personality of the Sully. His lines are delivered with grade A accuracy, and yours truly gives the actor props for handling the lead role with such a powerful performance that will most likely net him an Oscar. While most of the other cast certainly plays a hand in recreating this story, Hanks is by far bearing the brunt of the load and handles that responsibility quite well. DISLIKES: Â• The Drama Flare Added Â• Some perspectives not neededAs I sated, seldom is a movie safe from getting the dramatic touch added to the tale. Sully is no exception as some components take on that Hollywood magic to spice things up and make them more 'entertaining.' Some of this editing is in the nature of the crash itself, the dragged out drop to the river, support personnel going into near break downs to add a touch of sympathy, and even the rather stretched portrayal of Sully's wife. Yet all those moments are nothing compared to the direction they took the lead investigator Charles Porter. Instead of playing an agent just looking into the entire scenario, Porter's character was like the lead marauder in a witch hunt with a single-minded goal to bring Sully down. This could have been fine if this was the true character, or even if they mystery was deeper. Unfortunately, neither of these cases seem true, and Porter's stubborn as a mule attitude inspired nothing more than anger and eye rolling for me. The second dislike comes in the form of editing and the director's decisions to split the incident into so many perspectives. While I appreciate the integrated approach to fully envelop you into the moment, there were some components that really weren't necessary. One major moment was from the civilian perspective watching the plane come to land, or the random passenger trying to swim the cold waters due to their panic. I appreciate the realism in all manners of this flight, but these moments added little to me other than trying to expand the movie out to a longer run time. A minor error sure, but the editing could have been tapered down a bit to remove some of these pointless moments.The VERDICTWhen it comes to Sully, this reviewer has to give props to this movie. A realistic portrayal of the hero with fantastic acting and attention to detail are sure to attract the nonfiction lovers to the theaters for this one. Sure it could have found a home on Netflix or PBS as a 1 hour special, but I have to admit that this movie was one of the better productions I've seen in a while. So is it worth a trip to the theater? I would say yes, especially to pay tribute to Hanks' wonderful performance. The recommended audience is anyone in love with nonfiction/true stories, Tom Hanks fans, or those looking for another tale of a trip gone wrong (with Hanks again being the captain. Guess I won't be traveling with him anytime soon.)My scores are: Biography/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",8,1,5,9 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Mehlien
","AlienÂ… a franchise that has continued to take many forms over the last four decades. While some of its evolutions have been weaker and worthy of forgetting, there have been some forms that will forever hold throne in the realm of good science fiction horror. Tonight, Alien Covenant launches in US theaters, unfortunately to a mixture of reviews slamming it enough to call it worse than its predecessor Prometheus. So, alongside my friend Jeff, we hit the theaters to see what it's got after all the buildup and hype. Robbie K back and as always, I'm here to share my thoughts. LIKES: Â• Back to Alien tactics Â• Danny McBride isn't a stoner Â• Science Fiction Elements Â• Loose ends somewhat tied upSummary: Low and behold, Covenant finally returns back to the elements we fell in love with years ago. Nostalgia runs wild in this movie as Daniels and her colleagues work to survive the nightmare that dwells in this movie. Narrow Hallways filled to the brim with shadows as the 'perfect' organism seeks out its prey, amidst shrieks, acid blood, and that infamous lethal tongue? The gimmicks are all there, alongside the science fiction element this series is famous for. Biology is certainly one of the topics they focused on this one, in hopes of adding some plausibility and 'realism' to the series. My buddy and I both agreed that this component did some nice damage control and added a unique twist to the mix. A particular like for me was finally seeing McBride in a new role. If you're a fan of classic McBride acting like an idiot constantly on drugs and spouting nonsense, you won't see that side of him in this film. For me this is refreshing, and McBride finally crafted a character I didn't want to punch in the face, but instead relished as he took a major role in the story. While I certainly would have liked a little more him in the film (not something I say often), McBride works on so many levels for me in this film.Finally, the story element of the movie. When last, we left the series, Prometheus left so many freaking questions and confusion that we needed another movie to explain the movie. Good news, Covenant comes in to tie up those loose ends, helping bridge the gap between the new and old and answer some questions we have asked for a while. In doing so it adds anÂ… interesting element to the mix and doesn't raise as many questions as Prometheus didÂ…. Thank the lord for that. DISLIKES: Â• Weak opening Â• Most characters practically worthless Â• Weird gimmicks Â• Overzealous gore Â• Inconsistent story lineSummary: Reading some of my fellow reviewers' writings I have to agree with many of the dislikes in this movie. Much has to do with the story, and it starts with the weak, almost pointless opening that causes all the trouble. It's lazy writing, with a random element thrown in to get things going that barely makes sense other than some special effect firework display. Throw in the pointless cameo (again) and you are left with a bitter taste from the start. Unfortunately, that's only the start, for Alien Covenant continues to take hits in the plot development, primarily in the character story aspect. Much of the cast is pretty much pointless outside of being fodder for the aliens, with few having any backstory or an understandable name. We get it, Aliens is all about nameless characters facing the elements, but the first two installments were successful in integrating some of them into plot and bestow significance. In addition, someone wasn't paying attention to their details, because Alien Covenant offset some of the details Prometheus set. While it may not be a big deal to the layman, most fans of the series though are going to noticeÂ…yeah, we nerds can be a pain in the butt. Still, I didn't like some of these lack of attention to detail and will most likely do everything in my power to theorize a story to cover this gap. NopeÂ… instead this movie wanted to try out some new gimmicks in multiple departments including weird kissing scenes, that notorious black crud, obsessions with 'love', and of course new types of creatures. I'll give them points for some originality, but the gimmicks were a little off the wall even for me (who is pretty dang weird). Even worse, the gimmicks are kind of unnecessary or neatly explained in a single sentence. Instead the new gimmicks, as well as much of the movie was all about the gore. Alien Covenant keeps to the displays of blood, going strong for the insanely detailed displays of blood (both CGI and real) and people getting torn to bits, by a less impressive looking Xenomorph. The VERDICTAline Covenant is pretty much what you expect from the series since Alien 3 emerged out into the theaters. It is all about the gore filled hunt, mediocre story, all wrapped in a science fiction exterior. A plus side is again the Alien tactics and tying up loose ends, but unfortunately it still lacks a lot of story, relevant gimmicks, and balance the first two movies had. Perhaps, should a next one be made, they will tie up more loose ends and obtain a little more storytelling. In addition, the insane obsession with death and gore might be diluted as well, though I highly doubt this given modern audiences obsession with killing. Worth a trip to the theater? For the fans of the series, yes, otherwise hold out until RedBox for this one folk. My scores are: Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",6,3,10,18 May 2017
Furious 7," Furious Excitement! A Tale of Brotherhood
","Fast and the Furious is a series that we have all fallen in love with. Ever since 2001 when the series came out, we have been exposed to beautiful cars, hot extras, and plenty of crime and punishment amidst their colorful cast. This weekend we jump into the seventh, yes seventh, installment to see if we get the same thrills and chills that we love. For the virgins of the series, and those who've seen the trailers, here is what you might expect: Â• High speed thrills and action Â• Beautiful women seen from all angles Â• Jason Statham being Jason Statham Â• A conclusion to Paul Walker's legendary roleFans of the series know that this movie is all about coordinated plans that often involve beautiful cars performing unbelievable stunts. Well that trend continues with at least three lengthy sequences dedicated to showing off expensive cars being pushed to their limits. Fans will be pumping their fists in joy as Dom and the crew take their beauties across the world, country hopping as they fight off terrorism partnered with vendetta. In glorious high definition, alongside stable camera work, adrenaline junkies like myself will be more than happy with the exciting battles this movie has. While some of the situations are ridiculous, and a bit conventional, they are incredible displays of the glorious work special effects can craft. In addition to the excitement, the directing team did a good job adding some additional character to the scenes. Furious 7 has plenty of laughs, especially in the brotherly exchange between Taj (Ludicrous) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson). I myself laughed the hardest at Gibson's scenes, where his stunts and dialog, combined with the delivery, were enough to relieve the tension. The action also held suspense, mainly due to the built relationship between the cast of this series. That dynamic, along with the wonder of who will make it, keeps you engaged in the battles, both the necessary and unnecessary battles. Unlike some other action movies, Furious 7 sometimes takes a little too much liberty for making an action sequence. A few of the scenes were a bit overdramatic, some of the fights quick write-ins to allow for cameos and character involvement. Speaking of cameos, you can expect a lot of filler shots centered on the feminine figure. Guys will love seeing the curves of many beautiful ladies, most getting close enough to touch the derrieres they are shaking. The tight outfits and bountiful bosoms, or missiles as Roman calls them, will make many a man or boy, drool in delight at the gorgeous women before us. This brings me to another point, that Furious 7's editing could have used a little work. While the movie was exciting, there were plenty of scenes that could have been trimmed, or left out to shorten the run time and make a more conducive movie. Now I mentioned how the relationship between the stars is a big part of this series, but what about newcomer Jason Statham. No surprise, the action star has little to say, and what he does comes out the same grunting mess he always does. Primarily he talks with his fists, or cars in this case, as the stunt man goes to work on his vendetta plan. I can say Statham still has some moves up his sleeve, but this role was not my favorite of his repertoire. He still had the threatening gaze, but his character lacked the finesse and skills I normally enjoy seeing. Much of his stunts were overexaggerated antics, painting him invincible instead of deadly. Fans of him will have no problem accepting this, but there were a lot of stretches with his character that I didn't quite enjoy in the grand scheme of things. The man is still good, don't get me wrong, but I think I enjoy his Expendable work more than the brother with an attitude. Finally the tribute to Paul Walker; the man who started this series concluded his performance in a great manner. Walker's tale has heart, soul, and bite in this 'final' installment. I felt I got good closure for the character Bryan O'Connor, getting to see the true man in the calm and collected warrior. Sure it wasn't the greatest backstory, but decent when blended with his action. The ending in particular gave me goosebumps, and captures the essence of the actors' relationships and the brotherhood they shared. Although not anything what I expected, I bow my head in honor of the action star. To sum everything upÂ… Furious 7 is an awesome sequel that ranks high on my F&F list. Action wise it is one of the more exciting, and helps tie up the tales of almost all our characters. Is it truly over? I don't know; there is a lot of open ground to cover for a possible sequel. However, it brings the same excitement you like in the ridiculous world we've fallen in love with. Despite the plot conventionalities, disproportionate acting, and interesting editing choices, the movie is one of the better ones I have seen in a long time. Go see it in theaters, for the special effects, the engaging chemistry, and to close out the series. My scores for Furious 7 are: Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0",9,2,6,3 April 2015
