It," The movie was fun to watch
","The movie was good. I love the acting because all of the casts were all out on it. The story was interesting and made me curious on what will happen next. I love the scenery that was chosen for the movie. The movie filming were taken from good angle, I love it. Although the movie wasn't scary, but it was fun to watch. I recommend to watch it at the theater instead of waiting for the blue ray release",8,4,11,10 September 2017
