Iron Man 3," Good and Bad
","I know this is a fictitious movie, but I mostly had a problem with the realism in Iron Man 3. I really didn't like how his pieces of armor could fly onto Tony Stark, or that he could just jump into a suit in two seconds. I suspended my disbelief with the Iron Man movies when Tony Stark comes to a sudden stop while in his armor without getting a concussion or something, but that's as much as I can handle. These movies were pretty good at staying believable and realistic for the most part, but it's not getting better.Also, Jon Favreau hamming it up at the end was painful. Besides that, RDJ did a great job as Tony Stark as always and I enjoyed a good portion of this movie. I hate to only talk about the things I didn't like, but I don't want to give anything away. It was fairly solid like the rest of the Iron Man movies have been, it just got a little cheesy is all.",7,0,1,3 May 2013
