Marie Antoinette," Not Just Another Biopic....
","Marie Antoinette is an excellent film. And maybe that is because Sofia Coppola refuses to tie down Marie A to the standard 'biopic' movie. She doesn't get bogged down in historical accuracy, instead the film is a riot, a romp (excuse the clich√©), or just plain fun, not just for party animal Marie, but for us too.Kirsten Dunst actually evokes sympathy as 'The Austrian.' The scene where she breaks down and cries after YET ANOTHER letter from Mum in Austria telling her to get a bun in the oven fast is very powerful. The rest of the cast are no slouches either, especially Jason Schwartzman and Asia Argento. The film looks stunning and the soundtrack...well, I really want a copy. And the final shot (Marie's room trashed by the French rebels) will stay with me for a long time.One of the movies of the year, in my opinion!",10,2,4,2 December 2006
