Angels & Demons," Angels & Demons
","Angels & Demons sees Robert Langdon (Hanks) recruited by the Vatican when secret society the Illuminati kidnap and threaten to kill four cardinals then detonate a hi-tech antimatter bomb under St Peter's Square. With the help of physicist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), Langdon embarks on a mad puzzle-solving dash across Rome to save the day. Howard juxtaposes Langdon's frantic search with a crisis behind the doors of the Basilica - the Pope has just died and the cardinals are unable to come to an agreement on their next leader. The Camerlengo (McGregor), in caretaker charge until the new selection, aids Langdon while attempting to smooth over problems within the Vatican.Shorn of his mullet, Hanks is more at ease as a thinking man's action hero this time. He's helped by Howard's improved grasp of action (no abysmal Smart car chase here) - the staging of a set-piece in the Vatican archives where Langdon must escape a room that's quickly running out of oxygen is tense and funny, and Hanks is the type of actor who can effortlessly blend the dramatic and comedic. Howard dances around location problems well (a man drowning in the obelisk fountain was never going to get approved!), though there's a hideous computerized recreation of the Pantheon's interior, which looks like a frame-by-frame Microsoft Paint compositing job.There are still moments of awkwardness from the usually dependable Hanks, like when he takes a dig at the Swiss Guard and comes across like Fonzie clad in a tweed jacket ('C'mon fellas, you called me'). McGregor is lumbered with a difficult role, that of an action hero priest, but he's skilled enough to paint his character with the required subtle brush strokes. It's cringe-worthy, though, when he casually mentions how he can fly a helicopter, and is called upon to do just that in a finale complete with dreadful 'ascent to heaven' symbolism.Where Brown mastered the art of getting readers to turn the page, rocketing the story along fast enough so his plot holes and portentousness never become much of an issue, his two big screen adaptations suffer from an inertia that brings these problems to the foreground. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman, generally solid plot technicians, come unstuck with a wordy, 'tell don't show' script that insists on joining the dots for viewers instead of letting them do it for themselves. Angels & Demons never really wants to admit that it's an absurd folly masquerading as a high-brow thriller, but it's marginally more dynamic than its predecessor and will probably pass time reasonably well as in-flight entertainment.",4,1,4,17 May 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Very Solid and entertaining !
","I was kinda afraid after reading some critics and comments from people who downloaded illegally the workprint version all over the net. But when I saw this movie, i was really entertained. It's fun, quick and full of super-heroes.For thoses who like the X-Men series, you will like this as well, i'm not a geek in comic books but I can tell you I read many X-Men, Wolverine, Batman and more, and it follows the original comics quite well. Sure, it could have been more, but from what we have, the result is quite satisfying. I didn't feel robbed as Hugh Jackman as well as the criminally underrated Liev Schreiber put on strong performances. We truly believe they are that super-human. A lot of effort and great storyline make this movie truly entertaining.I highly suggest to thoses who have an open mind... sure it's not Watchmen or Iron Man but it's not Spider-Man (overrated) or Catwoman in terms of bad movies, it's truly in the greatest of our times, and even if I will have like to have at least 20-30 minutes more of this story, i am satisfied, it's not easy to make such a great film and the result is quite good, so I can tell people, to go watch this movie, a great visual treat !",8,2,4,1 May 2009
American Beauty," American Beautiful
","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is suffering a mid-life crisis that affects the lives of his family which is made up of his super bitch of a wife Carolyn and rebelling daughter Jane who hates him. Carolyn is a real estate agent a little too wrapped up in her job who takes on an affair with business rival Buddy Kane.Meanwhile Jane seems to fall in love with Ricky Fits, the strange boy next door who is a drug dealer/documentarian who lives under a roof governed by a very strict marine father and a speechless mother. Lester's mid-life crisis causes him to drastically change his life around when he quits his job and works at a fast food restaurant.He starts working out to gain the attention of Angela, a friend of Jane's who brags about her sexual exploits every weekend. Lives change and not for the best.American Beauty follow all the steps of a movie who will become something even bigger with the time. You don't understand all of this at first, but then you think about the movie and you see something you never see at the first viewing. The casting is simply perfect, Spacey, Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper (who should have been nominated for an Oscar), Peter Gallagher and the underrated Mena Suvari who can make look good a movie by her unique presence.The casting has been choosed step-by-step by the talented Sam Mendes who give us one of the most humanized 1930s flick in Road to Perdition and more recently, the wonderful war movie, ''Jarhead''. American Beauty tell you the story you want to hear, without any shadow of doubt, this has to be a movie that will live forever in our hearts!",10,0,1,11 December 2005
Ghost Rider," Ghost Rider = A great movie!!
","First of all, i'm not someone who bash a film without seeing anything about it or watch a trailer and said, it stinks. But really, this movie blew me away. It gives the viewer everything he want to see. Action, Comedy, great special effects, great one-liners, Eva Mendes hot as usual, and a Nicolas Cage as the main hero. He does his job the good way because he looks like a hero that don't want to be one at first because that's what the Ghost Rider is all about. A anti-hero that will become one! I really hope they will make a sequel and with all the money they make at the box-office, i'm pretty sure we will get one. It's really too bad that it's not this Mark Steven Johnson that directed Spider-Man, which in my view, was pretty bad considered all the hype. Ghost Rider dosen't fail on every levels just like SM did, this movie is what it is, and it's a movie we never thought will see the day because it's not easy to make with all the special effects. And the presence of Wes Bentley as the main villain, Sam Elliott and Peter Fonda as the devil add a lot to this great film full of action and excitement!! I found myself really entertain by the story! I recommend this one!",7,6,8,28 March 2007
Logan," Impressing movie !!
","Let me start this review by saying the numerous good reviews by either the critics and the real critics in my mind, you, the people sold me.... well last year at the same time, we had Batman vs Superman that in my opinion was so destroyed by critics that us, the normal people, did not want to see it... in fact I saw it and loved it a lot.So far with the underrated one BvS, let's talk about the best thing Marvel ever done with their current TV series shows on Netflix ''Jessica Jones'', ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and currently since yesterday ''Iron Fist''.''Logan'' stars Hugh Jackman in the returning role but in a much different era, 2029. Sir Patrick Stewart also join the cast as Professor X, the great Stephen Merchant as a older Caliban, we seen him under another actor in ''X-Men Apocalypse'' last year. Boyd Holbrook as the furious Pierce. and an actor I'm happy to see, Richard E. Grant as Dr. Rice. But the one that really shines is Daphne Keen Fern√°ndez who portrays Laura, the daughter of Logan/Wolverine.I won't talk much about the storyline as you will see, it's not entirely new, but for a film like this, it's brilliant. James Mangold make a film part Western part Superhero and the recipe work pretty well... ''The Wolverine'' was kinda disappointing for most, in fact, i did not hate it as it was part of another universe of the Claw man. Here, it is the same case, it's another universe, you can say ''Hors-Serie'' but the film really shines because we know Logan since almost 2 decades of film with Hugh Jackman and it take a really personal and emotional ride.See it without even reading what worked or what could have worked. It's just pure cinema and I enjoy it a lot.",10,2,7,18 March 2017
La La Land," The term overrated has been created for a reason, THIS FILM !
","This film starts with a great promise. We follow a musician and an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles. The film's title is a reference both to a nickname for the city of Los Angeles and to the idiom for being out of touch with reality. But where it fails it all the rest. The movie is well acted no doubt, but the subject, you care less and less. And even if you want to, this film is a 90 minutes romantic comedy that turns out to be 130... even Woody Allen will think it's too much, i want the shorter version. I was bored to death and i'm a huge fan of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Work... here I try, but can't ! It's just too long !",2,68,133,11 January 2017
Saw," Smart movie
","First off, this movie is a really intelligent one. If you think you will saw a fast-food typical Hollywood movie, YOU'RE DEAD WRONG!! If you dig movies like Freddy Vs Jason or The Exorcist IV, this movie isn't for you. Sorry. This movie is about the jigsaw killer, a killer that NEVER and I mean NEVER kills people. Yeap, he can be arrested and free the next day. But I won't tell you the plot because after you will say it's very predictable & any crap like that when it's not! That movie deserve the perfect TEN for the category of movie it is and it's psychological thriller. When the horror appears, it is for a reason, to tell you something, not just to scare you but to make work your brain something Hollywood don't like to do the past 20 years. Don't rant it, BUY it if you're a fan of pure psychological thrillers.",9,0,1,20 March 2005
Sinister," Excellent horror movie, perfect Ethan Hawke.
","I'm not saying it's a perfect movie, the actor was, and i'm a big fan of his work, but for the actual scares and story, it was very effective. A big 8/10 for me. Because there's not many movies that freaked me out that way and all of the people in the theater were scared as hell like me, and it was a good feeling overall. The movie succeed in giving goosebumps all the way to the end. With that beginning, the 1st minute you know it's gonna be hard sometimes to watch and i love how obsessed the character of Ethan Hawke is and who really looks like a writer and reminds me sometimes of Johnny Depp in Secret Window. This movie gives a grand finale that will be remembered and will have sequels as well... i'm just surprised that this movie has a 3-4 millions budget, i guess 1.5 for Ethan and the rest for the movie because it has not big stars except of b-league ''theses days'' Vincent D'Onofrio who is in the movie for barely 5 minutes but he is very good !",9,15,23,21 October 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Worst film of the year candidate !
","Firstly, the main antagonist is a Marvel character that has been completely changed for this movie. It bears no background similarity to the character in the comics whatsoever. I understand that the Marvel movies are all about making a spin on the comic book story arcs, but this difference was far too large for me to accept.Whilst watching the movie, I had to ponder whether I had stepped into a Marvel Superhero version of 'Fast and Furious'. There was a continuous message that family is important and how the protagonists became who they were due to disenfranchised childhoods. Whilst this is a valid point, I do not feel that it belongs in a superhero action movie as it serves no purpose. Worse was when the message contradicted itself when we see Peter Quill betrayed by his Father. The clumsiness of this contradiction did nothing to alleviate the sickly sweet message that the movie was trying to convey. I get that James Gunn is trying to send out a message to the younger generation but I would think that kids go to watch a superhero movie for the action, and will not really appreciate or acknowledge the message that he is driving.Unlike the first movie, there was a distinct lack of character focus and their abilities. It could easily have been an action movie without superheroes. In fact, the movie seemed to be focused on two characters when it came to showcasing their abilities. One of these had a sequence that was inspired by the Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men movies. The other was extremely underwhelming and was defeated far too incredibly when you consider the differences in age and experiences. None of the characters were interesting with the exception of Nebula and Mantis. However, Pom Klementieff played her role like a stuttering female cyborg that I even thought the role was played by an East Asian actress before I checked the cast members. The actors paid to play the new characters were miscast in my opinion. Sylvester Stallone's performance reminded me of his Judge Dredd and not in a good way.It was clear that the popular factors in the first movie were taken and overdone in the second movie. Drax was made to look like a dumb fool once again but even more than in the first movie. While the CGI effects were good, the cuteness factor of Baby Groot served only to market the movie to kids and geek girls, and to rake in merchandise profit. There was also constant mention and focus on the cassette mix which was totally unnecessary (again, for merchandise promotion).With the exception of the very first Iron Man, why do the Marvel movies have to be over- saturated with humor? It's one thing to market the movies to a wider audience but it's totally another thing when it's taken too far, and the humor becomes so boring.",3,7,17,21 May 2017
Hancock," A very nice surprise - Smith, Theron, Bateman & Berg = the perfect mix !
","Just saw the premiere of this movie on July 1st and I can say that I was not too impressed at first. I saw the trailer and I was, it has some funny taglines but it looks too much like your typical Hollywood-spotfest so I didn't know what to think at first. The surprise was absolutely very welcomed ! Will Smith make the movie a real treat, he add the dose of charisma and energy we need in such a big blockbuster ! Charlie Theron & Jason Bateman as supporting actors ! It was a nice addition to see Theron in a role like this, just imagine Aeon Flux but more intense and funny at the same time, she seems to be perfectly fine for the role, as compared as what people said. At first, she seems to have signed for a very ordinary role, and it's not at the end ! She's even more important than the lead actor in this movie. And Jason Bateman, he is the man with the smile, he make us laugh and he want to help the entire world, and he may have find what it takes to help him, an anti-hero that can become big if he listen to someone like him ! All in all, a very entertaining film, don't listen to the bad critics, because you will miss an opportunity to see a great film !",7,3,6,3 July 2008
Wonder Woman," The DC Universe did it again, Masterpiece !!!
","Many biased critics and anti-DC give rave reviews to both Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad because they wish this great studio fail.Now, they watch the film entirely, and see it has a lot of sense... why I said the other two titles ? Because those same people will see that theses movies were awesome just as Waterworld back in the days, but critics have a job to do and it's to call film flop and other good...Here, Wonder Woman possibly the best superhero film (in any company) since Man of Steel tell you a story, an awesome story to follow with a great lead. Gal Gadot. An Actress/Model people did not have lot of faith in... but I had lot of faith. She was awesome and believable in her role in the Fast and Furious franchise and she can do a lot better. That'S what she prove here. I won't tell any spoiler but it's a perfect film. The main villain is really believeble and the CGI does look good. The effects are awesome. Patty Jenkins (2003 Instant Classic Monster starring Charlize Theron) make the Perfect Wonder Woman we want to see..Thank you Patty ! If you read this, i give you 10 minutes of standing ovation with applause !",10,15,32,6 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman vs Superman = The Reason IMDb closed boards !
","March 2017 UPDATE: Because this film, Suicide Squad and any DC films... get so many hate by Marvel fans, it must have been truly hell for IMDb moderators. Never in nearly a decade and a half here i have seen so much hate on a movie for no obvious reasons. Zack Snyder release a Ultimate Edition that blow everybody in the world and still, there's hate.... Suicide Squad was a fun, dumb film full of love by the creators but some love to make it look like a giant turkey on theses boards !!! i can tell you, NEVER i have seen hate for movies before. And it was continuing with the new Batman, Justice League, Flash, Wonder Woman... that NO ONE have seen yet !!! For that I am happy IMDb closed the boards, it was full of biased and unnecessary hate... back to the original review ! I did not change a thing !2016 REVIEW: I put spoilers alert, but i don't say much, i am much more on the actors, the music and direction of the film.Now, stop with the non-sense... why I enjoy this film ? When some internet geeks on YouTube tell you in a 45 minutes video not to like this film. Simple. DC is a universe I admire. There's tons of effort and good will in this film. I enjoy Nolan Films, but i'm much more of Tim Burton films and the Gotham TV Series to me respect a lot better the Dark Knight world than Chris Nolan. Who still did a terrific job, no doubts here.Let's start like this... BEN AFFLECK... AFFLECKMANIA.... Simply ''BEN''. More than 75% of comments were negatives when they announce him as the new Bruce Wayne... who will have you prefer ? Daniel Craig... George Clooney back ? There can be other good candidates but to me Ben Affleck is more effective in the sense that he aged... he still looks good and he damn sure give the best performance yet as The Batman.Henry Cavill, the Superman ! The most underrated actor to me, of all times. He is never giving up on the role and it pays now. He really is The Superman, Clark Kent as well. When i see him with his goofy glasses, i laugh for a while. He know what he had in front of him and he is not gonna lose it to someone else. I won't be surprised to see Cavill doing a lot of films and even more than ''The Icon'' Christopher (RIP) Reeves. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince,Wonder Woman does a good job with what she have on paper. She is not the center of the film but she is really important. And it will helps when she get her film. She reminds me of Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment, as sexy and as mysterious as she is. Don't get me wrong, i'm not telling you she is the new Meryl Streep but she is a good action actress and make believable the role she gets.Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. At first i was not sure. He is one of my less favourite actor of the whole film. He end giving one of the best performances of all time, easily the #1 Lex Luthor... he is crazy, psychopath and he will go in a great direction with the next few films. Eisenberg is officially Luthor. I can compare it to Danny DeVito in Batman Returns. Very good performance and believable !Supporting cast is A+... Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Amy Adams, Tao Okamoto, Holly Hunter. I have nothing to say about them, they are amazing every time they are on screen. Quick cameo by ''The Comedian'' Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Wayne's Father, i dig it !Zack Snyder, your director... with the experience he got with Man of Steel and if you like it, you know what you're ready for. HE is very talented to tell a story. Many did not like his approach ? I like it. He don't waste time, sure when it's needed we see long dialogues, but I was never bored.I think what many dislike of this film is the lack of comedy act. Here, you won't have 1 hour of comedy skit, 1 hour of war against robots and 30 minutes of romance... no it's a pure superhero against superhero hate with lots of flashback (that were needed) and cool villain.THE CAMEOS... Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg... they all look good and will have their single movies as well if they don't screw up productions... the way Wonder Woman discovered them was fascinating. Like some detective film.The Score... the very intelligent score by Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) and Junkie XL (Deadpool). i have been listening to the score before and after seeing the film, and it's even better after. My favourite themes are ''Is She with you'' aka Wonder Woman theme... ''This is my World'' that is also used a little bit in Man of Steel. ''Men are still good (Batman Suite)'' is also pretty good listening.I saw the film in Ultra AVX D-Box 3D... yup it cost me over 20$ for the ticket. I would never never experience a film as complete as this one. The 3D is pretty cool, i'm not a fan of 3D films but in the first 10 minutes of the film, i already say to my friends ''Hey proper use of the3D, huh!'' which they respond ''F*** yeah !!!'' The running time of the film may seem to be long, 155 minutes, but i would have taken 180 anytime with that kind of directing.",10,4,8,28 March 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Masterpiece... thank you IMDb, this place is back as the place it used to be !
","First off, let me say, yeah it pi** me off that the forums are gone. But when I look at how bad the discussions has become with lots of people giving fake websites full of viruses, i don't miss it one bit. A decade and a half member is telling you this.''John Wick 2'' starring Keanu Reeves back in the title role, Laurence Fishburne as a great cameo and a whole cast I don't remember the names but can tell you they nail the target on their roles make this movie absolutely fantastic... not for the faint of heart. ''John Wick 2'' give us lots of blood and guts and get over 100 different murders.The movie is extremely violent, is it a ''Ichi'' 2 ? NO ! it's more of his own genre but if you want to compare, ''The Raid'' movies violence is nearly equal. Well OK The Raid is more graphic but John Wick 2 shines in his violence. If you go see this movie to see The Godfather, you are wrong. If you want to see one of the best action sequels since Aliens, The Raid 2 and Terminator 2, you are at the right place ! We really have good action films theses days, and this genre is so underrated, i'm glad Keanu Reeves continue to be part of it and don't go too soft about it. After all, it's a darn movie !The dog in this film is more of homage to the first. He is not used a lot, and except at the very end, he is not very physique in his role. At the end, you can see Jonathan Wick being the target of about everybody in the world, and the Pitbull run with him, that's it.Just one remark about this particular scene, i hope they don't make something big of the pitbull in part 3 because this is the most intelligent and sensible breed of dogs in our world, I will let my children with a pitbull that I know any day compare to a Chihuahua that will make them hate dogs forever.''John Wick Chapter 3'' is already confirmed and will kick major ASS !",9,3,8,18 March 2017
Minions," The most disappointing film of the year !
","I had high expectations with this one being a huge fan of the ''Despicable me'' saga. This one is truly not the film I expect. Sure the minions are cute, funny... for the 1/3 of the film... then it became another film with the pointless and not-funny at all human. The Minions stayed in some scenes but feel pointless or out of context most of the time. This film feels like it has been make for the big money. The storyline is boring. When the kids had fun for 30 min and then all of sudden it turn into a giant mess that some check their cellphones or other finally go to the bathroom break for that boring moment in the movie... but when they came back, it was still boring. I can not imagine someone accept this final script. Hope their will never be a sequel to this giant mess of a film. The minions are much cuter in the Despicable me films.",4,4,6,24 October 2015
