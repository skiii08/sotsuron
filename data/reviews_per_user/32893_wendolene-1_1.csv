National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Hair-Raising!
","I loved the first movie and the second. The whole plot and premise have gotten young students interested in American history again. Well-done, interesting family movies are getting harder and harder to come by. I hope that if they make a third movie (as is rumored), that they will take it easy on the hair dye for Nick Cage. In the first movie, his hair color was noticeable, but not as distracting, more highlight than full on dye job. The REALLY BAD dark hair dye job in 'Book of Secrets' was VERY distracting during the entire movie. Much like a piece of spinach in your date's teeth, once it attracts your attention you just can't get past it. I love Nick Cage, let's just have him like he is - mostly ;)",9,0,4,21 May 2008
