First Man," The Story you think you know.
","First Man, starring Ryan Gosling, and Claire Foy, with Damien Chazelle directing, he of La La Land, and Whiplash. This film was I think a progression of both styles.First Man, is the story of Neil Armstrong, first man on the Moon, and his journey not only in space, but of the NASA programme for the previous 10 years. However, rather than go the grand adventure route, which it most certainly does include in the film, its more of an introverted look at the life of the Armstrong family and what they went through. Opening with an early test flight of his as a civilian pilot and the death of his young daughter, slowly from cancer. This film actively avoids lingering on anything of the wider issues, Racism, Government policy, the Soviets vs America, or Kennedy's promise. it certainly doesn't ignore the politics behind the story, but it is always from the angle of NASA looking out at it, and swiftly returns to the man in the middle.Through the use of intimate handheld cameraing and very quiet, close moments at the beginning especially but used throughout, you are thrust straight into the life of this man, and feel transported along with him. The sound design is incredible and even when dealing with Space, they keep it very close and intimate, how these men actually felt in the tiny cramped modules and suits.Gosling gives a great performance, but it would be nothing without the natural presence of Foy, who utterly convinces as the quietly pained and suffering wife/mother. The superb support cast, littered with talent, again play well, but always remain bit parts to intense concentration on the Armstrongs, Neil in particular, of course. As in Whiplash, its an intense two hander between these two people, there just happens to be the most famous story in history happening at the same time. They marry these two challenging scales very well. The weight of history is almost inevitably where this film reaches issues. How to retell a story that everyone upon everyone knows, and worst, has their own version of what actually happened? You can never really lose the sense that you spend 2 hours just waiting to here that line! When it actually comes to this point, they handle it well, and predictably/cautiously give it over to a very human moment with Neil Armstrong remembering his lost daughter. But throughout the NASA parts of the film, they retain that sense of them taking a massive unknown risk, which for me was beautifully reflecting in Armstrong actually taking the first step, where he hesitated because no one actually knew if the surface was even solid!This film achieves big and small at the same time and at points is almost breathless in its intensity. A throughly good cinema experience and a film, that quietly asks a question of you and your place in it all. But how could the greatest story, not ask such question. 8/10",8,8,19,14 October 2018
Joker," Cinema at its extreme edge.
","First things first, I am not a phycologist. But, I like so many in the aftermath of seeing this movie found myself discussing the threads of human nature first, the sinews of the film second.Every scene, every frame of this reminded me of a Gregory Crewdson photograph, every object picked with purpose, every room structured to affect emotion. I found it spectacular, ruthless, unforgiving and painful it might not even have been a movie it might have been interpretive dance. But constantly you can't help but ponder on the very nature of being human and how far could you be pushed; how far could you fall.Personally, I don't see this as the glorification of violence as some others might. I grant you it does traverse a very thin line at points, and this is massive credit to Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of Arthur. I think maybe the reason so many people are finding it uncomfortable is that it actually cuts to close the bone, it unwaveringly shines a spotlight on how we are capable of mob mentality and how quickly and how far, when things go wrong, we as 'decent' human beings could go.I don't see the character of Arthur as simply he thrives on the violent acts, he doesn't, he thrives on finally being excepted and finding a place to belong. This Arthur within this DC Universe is a fragile one, at a crossroads within himself. This film documents what it takes to push him to become the Joker. The backdrop of social upheaval is the fuel needed to take him that extra distance and finally be accepted for who he has become.This is also about Gotham, a fictional place, conjured in the times around post World War economic boom in America, and based on a New York style with Chicago mobster mentality, all elements that play into the fat-cat nature of Gotham, the rich get richer the poor stay poor. Sadly, an idiom that we struggle with back in the real world. The really incredible thing this film does, is we know this character, we know how it ends up, he's Batman's nemesis, he's a fictional bad-guy, yet Todd Phillips and team show us a version of this character and his story such as it is, that we didn't know possible, where we are gestured to sympathise and understand how he became a 'monster'. In real human terms.Joker is an incredible piece of cinema and I think my opinion of it is open to change as I ponder the nature of being human more.",9,1,1,13 October 2019
