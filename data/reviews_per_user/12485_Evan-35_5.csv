Alien 3," A huge waste of celluloid
","I'm surprised that a lot of comments about this film were positive. I almost envy the people who liked Alien 3. I really wish I could have enjoyed this movie, but instead it ticked me off like no other film. Here are the reasons why I hated it:1) Hicks and Newt were killed off in the very beginning!why couldn't Fincher further develop their relationship with Ripley? They could've AT LEAST have been killed at the end.2) The Alien looks really fake and has too much screen time. It was a rod puppet blue-screened into the action, but it resembles jerky stop-motion.3) Where's the weapons? Unlike the first two there's no flame- throwers or machine guns to kick butt.4) I didn't care about the other chrome-domed characters. They might as well have been those expendable red-shirted ensigns on Star Trek. All in all, it left me cold.",Null,4,5,6 August 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Cold War Comedy
","DR. STRANGELOVE is a classic, hilarious satire of the current fears of that time, and it's lost none of its edge. The humor went over the heads of most of my peers (Yes, I'm currently in High School), but I loved it. I guess the other kids would laugh if it had the usual Scatalogical humor that is plauging so many 'comedies' today. Anyway, Sellers is in top form here, as is George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Keenan Wynn, playing a Colonel who hates 'preverts.' My 2 favorite scenes are the Coke machine incident and the classic scene of Slim riding an A-Bomb as if it were a bucking bronco. One of Kubrick's best.",Null,0,0,30 December 1999
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's War Odyssey
","FULL METAL JACKET is an amazing War movie, one that shows how de-humanizing the conflict in Vietnam was.  Joker (Matt Modine) is an extremely appealing, if somewhat detached, character.  Granted, it's not quite as good as APOCALYPSE NOW, but a very worthy war film by the late, great Stanley Kubrick.  The film's anti-climax perfectly fits the the anticlimactic end of the Vietnam war.  'This is my rifle. This is my gun. This is for shooting. This is for fun.'",Null,0,0,22 December 1999
Armageddon," A big, bloated cinematic turd
","A year ago I went into the theater thinking this was going to be a great film. 2 hours later, I walked out p*ssed off. Armageddon is a big example of what's wrong with mainstream movies lately:  All FX, no plot. Here are the reasons why I hated it:2)The male characters were basically a bunch of overgrown boys.3)The romantic subplot between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was corny and irritating like no other film.4)WAY too many scientific errors.5)Excessive patriotism. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud to be an American, but this went too far. In real life, the mission would've been an international venture. The Russian stereotypes didn't help either.6)Enough predictability to fill TWO movies.and the list goes on and on......",1,2,5,17 August 1999
Evil Dead II," one helluva ride
","EVIL DEAD 2 is a cinematic rollercoaster that flies off the tracks and just keeps on going.  Sam Raimi has made a film that's a scream in every sense of the word.  wonderfully twisted humor, and non-stop action (especially near the end)makes this my favorite of the Evil Dead trilogy.
