Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very good movie for a third sequel
","Just to state the obvious, the effects are outstanding. When the droids prepare for battle, they all turn around at the same time - but not synchronised. The only way you know they are effects is because these things can't happen. Huge battle tanks don't float in air.I was a bit dissapointed by the acting. These aren't bad actors, as we know from their precious performances. But you don't feel with them, like you did in the first three films. Luke Skywalker was an innocent young man, who proved to be special. That's something we can identify with. Han Solo was a real smuggler. He's also easily identified with.But Qui-Gon Jinn and young Obi-Wan Kenobi seem to lack all emotion. If this is supposed to be a quality of Jedi's, then why do I see these qualities in Yoda? And he's puppet.Overall, I hardly saw any emotion in any of the actors, except for Anakin and the computer-generated and puppet ones. I think the kid was good: he acted exactly like a boy of this age.It's a shame that they created a 'scientific' explanation of the Force. I'm not relogious, but the mystic that surrounded it gave it something special. Now, 'May the Force be with you' means 'May you have many little critters in your body'.Generally, it looked much like a remake of episode 4 'A new hope', with the princess or queen, the pilots jumping in their fighters, the exploding big thing in space after they blow up some minor part inside, the ceremony at the end.It may not be the best of the Star Wars series, but it fits in into them. All of them had a simple story, the good guys have green lasers and the bad guys have red ones.Considering that's it's a prequel, twenty-two years from the first movie, it's very good. It has it flaws, but these I can live with.",Null,0,0,23 October 1999
Memento," Good, though a tad slow
","I don't agree with the people claiming that this is a boring film. But neither is it so incredibly good that it deserves to be on position 11 (at the time of writing) of all films, of all time. Then again, we find Fellowship of the Ring on number 3, which tells me that - pardon the pun - viewers' memories don't reach back far. And do I think it's better than The Usual Suspects (at number 16)? Most definitely not.For sure, it is a very interesting film, where you have to stay focussed for every second, lest you get totally lost. In a time where the catering for the CG crew takes up more space in the credits than the script (even if they had more than five script writers), that certainly is refreshing.If you don't have the patience to try to figure things out, that doesn't make this a bad film. Nor is it not a fantastic film, just because it requires you to use your brain.Good points are, as mentioned, the script and Guy Pearce's acting. But I never really got 'in' the film - it's very hard to identify with the main character - and the supporting roles weren't very in-depth.Well worth watching - but not too often.",Null,0,2,27 April 2002
Spider-Man 2," Surprisingly good
","As a rule, there are way too many adaptations of comics (especially the superhero kind, which I don't like) and sequels coming out of Hollywood. So if there's a sequel to a comic adaptation, that bodes ill.Not so in the case of Spiderman 2. And it's not about the action sequences, that look like they had a very big budget. If you like those, you won't be disappointed.No, Spiderman 2 invites you to think, without being pushy on the morals front. There are no meaningful speeches or metaphors that a toddler would understand. Instead, there is plenty of humour that doesn't get too tacky, and there are even tender moments, notably at the end of the subway scene. That one, I actually found touching.It's difficult to elaborate on the film without giving too much away. But if you have a chance to see it, it's well worth it. It can be mindless action if you want it, but it's much more than that.",8,0,1,6 March 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Rather overrated
","This review is not going to be the heaps of praise that most other reviewers have given this film. Imagine, just for a moment, that it's not a film about a gay love story, but about a 'straight' love story. What's left?Well, it's a story about two people, spanning several decades. The photography is very well done and the opening shots of the outdoors on Brokeback Mountain are very promising... but somehow, I find it very difficult to feel any sympathy for the main characters. They seem self-centered in their actions, and the anti-gay sentiment is never really made felt. It's also a rather slow film, never picking up anywhere. There's no climax, it just... ambles on.In my opinion, the subject matter (which I can only praise, and about which there should be a lot more films) got the better of the perception of Brokeback Mountain. It's not a bad film, not in the least, but a masterpiece? No.In this light, I'm not surprised that it didn't score nearly as well at the Academy Awards as was thought beforehand.However, it does deserve praise for tackling a subject which is still very contentious in the more conservative areas of the world, and for being a film with originality. After all the rehashes, adaptations and sequels, that *is* a relief.",6,0,29,6 March 2006
The Matrix," Great effects, many holes in the plot though and *very* overrated
","I don't know why everybody is so hyped about this story. The idea is nice - we all live in a fantasy world - but it's not original and there are many holes in it.For instance: machines use people as a power source, because the sky is totally covered with clouds. But where do people get their power from? I'd say from plants and animals, and animals get it from plants. But plants won't grow if there's no sunlight.Frankly, I thought it was an insult to my intelligence.For the rest, it looked a bit like a mix between Blade Runner, Streetfighter, Quake and some manga. Plus Baywatch, because of the slow motion sequences.There are more things in this movie that don't make any sense, like that you need a telephone to get out of the dream world. But how do you get in?What was really annoying were the long monologues in which the (unlogical) story was explained. The acting wasn't very good either. Kenau Reeves was the best actor.The effects, on the other hand, are outstanding. I especially like the scene in the beginning, where the girl jumps up, the picture freezes and the camera turns around her in a half circle. Simply brilliant.I think what most annoys me about this movie is that it appears in the top 30. There are more than 30 movies who are better than this one, believe me. It lacks too much in the acting and plot department to make it a great movie. It's good, but not great.",Null,0,0,23 October 1999
Gladiator," Everything that makes a great film
","'Gladiator' has everything that makes a film a great film. It has a pretty simple story, a main character that you can either identify with or which has an incredible sex appeal (so my wife tells me), great actors, a great score, and very professional production.You can easily find films that outperform 'Gladiator' on one of those elements, but films that do so on *all* elements are rather scarce. I've seen plenty of comments complaining about the story or overuse of special effects, but you might as well go and complain about Star Wars - because I think that what makes Star Wars a great movie is pretty much what I described in the first paragraph.*** Spoiler warning: if you don't know anything about the film, best not read the part that comes next ***The film is indeed rather dark. There are the very graphic fights on the battlefield and in the arenas. There is the decadence of Roman culture, and the incestuous love (lust?) of Commodus for his sister. It certainly doesn't have a happy end, but amazingly so this is one unhappy end that makes you feel good: it gives a glimpse of afterlife as the Romans would have perceived it, and somehow it tells you that dying isn't as bad as people make it out to be.All in all, I think this is one of those rare, very beautiful films. When you leave the auditorium, you're still in another world. There are very few films that have that effect - instead relying on what the CGI department came up with this week, or what the statistics say a film should be like. It is a pleasure to watch, a film like a film should be.",Null,0,0,10 July 2002
