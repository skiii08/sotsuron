Mission: Impossible III," J.J. Abrahams has done it!
","There's something about the Mission Impossible franchise that just makes it so darn appealing. Whether it is the familiar Lalo Shiffrin theme song from the old series, or the high tension action, or the schmaltzy dialog coupled with the matinée idol hero, I just can't put my finger on it, so I will say that it is all of the above. If you are looking for that action film to go see this summer that will fulfill all your blockbuster needs, then look no further. Mission Impossible 3 aims to satisfy not only your lust for action, violence and blood, but also your possible need for some explanation, plot and justification. This film actually has a good pace that allows you to catch your breath and follow the ridiculous plot, so you can fully appreciate every quick cut, hard breath, explosion, and bullet that is fired. This is the Tom Cruise world of escapism, after all, and his co-writer/director JJ Abrams (of TV's Alias) is definitely not an un-talented guy as is evident here. Even as his camera gets jittery because it's hand-held, and his editing style pushes into the kind of kinetic mode that might've made Scott/Bruckheimer proud, we are able to watch and learn without laughing at the silliness. This is largely a result of Abrams', who knows how to stage various action sequences and knows how to keep audiences enthralled from one scene to the next. Abrams raises the tension level to a maximum and leaves your pulse racing for more. 'Mission:Impossible 3' makes up for what the other two installments basically missed since Abrams masterfully energized the series by taking a predictable franchise with his signature style and does the impossible which was something the other two directors from the last two films tried to successfully accomplish. The last two installments were still megamoney makers. Again, Tom Cruise returns as special IMF agent Ethan Hunt who is called back to duty to take on one of the most ruthless villains he has ever had to face....a sadistic arms dealer and vengeful psychopath who is played masterfully by best-actor Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman. It is Hoffman by the way that gives this film its sheer brilliance and raises the bar with his mere presence. There is something to be said about a great villain that makes a film that much more enjoyable. I am reminded of Orson Welles' creepy 'bad guy' portrayal in The Third Man, as well as Tommy Lee Jones in Under Siege (a film which would have truly decomposed were it not for Jones). The rest of the cast includes Ving Rhames (reprising his role onceagain), Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Billy Crudup, Michelle Monaghan, and Laurence Fishburne as a creepy IMF associate. The best moments in the film are breathless, especially the stunts where Cruise's character Ethan Hunt jumps off a skyscraper and dangles upside down, or when he gets run over by a semi tractor-trailer. There is also a sequence on the expansive Chesapeake Bay Bridge that includes some of the best stunt work ever filmed (Cruise does his own), wherein cars and rigs explode by a missile barrage from overhead copters. Director Abrams chose to use actual stunts over CGI effects, and the realism shows. One of the films weakest points is the silly love story, which unfortunately is pivotal to the plot. The main focus of all of Hunt's worries and fears lie in his devoted love to his fiancé. In pairing Cruise with Monaghan, Abrams is domesticating Ethan Hunt, which makes about as much sense as domesticating James Bond. Julia is a downright dull character, a beatific nurse with no apparent flaws who clashes alarmingly with the band of rogues that Ethan surrounds himself with. Monaghan has had her great moments in films such as North Country and The Bourne Supremacy, but here she's little more than a damsel in distress. Cruise had far more chemistry with Thandie Newton in the second installment, and it helped that her character was a master thief, which gave their courtship more of an edge. As for the rest of the screenplay, it's less convoluted than the last two Mission Impossibles, but now it's easier to find the holes. Each viewer will have his or her own pet plot point that just didn't work. But for 126-minutes, most viewers should be happily distracted, riding from high point to high point until the credits roll. Overall, this is a strikingly clever film. Abrams opens with a jarringly grisly flash-forward that haunts us until we get there again. And by then he has run us through a wringer that's thrilling and dramatically engaging. M:I 3 is an expertly made guilty-pleasure blockbuster.",10,1,3,20 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," 'Tis' Good
","UNDEAD MONKEY! Top that!'....Well, Pirates of the Caribbean 2 has a solid go at topping the top-grossing film of 2003.Johnny Depp, Oscar-nominated for the role of Capt. Jack Sparrow, possible the best-worst pirate ever owing a life debt to Davey Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, another cursed ship. Also returning, Orlando Bloom as Wil Turner, the decent colonialist, who in the spirit of Flynn's CAPTAIN BLOOD, is drawn into the pirate's life along with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann.Wil and Elizabeth are arrested instead of wed and slated to be executed for their part in Sparrow's escape. Wil cuts a deal to bring Jack;s quirky compass in return for a pardon for he and Elizabeth. The three become involved in Sparrow's struggle to free himself of eternal servitude onboard the Flying Dutchman, along with 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner aka Wil's Dad. Captain Jack and Wil Turner's unlikely friendship continues in one misadventure after another, with more returning character's from the original than you can swash a buckle with, like Elizabeth's father Governor Wetherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the lovable buffoons Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and MacKenzie Crook), first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and the fallen Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport).Director of the original, Gore Verbinski again throws the pirates into one amusing action sequence after another, from island cannibals, to an inevitable bar fight, some Treasure Island homages, battles with barnacled minions of Davey Jones and a runaway mill-wheel-three-way duel between Jack/Wil/Norrington that is worth the price of admission and beverages.Depp's swaggering-staggering Sparrow makes any scene fascinating with his rock star take on pirates. But be WARNED: Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 were produced back-to-back to allow for quicker release of two, meaning Dead Man's Chest is 'a link film.' And for those of us who endured the ending wait between The Empire Strikes Back and Jedi, you know what I mean. Pirates 2, ends with a bit of a cliffhanger which is always risky. The ending leaves almost nothing resolved and no villain thwarted.The locales as breath-taking and effects are as stunning as the original, in particular the ship swallowing Kracken. Sadly the brilliant Bill Nighy as Davey Jones is wasted as the overly CGI and effect laden character, who could have been anyone and was less striking than the previous films nemesis. In fact, I would rather see Nighy play Sparrow's dad (who was supposed to be briefly in the 3 movie due out in 2007)",9,0,1,20 November 2006
Hostel," Gross, weird, gory, and offensive to women.
",I truly hated this movie. It had no point. This started out like an average horror movie did and then it just turned gross. I was watching this with my girlfriend and she was very offended by the pornographic sex in this.The first half of the film is just plain porno. The next part starts out with torturing and killing. Its sadistic and its very wrong. This film should have been banned. I still cant get some of the nasty images out of my mind.Its about a group of backpackers that go to Europe for fun they end up having fun but when a few pass out they wake up in a Hostel where they are tortured and eventually killed.There is so much of blood and gore that it makes me puke. Don't see it if too much is nasty. I thought the whole movie was gross and poorly directed.,2,1,3,20 November 2006
The Girl Next Door," Funny
","There is a point in 'The Girl Next Door - Unrated Edition' (which I received and promptly devoured, extra's and all, in one sitting) where the movie is in danger of changing in tone and focus from American Pie to Showgirls, but luckily for the movie - and viewers it recovers itself and ends in a definite teen comedy spirit.I never saw this movie in the theater so I cannot comment on what has been added to this 'unrated edition' but there is certainly quite a lot of nudity, but nothing involving the main actors. There are some graphoc scenes at a strip club (including lap dancing) and we get shots of one of the main actors watching a porn video at home. There are some nude scenes from behind of both principal actors Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert, but as Hirsch points out on Side B of the disc (where most of the extras are located) the movie used a stand-in for those shots.I have a word of caution regarding the list of extra's on the Amazon page. One is titled a scebne specific commentary bu Hirsch and Cuthbert. What we have here though is not a commentary for the whole movie from the two stars, but rather several scenes on the flip side of the disc in which the two actors both give separate commentary.Largely (and unjustly) ignored at the box office this teen comedy starts of really well and within the first few moments had me rolling with laughter. The movie starts with a montage of sorts, we see the jocks, brains and cheerleader-types all stating, for their entry in the yearbook, what they 'will always remember.' Then there is Matt (played by Hirsch) who is pondering this question. Sure, he has had a successful academic career - as illustrated by his acceptance to Georgetown - but he really hasn't done anything memorable in his senior year of high school.That's about to change for Matt though with the arrival next door of Danielle (played by Cuthbert), who mplays a breathtaking beauty house sitting for his neighbors.Entranced by her Matt is unable to stop himself from watching Danielle undress in the window opposite his bedroom - but he is spotted. From that moment he is on a roller-coaster ride. Danielle, amused and evidently attracted to Matt, shows him the excitement of living on the edge, from running naked through the streets to moonlight skinny dipping in his school principal's pool.Just as everything seems to be going so well between Matt and Danielle, Matt is shocked when one of his best friends Eli (who is a connoisseur of porn movies and full of in-experienced sex advice) shows one of his porn movies - in which Danielle is the main star.Foolishly following some of his friends advice, the two part company and moments later the movie changes tack and takes on a decidedly darker and more serious tone as Matt becomes sucked into the shadowy world of the pornographic movie industry. Initially charming and friendly towards Matt, Danielle's producer and one-time boyfriend Kelly (played well by Timothy Olyphant) turns violent and antagonistic towards the youth who has his mind set on getting Danielle out of the industry.This all comes to boiling point when the sleazy producer drugs Matt and sets him up for a robbery.What follows is both inventive and highly amusing. How will Matt afford to get into Georgetown? What will become of Danielle? These are just some of the questions in this entertaining movie that borrows heavily and liberally from a number of the John Hughes movies of the 1980s and the American PIE movies of more recent years. The movie ends on a high note in a conclusion that is both satisfying and enjoyable.Now onto the part that most readers of this review are more interested in - the extra's. On Side A of the disc we have an okay director's commentary from director Luke Greenfield and an at times amusing and at other times fascinating trivia track.Then on Side B of the disc we have the aforementioned seven to eight scene specific commentaries from Hirsch and Cuthbert (Hirsch curiously has one more) and deleted and extended scenes with optional directors commentary. None of these scenes are of any particular value to anyone but completists or fans of the movie. They add nothing to the feature, but do have a curiosity factor to them. They also chose the better of the two endings also.Of more interest is an amusing featurette in which actor Chris Marquette (who plays Eli in the movie) poses as a porn producer and lures in all too interested men (there'e a cute blonde on the bed afterall) who get decidedly less interested (for the most part) when the girl is replaced by a big burly guy.We are also offered a stills gallery and a VERY short gag reel as well as trailers for a couple of other like minded movies in addition to one promotional trailer for several other Fox titles. There is also a trailer for THE GIRL NEXT DOOR with the subtitle 'Dirrrty,' which in reality isn't really that much of a big deal.All in all, this is a good and entertaining movie, it seems to lose its footing half way through but successfully and engagingly returns to top form before the final credits roll. This is a definite must-buy for fans of the movie and the genre and certainly great entertainment",6,3,4,20 November 2006
The Prestige," Filled with Darkness and Mystery....but ends up great!
","Certainly one of the darker, yet more interesting films of the year, The Prestige sets out to tell a story full or originality and intrigue. Magic is a hard subject to resist. There is a part within all of us that has an avid curiosity and need to know how to explain the unexplainable. Of course, once it's revealed, almost all interest is lost, and it seems it's time to move onto the next thing. The Prestige tells a lot. I won't venture too far for fear of giving too much away, but while much is revealed in this film, there is still a lot to scratch your head over as the final credits roll (to a magnificent Thom Yorke song I might add). Yes, The Prestige has all the elements that keep your head spinning. Is it good? Yes. Will it stay with you? Yes. I'm just not sure I want that much darkness to follow me home.The Prestige, (like The Illusionist also released this year) is another thriller about 19th-century stage magicians with secrets which advances so far beyond its recent predecessor that only the subject matter entices me to mention them in the same sentence. Credit lies with director Christopher Nolan, who approaches his projects with a dark vision that I find wholly appealing. He wanders through the shadows of human desire and ambition, coloring his observations with sarcastic wit that staves off the despair to which they might otherwise succumb. Showbiz illusion makes a natural fit for Nolan. He understands as few others how much film has in common with it -- and Christopher Priest's source novel sets a story uniquely suited to his sensibilities. It centers on the bitter antagonism between two rival performers, once friends apprenticed under the same man, but now poisoned by jealousy and reproach. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a master of technique, grasping sleight-of-hand mechanics with unparalleled insight. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is less physically adept, but makes up for it with supremely charismatic stage presence. This is something that his counterpart never quite got the hang of. Both have good reason to despise one another. Borden's arrogance once triggered an accident that cost Angier dearly, leading to an act of vengeance that threatened to cripple Borden's performing abilities for good. The two survived and went on to successful careers, but the seeds of hate were planted deep, and now the good things in their lives mean nothing when compared to the prospect of destroying each other.The interesting and visually brilliant technique that Nolan uses in keeping your interest in by enticing you with his abstract, and sharp color, as well as reminding you that if you look away, you might miss something--and certainly you might. As the film trails on, you are left to develop theories and ideas, knowing full well that your guess is as good as the person sitting next to you. There are jump cuts, quick edits, and long meditative shots on such beautiful starlets as Scarlett Johansson. This may be Nolan's technique for distraction as the background may very well be giving you the big reveal. The plot grows intensely complicated (the posters aren't kidding when they admonish you to watch closely) and sometimes strains credibility (fake beards come into play a little too often), but faithful viewers will be richly rewarded by the clever ingenuity on display.Nolan keeps it all together with the same tricks that have made his previous films so enjoyable: clever story development and focus upon character. Like Memento, The Prestige utilizes a complex editing style, cutting back and forth between eras to create a cinematic texture of misdirection and revelation (high regards should also go to editor Lee Smith for an extraordinary job). The results draw us close to the central figures, then let us watch in rapt fascination as their wounds and desires drag them down. A few problems and inconsistencies do arise -- places where plausibility strains or the twists become repetitive -- but like the characters on-screen, Nolan is so good at guiding our attention elsewhere that we soon forget such problems. His leading men give him plenty of help. Bale's knack for evoking the dark side is well established, but it's sublime watching Jackman turn his immense charm towards sinister ends (this is easily his best film performance to date). Both make excellent use not only of their characters' strengths, but also their fears and insecurities, which retain an ounce of humanity even as they seek new parts of their souls to sell.There is a lot to here to be creeped out by, especially when the end comes around. The darkness became so overwhelming to me that I had a hard time shaking it soon after. It made me fearful again of what humans are capable of and reminded me that there is still much to be learned about the dark side of the human psyche. The Prestige does earn high praise not just as a terrific historical thriller, but also because it grasps the medium's links to this subject so remarkably well -- just like Welles, Hitchcock, Wilder and all those other great filmic magicians whose ranks Nolan is well on his way to joining.",9,3,5,20 November 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," it was awesome
","I'm not much for remakes of film's that doesn't really require being remade. Some classic examples being Psycho, Dawn of the Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes came to mind. Both Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake and the Michael Bay-produced Chainsaw remake were critical failures from both fans and critis alike. Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake only succeeded for the fact that it's more of a reimagining than a straight remake. The only thing that film had in common with Romero's classic was the location. Now we have another remake of a horror classic (though to some calling Craven's second film a classic might be somewhat of a stretch.) in the Alexandre Aja directed and Wes Craven produced The Hills Have Eyes. Aja's The Hills Have Eyes becomes the rare horror remake in that its more than a match to Wes Craven's original.The first half of the film was very slow as it slowly built up the tension and dread as the Carter family's journey through a supposedly short-cut through the desert put them closer and closer to the dangerous people who dwelt amongst the desert hills bordering the desert road. Once the family becomes purposely stranded in the middle of nowhere the fun begins for horror-aficionados. For those who have seen the original this remake doesn't deviate from the main story. The hill people who, up until now have only been glimpsed through quick shadowy movements across the screen, were the true cause of the family's predicament attack in a brutal and grisly fashion. None of the Carter family members were spared from this attack. From Big Bob Carter, his wife Ethel, their three children, son-in-law and young granddaughter they all suffer in one form or another. The night attack on the camper is the main highlight of the film and shows that Aja hasn't lost his touch for creating a cinematic setpiece that doesn't hold back. From the brutal rape of the Carter's youngest daughter Brenda to the sudden deaths of several Carter family members. This sequence was both fast-paced and chaotic in nature. It also helped push the definition of what constitute a very hard R-rating. Just like Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and Roth's Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes push the limits and boundaries of what the MPAA has allowed so far in terms of on-screen violence. I'm very surprised that some of the violence and deaths in this film made the final cut. This film definitely brings back the 70's style horror.The cast for this remake was one high point that the original didn't have. Where Craven had a very inexperienced cast for the original film, Aja had the luxury of a bigger budget to hire a more competent and able group of actors. A cast that was led by Ted Levine who shined in his role as the patriarch of the civilized Carters. Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of the bunch soldiers on even though its almost predestined in films such as this that she would be one of the doomed. The two daughters as played by Vinessa Shaw and Lost's Emilie De Ravin did extremely well in roles that involved some of the more graphic rape sequences put on film that wasn't from a film called Irreversible. Much kudos must go to De Ravin for having to perform through her scene during the trailer-camper attack. But the two actors who excelled in the film has to be pacifist turned avenging angel Doug as played by Aaron Stafford. We see in his character Doug the lenghts a civilized human being would go through to survive and protect those he cares for. Even if this means resorting to becoming more brutal and primal than the inbred, mutant hill dwellers. It's in Doug's character where the basic premise of the clash of the modern with the primitive comes close to matching the same theme in the original. To a smaller degree this was also echoed in the Carter's teenage son Bobby. Dan Byrd of Entourage plays Bobby Carter and its in him we see the level-headedness of the family. Despite all the horror and carnage he has seen the hill dwellers have inflicted on his family, Bobby remains somewhat calm and level-headed to protect what is left of his family. The only drawback as to the cast itself was that the opposing family seemed to have been shortchanged. In the original we actually got to understand some of the motivations that drove the hill dwellers to prey on unsuspecting travelers through their area. In this remake the hill dwellers seem more like superhuman monsters and boogeymen. It didn't bother me as much, but then it also lessened the impact of the story's basic premise of civilization versus primitives.In the end, Alexadre Aja has cemented himself as this generations premiere horror auteur. The Hills Have Eyes might not be the original second helping some have expected from Aja after his brilliant, if somewhat flawed first major film with Haute Tension, but it does show his growth as a filmmaker and his clean grasp of what makes horror cinema truly terrifying and uncomfortable. Two ingredients that makes for making a genre exploitation fare into something of a classic. I'm sure that outside of the horror-aficionado circles this film will either be met with indifference or disgust, but for those who revel in this type of film-making then it's a glorious continuation of the grindhouse horro revival that began with Aja's own Haute Tension, continued by Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and Roth's Hostel. It truly is a great time to be a fan of horror. And Aja's The Hills Have Eyes more than holds its own against Craven's original.",10,1,4,20 November 2006
Saw III," Saw Wraps up tight.....can you find the key in time?
","Saw 3 does what most third installments don't do; it comes back at us with a tight script, super laden with mystery and yet despite all the loose ends that tighten, does not lose its power. Coupled with this are supreme images of ghastly terror within the modernized medieval type torture devices that we never get enough of.Saw 3 picks up lightly where the 2nd one left off, but does not dwell there long. In this film, we're reintroduced to jigsaw yet again, but more of the focus is on his apprentice this time. Meantime, several characters, some strangers, some not, come into play. One of the 'key' (no pun intended) members of this cast is Jeff (played by Angus MacFadyen). Jeff is apprehended by someone and soon finds himself in quite a predicament. The key (again, no pun intended) here is that unlike other victims of the vigilante/vengeance psychopath known as 'jigsaw', Jeff is not shackled, bound or trapped. His quest is to take place throughout the industrial maze of brick, steel and cement landscape that has become a staple of 'Jigsaw' hangouts. Jeff has not been paying attention to the family that needs him, but only because of hatred that has filled him over the loss of a loved one. Now he must play jigsaw's final game, to see if he can overcome his problems and in the process, simply survive the carnage.Jigsaw's apprentice (Amanda, played by Shawnee Smith) has quite a past of her own as we soon discover. Despite the power you would think she would yield, we quickly learn how fragile all the seams of life really are. Saw 3 again shows great imagination and unique direction in the horror genre with such devices as the shotgun collar, attached body chains, ribcage reversal vest, the ice shower, pig guts vat, and another called 'the rack'. Jigsaw (played brilliantly by veteran actor Tobin Bell) has more tricks up the sleeve than you can shake a blade at. The writing of Saw 3 is superb as it intertwines multiple characters on a destiny soaked with death. The key again, is also its ability to not make to much of a puzzle of it as much as intertwine past events of the first two movies to make it come together with one final showdown. What will become of Jeff? What happens at Jigsaw's bed when the minute is up? Will the apprentice fulfill her mission or die trying? Gore Factor of this movie is a 9 of 10. At times Saw 3 is able to freak you out with its nailed hands, ripped skin and breaking bones. The humanity and irony that surrounds some of its more special parts is often drowned out with glimpses of complete carnage so gory that you just better hope you saved Dinner for later.",9,1,2,20 November 2006
Batman Begins," A great way to begin The Batman franchise....again!
","Since his first dramatic appearance in Detective Comics in 1939, Batman has grown to become a pop-culture icon. From movie serials in the 40's, to a classic campy TV show in the 60's, to a solid animated series in the 90's, fans have thrilled to the super heroics of this unique character. However, as a film franchise, he has brought results that were somewhat less than impressive creatively. While the Tim Burton directed films, BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS were stylish and dark, they also suffered from plot holes you could drive a Batmobile through. Then Joel Schumacher introduced a Day-Glo sensibility to the Dark Knight in BATMAN FOREVER, before drowning the character in ludicrous costumes (a Bat suit with nipples???), pun-filled foes, and whiny sidekicks in the lousy BATMAN & ROBIN. By then, Batman as cinematic property had become a laughingstock. Fortunately, indie film director Christopher Nolan reinvigorates the franchise in glorious form in BATMAN BEGINS, a reboot of the Batman legend that, for the first time, puts the focus squarely on our hero and not on the over-the-top villains of past films. Nolan also bases the film in a strong semblance of reality that allows the audience to not only accept the possibility of the winged vigilante, but embrace it as well.Most fans already know the story of how wealthy Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) loses his parents when they are slain during an attempted robbery, but the movie also tells how he chose the bat as his symbol, as well as the steps needed to become the avenger of the night that he turns into. Disillusioned and frustrated by Gotham City's corrupt judicial system, the young Wayne goes abroad to study the criminal mind. Later, while locked in an Asian prison, Wayne is recruited by the enigmatic Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers him a path in which to focus his anger and hone his skills. Wayne eventually joins his new mentor as a recruit in the mysterious League of Shadows, headed by the sinister Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Wantanabe). Eventually, Wayne realizes that he cannot follow the League's extreme methods of dispensing justice and returns to Gotham to forge his own way. It soon turns out that Wayne's return is just in time as Gotham falls prey to a fear epidemic engineered by the twisted Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA 'the Scarecrow' (Cillian Murphy) and a familiar figure from Wayne's past.From the top on down, this film is blessed with a solid cast that adds wonderfully to Nolan's vision. As the title hero, Christian Bale blows all other Batman portrayals out of the water with his intense and scary take of the role. This is a Batman that you not only fear, but can relate to as well. In fact, he turns in the definitive performance. Michael Caine adds warmth and humor as Wayne's trusty butler, Alfred. Liam Neeson does a great variation of his usual mentor roles as Ducard, a man with his own surprising secret. As an assistant DA and Wayne's childhood friend, Katie Holmes does a nice job with what is basically a thankless role. Cillian Murphy makes for a perfectly creepy Scarecrow, while Morgan Freeman is solid as usual as the man who provides Batman's wondrous car and gadgets. Gary Oldman is wonderfully cast against type as Jim Gordon, one of Gotham's few honest cops. The scene in which he drives the tank-like Batmobile is a sheer delight.The screenplay by Nolan and David Goyer (who wrote the BLADE films) is awash with characterization and motivation...something that you don't see in many comic book films as a rule. In fact, you get so engrossed by the proceedings that you almost forget that you are watching a 'superhero' film in the first place. The special effects are used to enhance the story and not overpower it, while the set design pictures a Gotham that is a unique cross of Chicago, New York and Hong Kong. If there is a flaw, it lies in some of the fight sequences. Done in close-ups and quick cuts, they can get frustrating for those who want to see more of Batman's fighting style. However, this is very minor since the story never ceases to grasp your attention.In the end, Nolan and his superb cast and crew succeed in achieving what was once thought impossible: the resurrection of a film franchise that, if not dead, was at least on life support. As a result, Batman is once again flying high and BATMAN BEGINS is a film that I wholeheartedly recommend.",10,1,2,20 November 2006
Sin City," Enjoyed every second
","While it's probably a total clichÃ© to say it by now, Sin City really is a wild thrill ride of a movie, and quite possibly the most entertaining thing that will hit theaters all year. Adapted by director Robert Rodriguez from Frank Miller's graphic-novel series, it's an energetic slab of Ne-noir, complete with twisted characters, ambiguous morality, and deadly serious dialog. For those who thought the Kill Bill movies weren't bizarre or violent enough, Sin City ought to seem like a stylish, action-packed gift from guy-movie heaven. It's filled with negativity, outrageously over the-top bloodletting, and some of the blackest humor known to man, but it all works anyway.It should be noted right off the bat that Sin City is not a movie for everyone, but if you're the type who would like it you presumably know who you are. IF you like crime movies, especially those filled with action and atmosphere, you will almost certainly get a kick out of Sin City. As everyone (and probably their brothers) knows by now, Sin City was filmed using real actors against a black-and-white CGI background with some touches of color added for dramatic effect. It may seem like a gimmick at first, but Sin City is all about bringing the viewer into a sort of parallel universe, so this unconventional device works perfectly. Sin City is a movie dealing with lives on the edge, and it conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter. Weighty themes and over-the-top violence abound here, and it's only fitting that the movie's look and feel should be so uniformly haunting. Consisting of three tangentially related stories occurring out of sequence, Sin City brings the viewer into an underworld populated by thieves, murderers, hookers, and dirty cops, and the morality is viewed entirely in shades of gray. In the Basin City of the movie, where the good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse, violence is often a virtue, or at the very least a prerequisite for survival. If there's one redeeming value to Sin City's cartoons ultra violence, it's that it's painfully clear that its recipients generally deserve it.Anyway, if there's one theme running through all of these stories, it's that of redemption. The protagonist in each tale (Bruce Willis's Hartigan, Rourke's Marv, and Clive Owen's Dwight) is a most unlikely hero (although Hartigan is just a regular cop and therefore not exactly bad, whereas it's clear that Marv and Dwight are murderers), but each finds himself driven to acts of extreme courage and sacrifice in order to see justice done. Sin City portrays a kind of heroism not typically seen in movies (especially big-budget, sanitized Hollywood productions), one that comes from doing the right thing even when it's nowhere near being the easiest thing. Rourke's Marv is probably the most memorable character, a hulking thug with a highly overdeveloped sense of vengeance who managed to arouse some of my sympathy even as he cut a swath of unimaginable destruction through his enemies on his way to avenging a murdered prostitute. Out of the legions of other figures in the movie, the great Benicio Del Toro deserves some special mention as a comically malevolent crooked cop who won't shut up even after he meets his unfortunate end.Now, although I've gone on too long already, I'd feel remiss if I didn't talk about Sin City's staggering violence quotient. Yes, this an extremely graphic movie, and much of the violence is downright disturbing to watch (Elijah Wood's character being cut up and fed to a wolf is a prominent example, even if much of the violence in that case was implied), but it's just as true that context is an important factor when considering just how offensive such bloodletting is. Now, for one thing, Sin City is meant to be a piece of escapist cinema, so nothing that takes place on screen should be taken too seriously anyway. After all, no one got offended during the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when King Arthur cut off the Black Knight's arms and legs; that scene was meant to be funny and it was. Perhaps more to the point, the violence here is so ludicrously over the top from the opening scene that it's hard to imagine any rational person getting too upset. You have to just go with it; if you're the kind of person who makes it a point to be huffy and offended all the time you shouldn't be seeing this movie anyway. 'Nuff said",8,0,1,20 November 2006
