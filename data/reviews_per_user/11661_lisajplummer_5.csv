It," Remake
","Not often do i enjoy a remake, I loved the original, so leave it alone right?
Nope I'm wrong, this was fantastic ! I loved how it respected the book, the original movie, the original characters!
Can't wait for the second movie, love the new take on pennywise, very dark and spooky",9,1,1,2 August 2019
Toy Story 4," Imaginative
","I enjoy all toy story movies, beautiful stories, amazing characters and everyone can relate to something within the plot at some point from their own childhoods.
I enjoyed toy story 4 but to be this should have been a separate spin off. The 3rd installment ended with such an emotional and touching point it made everyone stop and consider what we should do with our old unwanted items lying around in boxes.
This movie started and ended with me questioning; was there really need for any of this, none of it spoke to emotionally and I truly believe there was no need for it. I didn't enjoy how the toys interacted so strongly in the day to day life of 'people', upto now the movies made you believe toys came to life when you weren't looking but not in this movie.... they're very much real.
I loved the new characters but all the old characters were background pieces which supports my belief that this movie was a spin off and shouldn't be watched as a true lover of toy story expecting a 4th installment.",4,1,2,5 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Disappointed
","I love Tarantino movies, I could watch some of them on repeat and each time appreciate a different aspect. They're a work of art and not only do they capture great storytelling but they showcase actors and actresses great performances.
Unfortunately for this move it just didnt hit the spot, I kept on waiting for the twist, the punchline, the energy..... but all I got was a tale of a daytime drama.
I give this review 3 stars and this is truly hard as I felt that Brad Pitt deserves a 10 for a fantastic performance and possibly for showcasing the greatest 15 minutes scene within the entire movie.
The stars of the movie are fab and I loved each and every role they were set as the acting was exceptional. For me the storyline wasn't what I wanted in a movie. On ending I felt..... wheres the rest ??",3,5,7,29 February 2020
Aladdin," Unfinished
","Not yet finished watching, stopped watching around halfway. I personally felt the songs were spoken rather than sung and couldn't get into the movie in any way. It's a shame as I have enjoyed the other revamped Disney movies, this just didn't catch my interest.",2,2,4,27 September 2019
The Lion King," Epic
","I had tears in my eyes watching the opening scene as it was so close the original.
I had the pleasure of visiting south Africa 3 years ago and watching the lion king just reminded me of the beauty that is there.
Loved how much darker scar was and how the hyenas were more focussed on as scavengers.
Loved the movie, loved the music, can't wait to view again.",10,2,8,2 August 2019
