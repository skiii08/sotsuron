Hereditary," Seriously?
","I get that it nailed the 'drawing you in' factor and left you intrigued. The acting was definitely above par for a horror flick (Toni Collette rocked). That having been said, it held up for the first 90 minutes and then just got beyond frustrating. Yeah, I get the grandma was a satanist and that's the root of everything that transpired. Kudos to the writers for doing their research on satanists and satanic gods. That's all pulled together. I personally know nothing about that field so that further ostracizes me from following the plot. However, after learning of her family's truly extensive mental health issues (which after watching the movie I'll say alleged mental health issues) it makes you wonder if the plot is deeper or better than just.....satanist. It does add to the 'is she losing her mind?' factor, but all in all I suppose I was hoping for more explanation or a more clear synopsis. I guess if you're a satanist you followed it well, but the rest of us are just left feeling a bit robbed.",5,1,2,3 January 2019
