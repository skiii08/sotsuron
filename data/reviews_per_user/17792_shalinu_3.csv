Hereditary," Not for Hardcore Horror Fans
",Overrated movie. Don't expect much from it. Falls short as a horror movie.,5,0,3,5 September 2018
Dear John," Horrible Movie!!
","This is unbelievable. How can this even count as a romantic movie? I mean really?? You just swing around like that without consequences? She had options and she chose the worst one. You can really take care of people without naming the relationship. There is difference between feeling pity, giving support and utter stupidity. I am not gonna name anyone so that this could be max half the spoiler and half you can figure out by yourself. But if I would have been dieing and have few months left, I die making things and not breaking it. Stay away, this movie is not about love and sacrifice. Its about wrong choices and misuse of the most important emotion of Humankind.",2,1,1,22 September 2019
Prometheus," Avoid At All Costs --- This Movie is Over Rated !!!!
","I have never ever seen such stupid movie in my life, two most anticipated movies in Sci-Fi genre and both are awfully stupid and tries to make us the same. First was battle ship and now this one. Looks like Hollywood is no more interested in intelligent plots or more intellectual scripts.To the Director - What are you drinking bro ??!!! Have you read the script once? I mean you spent $130,000,000 ?? really?? You should have donated it to some poor country ....Why waste ?? Here it is, a bunch of jerks goes to find our creator on another planet, may be many light years away. Funny thing is they just reach there and park their ship right next to an alien one, just like that, yeah like they have been beckoning you, 'Hey buddy I am here, I am here, come park next to me'. If anybody from NASA will see it, I am sure they will commit suicide. Ship captain looks like rapper, no more comments on that one. Leave it, I do not want to spoil the story ... ah wait ...... THERE IS NO STORY !!! A 10 year old has written it. CG guys have done some good job, but sorry guys, it ain't saving this movie.Movie has made some money though, proving that no-body is interested in your entertainment anymore. Just give a spectacular trailer or teaser one, reap the money in opening weekends or two before the word goes out. I do not even want to waste time writing about this.......just give me back my money .....------------ DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ------------ PERIOD",1,51,98,8 July 2012
