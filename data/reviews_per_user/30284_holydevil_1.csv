Deja Vu," after thoughts about terrorism 911
","Dejavu Dejavu,,,,,D...E....J....A.....V.....U............I love this movie...however just hoping if it could be another 20 minutes longer that enable to show us what happen to 4 days after wards....if it did...there would be much appreciation and understanding by some peoples stiff mind set of whether denzil died in 4 days later or not.this IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, ONCE AGAIN DENZIL GREAT JOB...The movie gives the audience of sense of time since it was an act of terror ( bombing) since 911 we all have an idea of what if we can go back in time....if this was real...can we stop the terrorist attack...? i wonder how many time has people change their life by seeing the future...if there is actually device such as 'snow white' i guess it will be catastrophic disaster for human kind...especially if it is in the hand of george bushhy....",8,1,3,27 November 2007
