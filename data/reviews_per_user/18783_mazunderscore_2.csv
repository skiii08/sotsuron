The Blair Witch Project," The first and only.
","It is every film makers dream to spend a few thousand dollars on equipment, round up some student actors and shoot for 8 days in order to make a film that grosses over $250,0000US.I remember when this film was released and people were trying to work out if it was real or not.The main thing to remember is that ALTHOUGH it's obvious that it isn't real, creating the possibility to some that was is real, is the reason this film grossed $250,0000US! They won't be able to do this type of 'thriller' again because everyone will remember the blair witch project! It had to be started and it was started well.The actors are what make this film special. Although they are at times annoying, you must admit they do a brilliantly realistic job. Ad-lib can be a hard thing to do, but in a film of this nature it's very important and they pull it off very naturally.An interesting watch, although I doubt I could watch it more than a few times.",7,0,1,27 February 2007
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," It's been emotional...
","I'm confused to see that a lot of people seem to be comparing this film with Pulp fiction. Although I like Pulp Fiction immensely, I FAIL to see to comparison between the two films. Besides, WHY do you have to compare it to anything? Why does it have to be the 'British Pulp Fiction'? That's just stupid!! Lock, Stock is my favorite film of all time - and that, for a film buff like me, if a HUGE call. It has everything in it; comedy, wit, action, style, a great soundtrack, wonderful acting (the sexy Nick Moran being my favorite), perfect direction and cinematography and an even more perfect script. Now, the two things about this film that make it as perfect as it is, is the witty and intelligent script and the wonderful characters. Through the script and the great acting, the characters, although many, are able to really be developed, and developed well. We get to know not only the main four; Ed, Bacon, Soap and other characters like Winston, Plank, Rory and Harry so quickly. We really get a sense of who they and what their intentions are from just a short period of time with them. There are so many wonderful and clever lines in the script and they are quick and easy to miss sometimes. I would recommend watching this film at least twice (Or like me, over one hundred times) in order to gain full understanding of the dialogue. Now, it's only natural progression that after praising the film I'm to move onto talking about the writer/director, Guy Richie. To be honest I don't care about his string of not-so-good films after Snatch, which I must say, I didn't like as much as Lock Stock. To me this film stands alone as the film he became to writer/director for. I also don't care about his affiliation with Maddonna, that's his personal business and nothing to do with me. None of that stuff matters to me because this film is perfect as far as I'm concerned.I have seen and enjoyed this movie many many times over.",10,0,1,8 April 2007
