The Lobster," Disturbing, not really a 'comedy' at all, not for fainthearted
","Unfortunately, the trailers for this movie portray it as a comedy. And therefore we rented it. However we found the trailer to be quite misleading. I am particularly fond of foreign films, especially anything from Ireland or Great Britain and even enjoy subtitled flicks, but I'm afraid this one was just over the top disturbing, and not what I would categorize as a 'comedy' at all. It is definitely satirical with a very twisted sense of humor, more macabre than anything else. Would not recommend this for anyone looking for a laugh; it is very vulgar in language and is graphically violent. And we watched it with our 18 year old son, which was quite uncomfortable due to the sexually 'suggestive' (and I'm downplaying it using that term) scenes. It was not what we expected at all and is now on my top 10 'wish I could 'unsee' that' movie list. If I could give it a 'zero' I would!",1,10,13,8 August 2016
