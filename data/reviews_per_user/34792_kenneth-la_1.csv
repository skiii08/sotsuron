Hereditary," Expected more of it
","When I went to theatre I was all excited. In the media they dubbed this as 'the scariest horrormovie since 'The Exorcist''. After i watched it I was disappointed of the movie.At first I want to say that the story is a good one. There are enough twists in the storyline to make it interesting. Each time I thought I could predict what follows, turned out completely different. Also a BIG APPLAUSE to the actors and actresses in this movie. They did a terrific job. I was actually starting to mirror myself with some things that has been said during the movie. The tension was well-built. The further the movie went, the more tension there was visible in the characters.Sadly enough the movie itself was sometimes boring to watch. It was litterally the first time ever that I yawned while watching a horror movie. During the 2 hours I was sitting in my comfy chair in the theatre, I felt only one chill in the entire time. One jumpscare at the end of the movie gave me that chill. The makers did give some subtle hints at the beginning of the movie to show what will follow. But it takes too long to give the meaning because most of the viewers will forget those subtle hints in the start when the end is there.This movie is a recommendation for those who don't only want to watch horrormovies for jumpscares. There is strong tension in this movie, but it takes too long to connect all the stuff in the beginning of the movie to what happens in the end. So I would say: if you only like to be scared in a horrormovie, you shouldn't see this one. If you like a good story attached to it: strong recommendation.",4,0,0,1 July 2018
