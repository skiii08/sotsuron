Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very pleasant to watch
","I am not a hard core Star Wars fan.  I waited a couple of weeks to watch the movie.  I was suprised that this was a very pleasant movie to watch.  It accomplished what it was supposed to do, which was to setup the begining of the Star Wars story.  It is well worth the time and money to see.",10,0,0,11 June 1999
Toy Story 2," A Rare Gem
","Very few movies have been better than their original.  This movie is by far on the top of that list.  It has heart, humor, action, and most importantly....A STORY!  Not a moment went by that the audience wasn't laughing, cheering, or sniffling (there is quite a touching song that describes the past of a toy.)  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this movie.",10,0,1,26 November 1999
