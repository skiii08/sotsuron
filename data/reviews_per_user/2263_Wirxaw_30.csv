Despicable Me 2," One of the worst sequels of all time.
","WARNING: A lot of spoilers, basically a step-by-step story dissection.Where to start... perhaps with reassuring that I am a fan of the original, and I was excited when this sequel finally came out. The premise, the soundtrack, voice acting plot... of the original - was really good. Worth getting about 8\10 and an animation classic call. So let's put it as a starting position for the sequel - 8 stars. First thing in the movie that revolted me - is the image of Lucy. Nya- ish, perhaps. But a red-haired Barbie-Xena, specifically surnamed Wilde... is like a pile of excrement that you licked just to make sure it's... well, excrement. Perhaps having a Nikita-styled agent in a children cartoon is too much, but this eye-candy is something even My Little Pony haven't done. But, well, tastes vary. Second was absolute cliché of 'falling in love' with a black-haired slender guy, specifically in leather. What kind of target demographic was this aimed at, exactly? Then again, not the first, nor the last 'miracle' of modern romance. When I almost decided to delete the subject and spare myself - was Antonio's line: 'My dream is to play video games for living'. Being a rock-star, singer, millionaire, pimp - all of those I could take. Again, not the last of modern dirty clichés. But whether this line was a promotion of gaming, or, as I took it, a totally mental attack against gamers, who would think that now even such animals could be gamers? This is personal... but not false, either. After all this, I could try to be merciful... and deduct 2 stars out of 8. Party couldn't end without arousing Mexican dance. In children cartoon. That has to make it 5, no, really. But even that could be safe for children, compared to Gru's date. What do little girls have to think of that... what was her name? I'd call it horse. Do they have to have nightmares? Fear that they could become like one, or perhaps that they all are Lucies, while the rest of them females are exactly like that - horses? The manner in which they returned her - makes the clinical humor of Tom and Jerry look like Award-winner. It gets to 4, no mercy. Unfortunately, it's not over. Gru's 'in-love' street walk could last for a couple minutes more. People probably haven't got the idea what and why he is doing. And he should've been more cruel on his way back. Afterall - what gives? Remaining plot could be summed up into the diluted garbage of hero being left a fool, his babe flying away, while realizing that she is in love in such a proper time and place; damsel in distress; totally heroic and unpredicted behavior of Dr. Nefario and... well, happy end. To add one last thing: I think Macho has clearly elaborated that serum makes the subjects virtually Supermen. How is it then that a... Monster Inc escaped and drunken Sullivan-sized 'injected' Macho could be zapped like a pig with a mere lipstick-taser? Very, very convenient. So I guess it's not 4 anymore. If you are a fan of romance and don't quite have the taste... or brainpower(as rude as it is) to contemplate the failure of this movie - give it 3. It deserves it. I don't have such weaknesses, so I would give it 2, because there can't be less than 1, and, for all we know, it's Despicable Me! It deserves a star for the franchise.TL;DR: If this review even makes it in(since it's not much of a review, but then again I ain't a critic with obligations of quality), I could just say: If you like the original - Don't. Watch. This. Spare yourself and your braincells, let alone your time. Trust me, you can imagine much better plot and continuation of the story all by yourself. If there is ever going to be the Third part... leave your hopes for it, and don't let them be destroyed by this sequel.",2,7,12,18 October 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Makes Paranormal Activity look legit.
","I haven't realized that there were sequels to the questionable Cloverfield until I've watched The Cloverfield Paradox, and, while that movie doesn't deserve a particular review and could be summed up with 'Mediocre, but passable' - this one really, really shocked me. In a bad way. What was the point of this movie?Okay, the original Cloverfield has found footage, lots of CGI, franchise-setting aliens(years before Pacific Rim), some hero interaction, some hero action, but, of course, all within the ridiculously panned out camera capture. Still, it was 'original'. Cloverfield Paradox, again, tries to at least... add to the story. Somehow. It... tries, something already seen many times before, but still tries.What is 'this'? Mystery? How the hell is it a mystery? Horror? Eh...drama? That's a two hours worth of cheap sound effects that start nowhere, go nowhere and end up nowhere. That's what.So what do we have? Apparently a basic b*. Who is running away... or something. Who has an accident, wakes up, finds herself hurt(duh) and... guess what... taken care of! With medical stuff and even a leg brace. And... that she is shackled to the wall. What's her first reaction? Well, most adequate people would probably call out, or at least analyze the situation. Because maybe whoever took care of her - doesn't want her to wander around, just like nobody wants patients to run around form the hospital. Pretty basic stuff. What does she do? All kinds of idiocy. All to find out that the mysterious savior... brought her food. Instead of any kind of normal exchange, she goes out like she is in some Saw movie: 'Please, please, don't hurt me'. Damn, the b* deserves to be done right there. But - the man gives her the crutches and the key... tells her to get accustomed. Wow. Okay. So how does she react? She sets off a fire alarm, sharpens the edge of a crutch and tries to assault the man. Wow. Hilarious. Injured, debilitated, hungry, not knowing 'anything' - she tries to take out the man, who clearly tries to keep her alive. This is some JarJar Abrams level of script here. I bet the director asked: 'So how the duck am I supposed to shoot that bull?' And the answer was: 'Oh... come on... make it mysterious or scary or something. This is the best we've got and the franchise needs milking, so unless you don't want you paycheck, you better think of a way to make it happen. Don't worry about the audience. If they were dumb enough to like Cloverfield, they aren't going to complain'.Anyhow, over the next hour we find out that there is another guy, that the situation outside is actually bad, that living inside isn't too bad, yadda-yadda. All would seem reasonable to have a more practical talk by now. Instead... we get a scene, where our Wonder Woman(WW is probably only the 2nd dumbest female in movies, right after this one) crawls to a power room to reset the air conditioning and she finds... Well, supposed evidence that the man, who saved them - is probably lying. Later it goes down the road of Dawn of Justice: 'If there is even 1% chance that he is bad, we HAVE to take that chance!' So... instead of setting up a controlled situation, where they can confront him... verbally, we get a lot of montage. Which, in the end, results in a pretty forced situation, where the man, who already suffered quite a bit from their presence, finds out that they are planning something. And, in the most fluffy way, the guy decides to take the fall for the girl. And he does that just the right way. Instead of either trying a lie, or at least saying something plausible, he says that was making a 'weapon', so that he could 'take out' the man and be 'the hero' to our girl. Wow. The level of stupidity here has surpassed 9000. So, it's supposed to be a shock that the man straight up shoots him.From there on, the movie gets to the worst part - the most forced and unlikely escape, some alien activity outside, our girl single-handedly taking out an alien spaceship and braving out to help the people in hospital. Because she is, apparently, a clothes designer, who managed to do a few tiny stitches and who just got balls enough to go Ripley.I don't even know why I give this two stars. Maybe because the heroes tried to act... particularly the anti-hero. He really carried this movie. And because it's a Cloverfield movie and I was dumb enough to watch it for that. Because there are no redeemable qualities in this movie. No plot, no lore, no franchise ties, nothing. It's a horrible, unthinkable, C-level script that got the funding, the greenlight and the franchise name in the title. It could literally be the worst movies of late, if it was some indie movie. You just change the finale slightly, ever so slightly, and 90% of the movie can stay EXACTLY the same.
In the end, we find out that the man was indeed a bit paranoid. And had a quarrel with his wife. Yes, apparently it wasn't the wife, who took the daughter. It was him. Absolutely common case of denial. And now he wanted to save another girl, clearly SAVE, and raise instead. Yes, he didn't want that guy in there, but... as long as he behaved, he wasn't an issue. Some time could've gone by, they could've bonded, he may even have seen reason. If they would all get cleared and try to escape the house, fighting off aliens and trying to get to the survivors - I'd give this 6-7\10. Easily. Because if the movie dedicated more time to the actual franchise, whose name it carries, and if it had the script that made even the basic modern level of stoned sense - it could, again, be passable, if not decent.Unfortunately, the movies doesn't do it. Doesn't do anything. It spits on you, it sits on you, it wastes your time, trying to exaggerate every possible situation, make every possible mistake and in the end - force the most predictable outcome. This is a clear example of how NOT to write movies. Because, lord be my witness, I've seen more creativity from Paranormal Activity parodies. The dirty and explicit ones. Ugh....",2,0,2,16 February 2018
It," That's.... it?
","What an eye-roller.... I'll be honest, the cinematography was solid. Effective... special effects, imaginative... CGI, compared to many modern horrors - this isn't a wasted effort. But the writing... I admit, I have no idea of the original, I can't compare it either to the novel or the series. But the characters are so unclear that you just roll your eyes every other scene.The elephant in the room: Why even include the fat kid in the first place? Okay, there are a few secondaries with little personality, that asthma kid, the jew, the black one - they are filler, I am surprised none of them died.And the fat kid? The movie begins by suggesting an... out of nowhere romance, literally. Right, as if a gorgeous girl, even if she is trashed, would just approach and be so nice. Golfclap. What do we see next of this kid? He takes pretty much the worst treatment of all the guys(and one of them gets his arm broken). Yet what does he do? He fights back, he shows no fear. He actually looks like a diamond in the rough, a hidden protagonist. He studies the town, he plays an important role for the plot. He even saves that token girl in the most fairy-tale way imaginable in the end.But somewhere in the middle of the plot - suddenly this... this... Harry Potter, for the lack of a better description, rises. Maddeningly driven to find his god-forsaken brother, devoid of all fear, a pure knight in shining armor. White, handsome, slender and brave. It really can't get any dumber. And when everything looks bad, who are the only people to be 'brave'? Of course, he. No zit. And the girl, because.... reasons. She is apparently also super hot, super kind, super open-minded and super brave. Just an ideal persona. Yet... the fat kid is swept under the rug. Along with all the other fillers.As far as we are concerned, the boys are grounded and hate each other. The four-eyed comedian hates both Harry Potter and his girl, yet when the damsel gets in distress, as per the norm - he immediately goes to the rescue. And so does the jew and the black guy. No questions asked, they've got nothing better to do. Even the asthma kid, who clearly got screwed by that girl, who told him that the meds are fake - blows it out on his mother and joins the rest. Just like that.Throw in a couple of 'Full Metal Jacket' scenes and we are approaching the finale. During which - the Harry Potter promises to the jew that 'if they stick together, they will be alright'. One really eye-rolling scene later, we see the jew get lost. Just like that. And, when his face is clearly getting eaten, instead of some proper gore(and, for what it's worth, by that point that movie has shown patricide twice, so it can't get any worse), he is left out with mere bites. Guess jews really aren't tasty.In the end, the Harry Potter clearly skips the girl for his bloody brother, while, as I said, the fat kid saves her. But... after a few really stupid exchanges, Harry Potter takes the lead again and... yeah, everyone leaves and he pretty much shares the final solid kiss with his future squeeze.It feels like the movie TRIED to establish the characters, to develop something non-linear. But it utterly failed and turned out as every generic flick ever. And here I thought Frozen had a ridiculous turnabout...The most unnecessary character was the black kid. Why... was he there? Token Black from South Park? Or he was in the originals too? I'm not talking about color here, I'm saying that he both had the color and the lack of any development whatsoever. And pretty much so was the jew. Well, he 'had' some extra scenes here and there, but he seemed like an annoying donkey of the bunch. The asthma kid and the four-eye? A couple of sidekicks, who can't decide which ball to rub. On one hand, they are actual sidekicks, on the other - they are just as useless. And, of course, the aforementioned fat kid, who got written off, but at least had plenty of character development. Come to think of it, the main duo had less character than even the fat kid.So it should be pretty clear why this plot feels so... weird. Eye-rolling.If they wanted to build a relationship - they should build it. If they want Harry Potter to find his brother - focus on that. Remove one or two unnecessary characters and invest more in the others, there are plenty to go. Explore more about the girl, more about Pennywise. I've almost thought it would be revealed that he is 'some freddy krueger, who got killed by the town and now he hunts it', but no. He just goes Sadako back into the well. Haven't seen that one before...I can't say that this is a bad film... all in all, it COULD get worse and stupider. But it really can't deserve any more than 6/10. Not with that plot. And it's sad, if it was well-written, it could easily be a modern horror benchmark at 8-9/10.",6,0,1,29 November 2017
John Wick," Keanu needs a payday.
","Heh, so that's what it looks like when Matrix and Equilibrium have unprotected relationship. Sadly, if the two movies above were filled not only with... extremely brilliant scenes for the technology of the time, but also quite deep and meaningful plot - John Wick seems to be a pretty one-sided coin.He lost his dearly beloved, he got mugged, that's all the premise you need. Though I do admit that Viggo's exposition was impressive, some background would be nice.Granted all the plot unravellings, I don't understand why would he hang up Viggo's call. Both John and Viggo know better, and instead of going on some mad rampage, a simpler fate could've been arranged. Much simpler. Or it could end the same, but it would at least look plausible.Red Circle encounter is laughable. Beautiful, obviously, until he stares at his desired victim and just lets him run away. I first thought he wants the usual: suffering, torture etc. But apparently he never needed it, so why not end the movie halfway through if there was a chance?All the side characters are merely plot devices. Female assassin? Has to explain what the management was. Marcus? Deus ex machina.Yosef's death could probably only rival Talia Al'ghoul's. Home siege, Red Circle, Car scene... all these great performances, yet the very antagonist of this movie was supposed to be hidden in impenetrable fortress, but... Snipe here, snipe there, done. Seriously?The list can continue, but the point is that very often the suspension of disbelief is raised, even if you really want to keep it.And, of course, I can't help but stand in line with every Russian who was severely offended by this movie. Now, I know that between Italian and Russian mafia - these nations shouldn't really be surprised when their people are slaughtered, and I would never imagine that Hollywood would ever get Russian actors. But that song? The lullaby? I know russians are a sick nation firsthand, but not even the craziest of us would sing a 'lullaby' in a nightclub in a bath with half naked women.I feel that giving the movie 7\10 is a very generous gift. If not for Wick and Viggo's performance - 5\10 would've been the right place. Aka - a movie that really isn't remotely good, but is at least worth looking for the some thrills. But hey, I can play as John Wick now, he is played by ol' good Neo and there was plenty of gun fu. Who can resist that?",7,0,2,21 June 2015
Gravity," Another marketing fake
","Let's start off directly - critically acclaimed with 8.2 rating. Since I can't vouch for mental credibility of critics, I can vouch that they have been properly paid, just like for other big titles.Now a bit more detail. Movie isn't bad. There can be worse, certainly. Movie has visuals, some music, some acting, some plot. If watching this is not an expense to you - it's worth it. However, there is nothing to expect from this movie. Absolutely.The only possible positive thing about this movie is the atmosphere. Duh, a movie about atmosphere has atmosphere! Well, better than the opposite. To some it may be boring and redundant, but I can more or less understand the purpose of depicting how helpless a person is in open space. This is the catch of the movie, and it is achieved. At this point the movie COULD in fact have 7-8 rating. But...The amount of stupidity in this movie can only be competing against Promotheos. How did this specialist get in space? Last time I checked, space program isn't some university teaching. You can't just be an 'expert' or 'specialist'. Unless all of that is an urban myth, only people with perfect health\physical condition, mental stability proved by multiple tests and extreme perception are allowed to actually go there. And that is regardless of your 'role'. And it is for the very reason that things that are shown in the movie - do NOT end like they did. What do we see? Well, mentally unstable, physically slender 'expert', who has issues in basic centrifuge situation(and that IS one of the tests). Oh, and I hope this isn't much of a spoiler, but apparently she also has never succeeded in emergency simulations. We are supposed to believe that she was allowed up there... On top of that - the dialogues are very plain. The whole movie can be summed down to protagonist whining and being babysat by her officer in charge. Twice in the movie the protagonist stays on the brink of death... for unnaturally long time. Let's put it this way. Over the course of 10 minutes, the Oxygen amount has been reduced from ~10% to 1%. In the next ~15 minutes of active talking, breath and moving - this 1% is as good as full. Seriously, no. Just no. And, of course, there is one decompression scene that is worse than Ripley in Aliens.If you are a visual fa.. fan - you will probably award it 7-9, as you'd do to any other CGI motion picture. If you are a scientific person... well, you will be offended. Totally. This is probably not the safe movie to watch.",5,3,5,8 March 2014
Zootopia," Trying too hard.
","I'll begin by saying that I clearly enjoyed the movie. Yet, since I am not am imb**ile who has a 1\10 or 10\10 rating system and 'this sucks' or 'Disney means top quality' mentality, I'll have to cynically tear even a fairly made movie in pieces. Because lord knows this movie has a 'gazelleon' of flaws.If this movie was a government sponsored child cartoon for ages 3-7, or an otherwise honest movie - I'd be gentler. But it is a Hollywood blockbuster, and a Disney one at that - so it clearly is a lie, and therefore deserves no mercy.First of all, anthropomorphism. It's getting old. Disney has built its empire on turning despicable humans into cute and cuddly drawn animals, but nowadays this trick can play a much darker role. Why are about 30-50% of females in the movie - pigs? And 'extremely' cutely animated, practically better than the rabbits? Why is there an obese police officer being appreciated? I'm surprised they didn't stuff some LGBT propaganda in there, seeing how they handled the nudists. I mean, come on, they show the nudists in every dark humor pose imaginable, yet they politely censor it to keep it G-rated. Okay, parents, time to explain your children, why were you giggling or gagging. High time... PC principal has really financed this movie, which is the first layer of lie.Then comes the idea. Do your best. Try harder. Believe in yourself, yadda-yadda. This crap has been shoved down our throats for decades, and, again, if it was an educational toddler cartoon - that'd be fine, but this an all-age blockbuster, and I personally am really tired of this nonsense hero making material. I'll never see a movie about an actual loser getting somewhere, because it doesn't sell or make sense to anyone. Nor will I see a movie, where a hero, strong or weak, lies and steps on the corpses of everyone behind him - to eventually succeed in life. Because that's how life works, and that's not a selling material. Talk about stepping on the corpses, there's a funny scene where the bunny literally jumps over others still trying to get over the ice wall. This scene was a subtle hint at the reality - if you physically can not get over an obstacle, the only way is to train and step on others, who possibly could've gotten over. But... that's not what the movie tells you.Going on, the movie even spoofs itself, when the chief tells the bunny that 'this is not some cartoon, where all your dreams come true and you miraculously just become what you've always dreamed to be'. Well, something along these lines. Because, hell, this is 'exactly' what happened, doh. A crazy bunny succeeds as a sleuth against all odds and reasons. Remembering the the Screen Junkies' catchphrase 'what a coincidence', I could quote it in the movie endlessly. That fox you've met before is just barely spotted on the 'last seen' photo? That fox knows pretty much everything about the guy? That hippie has machine memory? That fox has access to DMV? There are street cameras cover everything? The girl you saved was a daughter of ...? I could go on, but why spoil everything? Moving on, the whole plot turned from more or less swallow-able to 'because I wrote so' at about first third of the movie. And even this first third of the movie was a pain to watch, because what does our poor unappreciated bunny do when she gets a meter maid job? Besides, come on, a child cartoon gets a derogatory term for a police officer. Good going kids, now you know what to cry when you see a real life ***** doing her job. And that's totally legit, knock yourselves out! Back to the point, what does the bunny do when she is tasked to give 100 tickets? She decides to give 200! And, I think, she finally stops just a bit short of 300. And how did the writers apologize for this despicable proof of making your career off the corpses of others? 'She worked so hard she forgot about her own parking meter, so she has to give herself a ticket as well'. Boo-effing-hoo.After that the movie just went sort of The Nut Job, except for that movie was honest and didn't try to hard, eventually succeeding at being an enjoyable anthropomorphic flick without any propaganda rotting your brain as you watch.So, to conclude, did the Disney do something great? Ehh... not really. I know they can, they've made Wreck-it-Ralph, but this is more like Frozen, also trying too hard. And since I'm more biased towards animals, I guess while Frozen was an ear cancer for me, this was at least a decent watch that didn't immediately revolt me. But it 'tried', and this 'trying' is the reason I can't really say much good about the movie. Lies are not meant to be praised and given 10\10.But... you could always take your child to be zombified by this propaganda, if you can't do a better job yourself.",7,2,5,20 May 2016
Aquaman," Wonder-man
","DC never learn, do they? Well, baby steps. They thought that the success of Wooden Woman would do the trick... and they were right, clearly there aren't enough pirates in the world to show that making bad movies is bad for business.The first thing I'd like to say is that this movie is extremely dumb. Painfully. Clinically. Not Gravity level, not Prometheus or even Martian. It is Logan level of dumb. The absolute abyss, it is technically impossible to watch this movie and think rationally, so the only survivors either have their brains disabled by default, or had to. Luckily, unlike Logan - this movie is more like Avatar. It's probably the most visual since Avatar. Yes, both Nibber Panther and Infinity Quip were stunning, but... not really visual. The difference is like a game with good graphics and... Subnautica. This makes Aquaman more or less easy to swallow. Indeed, if you do NOT think about what you are watching - this is a fancy popcorn-muncher. Perhaps even worthy of going to some IMAX.Another very important feature about this movie - is that, unlike Nibber Panther and Wooden Woman, or even Captain Feminist - this movie doesn't seem to have a deep agenda. Sure, there are a few allusions and suggestions, but... I'd hardly compare it to the modern world, because we don't have a 'Karathen' and any attempt to replicate such a scenario for politics would hardly be done in CGI. Agenda, propaganda, the things that pollute Martian, Wooden Woman, Nibber Panther, Zootopia, Frozen - they are the first and foremost things that inhibit the suspension of disbelief. Because you are almost ready to give in, when the writers remind you that 'hey, this is kinda relatable, dontcha *think*?' The same goes for pretentiousness. Logan, The Shape of Water - when movies actively try to pretend to be something... that also tends to itch for people, who have problems turning their brains off. And that's the thing - Aquaman doesn't have any of that. It's a perfect example of a visually brilliant, sort of fun, filled with action superhero flick. For that - I can sort of agree that it's worth 6\10. It's nowhere near the first Avengers, it's not half as thrilling as the Dark Knight and it doesn't even begin to scrape the surface of the Watchmen, these movies were first of all 'whole' movies, with superheroes and CGI being sort of... a background. And that's what truly deserves the peaks of the rating.Aquaman isn't insightful, it doesn't show anything new. In fact, its plot is even more stupid and painful than Logan. Its characters - a copypasta from Wooden Woman. Most of the 'memorable' scenes have a 'Blue Steel' face in them, just like Wooden Woman(sorry, Galya Gadot, a model ain't an actress), so you can't really feel the characters, you don't feel anything towards them. There is no danger, no real drama, everything is as artificial, as superficial as it could be. Nichole Kidman washed up ashore? Well, let's get busy. She was hiding? Well, but how does Aquaman learn to do things? Oh, apparently he is trained already. He's fighting the bad guy? Oh, well, skip that part. Then there's some desert quipping, property damage in actually better parts of the world, then they go where they need to go, do things they need to do, chop in a CGI battle and voila - that there's a movie. I've watched a full-spoiler review of this movie before watching, so if you consider this summary a spoiler... I feel sorry for you. Someone has to.The villains make Lex Luthor look good. I guess Patrick Wilson signed up just because he was told there's an Annabelle cameo. That nibber with his father... That whole scene makes Martha look painless. There are two absolutely, clearly and unmistakably a-hole guys, one of them is allowed to live. Then he gets a chance for revenge. Then he also lives. Okay, I am a racist, but casting him as a Black Manta after Black Panther... seriously, writers, YOU make the world racist. YOU do. Either way, the perpetual survival of this absolutely E-level villain that makes Malekith and Ronan look impressive(and that's saying a LOT) - doesn't help this movie, it only helps to establish an even more stupid sequel.For all intents and purposes... An effort should've been made to turn Aquaman into the Ocean Master. Because clearly there haven't been any for a while and it's not like anyone but Momoa can do that. Ocean Master... that resounds. That's somehow more meaningful than Starlord. Aquaman? That's a Seaman joke bait. Good for a movie title, I suppose, people wouldn't have 1\5th of a brain to figure out what is the movie about otherwise, but for the movie to end with him accepting the name 'Aquaman', a moniker given by hell knows whom, when he clearly has a title... Again, I suppose the target audience wouldn't understand what 'Ocean Master' stands for.Speaking of target audience, I guess the shareholders at DC figured that DC has only one set of powers - the As-Man. So no matter who that is - Cyborg, Batman, Wooden Woman, Aquaman - all heroes need to be some sort of bullet-proof, need to be crushed into buildings and stuff, need to occasionally bleed, need to fly and be super fast. Sure, Aquaman doesn't fly or run. But somehow the only identifier that the movie sort of happened underwater - was the visual background. Otherwise it's absolutely, 101% no different from ... Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. People talk, things fly, sounds are heard, you know, bullets, battles, physics and all that. So, yes, Aquaman is about as original as Drax. Okay, scratch that. Drax is a memelord and an actually good character. Aquaman is just Jason Momoa, and his enemy is just Patrick Wilson.Maybe in a few years - DC would learn to flesh out their characters. Plots. To imagine heroes with more abilities than virtual invulnerability and lasers out of their eyes. Maybe origin stories would have some moments, where the audience would feel something for their heroes, when heroes do actually incredible things. Instead of pulling the sword from the stone. Until then - Seaman is a decent movie to download, worthy of some popcorn and IMAX. But it's not something to write home about. People, who praise it... clearly have abyss-bottom low expectations for DC movies and, in DCEU, ignoring the Dark Knight trilogy - yes, Aquaman is definitely the best movie so far. Sadly, a hero in town is only a commoner in a city, and most people live in cities...",6,0,0,14 March 2019
Suicide Squad," Suicide Mess.
","Or 'Antihero gone wrong.' Or maybe 'Direct-to-TV movie on the big screen'. It's like watching some Thor: The Dark World - you don't know what the bloody actual duck is going on. Everything is so faceless, everything is so stretched out... but at least there it kind of looked like a superhero movie.This thing... I think this should actually be Ghosbusters 3, with Gozer coming back. Because, seriously, there was nothing superhero here. I know it's about metahumans and stuff, but damn, if Jeremy Renner can pull it off(much less Deadpool) - why can't a whole freaking squad?Speaking of the squad - it's laughable. Over 50% of the people probably went to see the movie just to look at Margot Robbie's underwear. She acted well, granted, but was probably the biggest eye candy there is. Is that how she really is in comics? I know Black Widow is blamed for that reason exactly, but she is at least in a full leather suit and has quite a character. Harley's character is like a punchline without a joke. She has a couple of bullying scenes, but instead of being a strong, ferocious fighter, she is... just being there for the shots. She narrates, gets the shots, and that's it.Deadshot, to be honest, does not need to be played by Smith. Really, the amount of character and the amount of action he had - could've been easily done by any black Marvel actor. Why would I say it... oh, right, because they've already had more character, so it's done. I admit, I don't like Smith, he is overpaid and over-hyped. But if he can do things, like the original Independence Day or other older movies - he does it. Here he just... makes a few faces occasionally. And delivers a few lines of forced dialogue. I don't see why people think he saves the movie. He is written, sort of, but he gets too much screen time for no good reason. He is like the leader against all common sense, a cute and cuddly assassin, who is suddenly legit. One would think an assassin, who can whack-talk a buyer into 2$mil salaries - would've done a few jobs and disappeared, just stolen his daughter for f's sake and lived in a mansion somewhere remote. No, he needs to be kind of Ant Man, who is struggling to get a job in Baskin Robbins.Rick Flag is... yawn. Anyone watched Captain Phillips? Now there's the SEAL Leader. Just a leader of a spec-ops team created to get -it done. Almost R. Lee Ermey style. Here we have a pussy-whipped American hero, who... Do I really need to continue?That's about it. Diablo is DC's Quicksilver. A character sort of there just to die stupidly in the end. Katana doesn't do anything(except ridicule the Japanese culture, down to the point of harakiri). Jay Courtney is, as always, wasting screen time. Killer Croc's biggest performance in the movie was the reveal that he is black. And why exactly did they add Slipknot? To show that Jay is an a-hole? It's funny, with the speed of his escape, a child could gun him down, but he needed to be made an example...As for the Joker... well, I kind of liked him. He tried. Overacted, perhaps, but at least he tried to get to the comics' level. Unfortunately, there is a thin line between smart and crazy, and Leto went with full on crazy. We've had a clown of the nineties. We've had an unnerving terrorist of Nolan. And in the comics, he looked crazy, but he was ultimately sinister. Here he just... kinda... makes faces, does crazy things... He serves as an exposition, and not just as an exposition, but more like a wrong advertisement. Like a dentist's drilling tool in the toothpaste ad. Looks good, but leaves an aftertaste... Still, as any crazy character - at least crazy is guaranteed to have character, and Leto gets a credit for trying.Now for the bad guys. Well, they pop out of out nowhere. Here's Enchantress, deciding to do... uhm... a little bit of night walking, which conveniently coincides with the anti-heroes first class. Her brother is that kind of invulnerable almighty guy that will die, because of something stupid. Like Apocalypse. And she is practically Azazel+Scarlet Witch, but all she does is a bit of choreography for the camera, and then she gets fooled like a troll in the first Hobbit movie. She can read their minds, see them through the walls, but she can't predict the most obvious deception? Who wrote that again? Oh, right, that was not about her, it was about Harley, she had to do something in the whole movie.As for the minions, they are the classic minions. When they attack random SWAT teams - they are some ravaging, shifting and unkillable monsters, tearing people apart etc. When they fight out heroes, they become those droids from The Phantom Menace, who kind of just sit there on your shoulder until you throw them off. And they die with one bullet shot(or baseball bat whack)On top of that - many questions remain:-Who was shooting at the helicopters? -Why did Walker's helicopter escape 20 feet off the ground right into the lightshow? -Why did Walker keep these artifacts in her bedroom? So... yes, for the small screen, a TV flick with a little bit of CGI, some costumes, little character development and crazy plot - that'd be quite a nice evening watch. But theatrical release with 175$mil budget? Let me guess, Will Smith costed at least 50.Let's call Suicide Squad a 'Scary Movie' of 'DCU'. Scary Movie 4 of DCU, to be precise.",4,0,1,19 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," JarJar has stolen someone's work once again.
","I don't think anyone would be surprised by now that The Force Awakens was basically A New Hope Remastered with pretty much nothing added to compensate. And, given that The Last Jedi was directed by someone who clearly enjoyed the Holiday Special - JarJar was left with no options. The new emperor(Snoke) is dead, he can't copy The Empire Strikes Back, and thus not The Return of the Jedi, but then JarJar thought... But what if he actually DID copy The Return of the Jedi? But how? Luckily, the expanded universe gave him an answer.Star Wars: The Old Republic - Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion, year 2015. An Emperor who is suddenly alive on a far away planet, who has built a fleet of ships out of thin air, who is interested in possessing the main character and who is definitely hell-belt on purging the galaxy. The plot was already laid out. Not to mention a few other similarities, but they are inconsequential. I mean, just the little things like extremely powerful force ghosts, force healing AND resurrection... In a proper medium, a video game, and in the expanded universe that wasn't chained by the few examples of the force from the movies - it all made sense.But that wasn't quite enough for JarJar. I mean, he had two for two - a plot to steal and a story to remaster, but that's not enough for the man. He hated Ryan Johnson's attempt at Christmas Special Remaster SO much that he was ready to spend.... 'dozens' of minutes of screentime to just... flip a bird and stick it up to Ryan and his efforts. Eliminating General Hux? Yep. Making Snoke into a further joke? Yup. Making even more fun of Luke? You bet. Killing Finn? Finally! Making Rey train, so that she was basically a Jedi God? Oh, yeah, that helps.Essentially JarJar took the goal of The Return of the Jedi as the frame, then splattered the paints from KOTFE as the main plot, and just slashed with his brush, while laughing maniacally, lining the picture with various 'F you Ryan' jokes, the key of which being that he made Rey into a Palpatine, but still got her to call herself a Skywalker. So he showed Ryan the candy he wanted, and then ate it.Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the conclusion of one billion-dollar worth of production trolling. And you all have paid Disney dearly for it. Enjoy.",1,45,68,16 January 2020
Justice League," DC don't learn, do they?
","One would think that after four movies - DC would learn something. The senseless action of Man of Steel, the disgorged story of Batman vs Superman, the sheer, utter stupidity of Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman... And they've brought all the worst parts of the three together. Now, before I get too far, I'll admit that the movie is has a contrast with BvS - if BvS started fine and ended terribly, then this movie does the opposite: start terribly, but improve by the end. Which is why, ultimately, 4-6\10 is something this movie deserves, no more, no less. It's no Suicide Squad or Iron Man 3, there is something good hidden within it, but it's hidden among a heap of trash.First things first - the opening, the premise, the story and the scenery. All the minor details that add up to the cringe. In the opening scene we see Batman struggle\toy with a minor criminal, causing collateral damage just to... apparently attract an alien scout that... well, just came out of nowhere. And Bats left the criminal just like that. This scene is so badly written, poorly executed with camera cuts and has so little practical value to the movie that it could easily have been covered by exposition. Because it's hard to find a lesser evil between a bad cringeworthy scene and extra exposition, which this movie already holds aplenty. This sets the premise of parademons and the invasion. Now, apparently Lex Luthor was spoofing something about it, but... You know, the properly big Marvel movies feature properly big stakes. There is a reason why Thor 2 was panned - because an apparent universal threat was dealt in a duel within like one square kilometer. This is the same thing. Doomsday was a thing that even Superman couldn't stand up to, and Lex somehow knew and was mumbling about this Steppenwolf, back then, much more devil-looking godlike creature. Now, of course, Darkseid was mentioned and he is somewhere in P3 with Thanos, but what did this Steppenwolf turn out to be? Some retextured Ares with vague abilities that could take on the five heroes just fine, but who didn't even remotely stand a chance against Superman? Man, the balance and the stakes in this movie are sooo off. Batman's daring attempt to revive Supe was so bold that I thought... wait, wait wait wait, wasn't this supposed to be JUSTICE LEAGUE? Nope. The movie spent so much time sucking the idea of Superman's importance(boy, how on Earth did the world live for thousands of years before this freak came around) that it's really sad how everything must revolve around one character. Maybe they should write a New Testament or something... Instead of showing a competent team action with a failure and a chance to recognize this failure and look for compromise, we are thrown into a half-reared resurrection, even more ridiculous Supe vs JL fight than Civil War showdown(and that's saying something), and then we get a boring beatdown of the team by one weirdly written antagonist, all the while KNOWING that Superman is coming, and when he comes - it's a total pushover. Just like in Wonder Woman. There is not even that ridiculous choice scene of the Man of Steel, the enemy is just stomped. And, talking about scenery, I guess they really had to call some spot in 'Russia' as the 'rear end' of the world. And they really made some lovely remarks about it. I guess there was a good reason to bring another country into the mix, and an even better one to just leave it at that. That Steppenwolf would've been nuked six ways from Sunday before these heroes even began sorting out their hormones...Talking about heroes, I see DC has tried desperately to replicate the levity and the humor of Suicide Squad.... of the lack thereof. Barry, apparently, loves his dad who killed his mom and it's so sobby and teary that we don't have a clue whether he did that, why did he do that and why does Barry even care for his father still. This character story is just there for the checkerbox. And Barry himself seems to be a very weird guy, who apparently has already built himself a suit(that even Bats complimented) and is living quite the life. The comedian of the team, he looks about as silly as a Spiderman copy. And this is something I would rather not touch with a 5-foot pole. Cyborg is a brooding and annoying teen in a metal suit, who seems to have been built from the Allspark... I mean, the Tesseract... Ugh, screw this, who transforms like a terminator.Wonder Woman is as terrible as ever, Gal Gadot's desperate attempt at facial expressions really hit that nail in her coffin as an actor. I mean, just look at her while she was looking for Cyborg in that dark street - I haven't seen such an unusual face in a while. I think she needs to take a few lessons from Trump - the guy can make an expression. And her powers - DC really has gone 'ah, duck it, we'll just roll with it'. Superspeed, super reflexes, indestructible gear... I thought Woman Woman was terrible, but this bank robbery scene has really gone so overboard that I really couldn't care less about her character. She is like Mario - brain hurtingly stupid in everything, but... loved for... reasons.Aquaman was really out place. Even more than Barry - he felt like he was there just for the poster image. Indestructible, without any special powers, he, WW and Cyborg really were very generic in this movie. The reason Marvel succeeds - is because their heroes are unique. Each has a role and a style, weak points and special stuff. DC lacks that. Superman is a brute. Wonder Woman is basically a female Superman now. Aquaman is like a lesser Superman, but still a brute. Cyborg is a terminator brute. Barry is a pizza delivery service. And Batman's greatest power is to have big machines torn apart by brutes.I mentioned that the movie gets better in the end - yes, the action and some visuals are decent, but, again, with the revived Superman, with the pathetic copy of Tesseract\Infinity stones, the bad writing of the antagonist and the vague heroes - it only gets 'so' much better. It's better than the last Fantastic Four, definitely, but Justice League still fails to do DC heroes justice(pun intended).DC needs to focus on character development: unique sides, personality, strengths and weaknesses. The story must feel like a whole picture, not a bunch of notes thrown together. The enemy must have the scale, the stakes, the impact. Even Marvel suffers there, even Ultron did, but damn did the character of Ultron deliver. Hell, Ares had a little screen time and he was a better villain. DC takes notes from Marvel's worst movies: WW copied First Avenger, this thing copies The Dark World. Is this really what it takes to be different from GOOD movies?I'll finish my review with something very, very cold. And I'm not sorry for it. 'Groot had more personality in GotG than any of Justice League.' Ruminate on that.",5,0,1,26 December 2017
Ender's Game," Spectacular.
","Really a jewel among modern Sci-Fi. Great visuals, just enough to look good, but not enough to look abhorrent. Good acting - impressive actors, solid performance. Maybe nothing 'hardcore', but they are kids. Ender is a kid. And that is a very good start. Fair music, noticeable right when needed. Could be better, but not all movies are grand movies. And most importantly... something that practically all modern movies totally lack... SENSE! This movie has sense(whether thanks for the original book or not). It has morale, logic, a deep thought about it. And it's not something on the level of Disney drool opera of Avatar scale. Nothing like a big flip off with the purpose of guessing of Promotheos. It's not about victory, it's about the reason for victory. Really something amiss in modern competitive gaming.What could be better? Perhaps a bit more story escalation. Of course, the whole movie is about the genius rising, but the plot looks too much placeholder. Maybe something else, but can't quite figure any other real issue.What's important, is that the movie fits it's motto - balance. Tactical, quality approach. It may not be a grand blockbuster, but it's not another stupid Sci-Fi that you will watch for lulz and soon forget. It's a movie that both entertains, becomes memorable and teaches. I give it 8, it may deserve more, it may call for less. But it should stand out above average low-quality designs.",8,0,2,20 February 2014
Dunkirk," I can't believe this was Nolan.
","As a huge fan of Nolan, of his movies, his personality, his approach to cinematography, I can't believe I'm writing this review as it is. I've read a lot of other reviews, I knew that something might be 'weird', but what I've seen is beyond any hope.First of all, I think Nolan has tripped over his own ego. Now, I love parallel cinematography. When it is established in a rich movie, when you care about the characters and the plot - yes, watching Inception is a breathtaking thrill, watching Dark Knight is a constant surge of action and Interstellar is just a heartstopper with tears for the cast. This is all good and reasonable. However, when the movie is shot like a... I'm sorry, this is the only thing that comes to mind: Empire at War cinematic mode, where the game camera closes to a random character and shifts every 5 seconds, giving you some cinematic feel to what's going on - it doesn't work. So much in fact that the only movie I can compare Dunkirk to in terms of 'nothingness' - is Gravity, and this movie I hate with passion. It's almost like a scene that is cut from 10 angles, forcing the screen to flicker while you watch a simple action. The movie doesn't revolve around stages of the evacuation, it doesn't have beginning, all the steps and the outcome. Everything happens in less than a day, as far as I'm supposed to believe, really fairy-tale like. And this whole tiny action is shot from multiple irrelevant angles. With the shots changing so frequently that you not only have issues following through, but you also couldn't care less about what's going on. What was supposed to be 'bloody war' turned out into a bigger video game than Hobbit.Secondly - characters. Oh, I've read about that, I knew they would be lacking and I've tried to embrace that desperate perspective that they are all 'meaningless' in a war. But it doesn't happen. See, if you establish a character, you either follow through or you dispose of him. Yet the four major characters that we are supposed to follow - are absolutely god-protected invulnerable heroes... without a speck of interest in them. In fact, the most developed character in this movie, the one with the most lines, most acting and most care - is the owner of one of the civilian boats that go on to the rescue. Him I quite enjoyed, and if at least half of the cast were built likewise - this movie wouldn't be such a disaster, pun intended. He had an origin story, where he appeared from, he had various impacts on the plot, lots of character interactions, his moral and spirit was established, his skills and precision. But that doesn't apply to everyone.So, who are these characters? It begins with a bunch of... someone, who clearly is absolutely clueless about the situation, with the main character's key objective is to relieve himself. Yes, that natural call is apparently very important to capture on camera, because it will be repeated later at least once(unsuccessfully, apparently) and for the rest of the movie he, I suppose, will be walking with a pantload of compost. But why do I say clueless? Because we have no idea, 'absolutely' no idea who are they or where do they come from. We just see that they are seemingly dressed as soldiers, yet they walk around like it's Fallout 4... no, wait, I take it back. Fallout 4 is much more suspenseful. So, when the random gunfire occurs, it just 'takes away' all the faceless 'whowasthatagain's with zero blood or anything remotely reminiscent of gunfire animation, people just DROP DEAD like it's a B-rated 1950 with 0 special effects. Now, I confess, I wasn't shot in real life. But I'm pretty sure they weren't head\heartshot by snipers, and a gut or shoulder shot doesn't just force you drop dead. Realism is not a goal of Dunkirk, it seems. Anyway, the protagonist survives, finds a french trench... I mean, a french barricade, introduces himself as 'English' and that's about it, he enters the next zone - the beach. All in all, this whole scene is so terrible that I remember the gruesomeness, the intensity and the grotesque of Downfall. A child there could navigate the streets better than these... 'whoweretheyagain's.This same character later... kind of befriends someone, they try to sneak onto a ship by carrying a wounded person, whom they found to be still alive, yet forgotten. This goes on for some time, and in the end, the ship just gets blown up, and the second major character, the Admiral or somezit, just has to accept that the ship will sink with all the wounded. This immediately brings a serious question to mind - 'why the hell did they even try to save the wounded'? It was mentioned that a single wounded person takes space of seven men. So grouping them on a boat that might just get blown up randomly - isn't a very reasonable, much less humane option. Anyway, some time around that, we are introduced to the third key character - Tom Hardy. He is flying with a couple of planes, one of which will just fall and sink without any explanation, moving on, the other will also fall and sink, but with some explanation which suggests that these 'brilliant spitfires' apparently had the build quality of a toy plane. Tom Hardy, in turn, will shoot like a stormtrooper for the most part of his half an hour flight, a lot of attention will be centered on how he hopelessly fails to save 'anyone'. But, yes, in the end he manages to finally shoot that Heinkel when it's a clear frontal shot. Hell, he shoots just like me in first-person shooters! I was desperately hoping for some cliched, yet heroic sacrifice of him ramming something, but... no. Instead he flies to Dunkirk on what apparently is long-ended fuel(very reminiscent of Gravity's oxygen scene, even if he is shown to switch to a reserve tank). His floating along Dunkirk beach with his rotor STOPPED is... I don't know. It's like Nolan can now direct Ridley Scott movies, Star Wars and Transformers. All the franchises killed by inconceivable stupidity. I'm no expert, but a cartoon shot from Looney Tunes or Madagascar 2 comes to mind that, when the rotor damn stops - the plane falls down. It's not a kite, it's a huge metal contraption that weights quite a bit. So, instead of properly falling down, like every other plane in the movie, he, against all the rules of aerodynamics, not just glides along the beach, but also manages to fly up and shoot some incoming Messer or something. Not sure I was supposed to care about that. How did he end up? You don't want to know, trust me.In the end, I'd like to mention music. Again, I've read good and bad stuff about it, but I knew that, technically, there are two types of scores: a Hans Zimmer score and ... not a Hans Zimmer score. What I heard was jawdropping. Throughout the whole movie there wasn't a single memorable tune. That 'evergrowing' motiff, that 'heart\run imitating' motiff and, of course, the clocks ticking. Wow. I can understand when a b-rated composer just tries to fill the movie with cheap suspense, but for Hans Zimmer to go down this road of 'nothingness'... I guess Nolan straight ordered the good Zimmer to do as blank of a soundtrack as he could, because this is what the movie needed...and very much deserved. But for Zimmer's professional track, it has to be a very embarrassing flop.Dunkirk was said to be a 2-hour long action from start to an end. Yet it started as a doozy and ended as a melodrama. With shots throughout having about as much action as that fence-climbing scene from Taken 3. Ouch. And for anyone wondering, I watched it with DTS sound on a 24-bit chip with 24-bit Sony headphones on an extremely crisp amoled screen. So, no, I didn't miss any sound effect. I heard 3D sound with all the depth that it had. I was also not distracted by screen size or color reproduction, it was an HDR experience that may have made a 'few' scenes worth something, but, ultimately, did not point out any brilliant cinematography. Maybe I needed to watch it in 4K home cinema or some IMAX, but the former is a bit out of my budget for movie entertainment, while for the latter, the reviews say that the whole thing is too loud to properly enjoy. What I do know is that the previous Nolan movies were masterpieces that did not require ANYTHING to be fully enjoyable. Much like watching Wonder Woman made me want to re-watch The First Avenger, so, after Dunkirk, I feel like I need to revisit the better days of Nolan, when movies were packed with action, cinematography, special effects and a soundtrack to remember.I sincerely hope that this flop would be just that - a flop. Everyone makes mistakes by either trying something new or trying something new while horrendously convoluting what they always do. Nolan used to be the CDPR of movie industry. If he learns from this experience, I'll forget Dunkirk ever existed. But if he doesn't, he'll probably become another Ridley Scott. An old director with zero inspiration that keeps shooting the only things he knows how to shoot and whose movies are overrated AF.",3,0,0,16 December 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Crimean Crisis
","As much as I enjoyed superheroes going nuts without exactly going Man of Steel about it, the premise of the movie is ... damn...I thought Batman vs Superman was ridiculous in terms of writing, but I can't believe I'm saying this - Marvel has outdumbed DC. Big time. They get saved by generally much more likable cast, but swallowing it gets hard. Captain series might be serious\dramatic, but if second movie was a fresh breath, then this is a bigger convolution than Week of Lultron.In almost every Marvel movie - they save the world, or the universe, in some way. They do it at a great risk, especially personal, even with casualties.Yet this movie will keep showing 'high-profile' people(not some sorry neighbor dumb blonde mom) keep throwing personal level accusations at our heroes. I understand when people complain about MoS being a clusterbuck, and even the Avengers could be questioned, but deliberately making this drama a plot? Like I said, that's worse than BvS. We get a new Hydra, this time being the 'World' they are trying to protect... I mean, come on, over a hundred countries signed a petition that affected probably... what, 2-3 of them? Talk about signing the anti-Russian sanctions... Ahem, and this Hydra is totally ballbreaking the Avengers. And, of course, the 'leader' - Tony, is compromised(by a woman I'd personally hit in the face and pay to be put in an asylum) at the exact right time. Captain, again, is the fugitive, which should be a running gag by now... And then there are the new guys and... semi-new guys: -I thought the Amazing Spiderman was the worst spiderman there could be. Because it was wrong at pretty much every turn imaginable. But this... This is a disaster. I won't disrespect the actor, he was fine, and I won't even mention his aunt, Jesus effing... But he gets recruited by Tony and agrees to do his bidding to capture the bloody Captain... on a whim. Plus, there isn't even any real introduction, Spiderman is just bloated into the plot for no apparent reason. So our little protector of the weak is abiding a weapon manufacturer to capture the only man known to fight for the world. And while doing so, he is doing the most annoying impersonation of Spiderman imaginable. Gone is the original Spidey. Gone is even the boneritis-ridden Amazing. This is the new low. Might as well have hired Bieber for the role.-This 'extra black' panther - I think he was the biggest villain in the movie. I mean, even the antagonist wasn't as much of an -hole as he was. His daddy gets whacked, among a dozen others, and our hero, our sorta 'Avenger' - promises to 'kill' the culprit... Damn... That's a first.-The antagonist is some sort of genius out of nowhere, and from his outstandingly -tarded exposition - Black Widow released Hydra files 'to the public'. I know Winter Soldier stated that Shield will be declassified, and that was already a drunken Shyamalan plot twist, but 'to the public'? Hey, I think even Snowden would roll his eyes... And that's saying something.-Vision, the only guy besides Thor to be 'worthy', a walking computer with a mind gem in his head - he acts as a second-hand puppet for the most official -hole for the whole movie. Personally, of all the Avengers, I'd expect him to Sherlock the whole deal first, and be the one next to cap. Instead he probably remains in a Jarvis mode for the purpose of 6v6.-Antman is apparently free to assist the Avengers now, despite all the Pym deal we saw previously. I mean, come on, he lets himself, and his suit - be captured by the new Hydra. Where is Pym in this? For all I know, it was Evangeline Lilly who did the trick in the end of the movie. Otherwise it's such bull that I can't even...On a final note... remember the finale of Winter Soldier? That killer line from Black Widow? You won't remove us, because you need us, because we do the things you won't? Well, apparently the whole world, 100+ countries - agrees to retire them. And, personally, I'd wanted to see the movie develop like Transformers 3: buck the humans. Buck them all. Let them burn, then come back and save them when the moment is right.So.. the movie started as bull, developed as bull, and ended as... well, a bit better smelling bull. It's interesting how they will continue this, because as much as the big brothers want to replicate The Incredibles - some things are better left unique.Superhero rumble: 10\10 Writing: 2\10",6,8,18,24 June 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," It's a trap! Ah, whatever, you will watch it.
","Well, the title says it all. You will watch it, because it's meant to be watched. Not read. Not given a thought. Watched, period. CGI candy. While I believe there are plenty of reviews of visual fans, stating how gorgeous the pixels moved, I'd rather present a cynical\critical approach to the various CGI scenes.*Warning - SPOILERS* >Spiders. Yet another extremely dangerous fight that leaves all dwarfs alive. Dwarfs lived through goblins, giants, orcs, spiders... Only to have hardscripted arrow hit one dwarf with a boner.>Treasure of Erebor. At least in Harry Potter there was Gemini Curse and magic. Do you expect me to believe that dwarfs just let these kilotons of gold lay around? That's below even hoarding, that's clinical, absurd and not even impressive.>Witch King's tomb. Probably one of the stupidest sequences in the whole movie. Gandalf goes in. 'Summons Radaghast'. Talks some scare. Alright, cut! Seriously, this tomb was mentioned in the previous movie - why the hell not show it? With all the stupid CGI scenes and Bilbo\Dragon flirting, why not show Gandalf actually explore the tomb, not look at the broken wall and realize: 'Welp, we're screwed'.>Bard. Faramir, yet another copycat from the original. Archer, douche, handsome.>Legolas and Tauriel. Damn, all they need is a pair of lightsabers and some Force to kick it. And introducing this elf just to mate her with dwarf for very obscure reason - right... Screen time! >Dol Guldur. It's a trap meme. Ah, screw it, once again there has to be screen time filler with no sense or purpose. And that will still keep the main character alive against all sense. Who, like, literally, WHO could not guess that Necromancer is Sauron? >Barrel Chase. Me: I thought the cow... I mean, the 'goblin level' of the first movie was the most clinically stupid, unrealistic and ridiculous scene(well, together with stone giants), but this is something else. When you go mental, you go all the way down - I am afraid to watch 3rd part.>Smaug. I thought Transformers 3's 'stupid wench tricking Megatron' was something that proved that Michael Bay is biased. No, Jackson has just redeemed Bay. Seriously, this silly CGI talking lizard hasn't fried Bilbo on sight, was flirting with him all along... and then hasn't killed a single dwarf before flying away in ragequit. Worst movie ending nominee. At least first movie's Bilbo-Gollum scene was a funny filler. This is just inexcusable CGI mashup with no sense or point at all, just to take screen time and show the dragon's moves.>Forge battle. Right, haven't any of them watched Alien Resurrection? You've gotta freeze the gold... Like, seriously, if this molten gold could not melt or simply incinerate Thorin swimming right on top of it... What was the point of bathing a whole 'impenetrable' extra strong lizard in it? They expected him to melt? But, yeah, looks cool. Worst ending ever already achieved, so what gives, cheers for the looks.Copied and edit-censored from my post on another site.So why give 7 stars to this? At least it's a Tolkien movie.

It Follows," Virgin-approved.
","*Warning, review contains MAJOR spoilers*With all the respect to the movie's premise, the tribute to Dostoevsky and plenty of nudity, I'm afraid that the movie is a bit short on the... action.Between rather poor exposition scenes, which could be forgiven in an indie movie, the plot is presented in a pretty dubious way. 'It' has weird rules, and performs them in a pretty inconsistent manner.A gruesome murder? Why? A plain rape? Okay, that's for the camera. Hair-grabbing? What for? I thought 'it''s sexual conscience incarnate, not some Paranormal demon. Infinite strength is used solely on knocking people away, breaking small holes and windows, but never to get to the point. Why even be susceptible physically?And the method of passing it on... sheesh. It's even sillier than the Ring. You don't have to show the tape, just keep banging everyone you see. Always hated that person? Give in, have at it, and you can be sure he dies. Damn, the possibilities of abusing this power, it's a perverted Death Note!And the transformations... what's up with them? 'Takes the most effective form'... Aka a totally naked person for no apparent reason. Or a ghoulish child. Or a undead urinating lady. And then the old woman, man and even the target himself. But, once again, the best thing is to clearly transform into a Frankenstein to break a small hole and enter as a ghoul. So effective. Perhaps it's afraid of doorknobs?People say it's not reliant on jump scares. To be honest, it has only barely less sound shocks than Paranormal. And all of them are even less reasonable.All in all, the movie is better themed than Paranormal, the potential for the franchise exists. Because the cliffhanger... is real. But if it's real, then 'it' learned how to wear bright clothes and actually increased its pace. Maybe next time it will be more effective and less expositional.With all the rules established, it's pretty pointless to keep it psychological. It's physical, it's invulnerable... it's a thing to be toyed with. Just like Alien.So let there be sequel. Deaths. Origins. Incredible situations. The proper milking of the franchise. It's rare, but I think the sequel in this case would be better than the original, because while the original can pave the road, but can't really ride it.",6,3,41,5 June 2015
Frozen," Frozen ears.
","Well, for an uninitiated person like me, getting to understand Frozen was pretty difficult, also not having watched Tangled. But since I at least heard about all the infamous Disney Princesses, I suppose this is the 'CGI in the morning' remix of something. So, obviously things like cuteness, certain craziness and cliché are granted, expected and even appreciated by fans. So while it can break another movie, I guess a Disney Princess movie can be cut some slack.What could be said about actual pros and cons? Well, the movie has surprisingly nonlinear plot. I expected dumber. I am glad that I was disappointed. It also has reason and morale, which I acknowledge way above other things. But I suppose morale is a feature of Disney, at least based on what I remember from childhood. And, with all due disrespect to unnatural cuteness - animation is really brilliant. Modern eye-candy in good sense.One thing, however, that I found totally unbearable and sick - is the singing. I remember the magnitude of singing from Lion King, the quality of Rio, the songlist of Madagascar. Now those are films that you can just listen to over and over and over. But this... I at least am glad there are those who also notice it, but I am nonetheless shocked that some acclaim it as 'standard' for Disney. This isn't singing, this is... 'barely trying'. Maybe it's also a feature that has to be cut slack for a Disney Princess movie(note that only Princess movie, not just any Disney), but in comparison to other movies - it is a disgrace.And of course things like 'Loldead' moment in the beginning, 'scalped' and absolutely clichéd greedy old man, the donkey snowman... Such things just make you hiccup with awkwardness. It's not a big minus, but not contributing either.So it's a fairly good movie, positive and healthy(more or less), but it could've been better if Disney tried to be less... Disney.",7,1,4,13 March 2014
The Mist," Good acting, bad writing.
","I'd like to start by saying that the movie isn't bad. The acting is good, the tension, the realism - it's definitely a worthwhile thing. Even if the premise is pretty cliché, and the explanation is even more so - the movie isn't among the copycats or ripoffs. Although I wouldn't call it a horror. Thriller\Drama - yes. And absolutely no Sci-Fi. I believe King himself drew the line between Terror\Horror and other definitions. Well, 'horror' being chilled to the very bone - does not fit the definition of this movie. Pathetic clichés of arachnophobia, tentacles, insectophobia, as well as amorphous things people could've been surprised at in 19th century - it just doesn't get the job done in 2000s. Maybe in games...However, all of that is tolerable. It doesn't make the movie bad, it just doesn't make it outstanding.What, for me personally, killed the 'whole' impression of the movie - is the depiction of religion. There is a thin line between good acting\writing and just making the watching process so painful that you cringe. Browsing the internet\going to churches - that's one thing. But the movie is supposed to entertain, and boy was it painful to watch.And then there was the ending. Well... it's fake. It's so damn fake I can't even describe it. Feels like the writers wanted to squeeze out every ounce of tears and drama from the viewers, they purposefully twisted it. The hero, throughout the 'whole' movie, was fighting for logic, morale, was trying to save a person dying from burns, and sacrificing more people just for the sake of it. He saved everyone he could, he did everything he could... And in the end... he would just... Not spoiling it, if somebody will bear through this movie - they 'have' to feel the stupid, stupid disappointment of this ending. That just doesn't make any sense at all. I'd be happy to give this movie 8\10, making it a bland, but very compelling thriller\horror. But with the religious overacting and the ending, I'm afraid I'd feel generous just by giving it 6.",6,1,2,22 February 2015
I Am Legend," No, you are tale.
","150 million dollars on this? A TWO-actor film?! Guess after Smith's paycheck and environment CGI, there wasn't much left.The movie has so many problems...1. Unbelievable.I can't really imagine a faker loneliness. Want loneliness? Watch Moon. Rockwell nails the performance spot on. Smith is just... saying the lines, looking sad and stuff. Must've been good having a pet around.Talking about pet - such a superdog who grew up with him for years... doesn't know that a dark place is bad? No, even better - it doesn't respond to basic commands? 'No, stay'? Yeah... right. Oh and that pet wasn't exactly a chameleon, it was deadmeat the moment it entered the underground. Hiding under the table like a cat when the ghoul is two meters away is so believable, why didn't Smith hide there?Smith is supposed to be stoic, tough, smart and inventive. He... uhm gets into his own trap? Then stays unconscious for hours until his watch wakes him up, all the while his dog barking literally nonstop? Yeah, he was shown to predict the clock time... while sleeping at night. That was hanging upside down with a barking dog. Then he gets himself down... sees that the time is probably bad and starts to... slither to the car? Pain or not, it should be pretty clear that he should probably walk on his hands but get his rear end out of there. Only at the very last moment he decides to stand up and hop on a single leg. Right... Then... as his dog dies defending him from his own stupidity, the best solution he finds is to suicide trying to kill some random ghouls? That's.... that's legend. Pure legend. Of course, he gets saved by a scripted girl. He then spends screen time trying to get around, pouting and promoting Shrek and Bob Marley. Of course, the question of arrival only occurred to him when the night fell, so he couldn't really prevent anything Tomorrowland style.But the best part is the ending. Granted that the alternate ending is indeed too much fluff, the way he went out in theatrical is... as logical as the death of the scientist in Night of the Living Homeless. He had a gun... he had a crack in the glass. What about... shooting the glass? Throwing a grenade, timing it? Probably the glass would take most of the impact, he should've survived. No, I guess the best way a military colonel can go out is to blow himself up, makes sense.And of course there's gotta be a happy end. Time to 'listen', right?2. Horrible narrative With such a short screen time, the amount of time wasted on his pointless family, on the mannequin rambling, on promotions and other pointless dialogue...The movie begins, you sort start to enjoy it, try to understand it, you already know he's developed the cure, it can't be made more obvious, and by the time the action starts... you just get the forced plot shoving. Trapped?! Dog died?! He went bonkers?! He was saved?! He acts Shrek?! Oh, right, time to wrap it up, coal chute is safe... gg. Why even bother with the cure, when it's clearly safer and faster to exterminate the ghouls and reproduce... Weren't those sheltered - immune? Wasn't his cure - an after-effect on the ghouls, not some vaccine for healthy people?3. Movie doesn't really get anywhere.I thought it would be a great coincidence to watch this post apocalyptic flick before starting Fallout 4, the beginning was so smooth. But then it just went zombie flick before losing all sense as described above. So what part of that was legend? Like Age of Ultron lasting for about a.. week? - so this movie doesn't really fulfill the title. It's not a legend, more like a story of a failure scientist who really, really wanted to get that paycheck and acted the sharp script as good as he could...I thought Riddick's dog was too cheesy, but damn... compared to this, Riddick looks like an Oscar material with low budget. If this movie can get 7\10 rating... why not give Night of the Living Deb 10\10?",4,1,1,10 November 2015
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Worst Diarrhea ever.
","Wiki has a good critic line that sums up this movie: 'This film wasn't made for you, or me. It was made for dangerously, easily distracted 9-year-olds.' So I guess nowadays children are granted to have ADHD, and this kind of entertainment is the only thing that can keep them focused on something.As for movie itself - it's quality is below criticism.Character design? Ridiculous for the sake of ridiculous. Voiceacting? Average. Music? Hardly. Plot? **It happens. It always gets resolved. Romance ensued. Oh, and the protagonist just has to be a special snowflake Peter Parker. In every single cartoon. Can Hollywood produce anything else? Humor? Scary Movie 5 has better humor. Or perhaps at least the same level of humor. Premise? Clinically crazy. Even taking it as an infant cartoon... What happened to Lilo and Stich? Lion King? Eh - any cartoon that is thoughtful and deep? Where romance and daddy issues are not the major sellers?What kind of rating do parodies have? Meet the Spartans? Scary Movie? About 3\10. And that's from a fan. Now I will not go insane pondering how this baloney got 7\10+. Why do I give it 4\10? Because while it is on the production quality of parody comedy - it's at least presentable to children.But seriously, I feel sorry for you and your children if you really adore this kind of... cuisine.",4,5,11,13 January 2014
Big Hero 6," Fantastic Six
","Honestly, I was ready to swallow 'and' enjoy the beginning of the movie. It was... well-paced, fairly acted, had music, action... well, it went like people picture it.Then... I saw the test flying scene. And everything got into place. This... yucky colorful mix just became absolutely clear. Because I knew where have I seen it before... In one of my most favorite cartoons - How to Train Your Dragon.And I don't mean cliché or similar scene... I mean practically line to line of script, of visuals, of ideas. And everyone knows Disney and Dreamworks are not exactly the pals to 'tribute' each other.I know this isn't the first time these two make similar cartoons, so the question is - did Disney even try?Well, I am not heartless. Even worst cynics can commend Baymax and I will give it to Disney, they made Baymax... cute, funny, enjoyable. And I can't help but commend the animators. But what else to expect from bloody Disney?Graphics and one character aside, that's as good as it goes.A genius kid, who invents something super, and who is unpopular? Haven't heard that one before. But... apparently he has a perfectly loving aunt, caring big brother, who has absolutely positive friends, and our Hiro discovers it all in 'one day'. Quite a premise. Really reminds of the Frozen kickstarter: it took parents about 5 seconds to die in a storm to pretty much establish the plot for the rest of the movie. Oh... actually, this ex-machina brother dies in... exactly the same situation. Double strike. And this kid has to learn to control his newfound robot, assemble a team, equip them with... Seriously, if a random kid can make a superhero team in his basement, why do we need Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark again? The montage scenes from this movie really deserve the South Park song...Going back to Frozen, how many people disliked the whole Shyamalan ending with the good guy going bad for a totally improbable reason? Well, apparently Disney doesn't want to do better. And how could they, if the thing Hiro created - was yet another telepathic superpower. Where have I seen that before... everywhere? Looking at Hiro's team, that consists of stereotypical characters, among which are tron-girl(c), agile beefy funny black guy, purchased HTTYD actor and a pink-loving blonde, can we expect anything other than a D-grade villain? No, no we can not.Throw in the protracted finale that made about as much sense as Hiro's powers and... well, all loose ends were tied up. Even Stan Lee's cameo.And, of all the cartoons, this one has to touch the puberty angle. Well, parents, get ready...It's not a bad cartoon, it's quite a good watch for kids, and for any popcorn-grade adult, but after Wreck it Ralph and even Frozen, I would expect something more from Disney. From a publicly acclaimed, award-winning movie. I am... very disappointed. I can't even think of any memorable, epic, climax scene that would remind me of this cartoon later. There isn't even anything to copy, because it already hasn't had any bit of originality.If they had worked the character angle, mixed up characters, made them surprising, not clichéd, removed the terrible scenes, like flight scene or 'through the portal' scene, reworked the villain, either giving this one a far more reasonable outcome, or changing him altogether... and, honestly, made the final battle actually inspiring - I'd say Big Hero 6 is a good watch. But as it stands - it's a hollow Disney moneymaker with almost no creativity.",5,2,4,8 March 2016
Jurassic World," Dumb and stupid spliced together
","I really thought movies like Godzilla, Transformers 4, Prometheus, Hobbit - can't really get worse. Like, they are the pinnacles of 'how you should not direct\write'. I was wrong... This movie... this is the TRUE Jurassic Period. Even Gravity is probably less barbaric. The only creature on our good planet that would suspend disbelief for this movie... is probably a sponge. Only a sponge would be able to take in that much... liquid.Where to begin...Oh, well, with positive. Howard and Pratt really kicked the rear end there. Cheesy, perhaps, clichéd - but, damn, those are the actors. They deliver. Unfortunately... they can't two-man a 25 man raid.The story begins with a dysfunctional, mental and unbelievable token family that establish the plot: kids aren't coming back. Really, in our good world, parents must attend before a child can ride a freaking roller-coaster. Yet in Jurassic - the lovely parents would leave their kids, knowing that their sister is some CEO and that one of the kids is retarded and that they will play with dinosaurs. Right... This family, these two kids... they will make the movie more horrible and painful to watch that the dwarfs of Hobbit, than the religious skank of The Mist... Seriously, every time the story gets back to these kids - you WILL want them eaten. Because they bloody deserve it. They ruin every last bit of atmosphere the movie tries to build.Then we get what... Well, this Park is probably one of the most expensive places in the world, not to mention importance etc. It's guarded by fat dumb white trashes who you wouldn't trust to guard an empty parking lot at night. It's crewed by skinny scaredy shrimps that you wouldn't employ in McDonalds. It's overseen by some asocial 'scientists' who are one of those 'secondaries' who you won't remember even if try to. It's protected by some 20-30man shady task force that desperately wants to 'let Godzilla fight'. It's owned by a distant and mentally handicapped cousin of Tony Stark. Who thinks that shutting down the park would make it more unpopular than having a mass manslaughter occur there. And who tries to combat pilot a civilian helicopter without license. Seriously, they could as well show Paris Hilton driving...Between everything said above, you will easily recognize 'Aliens', 'How to train your dinosaur' and... Terminator 2.Seriously. I'm being super frank here. Ice Age 3 is 95% the same movie. Just shot much better. And that's the worst Ice Age to date.Spoilers away, the whole plot is: 'Stupid family makes sure the movie feels relevant. Starlord and Howard make sure the movie has action. Fat pussy guard has the authority to open the most secure gate on the island. Stupid kids make sure the movie has unbelievable exposition scenes. Mad scientists pretty much announce the sequel. The evil bad Dinosaur takes down bigger dinosaurs, more defended dinosaurs, two spec-ops teams and even the T-800... I mean T-Rex. Like, really, that T-Rex lies there with pretty much torn throat. Then 'he is back' and, together with a wee superraptor and Starlord - they make sure Godzilla stays fed. That had to rouse some hormones and call the happy end.'So in conclusion: The movie is less original than the Avatar(and that's saying something). It will make you cringe every time you see the personnel or the kids. It will make you think that Gravity has sense and logic.AAA titles can't be ranked 0, so here's 4 stars for the CGI and for the two main characters. They deserve it.",4,3,9,29 October 2015
Logan," Senile adventures.
","Warning - outright spoilers, as I will bring the silly and plot-crucial moments here.By all means, I will agree that the movie is shot very well. Language, blood, action scenes, acting - everything is very, very solid. A real breakthrough after most of Marvel comedy.So why 6\10? Because I couldn't watch this movie without twitching. Scratching my head in disbelief, wondering 'what the fancy are they doing?' -Antagonists. They seem to enjoy going out on their own. They have supermutants, cyborg soldiers, but in every situation - you'll see some top hat just standing there for... reasons. When first you see the big guy meet Logan, it gets clear that it's going down. Logan should pack his bags, pronto. And that the guy is probably bada** enough to stand up to Wolverine, since he was completely alone, completely d*ckwad and knew pretty much everything he needed. What happens next time we meet him? He is knocked out by a metal object. That's it. He's not a mutant, he's not some end boss, he's just a douche. And what is Logan's decision? Asking his indispensable tracker to... drive him away and dump him. WOW. I just sat there with my jaw open. Is that a bloody killer Wolverine's reaction to an enemy, who he knows is 'already' going to kill him? Is that a G-level of approach undertaken in a R-rated movie? What the...Of course, this... madness... Leads to the meat of this movie - tracker is used to hunt Logan, the bad guy is always there show his useless face. If he'd have killed him there, you probably wouldn't need to continue with the movie.Same goes for the main scientist, who is there to kind of leash a pet, and who just stands next to armed Logan, explaining how evil he is. Wow. I thought that trope got old a couple decades ago. At least now Logan acts quickly, so the trope is kind of redundant, but the question is... Why include this character to begin with? Doesn't add anything to the movie.And then the big bad wolf(erine). Was he adamantium-boned? Or was he just the same genetic offspring of Logan? His face was already pummeled by an almost point-blank shotgun blast, which didn't reveal the skull. Yet... when a an adamantium bullet is shot through Magnum - half his skull goes off. We've seen Logan survive this kind of shot before. He was mostly alright. And we don't know much about about big bad wolv. Yet suddenly this is a deus ex, a very pointless deus ex, on many levels. When all the kids combine their powers to kill a 'human', one would wonder - why not just kill the big bad wolv? Or at least knock it out? Telekinesis, freezing - there are methods... Overall the final scene is very, very lackluster.-Protagonists. Xavier sure takes his sweet time to reveal anything remotely worthwhile, making enraged Logan a protracted trend throughout the movie. Making everything a painful guess. He is shown to be able to communicate and sense mutants, yet what about tracker? What about big bad wolv? What about other kids? When they stopped at every worst corner, prompting the casino scene, the family butcher scene, I just wondered... 'why'. I think Man of Steel would cringe at the level of carelessness here. They wanted to get lost in a casino? Gee, great, with that level of hunting on them, they'd be sure to wipe out everyone in casino if need be. Of course, Logan takes his sweet time in pub, because it's not like he has barely escaped out of his own house... And, of course, the family dinner. I understand why was the plot line involved, but... why make it so incredibly dumb? If Xavier was too old to think straight, maybe Logan could've said something precise. They wasted a whole family on a stupid whim. And, of course, big bad wolv had to just stand there and listen to Xavier, to give surprise at what comes next. Except for when you think about it, he would have no reason to, besides allowing a kind of sad exposition.-The Finale. I've mostly described everything, except for Logan's...well. Kids already were shown to have this weird green medicine. There were trucks around, probably carrying this stuff. Damn it, even Hishe ridiculed two of the moments I described, for good reason. Couldn't they show kids looking for the medicine? Giving at least some 'fancy' about it? No... it was almost as stupid as Han Solo's ... well, in Episode VII.So, to conclude, the movie is shot very well, very gritty and realistic. But I think the writing took some lessons from Prometheus or Gravity... for whatever reason. And it ruined some impression, as well as left an aftertaste. People compare this movie to TDK, and, frankly, not even close. No. Just... no. In the same league, perhaps, but this is a 2 hour 'wut', not a grand movie.",1,5,11,18 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of LuLtron
","As others, I've heard generally bad stuff about the movie, especially compared to the first one. And myself I've felt it in the first few scenes... that... that stench of CGI. Many movies since Avatar have been reeking of it, but that's the benchmark. Unfortunately, this is more like a stench of 300:Rise of an Empire. It's the knowledge that everything you see is just that... pixels. Not even well-hidden, despite the technology. There's no acting, there's a ton of slow-mos and it cries: 'suspend your disbelief'. And it's not even in a good way, if there can even be one, it's just panorama, exposition. Eye popper type of candy. Doesn't work for everyone, though. To add to this, as many people have noted - the humor. Where DC is gritting teeth to try and sustain the Dark legacy, Marvel hasn't really matured past Iron Man 1. I love the jokes, I love the oneliners. Any normal person does. But just like Frozen, when EVERY other moment, every other situation - is backed up by a oneliner or by a stupid song... The picture is ruined.People complain about plot and story, but I very much liked the insight and detail of almost every character. Sure, some minor characters were one-offs, like that doctor or arms dealer, and Captain has got two movies to flash in a spangled outfit - they can be disregarded. Who was given plenty of love are: Black Window, Hulk, Hawkeye. The backstory, the relationships - really made them more than the empty shells they were in the previous movies. Where Black Widow just had red in her ledger and couldn't figure which strong handsome man to flirt with in the next movie - she is now actually feeling something, acts open and reveals her background. And no, if there's one thing I disagree with people - is love story. It must NOT be there, and however veiled it was - that was ideal. I'd remove 3 stars from AoU if there was a kissing scene, seriously. Hulk keeps getting better and better, and receives more detail towards his mechanics than 'I'm always angry'. And while he finds some social ground to stand on, it's good that he still stays true to his solitary nature. Hawkeye... I was shocked. The amount of character expressed in him the movie is stunning. Previously he was what.. Legolas. Literally. Then there were Captain Hinds..., I mean America, who more or less 'raidled' the Avengers, and there was Tony, who had to work out all the technical stuff, had to make the hard choices in Avengers, IM3... Now we get the daddy hero. And that tops it all. It tops any resemblance of care towards planet that Superman could every try to face cringe. Hawkeye, the father, loved and inspired by his wife, has to be THE leader. The motivator, the overseer, the guy who has the most important thing in life to protect, unlike anyone in the movie. Of course, I might be stretching it too far, but he did his job(c).Add to that the god complex of Ultron and the story of the twins, and the comedy actually becomes sort of drama. I won't mention Vision, because he was just sort of piloted. Not much to say so far. Overall, the depth of characters is one of the best in MCU, and this more or less justifies the movie.What I'd like to least as clear disadvantages are the villains\anti-heroes. While I did acknowledge the moral of Ultron and the backstory of the twins, their realization is awkward. I remember a good quote from the Chronicles of Riddick: 'You know, you are supposed to be some slick-sh** killer. Now look at you... all back-of-the-bus and sh**.' Perfect description. Just flawless. Ultron was proposed as an... endgamer. By none other than Tony himself. And that's after we've repelled an alien invasion, prevented some prehistoric freak from destroying the universe, stopped hydra from butchering the world... among other things. Now there's just another Transcended guy, and poor Paul Bettany has to kill him, again! What's more, he pulls more cranks and has so wild behavior - he reminds me of Funnybot, for those who get the reference. I just want to imagine some of Ultron lines followed by him saying:'...awkwaaaard!' I thought Malekith was the worst character design in MCU(and that's saying something), but damn, Ultron beats him(though he is still technically a better scripted character).Then there are the twins... I dislike comics, and and I don't want Scarlet Witch to be some world nexus or something. But damn, can't a freakin chaos witch do something more than wave her arms and read the fears? Seriously, Tony did more damage by testing his repulsors in the lab in Iron Man 1. And if she didn't provoke the Hulk, all her mental powers would be nothing more than plot pushers. We need backstory? Yay, let's make her find their fears. We want to screencap Hulkbuster? Scarlet Witch is the gal for the job! Quicksilver... well, all his awesomeness spoofed in DOFP is used to merely parody the Flash. He is the single grumpy character in the movie. And all he does is whack stuff and get exhausted every now and then. Probably the actor had his contract revoked or something, because with all the stuff going around in the movie - Quicksilver felt like they wanted to off him before he did.In conclusion, I can't say that the movie deserves a bad rating. It's not as bad as it gets. 6 is the red price. I'm giving it 7 on a fan parole basis. I waited for it, I enjoyed it, and I wasn't outright revolted. And if there's more good than harm, then that's where the scales will tip from my perspective.",7,3,8,9 September 2015
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Jellybean
","Was this really directed by Del Torro? I'm pretty sure the script was written by Seth McFarlane. Because this has to got to the most sexual movie I've ever seen. And I've watch South Park, Scary Movie, Fifty Shades of Black and FDR: American Bada**. And liked all of them. This is a new low. The plot is so thin and barebone that I wonder what's dumber, Attraction or this. But I'm 100% sure neither is remotely worth an Oscar.Is the movie beautifully shot? Yes. Indeed. Is it well-acted? Sort of, the three faces try to follow their characters, although they aren't presented with much difficulty. So, yes, for the fans of blatant romance shot beautifully, Fifty Shades of Grey style and all that - 6\10, right there.But for an Oscar? Interstellar didn't win an Oscar. And that movie had a palette of actors across multiple plots, while being, that's right 'interstellar and sciency'. So how can this one-page script, disgorged by the insane amounts of obscenity, be a winner? It's not like it had a lot of opposition, but... even Oldman in a fat suit might be better.So what's all this obscenity? Well, besides not shying away from full frontal nudity, the movie depicts female m*stur*ation routine, discusses male toilet habits, manages to squeeze in homophobia and even certain kinky s*x approaches. It takes time to explain how 'fish stick'(for those, who get this precise South Park reference) works and how low women can fall in life.Yet, you know what's probably the worst part of the movie? As it is for most romantic movies? It's absolutely stupid to anyone, who doesn't get a boner from it. Like, Avatar, Attraction, you name it, you always root for the bad guy. Because their position is correct. See, in this movie, the pathetically infatuated p*sswiper, who can get around a secret facility better than James Bond, and who just can't search for a man even if it killed her - manages to kill a number of people, to ruin a perfectly happy family, to prevent proper scientific breakthroughs and even to ruin her friends' lives. Because I'm pretty sure the police will have a swell day with that old g*y guy and the black friend of hers.Once again, what could've been a beautifully shot Sci-Fi movie with possible s*xual subplot, with proper characters, happy ending, twists and revelations - ended up in nonsense. Everything was there, it would just take a few chess pieces moved around and you'd have a proper Oscar candidate.The scientist was a perfect man for our heroine, the fish guy could very well be an interest, but only an interest. Not to the point of risking 'everything' by flooding the apartment to have s*x in the bathroom. Present your findings to the scientist. Let him talk the bad guy out of the operation. Let the bad guy talk the general out of the operation. Coerce the fish guy to show his healing powers. Research them, trying to make sure that the subject doesn't die. Show a number of personality changes that can affect even that black friend's life(which is constantly mentioned, but goes nowhere). Maybe I'm a s*cker for happy ending, but a happy ending after enough troubles - is worth it.Yet a dramatic ending after a load of bullkak - is not. Because this is what the movie is. A lot of incredibly stupid, obscene, forced, fabricated drama - just to have a Disney ending. If this thing won an Oscar, I will never, ever, feel bad about p*rating a movie. Because the industry is becoming something that feeds itself. It's not about quality, about public reception, about supporting the movie. It's about advertisement, paid reviews and proper nominations. This is what pays for the whole thing. That is basically 'Straight to DVD' to me.On a final note... I can't remember a single sound piece from the movie. It was all about the old musicals. So... was it De-splat... or De-splash? Oh, and, that thing ate a cat. It doesn't deserve to live to begin with. Because a cat eats a fish, not the other way around. See, if the movie doesn't want to be sane, why do I have to?",6,3,9,7 March 2018
Fifty Shades of Grey," Magnificent.
","Well, what can I say. It's not Titanic, which I haven't watched nor ever will. It's probably not some... top of the line romance with actors not only enthralling, but also literally disturbing in a pleasant way to both genders.It's a movie made to feel uncomfortable and... relevant.Some may discuss the matter of BDSM quality and nature presented in the movie. I doubt it's worthwhile. What's shown in the movie is... a joke, a breeze compared to real BDSM. After all, Hollywood is not shooting porn. There are other sources for that, plenty.I will admit that the premise of the movie, which is inspired by the book I probably won't read, is indeed clichÃ©. Take some Disney prince, add Twilight girl and then seal it with BDSM. People are right when they say that the movie isn't really refreshing the genre.But the way the relationship is delivered... it's something that's hard to describe. Some people might smile and find themselves there. Some might visualize their dreams. Some - learn something about themselves, discover the answer to certain... confusions.So as a sick pervert, I can say that Mr. Grey was played out... extremely well. He's been there. All the joys, all the wonders of hormonal cocktail have been opened to him. The very idea of romance is plain, if not disturbing. Christian doesn't find sex by itself to be the reward. When a child shoots a toy pistol with juvenile glee - an adult looks at his hands and realizes that he has once held a gun that took lives. He knew that he will never see it as a toy. Christian does not need romance. He can afford to be laid 'on cooldown' by the best models. He can afford any... doll. He had 15 already. Hell, 95% of all women would die for the chance that Anastasia had.This brings me to the question of the main heroine. The amount of retarded in her is probably palpable even to female audience. To keep her virginity only to lose it on one night's stand of sorts, then to be littered with money, toy with the lover, even test him... She said she fell in love with him. She said she wanted to understand him. And after 6 whips, she collapsed? Boy, now that is a very, very spoiled child. Any girl her age would probably swallow such whipping naturally, but she just had to... Well, to be honest, I think it's artificial. It's the cliffhanger for the sequel, nothing else. She is female, she is dumb, and she had to act out.But back to the subject of Grey. Some people say that he didn't love her, that he can't even love. These people... I'm afraid to live in the world where they procreate. Perhaps they should read some Great Expectations... or just live their American dream. Smarter people might say that his chivalry was nothing short of outright 'purchasing'. I beg to differ. It is the innocent, unbending, yet cute nature of hers that sparked his interest. Like I said, there's nothing he couldn't afford. For all the gifts he gave her, he could've already made her disappear and be his slave until she outlives her use. Why would he bother to not only charm her, but also clearly explain his reasons of the contract, prepare her, reassure and even tolerate getting 'changed' by her whines? There's a good line in the movie: 'If you agree to be my submissive, I will be devoted to you'. Few men know what they want in life, and when it goes along the line of 'skirt' or 'family'... well, bad things happen. But some men want something else, something often not tied to physical standards. Something emotional. Such men remain loyal, because their sole desire has been achieved. He could toy around with any female, but he fell in love with her character. The only thing she'd need to do - is to live by his standards, because he can't go the other way around(and nor should be, he isn't exactly Jose). This would fill his heart with something he couldn't get from physical ecstasy alone.After all, if she really loved him... not his wealth or his looks... she would tolerate things that would make 6 whips feel like feather licking your cheek, compared to the reality that we live in. Because he loved not her physique - she was god damn ugly. And not her 'accessibility', that's not a concern for a man like him. He loved that (supposedly) intelligent mind, romantic, daring and brave. He loved her so much that he allowed her to change him. And that's saying something.Well, I hope this review explained some possible misunderstandings that people could have, but I still end on the same note I started with:'The move is personal. You either recognize it or you don't.'",8,4,8,15 June 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A long pointless tale to establish DCCU.
","The movie has promise, and while I favor Marvel, I can't say I would not anticipate DCCU. However, unless the producers gets their stuff together - DC will forever be 'number two'. I don't get what do people like about Batfleck. I really don't. Not that I didn't like his acting, he did fine. But the way he was represented - is laughable. He, the genius vigilante - gets TROLLED. Trolled into fighting a near-godlike creature. I don't care that he shot people, murder is always involved in such stuff, direct or indirect. I don't care that he was 'jedi mind tricked' by the word Martha. I've seen more stupid stuff on screen(even if Flash said 'Lois is the key'). But when Nolan established Batman as a caring human character, perhaps too caring sometimes, all Znyder established was some angry dude who is angry and rude and goes all Punisher and has Iron Man tech and is very emotional... Bottom line - this Batman was a joke. A joke that I couldn't care for less. He didn't make sense, his over-over-over-over establishment didn't make sense. His actions regarding first movie didn't make sense. It's like they've just sucked him out of a thumb to insert into a Superman movie, but make him able to fight the Supe for 10 minutes.As for the fight itself - laughable. I mean, come on, they sold this cr*p like apple pies for years, and this is what we get? A fake fight, originated from nothing, and resolvable by something called 'communication'. It's like that legendary yet stupid scene from Interstellar, where instead of 'don't do that', the character could say 'you'll blow the **** up, and take the station with you'. Had Supe nothing better to say, than these 'You don't understand, Lex is fooling you'. He had to move, he had to trigger all the traps, he had to shove Batman and... bah, make it physical. Seriously, the whole FIGHT was one of the weakest parts of the movie. From the beginning to the end.Lex Luthor was a bit of a bright spot, but he felt sort of... out of place. Not nearly enough to be a Joker, kind of a weaker, sillier Bane. Nothing he did made any sense. What did he expect when he created DD? The only reason he is alive is because Supe stopped DD's punch. So what if Supe was dead. The whole world would be dead too, including him.WW\LL were there for the t*ts. Lois Lane was established right away, at which point I didn't know if I'm watching a romantic comedy or a dark superhero movie. And Wonder Woman... well, they needed the third of the DC trinity, but everything she did was pretty secondary. Appears out of nowhere, has no motive, comes very handy, survives the final fight. And damn, she is powerful. While Supe can't really do anything to DD, she actually manages to restrain him, cuts off his hand with... some magic sword(definitely not kryptonite-forged), and nearly finishes him off, if he didn't just spit some laser. And she might be strong and stuff, but last time I checked - she isn't remotely Superman. In fact, she is more like Batman with just some meta-human strength. But her attire is more durable than Supe's caped swimsuit. And she herself is clearly immune to any harm, being absolutely unflinching about fighting something that overpowers\kills Superman. She is as close to some Supergirl as it gets...Ultimately, compared to the first movie, this is an improvement. Because it at least attempts to present a long, complex story, instead of boredom, followed by Super Sayian. But the fact that no effort has come to the writing\adaptation of the story, no attempt to make it comprehensive or believable... I hope, for the sake of DCCU - that they will change their direction.",6,3,6,9 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It can't get any worse... or can it?
","There were good Star Wars... there were bad Star Wars... Some of them had deep story, characters, created the franchise and good memories, some of them left a bitter aftertaste of characters, but at least had droids, CGI, action... some semblance of a plot.I hated this episode ever since I saw the first teaser. I felt like I've seen everything - dumbed down droid design, token black character for comic relief, some desert planet with oral exposition of empire tech, and that sword... that terrible sword...What I read afterwards was not good either, people claimed that this is a straight copy of A New Hope, that they are rebooting it without anything new.Thank *****y and thank goodness I didn't have to pay for seeing this mess, because what I saw... was worse, far worse than anything I have expected.First of all, there is NO story. Whatsoever. If previous six episodes taught us about Jedi\Sith\Force\Politics, then you will not see anything like this here. Force? A Myth. Politics? Outright Nazi who destroy a bunch of good innocent planets in one swipe. Sith? Gone. Jedi? Gone.There is no plot either. Everything you see here - you have seen before. Desert, robots, various aliens, stormtroopers with 10% accuracy, evil guys, good guys, rebel bases, death stars... Hell, prequels brought some evil plots, some droids. Even politics were more or less resonant. Definitely better than 'Es ist Zeit für Rache! Wir müssen die Rebels ausrotten!' (Everyone raises their left had) There aren't any characters either. There's some old No-bi Wan that dies right away, some, as better people have said, 'butthole-eyed' female Yoda and a fancy token protagonist Poe the Dragon Warrior.. I mean the best pilot in the galaxy. Some toilet-cleaning black storm trooper, who really is out there for himself and for the **ssy, gets shocked in his first fight, is sent to reprobation and, well, allowed access to the precious prisoner. Oh, he also knows a great deal about the Death Pokeball, the new Death Star, so he is very useful to the 'plot'. Ah, of course, there are also three well-paid fossils to eye***k the nostalgic fans. Although they do feel faker than Jar Jar. I mean, really, Han solo doesn't know how to fly his ship, is surprised at the wookie crossbow. He doesn't even shoot first...I feel like I've forgotten something... Oh, yes, the daughter of Luke, what was her name... She's just a perfectly bodied healthy under-fed genius scavenger turns pilot turns jedi turns force master etc. Nothing is known where she came from, how she lived, only that she waits for her family and that her family, apparently, is Luke. Aside from her godhood, she also serves as a perpetual damsel in distress, bringing great shame to the strong female characters of both trilogies, so just **ck her, I don't know why I even remembered her.The names in the movie feel like a cheap comedy. Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, Snoke, Poe... that's actually all the names you'll hear. Snoke... is it a combination of Snuff and Coke? Because the guy really looks like he's an addict of both. Remember the names Anakin? Obi-Wan? Qui-gon? Padme? Amedala? Palpatine? Vader? I guess they needed names that did not require much... pronounciation.After all that, one can at least expect some... CGI eye-candy? No, not really. We've seen great sword-battles, we've seen great space battles, but TFA doesn't have either. I don't have to mention that the janitor storm trooper has Han Solo+ accuracy and fights with a lightsaber better than the old Vader, that Rey fights better than Luke, who was training with Yoda and on his own, and Rey apparently is also a master of the force, capable of Jedi mind trick on a second try and capable of casting Protego when under Legilimens. Seriously, you are a wizard, HarRey.And, if anyone doubts that there is nothing new in the plot, then here's the rundown: Desert planet>Captured by bad guys>Escaped from the bad guys>Escaped from the bad guys again on the Falcon>Some planets are blown up>Traveled to Rebel base>Planned to destroy the Death Pokeball by disabling shields and destroying a video-game weak spot>Rey escapes custody and Obiwans around the evil base>Father and Son meet>Good guys win after one ship flies in some small hole and blows stuff up.I am usually a tolerant person. I hate many movies, I hate reboots the most. But of all the reboots, of all the horrors of the money-milking, false advertising and generally **cking people up - this comes out on top. The greatest franchise of America... ruined by Disney. I can't believe this studio has previously created POTC trilogy.So, well, here's the 1\10 for a change. Because the movie destroys the franchise, has no redeeming qualities, no memorable moments or CGEyecandy, nothing. It's as hollow, empty, copy-pasting as it gets.I wish I could say that it's always better to have at least some movie in the franchise, some revitalization, I know it's pointless to hope for a good movie nowadays. But... SW7 is not even suitable for an exception.What was so hard about making an original movie? Or a movie about the Old Republic? Games have created a ton of material, and I bet fans would die drooling if they see Revan live-action. But I guess a Revan-ish mask on a teenager who has more issues than Anakin in Clone Wars, who has just unlocked a CS:GO weapon skin - should suffice. For 8\10 population, it seems. Remember when a lightsaber was an advanced weapon of a civilized age? Now it's either Disney weapon skin for the bad guy, or a huge *ildo for the good guy...",1,8,10,14 April 2016
Life," A snack before Covenant.
","From the get go - Life looks very promising: you have a multi-national crew, you have the plot established, there is some really beautiful exposition of the alien. The mood is established as sharp and professional, something you don't often see nowadays. But... from then on, it goes absolutely down the drain, so, spoilers alert, I'll just list the steps how this movie steadily loses points one part of script after another.1. Alien reanimation.Okay, looks like they attended the Prometheus school of 'How to be a stupid scientist'. Even if the reanimation procedure is, technically, understandable: they can't bring it back before confirming anything, it still doesn't explain why, when there are all the protocols and firewalls - they have so little effect. No way to suppress the testing area, making all the protection it has - being plastic gloves. Really. Even then, the very laboratory, instead of being... well, 'isolated'... turns out to be jeopardized by nothing more than a sprinkler. Is that how they are supposed to contain viruses? 2. Alien in space If that was a true Russian astronaut - she would immediately sacrifice herself when faced with the same deal as the movie. A perfect opportunity - alien in space, alien is latched, just detach the tether and push yourself as hard as possible off the side of the station. Maybe even use some Martian Iron Man tricks. Done, roll credits. No, instead we see a Martian-level of stupidity before the airlock, and when the right choice is done... well, it has zero impact, making the whole sequence - a protracted drama.3. Alien in the safe zone While we clearly see the alien in space, and everything goes according to plan, after another protracted drama, we find that the alien was attached to one of the crew members. Insert Jackie Chan face. For a second I thought - it's another one, a new plot twist, something they haven't foreseen. Nope... It's the same alien, just somehow teleported. And, of course, the good scientist was so selfless that he didn't bother to tell anyone. Mindblown.4. Interstellar spoof Okay, if spoofing Prometheus and Gravity was not enough, we needed Interstellar spoof, where one 'suddenly' mentally disabled crew member decides to pretty much brute force a lockdown door. And, like the previous traitor, this guys is attempted to be saved, against all sanity. And, of course, there is a mandatory ridiculous decompression scene. Guess you can check that out. As for that whole Interstellar spoof... well, it ended pretty much the same as Interstellar. Except for the unparalleled epicness, of course...5. Freezing scene I saw this scene before. It's the same stupid protraction as in Gravity. You sob, you freeze and then boom! - you find a solution. I literally counted seconds. It was so pointless and clichéd...6. Finale If there was one more terrible movie to take lessons from(not counting Interstellar) - it's The Mist. Also a movie that was not bad by itself, but the writing and the characters absolutely ruined it, especially the finale. Well, Life is the same. Just worse, of course. You get a choice: a stupid happy-end, Gravity style or... the other thing. Frankly, nothing could be worse than Gravity, and I'd personally prefer a logical, sobby, but happy end. Instead - we get The Mist. In your face. Deal with it. Because this movie - is not getting any sequels.7. Alien After all, why was this alien so feared. Yes, it's kind of resilient. But it's not mind-controlling. Not replicating. Not innately contagious. It gets out on Earth, the worst you get - is Cloverfield. Even Xenomorph or Zombie viruses can be contained, but this weirdo? Suddenly getting all Ripley about it. Such a waste of ISS...8. Crew members In the end, one of the crew members 'reports' the whole situation, saying that 'five other astronauts sacrificed themselves and must be honored'. But did they now? The first 'corpse' disregarded the protocol and jeopardized everyone. In fact, saving that scientist at the cost of your life - allowed the same mentally disabled scientist to snatch the alien to the safe room, pretty much sacrificing not 'himself', but everyone else. The commander, instead of doing the right thing, did the pointless thing, as described above. Not exactly sacrificing. The fourth member went full on Dr. Mann with predictable consequences(only there was no Cooper this time...) And the fifth astronaut... well, you can see for yourself.Conclusion: Life is not 'that' bad. There are definitely worse movies. In fact, it looks like an improved Gravity. Because besides the painful stupidity - you at least get some plot, some thrills, 'something', while the premise is almost identical. It can be watched, with LSD and popcorn, but, unfortunately, should not be remembered.",4,0,1,4 August 2017
Warcraft," Another franchise ruined.
","LOTR, Alien, Spiderman, Terminator, Jurassic, Star Wars... Will this century be the death of everything that makes us human? Will technology kill the last brain cells that Apple still hasn't?Something is wrong... When Tales of the Past 3, a machinima circa WotLK, made by one person... Can outperform a marvel of CGI. A hand-made game engine movie... that has more soul than a 160$ mil motion picture. How could Blizzard do it? When I found out that Legendary Pictures is producing it - I was overjoyed. They are to movies like Blizzard... 'is' to games - every movie is magnificent, even if it's written by Snyder. But I thought that... with minds like 'the' Metzen, with books that were written by bestselling authors, the series that can rival any other major and older franchise... I thought they would do Warcraft justice.Warcraft is their baby. How could they do it? Who in the bloody blue **** is Duncan Jones? How can he say something like 'was the stale fantasy trope of, humans are the good guys, monsters are the bad guys'? Now I respect Moon and treat it better than Martian, but Moon was... like a puppy to the elephant, compared to Warcraft. It was a good 'indie' movie, but with just two movies on record, how can Blizzard hire someone like him? Is he Shyamalan? Who may be fanatical, but who damn knows how to write a mystery? Is he Jackson? Who at least has directed the best fantasy trilogy in the history of cinema? Is he 'the' Nolan?I know it's too cliché to say 'Nolan should've directed it'. Hell, that's all DC has been saying since DKR. But if anyone is good at directing EPIC grade masterpieces - that's either Nolan or Jackson. Why give the rights to the movie to a person, who first of all did not understand the core concept of Warcraft. Who tried to make it all mopey and kind, when it's... ****ing WARcraft. Not LOTRaft.So without further 'ado', let me say that I, being a heartfelt fan, who promised to curse the movie for eternity if they **** up 'The Last Guardian'(which... oh boy, they did) - still acknowledge that the movie has its heart in the right place. Like Medivh explained the hourglass - the order of how the pieces fall does not matter - they all are in the bottom of the glass. So does the movie resolve mostly according to Warcraft lore. However, only 'mostly'. And I feel like the remaining part will yet cause uncalled for protraction that will screw up even more memories. Like - Doomhammer will kill Lothar, but it would not be a champion, who would later go in a long journey of repentance and searching for new purpose. It would be a silly 'BvS Martha' level of misunderstanding, because of how Llane assassination went. Hell, how many tears were shed upon the lines 'The orc chieftains agree with you'. Hell, even Yogg-Saron encounter was better than this movie's 'Kill me, save yourself', that completely removes all the guilt, because it was a voluntary death, an order...Bah, okay. It should be obvious by now that the story has been twisted beyond any value. It should be painful to realize that the simple people will imagine that this is Warcraft. It's like thinking that Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy(you get my point). If only the story perversion was enough - that would be fine. However, the acting, the performance is deplorable. Where is the brooding Medivh? Who is this clown that is trying to make a serious face? Where is the grand Lothar? Why is there Ragnar Lothbrok? A troubled comedian viking, whose place is on small screen? Where is the King Llane? The strategist, the hero of his people? Who is this... this... popeyed creep? It's like Emma Stone in TAS. So creepy it's revolting. They've CGIed the orcs, why not draw some Final Fantasy level humans as well? Lines feel empty, scenes feel awkward(and downright insane to a real fan). Khadgar is a laughing stock. I wonder how will they ruin Thrall later... though that won't happen soon.If there is anything, even a slightest hint of value in the movie - it's the visuals. But that's just the Legendary Pictures. As much as I despise CGI in movies, I must say - the movie was a fine trailer. Worse than Warcraft 3 or WoW trailers. But still a good chance to see a realistic Warcraft, something WoW engine can't provide. However, if the orcs might have some nature to them, the dwarfs feel like a caricature of the most clichéd fantasy dwarf. Even Hobbit did a better job. Elves feel like plastic action figures with rubber ears.So... I delayed watching this movie. I tried to relive myself of all hope, I've heard what they say. So I thought I'd watch it with a glad heart... But some things can not be swallowed as a 'summer blockbuster'. It's not Independence Day 2, which I'd popcorn any time.They might as well have picked Uwe Boll. Can't be any worse.",3,3,5,9 August 2016
The Martian," Houston, ni hao?
","Looks like Mr. Scott has run out of ideas. We've had the oldschool grandeur of Apollo 13, the utmost, clinical, hysterical idiocy of Gravity, the absolute nonsense of Prometheus and 'The' Interstellar.Mr. Scott has tried to mix it all in one cup and ultimately flavor it with the Moon(2009). Well... where to begin...The first minutes of the movie I've spent laughing out loud like a maniac. Because I saw some of the stupidest scenes from Prometheus, gobbled with nonstop science mumbo-jumbo and abbreviations and...Ten minutes in, it's established that... something stupid happened and that the Martian is alive, because... something stupid happened.Scott probably liked the effect... and the stupidity of what he did in Prometheus, so he had to insert the science and the bloody scene, just to build up suspense. Pro tip, kids: if you get a suit decompression - stick yourself with something sharp, and mix the blood with the sand and voila, you are good to go Gravity style with critical oxygen for as much time as you need.That's followed by the heroic re-imagination of the Moon, where instead of something interesting... we see the convenient Botanist grow stuff up. Well, when you make it in space and on Mars - I guess it has to be interesting, right?The plot thickens(c), when our convenient Botanist finds a convenient probe just next to the hab and builds up a pretty convenient chat communication with Houston. It looks like the sole purpose of this communication is to establish that something bad will happen, because the moment it's announced - it happens.By then the movie straight parodies the tension of Apollo 13, unsuccessfully, to the point of mandatorily blowing up the USA supply probe, just so that we could get the Chinese some credit. I wonder, first Transformers 4, then maybe something I did not watch, now Martian... USA is really trying to get China, what's the tinfoil plot?That's when some uncredited genius thinks of a solution that somehow nobody working there for a living has thought of and it builds the mutiny and patriotism of Apollo 13.Then we see some solid BS that gives even Gravity the run for its money, and that's saying something... all because Scott is desperate for an intense resolution.In the end, we understand that... we have to watch Pirates(any), Iron Man and Lord of the Rings. And that the whole world apparently cares for the one guy who is simply MIA. Enough to risk the lives of other astronauts, millions of dollars... screw it, billions of dollars and the future of NASA - just to get this one guy back. At least Apollo 13 was 'true story' and tried to be realistic. This movie? Shows that Scott is trying his hardest to go from a great director to a random sellout. Sorry, Maximus, nobody is waiting for you on the other side... Except maybe for the blue balloon guy.",4,2,3,30 December 2015
