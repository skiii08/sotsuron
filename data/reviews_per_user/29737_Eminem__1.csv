The Blair Witch Project," Fiction Can Be Frightening!!
","I finally got a chance to see this masterpiece the other day, and I was amazed at the ability to create a fear unlike any other type of fear that a movie has produced. I walked into the theater knowing it was fiction, but that made no difference at all! I could see the fear in the young film makers eyes and it was as real as if I were with them in the woods. I recommend seeing this movie at least twice...Once to be scared out of your mind and twice to see the beautiful artwork.",Null,1,1,22 July 1999
