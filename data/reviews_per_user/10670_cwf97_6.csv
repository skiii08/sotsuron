Antz," Antz is a stinking ripoff!
","Antz is a stinking ripoff! I grew up with A Bug's Life when I was young. I saw Antz a few times in 2004 on DVD but this movie should have been rated PG-13 due to the swearing, violence and sexual references. Woody Allen is a good actor and director too. A Bug's Life was conceived before Antz. Antz shows more harsh and communist themes. Even in post 9/11, they forgot to replace the Two Towers with these stinking replacements in a future edition! Antz is not recommended for everybody. Antz should have been made in the first place. Good thing A Bug's Life won the success. Flik is essentially much better than Z. There are tons of animated kids movies but this is a galldurn exception! It has too many similarities to A Bug's Life and it looked like this movie was a stinking plagiarism!",1,1,7,21 March 2014
Hotel Transylvania," Have tons of creative differences, not as good as Samurai Jack or Clone Wars
","I am a future film writer and director who has deep creative differences from this film. The animation was bad and it was Genndy Tartakovsky's worst work. The jokes were terrible and this movie is not recommended for anybody. It has nothing that Clone Wars or Samurai Jack has. It consider it the worst movie ever in the entire history of the universe. I expected a mature vampire film but Genndy ruined it, especially its upcoming sequel. Genndy needs to work on Samurai Jack again. I love Genndy but he needs to work on his Samurai Jack movie. Selena Gomez was great but she had a better and tougher performance on the Ethan Hawke film Getaway. They should have cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Dracula rather than Adam Sandler.",1,1,6,29 November 2014
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Trilogy: Part Two
","The Matrix Reloaded is my personal favorite of the trilogy because it effectively deconstructed Neo's legend without delving into nihilism and introduced causality to the conflicting ideologies. Unlike the films before and after it, it shows a better focus on story and character development. Most people have criticized the last two films for ruining their expectations, but the Wachowskis did it the way they should do it. The Architect might be a bit hard to understand but he deconstructed Neo's myth. Same for how Smith converted from an Agent to a virus. The characters were well written and the scenes had perfect cinematography, including the infamous rave at Zion (which symbolized freedom of sexuality). Next up: The Matrix Trilogy: Part Two Point Five (Enter the Matrix).",10,2,4,25 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best Star Wars Movie!
",This movie is my favorite in the Star Wars series. It also is my favorite prequel of Star Wars. The visual effects and story were well written. General Grievous looks hardcore with cgi. George Lucas did a great job on the third chapter of Star Wars. I recommend this movie after Episodes I and II but before Episode IV. The story was very emotional and showed the ties to the other episodes. Episode VII is coming in 2015. I'm very excited! Episode III takes place 19 years before Episode IV. This is what I like about prequels. I think prequels are easier to make than sequels because it brings a fictional universe to an earlier time period like this.,10,0,4,1 June 2013
The Emperor's New Groove," Funniest Disney movie that inspired the tone of Guardians of the Galaxy.
","The movie Emperor's New Groove is very funny. It's clever humor and story somewhat inspired Guardians of the Galaxy. David Spade did a great job voicing Kuzco. Yzma is so funny. The movie is highly quotable and shows a lesson about caring about others. My favorite part is where Yzma turns into a cat with a potion. So very funny. James Gunn must have loved this movie because James Gunn makes funny movies. James Gunn must have used a lot of funny parts inspired from this movie and other movies including Footloose, Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. James Gunn should like this movie and the message of the movie is similar to Guardians.",10,0,3,30 December 2014
The Matrix," The Matrix Trilogy: Part One
","From March 1999, to November 2003, The Wachowskis have made the masterpiece trilogy known as The Matrix that doesn't suffer from cute characters such as Yoda and Jar Jar. It has no more than three films (Excluding Animatrix), which makes it not as bloated. The first one was very revolutionary. It was inspired by Alice In Wonderland, Ghost in the Shell, Simulacra and Simulation and Plato's Cave Of The Allegory. Like the other two films after it, The Matrix is flawless. The casting, directing, writing and editing was phenomenal. It was very amazing and had spectacular action and dialogue. From beginning to ending, this film has it all. It won four Academy Awards and got added to the National Film Registry in 2012. Next up: The Matrix Trilogy: Part Two.",9,1,2,13 February 2016
