Alien 3," so-so
","WARNING: SPOILERS--Being a big fan of the aliens trilogy, I have to say that I was quite disappointed with Alien 3. Firstly, the movie literally killed off Newt and Hicks in the beginning--two characters who would have both made a great sequel to Aliens. And furthermore, it also wiped out all the effort Ripley put into protecting Newt, and in the end, she drowns when the ship crashes into the ocean. In addition: Hicks's death marked the complete annihilation of the marine platoon in Aliens. And even worst: Ripley died at the end!! The most questionable thing in Alien 3 is how on earth another facehugger got on the ship. The queen could not have laid an egg on the ship, because that would take ages. And since when did a single facehugger be able to impregnate two different victims with two different types of aliens? These strange things are the reasons of Alien 3's unfolding story. Which means: Alien 3 should not even have existed. On the plus side: Alien 3 sports some really good acting, and a lot of suspense. There's a lot of blood in it, too. The scenes when the alien chases the colonizers were well-done, which the same can be said for the alien itself. The ending was also good. When everyone who watched it left the cinema, I was fascinated to find out that NOBODY was talking to each other. All in all, Alien 3 isn't such a bad movie, but for a hardcore Aliens trilogy fan, it is the lousiest of the bunch.",Null,5,8,13 July 2000
Aliens," Nothing comes closer
","This is THE best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The story picks up from Alien, where a woman named Ripley, after surviving an ordeal with a bug-like alien, is picked up by her employers while in her ship. She is offered a chance to lead a military expedition to the aliens' planet as an advisor in exchange for her a new job and new life. Ripley and the team then descend onto the planet and that is when the action begins. There are a lot of reasons why I would recommend this movie to anyone. It portrays the characters' personalities extremely well(Bill Paxton's character is an example) and it also creates enough tension to make you pee in your pants. The special effects were good for a movie made in the 1980s, and there is enough one liners and memorable quotes to keep you begging for more. Another reason why I like this movie is because it has none of those kissing scenes and mushy stuff. Every movie I have watched in the past 8 years had a kissing scene. The music was excellent, too. The dialogue, unlike most movies, is easily understood, and can keep the most prominent dialogue hater interested. Aliens is still my number 1 movie. And until now, nothing has come close to it.",10,0,0,28 June 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," good and bad
","This movie was both good and bad. I thought the storyline was rather weak and hard to understand, as there were too many plot holes and unneeded scenes and characters, such as the police inspector, as the influence he had on many characters was short lived. The ending was lousy as it did not resolve many things. Chow-Yun-Fatt showed the same expression on his face during the entire movie, even when he gets hit. And the way he spoke to Michelle Yeoh's character in the first bit of the movie seemed like he had rehearsed his lines once. And as the story unfolds, Chow Yun Fatt's character seems so insignificant to the storyline, which looked like it was centering around Ziyi Zhang. On the good side, the fighting scenes and sword fighting were done well.(Though at one point of the movie the fighting seemed unconvincing.)The cinematography and the scenes when the characters defy gravity and leap incredible distances were breathtaking as well. If you like quick and mind-boggling martial arts, with sword action so fast you'll get blown away, watch this movie. Otherwise, don't.",Null,0,0,16 July 2000
Gladiator," excellent
","Gladiator, as far as I can tell, is the best roman-history movie I've ever seen. Set during Rome's conquering of Europe, Gladiator is about a good-hearted General Maximus who, after skillfully conquering Germania, is heir to the dying Marcus Caesar's empire. But when Caesar's son hears that he is not the one to inherit his dad's throne, he kills his father, proclaims himself Caesar, then arrests Maximus because of disrespect for him and kills his family. When Maximus escapes from execution and discovers of his family's death, he is picked up by Gladiator trainers and trained to be a Gladiator. The movie was really good in cinematography as the scenes of the catapults and ballistas and flaming arrows in the sky, the colosium and the inside of the arena were absolutely stunning to see. During the sword battles, things got really bloody, sometimes the battles got messy and you could not comprehend what is going on: For instance, you can hear a sword cutting flesh, but on the screen all you can see is a complete shifty blur. But still, that does not take away the spirit of the movie, with the truly fantastic acting, the cinematography, the plot, and the drama involved. There were about 2 or 3 scenes where I nearly cried. The movie involved a LOT of blood and violence, such as when Maximus uses two swords like a pair of scissors and cuts off a gladiator's head, or when a female archer falls of the chariot and is later sliced in two by the spiked rod that sticks out of the chariot wheel. If you like intense battles and good acting, along with blood and guts, look no further.",Null,0,0,24 May 2000
