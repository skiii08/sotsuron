The Young Victoria," Visually stunning film with solid performances
","when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.The only thing that really let me down are the performances. Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.To me the film feels like unfinished. Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie.But overall it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt.",8,1,3,15 December 2009
Avatar," James Cameron is back
","Finally, after 12 years of waiting James Cameron is back. When i saw the trailer of this movie i knew this is going to be one of the best films ever made.When his brother is killed in a battle, Semi-paralyzed Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) takes his brothers place in a project, where his brother took part of, and goes to the moon Pandora where he has to infiltrate with help of a specially cloned Na'Vi avatar that he can control with his mind and when Jake enters the world of Pandora as a avatar he comes in touch with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) which since then has a special bond with. With help of Dr Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Norm Spellman (Joel Moore) he tries to improve the understanding between humans and the Na'Vi people, but Colonel Miles Quarich (Stephen Lang) sees this as a great opportunity to gain some information about the Na'Vi people and to take over their rich land.Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang and Michelle Rodriguez all did great solid jobs but the real stand-out is Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. I haven't seen a lot of her movies but in Avatar she was just great. The only thing i had problem with avatar is the story, which was a little bit clich√©d and at some time predictable.Avatar is a great adventure and is a Must-See for every movie fan around the world. I still can not believe that James Cameron made this movie in the past 12 years. Almost everything in this movie is great, actors, special effects , the eye to detail. i haven't seen a lot of high praised films by critics (Brothers, Inglorious Basterds, Precious) but for me Avatar is the Best film of 2009.",10,3,8,19 December 2009
