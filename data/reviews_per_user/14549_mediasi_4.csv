United 93," Nothing you expect... A must watch
","I'm very against the commercializing of 9/11, so chances are this is the only 9/11 film I will have watched.More of a docu-drama, United 93 focuses as much on air traffic control and military ops on that day as it does on the flight where 40 passengers stood their ground.I found this film to be very well done (the 'look' and angles make it more personal, unlike Hollywood Blockbusters). The score doesn't interrupt the story, and the story... well, it's realistic, believable and really makes you feel like you're watching in real-time as the morning's events unfold.For those faint at heart, there are but a few 'rough watch spots,' and all I can say is there's no choice but to watch them.I saw this in a theater that showed no previews, and posted a silent screen simply requesting that all cell phones be turned off.There are things to learn, and though some things seem to be placed for political reasons, I doubt they were. I don't think we'll see a 'truer' film on the big screen about 9/11.I found United 93 to be an educational experience, which also reminded me how important it is to live life each day, and to simply be... an American. It was an experience I'll never forget, and it's a film I'll not need to watch twice. It left me with the emotion that what I felt on that day in '01 has never diminished.",9,8,15,28 April 2006
Erin Brockovich," Great Acting, Directing to Convey a Tragic Story
","Even with such high ratings, I was skeptical to spend a Saturday evening with this film. I don't regret it one bit.Julia Roberts is at her best, with a dramatic story with slight comedic interludes. The story, regardless of its content, is as true to life as they come. And Julia, as Erin, represents a trait every woman wishes she could have - the gall to stand up for what she believes, the compromise between love and goals, and the strength to carry herself through anything.Two very promising thumbs up to the story, the actors and the director.",9,1,1,6 May 2000
Brokeback Mountain," I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen...
","A finely directed and acted movie - I'll give it that. But this movie did not touch me emotionally. I neither felt compassion nor disgust, or anything else for the characters.The acting was superb, there's no doubt about that. The cinematography was top notch.However, it was missing the element that makes you walk away feeling something for the characters. No matter what genre of film, if I don't feel some sort of emotion after watching it, it's nothing more than a 'story.' Sorry, but this was one of those films for me. They hype 'forbidden love' in all the materials, but I didn't 'feel' that in the film. I not once felt that these guys were so in love they would do anything for each other.",5,4,24,6 April 2006
American Psycho," Another fine example of high ratings for a poor film...
","Without spoiling the 'meaning' of the film for those who have not seen it, I'll sum it up in one sound - zzzzzzzzzzzzz........Very seldom will I regret having even sat through an entire film. If it weren't for the other five with me, I'd have walked out. When we stood up at the end (we couldn't even sit through the credits), one of our crowd said, 'I'd like to apologize now for picking this film.'Now, before someone out there finds a way to relay to me that I'm an idiot, I'll say now that I am INTO horror, INTO dry humor, INTO strange and 'out of the norm' plots and dialogue. I work around those in film making, have read many screenplays and watched many movies you wouldn't put your wicked stepmother to sleep with. And yet, I can't find one reason to rate this higher than a 3.While the acting WAS good, I got one laugh, and a lot of glances at my watch. It was the first time I got up in the middle of a film to get popcorn just for something, anything else, to do.I'm not alone. Of the five others with me, one makes a living working in film and another is working his way into film. None of us thought the money was well spent, and wound up going home to watch The Sixth Sense on DVD.Last week I finally watched Eyes Wide Shut (another total nightmare that I had to force myself to sit through). If I had the choice, I'd sit through that again to avoid any further flashbacks about American Psycho.",3,1,4,21 April 2000
