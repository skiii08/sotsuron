3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Redemption
","I'm not a Western film buff and don't claim to be so I had some reservations going into this film, however, I was also expecting something great even though it's not my particular genre. With Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, and James Mangold directing, I knew the screenplay had to be good. I knew the film was going to be good. I just didn't know how much I would love it. Christian Bale plays Dan Evens, a poor rancher who's struggling during the drought to protect his family. He happens to stumble upon Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) as he's robbing a coach full of money hauled by the Pinkerton's. After a gun battle erupts, Wade collects on his 22nd robbery. Dan Evans oldest son, William (Logan Lerman), ignores Dan, which happens a lot as William tries to see the action from atop the ridge as Wade and his gang spot him after Wade shoots one of his own men for putting the rest of the gang at risk. Evans oldest son is in awe of Wade and has a sense of admiration his father wish he had for him.Wade is caught in Bisbee and the Railroad Company is offering to pay three men to bring Wade to Contention and put him on the 3:10 to Yuma and send him to the Yuma prison. Evens tells him that he was the best shot in his regiment and Evans youngest son who sees his father as a hero tells Wade that he can shoot a jackrabbit at 50 yards, which is sayin' something. Evans is paid 200 dollars to help bring Wade to Contention.During the journey we start to see a transformation from both Wade and Evans. Evans tells him that he will bring him to justice. He believes it's right to stand up to people like Ben Wade. By the end of the journey, as they make it to Contention, they wait for the train to come and this wait becomes the films strongest act. Evans is watching Wade in a bridal suite waiting for destiny to come. As the wait comes closer to three o'clock, Wade's gang arrives in Contention. The gang's current leader, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), is the only one who wanted to travel 80 miles to help Wade. Prince makes an offer to the towns folk of 200 dollars to anyone who shoots one of his capturers. The odds now seem insurmountable and since everyone in the town has guns cocked and drawn ready to shoot the Marshall and two of his best deputies decide that they're family men and this is an unfair fight and they will not die like this, so they bail on Evans. Mr. Butterfield also says that he won't be helping Evans put Wade on that train. Evans is found standing alone.Now when all the bullets start flying reality goes right out the door with them, but the message and purpose for Evans leading Wade to the train makes it all worth it. The ending is controversial and a lot of people aren't going to find it realistic, but they haven't noticed the character change. Is it a little unreal how Wade seems to turn in the blink of an eye? Sure. Maybe. But the reasons for their turn is exhilarating to watch. Seeing Wade brought to justice was not Evans intention at all- as it was at the start of their journey. Evans does something incredible. Wade does something incredible. The actions during the final minutes with nothing but the sound of the chugging train engine like a slow heartbeat in the background is emotionally captivating. It is some of the best work of any genre you are going to find.Christian Bale is great in this film and this may very well be his greatest acting achievement to date (American Psycho, The Machinist, The Prestige) and Russell Crowe is also phenomenal and this is one of his better performances as well (A Beautiful Mind, Gladiator, American Gangster).This film is not about the gun battles or the wild west. It's about the characters. These characters are so deep and as we become so involved with them we are left rooting for them and hoping something doesn't happen that seems inevitable. The final lines of the film are said by Dan Evans' son and Charlie Prince. Both said to Dan Evans. We can get a sense of joy during these final moments because we know everything that happened up until that point went exactly as planed by Evans, and we get a sense of triumph in an odd way. This is a great film regardless of genre. It's also the best Western I've ever seen.",9,20,34,11 January 2008
In Bruges," Fear and Loathing In Bruges
","Martin McDonagh, in his first feature film, has created one hell of an introduction. The movie is not complex, at first, as two hit men are sent to Bruges to wait for their orders after a hit goes terribly wrong. Bruges is in Belgium, by the way. It's a beautiful medieval city that lifts off the screen with gorgeous cinematography. It's hard to imagine a city so aesthetically pleasing with its towers, canals, and scenery that most would cherish. One of the hit men is Ray (Colin Farrell) and the other is Ken (Brenden Gleeson). Ray finds Bruges to be old and boring while Ken admires the architecture with wondrous eyes. As they wait for their orders we have a lot of comedic banter with a setting Quentin Tarantino could write dialogue for days with. It takes about twenty minutes into the film when the action and the plot start to pull all the strings together with a hit; in a church of all places. This is Ray's first hit. The scene starts, through a flashback, with Ray confessing to a murder that will take place in the not so distant feature. He tells the priest, 'I've murdered someone.' The priest asks, 'Who did you murder?' Ray responds with, 'You, Father.' As the bullets start to fly a life is taken. More importantly an innocent life - a young boy's life. The boy is on his knees as he just finished writing his confession for all the bad things he did.This sets into place a string of events involving characters recognizing their own absurdity in certain situations (they call them principles). The humor is dark and extremely effective, mostly coming from Ray. At some point in the film, I was laughing so hard I missed the next lines. It truly is laugh-out-loud funny. Farrell is perfect with his childish delivery, batting eyebrows and high pitched squeaking sounds to emphasize certain words. Farrell does an excellent job as and makes you feel for his characters pain immensely as he agonizes over the little boy's death. Both of these actors work exceptionally well off one another and both give heart felt performances. Do hit men such as these have moral boundaries? Do they cross them? Do they stand by their word, and more importantly, do they do what they say they would do when the gun is put to their own head? Ethics would never come into play with hit men in most films, but these men have boundaries and their word means something to them. Henry (Ralph Fiennes) is the leader of these two hit men and he sent both to Bruges to wait for his orders after the tragic hit in the church. For the first 2/3 of the film we only hear him over the phone and he brings dark humor into the picture as well. The writing is fantastic as certain characters constantly repeat themselves and say the same thing multiple times. It sounds musical and so rhythmic with the delivery and the repetition. Fiennes is terrific. He and Ken have a couple of great scenes together in the final act. It's acting at its finest. The direction overall is extremely well done. After the film settles in it takes off and most of that is due in large part by the gorgeous cinematography and the great score lifting the film to the heights that it will stay at for the rest of the film. As the film progresses it gets better and better and better. You'll find yourself gradually becoming more and more involved with the outcome of the characters. 'In Bruges' is a dark and funny film that's engaging till the end with an engrossing plot and characters. The best movie of 2008.",9,8,14,12 June 2008
I'm Not There," A Chaotic Masterpiece Embodying Bob Dylan
","Todd Haynes has created a biopic so different than the norm that it's assuredly going to be bashed for not meeting the everyday standards of the everyday movies with the everyday formulaic narratives. Like Bob Dylan, Haynes never once backs away from what he tries to accomplish- change, chaos, and ambiguity. This film is Bob Dylan. The themes, settings, look, pacing, characters, chaos, ambiguity, contradictions, and for the fact that this never once tries to explain who Dylan is or why he is the way he was is so fitting it's hard to imagine a biopic on Dylan done any differently. This is a bold film done in a fresh and unique way. This isn't the usual 'Walk The Line' or 'Ray' type singer-biopic (Which are excellent films in their own right) where you have one great performance surrounded by the life and times, the highs and lows, and then the conquering of life's obstacles. When you watch those films, you know where we start and how we finish before the movie even starts. You just enjoy the journey. 'I'm Not There' baffles, confuses, lies, contradicts, and makes you question everything. We never know where we're going, who we're going to meet, or what time and person we'll end up with. Haynes doesn't have one person recreate Dylan as Dylan was. He relies on six actors and actresses to play parts of the enigma that we know as Bob Dylan.Haynes style is magnificent; the music is engrossing; the acting is on point from every actor in the film with award worthy performances scattered throughout; the cinematography was excellent; the writing superior to most of this decade and the editing was excellent. We never once feel we're at one place with one character for too long, or we jump into one life unexpectedly where it feels forced. Gere's part seems out of left field and it completely is, but when we're there we learn just as much about Dylan than we have with any character. Blanchett, Ledger, and Bale are the three standouts. Blanchett will get most of the praise because she embodies Dylan's psychedelic, far out trips, flamboyant behavior, and his eagerness to rebel, question, and change. Ledger gives one of his best performances during a marriage that is falling apart due to infidelity and long lasting time away as he plays Robbie Clark- a young, up and coming actor. Christian Bale plays Jack Rollins. When Rollins pops up it's through a documentary like form. We're watching a movie within a movie about one of the characters. Not only is that unique, but Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) plays Jack Rollins is a movie called 'Grain of Sand.' During the in-movie documentary on the life of Jack Rollins we learn about his past experiences and how he came to become an evangelical preacher. All three actors have the most intriguing parts of the film that just suck you in and stay with you long after you see them. Blanchett deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She's fantastic and gives one of her best performances as she's quickly building a resume that most actresses can't touch, but Bale and Ledger are both equally impressive. The intertwining stories are done so well and stay so true to the man that Dylan was makes 'I'm Not There' one of the best films of the year. The constantly changing themes, looks and colors of the film embody Dylan's appearances to perfection. The six characters embody Dylan's schizophrenic like changing of personalities. The historical backdrops used in the film are important and relevant to the times and characters as they add depth and perception to the character's lives. Todd Haynes has created a work that should only get better and more revered as time goes by because we just don't come across films such as this in any time period. Haynes has created a gem to be proud of and a gem that Dylan should be proud of.",7,17,30,25 May 2008
Citizen Kane," Gaudy Reputation, But a Dull Film
","I really can't find anything in 'Citizen Kane' worth liking. Do I see what the big fuss is about? Sure. And it is one of the best looking and most well made film of the 40s (from what I've seen. I admittedly don't watch many films from the 40s, because of bad experiences with 'great' films such as this). 'Citizen Kane' is a monumental achievement because of some of the technical aspects. I have no reason to watch 'Citizen Kane' ever again though. I don't particularly like any of the acting, and the story is just dull to me. I don't watch movies for editing, camera work, lighting or technical achievements. Those aspects of filmmaking certainly can greatly help or hurt a film, but without a good script, and without good acting, you just have a good-looking movie. That's the case with 'Citizen Kane.' Supremely directed and extremely well crafted for its time, but I just didn't care for the man or the exposition of most scenes. A lot of directors can make a good-looking film, and a lot have. The remake of 'All the King's Men' is wonderfully shot, but the movie is a complete mess that is just butchered by the director (most noticeably the atrocious casting and the shampoo commercial-esque editing). 'All the King's Men' does have a good performance from Penn, but that's about it. Other than that? It is a terrible movie. 'Citizen Kane' is not that bad and Welles' direction is far better, but I think it's a similar case were two movies look a lot better than anything that's happening between the characters, or within the story. The characters might be exquisitely framed, but I just didn't care what they had to say. It is masterfully made for its time and it is a greatly influential film. That's what it is remembered for and what it was always be remembered for. Rosebud comes second. If you rate a movie purely on direction, then you probably give it a high score. If you don't, then your taste will dictate how effective it was. For me, 'Citizen Kane' is another major disappointment to add to the heap of 'disappointing classics.'",6,11,18,11 August 2010
L.A. Confidential," Incredible Look; Incredible Plot
","'L.A. Confidential' is the kind of film that will make you laugh; make you gaze in amazement at its appeal, and become immersed in a murder mystery with so many twists and tangles that it could make your head spin. With one of the strongest plots I've ever seen, which is executed masterfully by Curtis Hanson, also has eye candy and sex appeal. The direction really is wonderful. The art direction is fantastic and brings you right back into the 50s. The acting is very good even if it comes off as 50s styled acting proving that todays actors are far superior than the actors of the 50s. 'L. A. Confidential' even goes as far as poking fun at the sensationalized way films were made in that time period with a hilarious sequence where a cop on a show called, 'Badge of Honor,' interrupts a women giving him details about some crime, and he says, 'Just the facts, ma'am. Just the facts.'The tangled and twisted plot is engrossing and filled with seduction, cons, lies, betrayal, killings, and corruption. The acting is terrific from a slew of great actors including Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Walter Cromwell plays one of the great villains I've ever seen. All of these guys have a lot of fun with their roles, and do an excellent job. Kim Basinger plays a prostitute who tries to look like a movie a star so that her pimp, Pierce Patchett (David Stratharin), can reap the benefits since everyone wants to be with a celebrity. 'L. A. Confidential' is as much a look at the culture of the 50s, both commercially through television and the dirty business of police officers exposed, as it is being a stylized homage piece. This is a film that's done exceptionally well with some great lines, great performances, and a plot that will force you to watch it again and again. It hardly misses a beat. This is one of the few films that can recreate the 50s with its acting and style and still hold up with todays society. It works well as a film and exceptionally well as an homage piece.",8,9,13,11 August 2008
Match Point," Forced Thriller That Doesn't Quite Work
","Woody Allen's 'Match Point' is one of his most forced efforts to date. Allen tries to reinvent himself with a thriller that twists and turns for shock and awe. The biggest problem I had with with the film is the ridiculous turn it takes two-thirds of the way through. Allen tries to set the surprise up by making his main characters struggle over his involvement in a love-triangle seem so pressing on his conscience that he's forced to do the unthinkable. I didn't believe Chris Wilton's (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) change. Not for a second. It was baffling to witness. The entire time, as I'm watching his actions build up towards an inevitable climax, I'm thinking, 'Don't do it, Woody. Don't do it.' The twist just felt so forced that I laughed at the execution of the film, and, not to mention, the twist is foreseeable and not that shocking. You may shocked that Allen decided to make the turn down this road. Maybe Jonathan Rhys Meyers is just way over of his head. Maybe he's the demise of the film since the films turn rests solely on his shoulders to make the audience believe such a turn is believable.I really never got into any part of this film. I wasn't engaged with these actors and their relationships at all. I didn't care about Chloe's (Emily Mortimer) obsession with getting pregnant, and actually found her terribly annoying and repulsive. Emily Mortimer is usually prime for a solid to great performance, but here she has a character that's just incredibly annoying that you find it odd how Chris can like her and how he wouldn't go after the more appealing Nola (Scarlett Johansson). Midway through the film, we kinda get bogged down in repeated scenes of Chris's inability to tell his wife that he's having an affair with another women, and we get the same argument between Chris and Nola multiple times. The film just comes to a stop. It might even lose some audiences and test their patience.Matthew Goode is exceptional and stands out from the entire cast. He's really one of the few bright spots in the film. The relationship between Chris and Nola felt very fake and came off as very flat. I didn't really care about Chloe since she was written so poorly. I didn't find Chris's internal struggle interesting, engaging, or authentic. I found his actions to be forced in order to move the plot along, making the film a bit contrived and a little too neat. This isn't an effective romance or love-triangle, nor is it an effective thriller or character study. 'Match Point' fails in the writing and the acting. This could have been good with a lead actor capable of handling such heavy material, but Jonathan Meyers is just unable to support such a dramatic turn. Very few actors can handle this kind of dramatic turn that borders unbelievability.",4,3,5,2 March 2009
Cloverfield," Unintelligent, Unimpressive, and Unoriginal
","I usually write reviews for films that I really liked, but my friends demanded that I see this instead of 'No Country for Old Men' so I went into this film quite p!ssed off and mildly drunk. It started with a bunch of talking at a party about God knows what and about God knows who. The entire film is told through a camcorder. 'Cloverfield' is a camera that was found in what was known as 'Central Park'. The movie is what was found. This video takes us from a party scene at the beginning to the death of every person on the camera. That's not really a spoiler because it's quite obvious what it is and what will happen before you even see it.After the military drops all kinds of bombs on this animal and there are no affects as the big monster just shakes them off, it's pretty clear that this thing is never going to die. We watch this air attack from the camera of one of the people in a rescue chopper as the big monster falls down. Everyone in the chopper says, 'We killed him! We killed him! Hooray!!!' as the monster falls into a pile of his own dust. Right then and there, not only does every audience member know this thing ain't dead, but we know that this chopper is coming down and everyone in it is going to die. And sure as the person reading this was born, that does happens. Only the crash doesn't kill the people in the chopper right away, just the pilot and co-pilot, you know the unimportant people, but the main characters stay alive just long enough to wake up the next mourning so we can get a good look at the monster. Then we get our first good look at it and I must say it's pretty damn cool looking, but I was so mad after and 1 hour and 10 minutes of garbage that I didn't even care. Then they die. And, I must say, this camera has some kind of battery since its running all night long and all day long. The energizer bunny couldn't keep this running for as long as it did.It is incredibly unrealistic. There are so many questions I was asking during this piece of garbage. I'm asking, why isn't this guy dropping his camera while a bunch of little critters, much like 'Alien' that are falling off the big monster, chasing him and trying to kill him? Drop the camera! They're trying to kill you and you're running backwards so you can catch it on video. Does that make any sense? No, it doesn't, but nothing else did so why would that? For one reason or another, the thought of dropping the camera never came into one of these characters heads and I wish they did since the movie would just end. How did this 'thing' start? Where did 'it' come from? How long has 'it' been in New York? This is the first attack? The thing is pretty big and you would think someone would have seen it prior to this and since it's so hostile, you would also think there would be attacks left and right, but no, this is the first attack and this thing goes straight for the city. Killing everything in its way just like in the movies!!!! Basically, it's filled with non stop, predictable, been there done that action after crappy conversation in the beginning. The best part was when all these people stopped talking since they made my head spin with their stupidity and dumb jokes. If we actually got to know these people, maybe I would have cared, but their purpose was to hold the camera and die. Plus the actors all sucked so it wouldn't have made any difference. It's a little shaky and by a little I mean the entire thing. Every second of every shot is pure shaking. Think 'Blair Which Project'. You really can't find one redeeming quality about this video. Everything in it has been done one thousand times before. They copied 'Godzilla,' 'Aliens,' and 'The Blair Which Project'.Everyone around me seemed to have the same amount of hatred for this film while a bunch of dorks clapped for it at the end and my sections rained down boos and chants of 'rip-off' and 'Godzilla.' One of my friends liked it. Since he made me miss 'No Country for Old Men' and for the fact that he liked it; I can now say he was a friend.One of the worst movies I have ever seen.This deserves ZERO stars.",2,29,59,20 January 2008
Crash," A Burning Mess with a Touch of Beauty
","'Crash' is a movie that has one character crashing into another. Several questions arise watching the film. I ask, is everyone in the world spewing hate-mongering statements 24/7 and looking at people who are of a different race and nationality as criminals, terrorists, or thugs? The film deals with far too prevalent acts of racism. These acts are not nearly as prevalent as they were 40 and 50 years ago in America, which is probably when this film should take place, but even then there would be one too many racists in this film. Not every person is filled with hate, but we get the impression that we are. 'Crash' wants to be bold and outgoing on a touchy subject and does a good job in doing that with the actions of the characters, but ultimately it never gets to where it wants to be.The only person that you get a feel for being 100% racist is Matt Dillon's character. After an inspiring act of humanity and selflessness from Officer Ryan it reaches its climax right then and there, half way through the film, and unfortunately never recovers until the final moments. This will be the first of many occasions where we see some good show through an evil character or some bad show through a good character. Veteran Police Officer Jon Ryan played by Matt Dillon gives an Oscar worthy performance. His performance ends up getting lost in the shuffle of the swinging door of one racist character after another and how we see them redeem themselves. His story along with the black couple that he comes to know on a personal basis like no other relationship you could ever imagine is truly some of the greatest work I have ever seen in film. We see the most volatile in man in one traffic stop from Officer Ryan then we see the most humane, noble, and heroic in an incredibly inspiring, emotional, and beautifully crafted rescue scene.Each and every character goes through a transformation which is preceded by a crazy and unrealistic event that happens in their lives that gives them a new outlook on life and a new outlook on the people around them. The bad end up good and the good end up bad.The film really misses on it racial slurs, but hits on all cylinders with its racial actions. The problem is that they didn't take it all that far. In all reality it's really lightweight stuff when you really listen to what they're saying with what they should or could be saying. Watch a Martin Scorsese film and then talk about racism. This movie tries to go all the way, but fails at the end of the day with the tone of the film not matching what we hear. It doesn't match what the characters are saying with what they're doing. They're supposed to be racist, but they speak in politically correct racism. Racism is no holds barred and this film is trapped in a 6X10 steel cage just waiting to explode.There is just one too many people changing for the good. And one too many people changing for the bad. To symbolize this, it snows at the end (In LA) to show that people can change and that it's possible. That anything is possible; when in these cases virtually none of it is possible. If you can get past all this over the top stuff that really brings the film down you can see what the filmmaker is trying to portray; you realize this film is not about racism like I thought it was after the first time I watched it. It has much more to offer.The second time I watched this film, the final images really jumped out at me. Maybe I had a better understanding, maybe I was watching closer, but we see all the characters looking out their windows, or out into the dark night, or out upon the city lights. We first see this with the newly resurrected Officer Ryan who is a changed man as he looks at a brightly lit Christmas tree in the city possibly resembling his future, but he still has a look of grief and sorrow for his actions on that same street that could make anyone sick. Then we see Daniel (Michael Pena) looking out his window after he nearly looses a loved one. We see him looking at the beautiful world in which he inhabits and the ugliness that he has seen as he wonders if that bullet from his past is still following him. He appreciates all that he could have lost and fears what he could lose.We see the DA (Brendan Fraser) looking out his door just after he comes home. He looks out his window wondering if he's safe and questioning his purpose in life. Prior to this scene we see that he has more than just a working relationship with his black secretary, Karen, which his wife(Sandra Bullock) would surly oppose. Finally we see the city of LA as we just witness Anthony (Ludacris) change into a hero and Shaniqua get rear-ended by someone of a different background. She then spews a toned down racial epithet. Here we see the beautiful images of LA where mankind's most vile and heinous acts have been occurring, but we also see its great acts of heroism and humanity. We see that people can change. We also see that people are good hearted and everyone has good and bad buried in them. They just need to examine themselves, step back, take it all in, and just let go. The final message is that, maybe tomorrow everyone can find their way. The final shot reassures us that maybe there is hope amidst all these despicable acts because of all the great acts of humanity that we see from the despicable.There's a lot to like, but it's just too heavy handed.",6,7,10,8 August 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Mass Destruction and 'The Bomb' have its Perks.
","Watching 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' was a refreshing comedy on mass destruction and the insane predicament during the Cold War and the Nuclear arms race. 'Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more then ten to twenty million killed, tops. Depending on the breaks.' is said by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott). Turgidson says this to President Muffley (Peter Sellers- in his first of three supporting roles) in the 'War Room' as Gen. Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has gone 'psychotic' and ordered 34 planes to Nuke Russia (U.S.S.R) because he thinks the commies are trying to spoil their 'precious bodily fluids.' He says the meaning is 'water,' but the low angle shots, almost as if the camera is in Hayden's lap, of Ripper sucking on a large cigar only scream of something more than just bodily water. I don't know what to make of that. As Turgidson debriefs the President, some of the best scenes of the film are shot in this one room- the War Room and let's be perfectly clear, there's no fighting in the war room. Turgidson informs the President that Gen. Jack Ripper has complete control and has shut off all communications to the base and the secret code, that only he knows, that can get in contact with the planes pilots have no contact with anyone. So, the President has no way of stopping the planes from dropping the bomb because Ripper has shut off all communications- sounds like some of the stories you hear from the 60s. This leads to a great, one-sided, phone call to the head of Soviet Premier, Dmitri, that might leave younger audiences thinking this is some kind of impersonation of President George Bush, but it's not. Peter Sellers best performance of the three roles comes as the President. The scenes between Scott and Sellers are both electric and very funny that hit on all six cylinders. President Muffley informs Dmitri that he's very sorry that 34 planes are on their way to drop a bomb that will ruin the entire civilization in the USSR, so he orders his own plans to be shot down and assists in the attack giving it the okay. Turgidson disagrees with the idea and would love to wipe out the entire Communist regime, but US policy is not to Nuke first. We Nuke second. It's only proper. 'I'm sorry, too, Dmitri... I'm very sorry... *All right*, you're sorrier than I am, but I am as sorry as well... I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri! Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are... So we're both sorry, all right?... All right.' President Muffley sounds very sorry. Quite panicked as well (Not really, which makes it all the more funnier).I thought Sellers gave the best performances as the incredibly off-the-wall, enthusiastic General with more plans on his mind than destroying millions of people- like getting back to Miss Scott, who's in his bedroom on a countdown. Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove is exactly how you think he would look and act. Is it over the top? Yeah, very much so, but his ridiculous quirks and possessed right arm that seems to have a mind of it's own is very funny, especially when you couple that with his survival plan for when the 'Dooms Day Machine' goes off. That's the really big nuke that will kill everybody on the entire planet if the USA pilots reach their targets and in order to save the human race, Dr. Strangelove says all the top generals and leaders of the world will have to live in a coalmine for about 100 years with a 10:1 ratio of women to men. This perks up the attention of General Turgidson and puts a smile on the face of Dr. Strangelove, even though he has a permanent smile on his face. The best scene in the film may come when the pilot of one of the planes is riding the bomb on it's way down to earth as if he's at a rodeo just living it up. That wonderful bomb has so many great advantages when you really think about it: A lot of sex with a lot of different women, you can ride on them like a cowboy, you can eliminate millions of commies there's just much good that can come of a bomb such as this. The fact that this was made right in the middle of the whole fire storm makes this film even more appreciable, now, more than ever. There are some great performances, good laughs, and a very engrossing look on annihilation and mass destruction as numbers are thrown around like numbers instead of human casualties. Other than the look of the airplanes resembling more paper planes on strings than actual airplanes, there's really not much to dislike. Very rarely do you see a refreshing comedy that was made over 40 years ago, but I've seen just that as 'Dr. Strangelove' has some serious staying power. It's a near-masterpiece. This should be Kubrick's best film, but I certainly see why '2001' may be regarded higher.",8,6,13,6 May 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A Throat Slashing Extravaganza Gone Wrong
","'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' is a hard film to watch and will test some audiences, maybe most audiences. I was tested during this musical, turned for the silver screen, that never felt so wrong. There were some things that were done extremely well and I can appreciate that, such as the make up, set design and costume design. Those are all worthy of the Academy Award nominations that they got and I can't complain about their wins. There was some great CGI and special effects that give the look of the film a very contrasting picture of dark, bright, beautiful, and a down right heinous look. The blood is just as black as the clothes, or the floors, or the rooms which gives 'Sweeney Todd' a very dark feeling that was captured very well by director, Tim Burton. The feel and tone of the film are pitch perfect, but once these characters open their mouths the film quickly turns from perfect to nearly unbearable.I actually would really like to see this film adapted to a fable instead of a musical much in the mold of 'Edward Scissorhands.' That's where I think this can be an exceptional film. The music is down right awful and it made me cringe in my seat. I had to leave during parts of the music because of the words and the sounds were just so hard to listen to; it's just bad. It's a musical and the music sucks. There was one song here, in a rare bright spot for the film, where Sacha Baron Cohen sings which generated a couple laughs, especially with the look of his hair growth formula. That's where the laughs end. This isn't funny and it isn't supposed to be, but that scene may have been one of the best the film has to offer- and that isn't even that good. It's just an average scene. The best scene comes at the end of the film. The ending is what got 'Sweeney Todd' a rating higher than a half a star in my book. I won't ruin it, but it's a strong ending that doesn't wavier from the theme and tone of the film and even though it's predictable it's still very well executed. The progression of Sweeney' thirst for vengeance takes such a severe course where he forgets what he's avenging and who he's doing it for. In his blood-lust he forgets where he came from and what he's here for. Sweeney looses himself in his hatred and grows so dark that he does something that he could not bear to do.The acting is average. Depp should not have been nominated with so many other strong performances from the year. Brad Pitt in 'The Assassination of Jesse James' was much, much better with a similar type of character; just against a very different backdrop. Ryan Gosling was much more deserving in 'Lars and The Real Girl' and in all reality this performance doesn't even stand in the same breath as those two. Depp just mails in another one of his makeup soaked, black eyed, yellow teethed, over the top, completely out there performance that only Johnny Depp would want to do. He's done this same performance before and basically plays another variation of 'Edward Scissorhands,' 'Sleepy Hollow,' 'Charlie in the Chocolate Factory,' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' It's a performance that I've seen before and quite frankly a performance that I've been tired of seeing a long time ago. Depp has a lot of talent and was great in 'Blow' and even better in 'Donnie Brasco,' but with films such as this, all those talents are wasted with ridiculous characters. His singing is mediocre, but it's not like he's got the greatest songs to sign, so I don't fault him there. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty good in this, and this is exactly in her ballpark, as well. I'm not sure why she didn't get nominated since I couldn't find much of a difference between the two lead performances, but I guess it's do to the fact that she's not a big name like Depp.In the end, the plot was good, the look was great, but the musical just doesn't work. Without the singing this is probably one of the best films of the year. This is, however, not one of the best films of the year. I'm not a musical guy in the first place, but I am open minded. 'Sweeney Todd' struggles with getting to where it wants to go and you can see where it wants to go from a mile away. I'm watching and knowing what's going to happen, but I feel like I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for it to happen as the music breaks up any kind of rhythm or pacing the film gathers. Instead of a 2 hour film, it should have been no more than 80 minutes. It becomes tedious and tiresome. I'm squirming in my chair, waiting for something to happen while Johnny sings for 5 minutes about his razor. It becomes boring instead of interesting and captivating. The music is the worst part of the film, and once again, for a musical? I don't think that's a good thing.P.S. don't show this to anyone who doesn't know anything about it other than Johnny Depp is in it. I've seen the results. They don't last ten minutes before they're gone. I have watched this two times with six different people. The results the same. Even Johnny Depp can't save this film. Main reason? It's a lost cause to begin with and he just isn't very good giving the same old tired performance that we've been watching for 15 years. The best part may have been the look of the giant breasts full of milk. And who doesn't love that?",4,6,12,24 April 2008
The Town," Entertaining Heist Film
","'The Town' is an excellent film that does have its flaws. It is, however, one of the best films made of 2010 (maybe the best film of th year). Ben Affleck really proves himself as a serious filmmaker with his follow up to 'Gone Baby Gone,' which was among the best films of 2007. The direction is amazing and Affleck really impresses me here, far more than the aforementioned 'Gone Baby Gone,' which was standard fare that is the exact opposite of 'The Town.' 'Gone Baby Gone' relied more on story, dialogue and acting whereas 'The Town' relies on great execution of a rather unoriginal script. If there is a major negative aspect of the film is it's complete unoriginality. It's a remake of 'Heat.' Plain and simple. Thats what it is.The shootouts are phenomenal and they're the best since 'Heat,' which are, pretty much, the best ever. It's a great little crime movie that yes, we've seen done before, but the performances and the craftsmanship are impeccable. That's really what makes it quite good. Its an extremely entertaining film, and for people who gravitate towards the genre (such as myself), should really enjoy it (unless they have some hatred towards Ben Affleck). Jeremy Renner, who plays a Joe Pesci spawned stereotype, is truly amazing. He takes a blandly written character and makes him a really intense, nearly unpredictable person. He steals scene after scene he's in. It's the one true standout performance of the film. Affleck, the actor, is much better than expected, but not completely convincing as the leader of the Charlestown heist team. You can enjoy it for what it is: a well done crime film with heavy action and good acting, or you can pick it apart for being unoriginal, which it is. If you sit and think about all the flaws of the film you can convince yourself it's an average to terrible movie. When I sit and watch it, I'm drawn in and entertained from start to finish. The robbery sequences are gripping thanks to top notch directing, editing and sound mixing. The suspense is amazing. The ensemble cast is terrific. It's the kind of movie so entertaining that it will constantly bring me back to it. It's a magnificent achievement that does everything it sets out to do. It's one of the best films I've seen all year.",7,1,2,6 January 2011
Taxi Driver," A Descent Into Madness
","'Taxi Driver' starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer, Bernard Hermann, as we see the blurred city of New York as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion. 'Taxi Driver' is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro's second best work to 'Raging Bull,' and among the finest acting performances of all time. Travis Bickle is the self proclaimed, 'God's lonely man.' Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy, crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes, he goes unnoticed; like a ghost meandering through life's morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man, with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don't see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He's ready for war, and the table is set. The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dream-like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot (possibly signifying Bickle's departure from the world?) of the carnage left in Bickle's wake. Then there's the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene, which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes, degenerates, and the scum of the earth. He's treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause: Kill 5 scumbags, save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she's no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He's quiet, reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After, Travis drops Betsy off, he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple, 'So long.' As Travis drives off, he menacingly looks back into the mirror, representing a problem still exists, then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle's brooding, boiling, rage within; symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn't cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn't make it any better. He's still ready for war.",9,80,102,25 June 2008
Shutter Island," A World of Confusion
","Martin Scorsese has set out to make a film in a genre he's never attempted with 'Shutter Island.' As usual, the greatest director to ever live brings new life into the psychology thriller genre. 'Shutter Island' is essential Scorsese. At the heart of the movie is Andrew Leadis. Leadis is brought to us by US Marshall, Teddy Daniels. Scorsese takes 'American Psycho' to a whole new level of insanity by depicting the film through the eyes of a delusional man. It is an unrelenting character study and one of Scorsese's finest. One cannot review the film without talking about the second act, which means there are going to be spoilers. Scorsese depicts 'Shutter Island' through the eyes and the lens of its protagonist. Every scene, every shot is a world most people have never seen, but one that haunts Teddy Daniels. This is a film you experience. You experience what its like to be a man so full of delusions that he literally has no idea the people he's talking to might not exist. Daniels is a man obsessed with finding the man who killed his wife (played perfectly by Michelle Williams). What Daniels doesn't know is that he is looking for himself. 'Shutter Island' does not rely on a twist ending that is supposed to shock and awe audiences. 'Shutter Island' is told through the eyes of Daniels and we as an audiences go along for the ride. We play along as Teddy Daniels vigorously attempts to find the killer that is somewhere in Shutter Island. We see how Teddy is haunted by his past through his dreams. He does everything he can to suppress those dreams, but his subconscious refuses to let go of the past that Andrew so dearly wishes never existed. Like Teddy, we suppress the fact that he is a patient there because we simply don't want to believe it to be true. We believe there is something more going on. We believe that the hospital is there to repress thoughts of its patients despite all the hints by doctors and partners and patients alike that Teddy is actually Andrew. Teddy refuses to see those hints, but we as an outsider pick up on it, and I suspect that Teddy does as well.'Shutter Island' does something that has never been done before. It takes a delusional man and shows how he exists in a world of delusions and confusion. Most films, 'American Psycho' the most prominent, have snippets of characters going in and out of a delusional state of mind. Patrick Batemen becomes increasingly more and more delusional as the film progresses. That shows the decent into habitual delusions while 'Shutter Island' shows the constant state of mind that Teddy Daniels is in. From the storm not actually existing to Teddy's dreams, we are completely and totally submerged into this mans mind and the maze he has created for himself. Andrew has created a persona named Teddy who is a good man who is attempting to solve the murder of his wife. Andrew at the same time creates a person for the man who actually did kill his wife... a scarred man that killed his wife in a house fire, he's a monster and that's how Andrew sees himself. Two persona's of Andrew Leadis at two different times in his life. Teddy is the good Marshall that he believed he once was. Andrew is the monster that killed his wife after she drowned their three children.All that I didn't even get to the performances, which are all first rate, the score, the cinematography and the haunting tone and tension created by the set and costume designs. This is a film that takes you into the mind of a man that has gone insane. It takes you and puts you in his shoes, and surprisingly, as a sane person, you seem to think just like the man that is insane, which brings up some interesting ideas. 'Shutter Island' is a complex and layered film that is full of ambiguity. It has haunted me and stuck with me long after seeing it.",7,1,6,24 February 2010
Full Metal Jacket," A Been-There-Done-That War Film
","Kubrick may be best known for his visuals, style, and creativity. 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't all that great to look at it, and doesn't have any great stylistic flare worth noting, and is the same old recycled and clichéd settings and scenes that we've seen over and over. 'Full Metal Jacket' is a kind of disjointed film told through a boot camp setting in the first half and a war setting in second half. The basic training elements of the film have been done numerous times, but nothing like this. This is 'Full Metal Jacket'' strongest element as we see some great film-making of things we've seen done numerous times before, but here; Kubrick brings us one of the most memorable characters in film history with Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). Ermey is fantastic and plays the part as if he's been through it all and seen it all before (That's because he has). The basic training is brutal and if you think the Marine Corps is brutal; 'Full Metal Jacket' raises the bar and heightens reality to unprecedented levels. The first half of the film is done to near masterful levels. There were only two real issues: The inconsistent acting from Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Gomer Pyle and the never ending shellacking that Hartman rains down on his young men. D'Onofrio is great in one scene and absolutely over-the-top in the next-- over-the-top in a campy sense. Private Pyle is a 'fat-body,' and a screw up. He manages to screw everything up to the point were he hides a jelly donut in his footlocker. We see scene after scene of Pyle screwing up as D'Onofrio goes so far over-the-top that at times he puts this look on his face as if he's trying to imitate a person with Down Syndrome- it gets that bad. In most scenes his face works to eerie perfection. Hartman, then tells his men that they need to motive Pyle because he has failed, thus the corps failed him because they have not helped him motivate Pyle. So they beat him one night as he sleeps with bars of soap wrapped in towels and everything changes. Pyle starts talking to his gun. He becomes an excellent shot and a marksman and starts looking more and more like a soldier ready for combat except we get the not-so- subtle feeling that Pyle is going to go AWOL, and, of course, he does. None of the characters seem to know, but we sure do. This will bring us to the best scene in the entire film, which takes place half way through the film. Pyle becomes the second best character, only to Hartman, but once we leave the basic training scenes we're thrown into a war we've seen before and a war we've seen captured on film much better. 'Full Metal Jacket' offers a lot of laughs in the first half of the film and actually goes for too many laughs with Hartman in the opening scene as Kubrick and company just go for the next joke about their sexual orientation. It's funny and Hartman has some great one-liners, but for a drill instructor it gets to the point where he becomes the comedian instead of the drill instructor. After so much it got the point where I was thinking, 'When is he going to get back to his speech and stop calling these guys fags and queers 15,000 different ways?' 'Full Metal Jacket' shows how dehumanizing war can be as we see 'born to kill' written on the helmet of Joker (Mathew Modine) with a peace sign on his chest that represent the 'duality of man' (as we're told). Basically this is questioning the idea that war will solve the world's issues- killing people will create peace. The problem with the film is that we get all of what Kubrick tries to sell us about the effects of war in the first half of the film, when, interesting enough, doesn't even take place during a war. Maybe that's why it made it so strong, but the final half is the same exact theme and message, but now we're actually in the war and it doesn't have as big an impact. The action sequences and the fight sequences are clichéd and stupid and look amateurish with the slow motion shots of blood spattering everywhere, and echoing cries of pain are heard from afar. This is supposed to strike a cord in you, that's why Kubrick elongates the pain. In 'Saving Private Ryan,' a film done over ten years later, in a very similar situation, Spielberg doesn't use any camera tricks or slow motion shots to make us feel a certain way. He just shows it as it would happen: Realistically. This creates a much stronger reaction than having a guy slowly fall and flop around as we're being told how to feel. It comes off as an unnatural and unrealistic force feeding because Kubrick is almost afraid his audience won't care for these guys, so he tries to make us care. 'Full Metal Jacket,' ultimately doesn't have much direction or anything new to say on the subject. It's a film about the soldiers, but the soldiers are all clichés. They're all the same exact people who are represented as nothing but barbaric animals. I don't know if his intention was to glorify veterans and troops, but this film is insulting to the men and woman who protect and serve.",7,10,20,6 June 2008
The Godfather: Part II," Overwritten Script Takes Away from What Could-Have-Been
","The sequel to 'The Godfather,' at times, was just as impressive, and sometimes even more impressive than the original. Overall, though the film struggles with it's flashbacks to an early New York as we watch a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rise to power. 'The Godfather II,' wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. When we're in the present time watching Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fight off Senators that are trying to squeeze him, or when we're watching his house get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone very close to the family we always find our self in amazement. When we jump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. The script is to blame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in it's near three hour run time. When we're in the early 1920s we see things that are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to being on par with the present day status of the Corleone family. Its good to know and see how the godfather started out, but there's too much to say and not enough time to say it. The bloated section of the film becomes underwritten. We don't really learn anything about Vito Corleone that we didn't already know. We don't really see how he gains his power. He kills 'The Black Hand,' and one day, through rumors, he becomes the Don of the city. Just like that. Just like that? Really? Then we come back and he's all of a sudden in the Olive Oil business. We don't know how he got there or anything, he's just there. De Niro gives it his best, but he's just not working with anything to give any kind of performance that's remotely on the same level as Brando did in the previous film. I found it painful to watch De Niro try to imitate Brando. When we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its convincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art direction, are very good. We never see big wide shots of the city block. We see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly moving camera. Coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too far (Probably didn't have the budget to make a huge set of the city), but we get a claustrophobic sensation. The kind of claustrophobic sensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close enough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a sack full of guns. Coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very well. There are some great moments in the flashbacks, but I could have lived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much better film (Possibly better than the original). When Michael finds that his own brother, Fredo (John Cazel), knew about the assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and that he never told Michael about his connection with Hymen Roth and Johnny Ola, it infuriates Michael to the point of no return. He feels as though he loses his family. When he confronts Fredo, he doesn't say much; he's sick of him; Fredo's too stupid to have around, and he can't even look at him. Coppola' direction here is magnificent. Even though its dark and you can't see the reactions of both of the men, they're both in the picture with the light shinning through the windows creating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body language, and the body language tells us everything we need to know.Cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish we got to see more from his character. He's so good in this one scene that it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge part of that is due to him. The words that come out of his mouth are on par with Marlon Brando' speech in, 'On the Waterfront.' All this frustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. He's pleading with his brother. We watch him spill his guts on the table, and admit that he's well aware of being stupid and feeding into that stereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel his pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and callousness of his family. He feels like an outsider, a coward, and a loser. All the while, Michael sits in front of the window looking at the boathouse. He doesn't care what Fredo has to say, which makes it all that more painful to watch for the both of them. Michael wants information from him, and that's it. One feels like an outsider, and one is an outsider. Neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins both of their lives. Fredo wants respect and power. Michael has the power, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he ever cared about: his family. Its one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history.",10,17,26,16 August 2008
The Aviator," The Concurrent Rise and Fall of a Legend
","Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors of his generation. Martin Scorsese is the greatest director of all time. They have made a formidable pair over the years and sometimes I think DiCaprio is miscast for certain roles ('Gangs of New York,' 'The Departed'), but 'The Aviator' has DiCaprio's name all over it. This is one of the best, if not thee best, acting performances I have seen since Robert De Niro in 'Raging Bull.' Both characters have their similarities as well. Jake La Motta had his own inner demons which lead to his paranoia about his wife which ultimately lead to the destruction of the people around him and Howard Hughes' demons are brought front and center as we see where it all starts when he's given a bath at an age where the young Howard should be more than capable to cleaning himself. His mother tells him about all the diseases and makes him spell the word 'quarantine.' In this unsettling opening scene we see where his delusions start. DiCaprio can be hilarious at times and heartbreaking at others. Scorsese and DiCaprio do an incredible job of taking us from the marvel of his genius and innovation in aviation to the destruction of his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). It starts off slow with a few hints here and there that something isn't quite right with Howard Hughes, but gradually we see more and more and more and more and more until we finally see some horrifying acts from Hughes as he locks himself in his projection room playing reels of his films 'The Outlaw' and 'Hell's Angels' over and over and over and over again. These films have been completed and released, but Hughes is still watching. Still looking for these imperfections. He's stuck. He's stuck in his mind and he's stuck in his life and he's stuck in his projection room.There are some very good scenes with Cate Blanchett, who plays Katharine Hepburn, and quite wonderfully I might add, and by wonderfully I mean terribly annoying, loud, and excessive. The damn woman does not shut up. Howard says, 'I could always hear you.' She replies, 'That's 'cause I'm so Goddamn loud.' Yes you are miss Hepburn, yes you are. They have some great scenes together, but the best one comes when Howard meets her entire family and it's quite possibly the greatest dinner sequence I have ever seen. It's beautifully shot as we watch Howard Hughes struggle to keep up with all the conversations going on at the same time due to his deafness. They are extremely rude people and they bully him and then he finally snaps and we feel so good for him. Katherine Hepburn is a completely different person with her family than alone with Howard. Howard accuses her of acting in her real life and wonders if she even knows anymore. This leads to the destruction of their relationship and leads to more paranoia from Howard Hughes as he burns all the cloths that she had infected. He calls Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to tell him to buy him some cloths and then quickly changes the conversation and starts asking him about recorders and asks if he's recording his conversation. This is where Howard Hughes and his paranoia starts to take off.The best part of the film comes in the third act, during a simple and what some may think as a rather uneventful Congressional Hearing. It's two people cross examining each other, what could be so great about that? You would have to see to understand it. Alan Alda is the villain as Senator, Ralph Brewster, who is trying to pass a CAB Bill through the Senate that will put a monopoly on the air ways giving Pan Am sole possession of the sky. Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) had his people create the bill on their behalf to shut out the competition from Hughes' growing airway company- Trans World America- which is expanding across the Atlantic Ocean into Europe. Brewster and Trippe team up to investigate Hughes as they try to embarrass him in public by revealing all his secrets. They order the FBI to raid Hughes' house over and over again causing Howard Hughes to shut himself off from outsiders like nothing you have ever seen before. They threaten to take Hughes down by investigating what he did with the 50 million he received from the government to build plans that ultimately didn't fly during the war. Howard Hughes can simply sell over Trans World America to Juan Trippe and everything will be forgotten to hide him of the public embarrassment. Alda is spectacular and so crafty, always looking for a way to the top, or always getting his way with a smile on his face, just rubbing his arrogance in the face of everybody. During the Congressional Hearings the film reaches it's climax. This is where Hughes tries to overcome his extremely paranoid state and go to these Congressional Hearings and fight for his reputation. The battle that ensues between Alda and DiCaprio is incredible to watch. The final sequences brings us triumph. Only then are we brought right back down as we see Howard Hughes has not progressed in the final scene. It's a brutal ending it the subtlest of ways. The fact that we seen him at the Congressional Hearings gave us hope that he can somehow recover from his paranoid state; that he conquered his fear. Then, we are shot right back down with the final moments of the film capping off an incredible roller-coaster ride of emotions. The final act of the film is what I thought would undoubtedly give Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar, but to my surprise that didn't happen and that's a shame because he is absolutely incredible here. A fan of his or not, you can't deny his greatness in 'The Aviator.' One of Scorsese' best.10/10",7,11,18,15 January 2008
Léon: The Professional," A Shallow, Bloated, Predictable Messianic Film
","'Leon: The Professional' is about a love story intertwined with some ridiculous shootouts. The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. 'The Professional' is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is old like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all. The best thing that came out of this steaming pile of garbage is Gary Oldman. Like everything else, his character is over-the-top, but he seems to be the only that embraces it and goes with it. He is so good as the crazy, classical music loving, DEA agent that's so corrupt he loves taking lives. He actually, loves it. That's insane, right? Completely unfathomable? That's right, it is, but Oldman seems to be the only one in this that takes this film for what it is. Everyone else, Besson the worst, acts as if this is somehow plausible. That's when action films like this can't be enjoyable. When the directors know, the actors know, the writers know, and the audiences know this is all over-the-top and all about action, action, and more action is when films such as 'Leon' are successful. Not like this, though. Not only are the action sequence poorly done, but the stereotypes of cops left and right with their minds on women, or family problems, or the they're just too stupid to do their job is not only ridiculous but tired and stereotypical and unimaginative. Besson does his best to make this feel anything but European. Reno is supposed to be Italian, see the casting director for that screw up, and Tony (Danny Aiello) is an Italian store-owner who does nothing but order people to be killed- And he has Leon kill a lot of people. Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, 'The Godfather.' Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. 'The Last Don' didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it. This takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable. This is simply terrible film-making that also looks outdated.",4,65,157,14 May 2008
Collateral," A Coyote and a Shepherd
","Michael Mann's, 'Collateral,' is similar in many ways to his crime classic, 'Heat.' 'Heat' is a much better film overall because of the way Mann handles his two leads. Pacino and De Niro play the cop versus the bad guy. That's a great character study of a protagonist and an antagonist. He sets both men on opposite sides of the law and shows how similar they are and how different they are, and one wonders if their up bringing influenced their career paths. They both look and act as if they could switch places and be great at each others jobs. Mann keeps the two titans separated for the majority of the film with only two scenes shared together. 'Collateral' brings these two guys, one good and one bad, together from the get- go. This is the driving force of the film and this is a necessity, but it also brings in several plot devices, coincidences, and moments were you might find yourself baffled by some of the reckless or stupid decisions made. Some audiences members will be tested to look past those moments for the moments of suspense, thrills and symbolism. Mann always does a great job of getting exceptional performances from multiple actors in his films and here is no different. Tom Cruise gives a nomination worthy performance. Mark Ruffalo gives the best performance of his less-than-stellar career. Javier Bardem has one scene and he hits it out of the park. Jamie Foxx is a personal favorite of Mann's, but he was miscast for this role. He was average in this role, and in order to make him look the part, they stuck some nerdy glasses on his face, and poof... he's a cab driver. Didn't quite work. He has his moments, but when he's on screen, Tom Cruise is on screen; Javier Bardem is on screen, and those two just hit their performances out of the park and he becomes a body taking up space. Cruise is excellent and surprisingly intense. Michael Mann seems to make films with great dialogue, but its the moments where he goes in close and uses extended shots of his actors eyes as they witness something powerful. Mann will set a scene in the quite or with growing background music, and let the actors emotions pour through their eyes and not a word will be said. The moment in 'Collateral' comes when two coyotes run across the street. Vincent (Cruise) just gets done telling Max (Foxx) how his father died and how he would be beat him after he got drunk. This scene signifies Vincent's loneliness and the coyotes that travel in pairs hunt for other beings. Vincent is the coyote and he's looking for a partner to hunt to with. Since he has no one, he uses cab driver's. He attempts to connect with Max and profess his ideals on life, which changes Max' outlook on life. This is the changing moment of the film. This scene will lead to Max' change. He will then become the shepherd.Even though Mann uses plot devices and relies on coincidences, its the moments of symbolism and suspense and the thrilling nature of man hunting man that spark some moments that will make you think, or put you on the edge of your seat. Mann does an incredible job of building suspense. He does a great job of developing his characters. 'Collateral' offers up some humor; some great acting; a great thriller, and a great lead performance. This is a flawed film and relies on things that can throw reality out of the window, which lessens Mann's direction, but his film accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's an exceptional film that gets better upon repeat viewings.",7,22,34,11 August 2008
No Country for Old Men," Mans Misfortunes Always Leaves a Trail
","'No Country for Old Men' has it all. It's a chase film, but it's also subdued with symbolism and subtly. The acting is top notch and everybody has heard of Javier Bardem' great performance, but I think the real standout comes from Josh Brolin- in a career year- as Llewelyn Moss. Tom Lee Jones gives a powerhouse performance in subtly which only fits the nature and the tone of the film. Kelly McDonald is fantastic as Llewelyn' wife. When those two share a scene we really get a great understanding of their relationship in just a few moments here and there. Woody Haralson will remind you why he's an actor with a very good performance as a bounty hunter.The film starts and ends with Tommy Lee Jones' character, Ed Tom Bell. He has been a Sheriff since he was 25 years old with a history of lawmen dating back to his grandfather. Late in his career and late in life Ed Tom struggles with his past, future and legacy. He always questions whether or not the old timers would be proud of him because he's not proud of himself. He feels as if the world is changing; the violence is changing; man is changing and he can't keep up anymore. He's being passed by, by the younger man much like his dream with his younger father. Ed Tom is slowing down and the people he's chasing are moving faster until they stop and start a fire. Only then does he catch up. Once he get's there he knows he'll face something he doesn't understand and he'll have to put his motto at risk: 'I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand.' The evil he chases is cunning, smart, dark, and almost invisible until the final moments where fate steps in and delivers what's coming.As Bell is the focus of the film, Anton Chigurh, is the driving force in the film. His evil is destructive, it's overwhelming, it's senseless, and it's the fate of a coin toss. Anton' evil is best shown in a gas station scene where he subtly threatens the life of a gas station proprietor. The dialogue in the scene is incredible and it's the Coen' at their best. After the gas station proprietor infuriates Chigurh, because of his stupid questions, Anton decides to let fate step in and settle the dispute in a coin toss. As he crinkles up a candy wrapper, and lets it go, it becomes out of the hands of Chigurh. Fate has stepped in and the coin that has been traveling for 22 years is now here and that will decide whether the man lives or dies. It's his call and its either heads or tails. Chigurh can't call it for him, but he is his fate since he and the coin arrived at the same time. Chigurh simply doesn't care what the result is, but there has to be a result. Another great scene which shows Chigurh' Grim Reaper like evil is where one man watches another man die right in front of him at the hands of Chigurh. The man absurdly asks; 'Are you going to kill me?' and Chigurh turns around and looks right into his eyes with a grin on his face and responds with an absurd question of his own, 'Do you see me?' Moss is a simple man. A Vietnam War veteran. A man with a determination to find a way out of the life he currently inhabits as greed and fortune take over his fate. He tries to run. He tries to get away and live happily ever after and he believes he will even after he is 'immobilized' by a gun shot wound from Chigurh. Like any person, Moss follows mans evil on a hunting trip as he tracks down the blood trail of a wounded dog. He follows the trail back and finds a slaughtering and Mexican Drug deal gone horribly wrong. Moss finds a man in need of water and he tells him he 'ain't got no water.' He smartly figures out there has to be money somewhere and figures one man was left and ran off. So he searches out for the 'last man standing,' leaving the other man dying of thirst. Moss comes to a shade tree and through his eyes we can see a figure next to the tree. He waits for movement, and then he walks to the tree and finds a dead man with a satchel full of money. His fate doesn't involve a coin toss, but rather a satchel full of money and a transponder. This will bring Chigurh to Moss.The films end will leave viewers dissatisfied because the final act of the film is quite different than the first two acts. The final act isn't shot in the vast, empty hot lands of western Texas, but in an urbanized environment in the city. This goes well with the change of Bell' character. The terrain is not his costume. It's not his country. The final act is fast paced unlike the first two. There are no horses. There are more than pistols- machine guns. The violence is no longer shown. It's shown through a spilt milk bowl or Chigurh checking his boots. The violence takes a backstage seat where the first two acts are loaded with violence pushing on excessive. As the film unravels like the candy wrapper, Bell's fate steps in. He goes back to the big crime scene. He sees and knows what's on the other side of that door. He knows he is putting his soul at hazard. He's pushing his chips to the middle of the table and he enters in the face of evil where fate takes over.",10,10,19,28 March 2008
District 9," 'The Fly' meets 'Schindler's List,' but with Aliens
","'District 9' is one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen. The trailers and previews make you think you're going into an alien war with the human race, but very quickly 'District 9' is more about humans controlling aliens and not so much about war, well, for the first half at least. The film opens with a great mockumentary style approach explaining this epic event that took place in 1982 where an Alien aircraft stopped and hovered over a city for three months without moving. What ensues is pretty innovative stuff. Interspecies prostitution, humans understanding the language of the Aliens and vice versa, racial discrimination (Aliens are treated similar to African-Americans in American History) and the sales / trading of illegal weapons. The Aliens (which might be an offensive term) are put into concentration camps similar to actual historical events. We are brought in and around District 9 by the main character, Wikus, who just got a promotion at MNU and has to notify the prawns (the aliens) that they are getting evicted. This has to be done legal, you understand, and they need the prawns signature. It's hard to wrap your head around this liberal government trying to treat these aliens like humans, or at the very least, equals, while humans treat them like the Nazi' treated the Jews or whites treated the blacks during a time of segregation. Once you do that you're left with the main character getting sprayed in the face and making a Seth Brundle ('The Fly') like metamorphosis, and then betraying his country and joining forces with aliens. Pretty corny, pretty cheesy and pretty dull. The first half of the film is mildly good, with an incredible opening sequence, but gradually turns into a dull movie about people you never care for and Aliens you can't possibly care for. 'District 9' goes from innovative to heavily influenced to a standard, brainless shoot 'em up action flick, but with aliens. As I sat and watched the final third of the film (I became very impatient with the film) thinking, 'I don't care. I don't care about anyone. I don't care how this thing turns out. I just don't care.' I was surprised by my reaction because I was mildly blown away by the opening ten minutes of the film.",4,2,4,6 January 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A Legend Born and a Coward Ignored
","'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' says it all, but it has even more than meets the eye. Not only is the title a spoiler, but it sums up the two main characters. JESSE JAMES is in BIG BOLD letters like the legend he is while Robert Ford is hardly noticed underneath his name with the publicly attached 'coward' in front it. The title allows us to sit back and enjoy the journey of Robert Ford in his quest to become famous, and Jesse James' journey into infamy and legendary myth. The film stars Brad Pitt as the notorious Jesse James. Brad Pitt delivers an incredible performance. This may be his crowing achievement along with the character, Tyler Durden, which he played to perfection in 'Fight Club.' He plays Jesse James like he's bipolar so we never know what he's thinking, or what he's capable of doing at any given minute under any given circumstance. One minute he's jovial, and the next he's ripping at Robert Ford's head as he presses a knife to his throat with a demented look in his eyes just screaming of a homicidal maniac. Brad Pitt doesn't play him perfectly and some will notice the infamous Tyler Durden laugh peeking through, but it's a great performance that is thoroughly layered with deep, dark and buried emotions. It is worthy of a nomination at the very least. Jesse James' past and his actions seem to haunt him. Pitt plays a man suffering from a deep and very dark depression as he tries to hide his inner demons with good nature and laughter. Jesse James always knows what's going on. He's very cerebral in his actions. He's like a homicide detective with his carefully intimidating probing of terrified subjects as he looks for answers, but finds nothing but lies. James finds himself all alone surrounded by people that are looking to get paid off by giving him up to the law. He is always on the run and we gradually see him become tired of running and tired of living the way he is. His insomnia keeps him up at all hours as he lives in fear and paranoia. The assassination scene, one of the best scenes in the film, is incredible and shockingly suspenseful, as well as chilling. The pacing in that scene is deliberate and thought provoking, which will leave you thinking about it long after you see it.Casey Affleck plays the 'coward,' Robert Ford. He is surly Oscar worthy here and undoubtedly gives the performance of his lifetime in a career year - 'Gone Baby Gone'. He plays Robert Ford as a weird, meticulous, well intentioned admirer of Jesse James thrust into his inner circle. He's the youngest brother of five boys. He's the weak one. He's the one always made fun of. He's always overlooked or looked down upon. Robert Ford is an uncomfortable person to be around, and Affleck plays him perfectly as a very odd young man with an obsession of Jesse James + the James gang that cross over boundaries of more than just admiration. He wants to be so much apart of that gang that, that's all he has ever wanted since he was a young child reading the fascinating stories of the James gang, and his legendary idol, Jesse James. He wants the fame and the respect that Jesse has, and he wants to be apart of something grand. He wants to know what it feels like to be Jesse James; in his shoes. As he joins the gang he starts to feel the pressure of Jesse James, and his feelings of the man start to change. When Robert Ford is sent to capture and arrest Jesse James that is when Jesse James becomes haunting as he watches his every move, and death seems immanent to both Robert Ford and his brother, Charley (Sam Rockwell). Robert Ford becomes every bit as famous after the murder as James was, then the people stop caring and they start hating. The final act of the film may be the most impressive since we see the kind of backfire stardom can have on you in a celebrity obsessed culture - even in the late 19th century. The journey leading to the assassination and the incredible acting is something to truly admire and become utterly fascinated to watch unfold. The acting was just incredible even with some of the smaller parts, especially, with the lying and conniving, Charley Ford, or the funny, smart and very creepy, Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). The acting on a whole was fantastic and no one upstaged anyone. The four main characters are all fantastic and all very different. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing; this is some of the greatest film has to offer. The scenery is vast and breathtaking. The way some of the images are shot with blurred and distorted edges gives the audience the same feelings of the blurred perceptions between myth and fact. There are several shots through distorted windows giving a blurred outlook on this folklore world that Dominik creates. We never really are sure if something happened this way since the truth has been lost in myth and legend. The set and costume designs were fantastic along with the argot. It feels as if you have been transported back to the late 1880s. It's a slow character study and wonderful cinematic piece of art. The score is both beautiful and haunting matching the tone of the film to perfection. This is one of the decades best films. Andrew Dominik deserves a lot of credit for this masterpiece.",10,16,25,8 February 2008
Gran Torino," Contrived, Stereotypical, Coincidence-Ridden Tragedy
","'Gran Torino' is one of the worst racial bound films I've ever seen. I thought 'Crash' and its heavy-handed symbolism and enormous cast was bad, but 'Gran Torino,' shockingly enough, makes 'Crash' look like a masterpiece. Both have plots that rely on contrived coincidence after contrived coincidence. Both play on stereotypes to nauseating levels. Both have characters overcoming their bigotry to make happy endings. Where 'Torino' truly separates itself from another kind of awful is in the acting and the writing departments. The writer (whose name I wont even look up) has no real views on the different races brought up in the film. He or she simply goes off of all the stereotypes he or she is aware of. It's so bad that we get racial slurs dominating prolonged statements from the cast members-- mostly coming from Eastwood. I don't know how many times I heard the term, 'Zipperhead.' The problem with 'Crash' is that you had people talking in politically correct racism. They didn't bother to use racial slurs, which made the authenticity of the characters bigotry feel artificial. Those actors felt very restricted. Almost as if they didn't want to be too racist-- it didn't help that the writer / director was preachy and overbearing. Eastwoods character, however, uses so many slurs, so often, that is makes his characters bigotry also seem fake and artificial. It became laughable. And just to make sure they weren't picking on just the 'Spook's' and *beep* they also slurred the 'Mick's,' 'Polak's' and 'Dago's' I'm sure the writer didn't want to come off as too racist, so he threw everyone under the bus. All these characters, with the lone exception of Walt (Eastwood), are cookie cut-outs that have no depth and provide no cultural impact to the film (even though one character explains the actions and the values of her ancestry). The ensemble cast is amongst the worst in film history. The casting director should be shot in the face. The acting from pretty much every supporting role is bordering on horrendous if not well beyond horrendous. These actors are just inexperienced and way over their heads. Some of these young actors can't even say their routine lines with any sense of rhythm, then you ask them to have an emotional breakdown? Not happening. Eastwood is bad. Don't buy into the hype. Much like De Niro and Pacino playing cops in 'Rghteous Kill,' Eastwood is just twenty-five to thirty years too old to play this part. His constant scowling and groaning under his breath becomes tiresome and it feels lazy. This is one of his worst performances of his career, and the guy has never been much of an actor to begin with. I felt his character had absolutely no depth to speak of. His character is actually the only thing that's fairly well written, but Eastwood leaves his performance on the page. He shows no range with this character. He never does anything in the movie but scowl and then put someone down. Well, he has a few bright spots with the young kid. This was a big missed opportunity for an actor in their 50s that fit the part to give a truly great performance. The two brights spots, Christopher Carley (the Father) and Brian Haley (Mitch), give the two best performances. The films premise actually makes for, what-could-have-been, a solid film. It has a great story with an excellent arc in the hero and a great ending. The ending is very good, and is the only thing in the film getting this any stars or credit. The ending is the reason why this film is getting praised by critics and completely overblown. I have no idea why they're calling Eastwood good, because he's embarrassingly bad. The Dirty Harry days are over. It just goes to show that people still love redemptive endings no matter how awful the rest of the film is.",5,16,34,2 January 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," An Epic Film Too Ambitious for its Own Good.
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' is set in the year 2001 and the main character is HAL. HAL is a computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064 a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep. The film starts with nothing but a pitch black screen for well over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is 'The Dawn of Man' sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world? During 'The Dawn of Man' sequence, out of no where, a huge rectangular block comes from out of the ground, from the sky, we'll never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it's there. The monkeys go apesh!t once they find this huge rectangular block that only man could have made, but that's the catch man hasn't evolved yet. So, who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group. Why? Because they have used their mind to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly, smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole.We quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe. And for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is, however, atrocious. There are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for, what feels like, an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about. For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. The spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Me neither, but that's what the future looks like in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors, and they're oddly shaped because we all know, in the future, we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs. The computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the TV sets look like they're from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, 'Well, that's how you would think it looks.' No, I wouldn't. Just like I wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now, set 30 years in time, and had a talking, self thinking computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with '2001'. HAL is the liveliest person- shoot I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in this film. And HAL actually thinks he's alive. He sees humans as his maintenance men who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL 'reads' the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank and he 'sees' that they are planning to turn him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters- An ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into a bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama!! Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity. Dave proceeds to terminate HAL. HAL pleads for his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. If the scene was shortened I think it could have been truly incredible. The final act is just as tedious as the first two. The huge block that the Apes found appears again at the end. It comes out of nowhere... again. Then, an infant is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to an infant? Is man evolving again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of whatever that alien looking thing is? Maybe I'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about it the more the beginning and the ending make sense. There are a few questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the blocks, but if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought. The film moves at a snail's pace. The first act and the third acts are fairly strong, but the second act meanders around, hovering in one place for what seems like eternity. There is some intriguing ideas in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance. And for that, it finds some level of profound greatness.",7,13,29,29 April 2008
A Clockwork Orange," A Messianic, Discombobulated Ideology Only Conceivable in a Distantly Distorted Future
","'A Clockwork Orange' starts at a 'Milk Bar' where they drink 'Milk Plus.' I don't know what it's in the milk as Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) narrates the contents of it and it sounds like he's talking in a different language, but it's intoxicating nevertheless. This is their prep work. Going to the bar sets the mood and the mind. After this, the 'droogs,' come across an old 'filthy' man- a homeless man- who's drinking and singing away. Once Alex jams some night stick looking weapon into the hobos stomach, the hobo, goes on to preach about the state of the world and tells the gang to 'do him in' as he rambles about the violence crisis the world is facing and its 'lawless' lands. It was terrible acting from the hobo and terrible dialogue, or should I say, terrible preaching. This scene, as ineffective as it may be, sets the tone and basic underlying theme of the rest of the film. The government has lost control. The gang then proceeds to beat the hobo with chains and canes. This is not the end of a night out on the town. The droogs talk their way into a house and the woman opens the door. The gang quickly rushes in and bounds the husband and wife. Alex then rapes the wife as he sings 'Singin in the Rain.' The helpless husband watches in horror. The act is funny in which it's presented in satire form. The singing done by Alex during his rape almost diverts the attention of what's really happening. The goofiness of the gang and the way they talk, walk, and act becomes more funny than horrifying. This satire will muster up some laughs and the acting of Malcolm McDowell is extraordinary, but the direction of Kubrick is heinous. The supporting performances around McDowell are horrid, over the top, and uncontrolled.The major theme is when the government backs a testing program, which forces its patients to take a shot that gives them a sickening feeling as they watch horrible acts of violence against their will. This gives the patients the feeling of never wanting to resort to violence again. Alex couldn't resist women, which is the reason why he raped them. If he wanted something, it was there for the taking. Alex is tested and the treatment worked!!!! This little twist takes away the freedom to choose- even if you chose to be a rapist.Once Alex has no free will the plot thickens. It thickens so much Kubrick get's lost in what he wants to say, but he knows one thing: Alex is the only thing that's normal and Alex signifies the criminal world. The criminal world is normal? Lw-abiding citizens are distorted and abnormal? Intereting idea Kubrick. Interesting idea. The testing now forces Alex into becoming a non-offensive person. He can't chose what he wants. When aggravated he can't fight back. 'Violence is a very horrible thing. You're learning that now. Your body is learning it.' The body learns it, but the mind loses all control. To make matters worse, when he's released for being cured, he becomes homeless and finds his parents have rented out his room to a stranger. Alex is shown no support from his parents. Ah, the life of a released criminal. Society labels poor old Alex improperly even though he's been rehabilitated (You can wipe away the tears. Kubrick would appreciate that). They care more about this new son than Alex. 'A Clockwork Orange' makes the point that: when criminals are released the world changes so much that society won't allow them to conform, creating no options. Once again, this is the governments problem, you see. Alex becomes homeless and with no place to go, he wanders around. He can't go back to his old lifestyle because, once again, the government takes that right away too. Alex has no place to go because when you've been gone so long society won't allow you to conform, and since the government took his freedom of choice away; he can't make a living for himself the way he once did. Alex runs into familiar faces that now take advantage of him and since he's cured we're supposed to feel sorry for him. The victims now get their revenge. As the scope of the second act and the third act widen, Alex becomes the victim and everyone else he's ever harmed, as well as the government, have taken away his free will. Now all the innocent people are the evil-doers and bad guys that we should hate. Alex fins himself on the opposite end of the spectrum. They're the bad guys now and Alex is the good guy. 'Government is Murderer.' Once some very bad things happen to Alex it makes news when he's hospitalized. He undergoes some more treatment done by the same government in attempt to hide the public shame of the experiment gone wrong. After more experimenting with Alex' brain, we see a much different Alex than in the previous act. We see the old Alex: Unfiltered and very much the same. In the end there's no great message. There's no solution to the problems presented. It's just a glorifying look at violence and blaming the government for abusing their power and using criminals as animals to test, manipulate, and ruin. In the end, you'll get the feeling that the director wants you to be happy for Alex. Why should you be happy? Because he can now go back to his antics that we seen in the first 30 minutes as he dreams of a rape, and says, 'I've been cured, all right.' Congratulations Alex. You're cured. We're all so happy for you. Now, go out and rape somebody. Make Mr. Kubrick proud.",6,9,17,1 May 2008
Pulp Fiction," Violence and Redemption Underscore 'Pulp Fiction'
","'Pulp Fiction' is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, 'Pulp Fiction' has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between 'Pumpkin' and 'Honey Bunny' as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of 'Pulp Fiction.' Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with 'The Bonnie Situation.' The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, 'Reservoir Dogs,' and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of 'Pulp Fiction' has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in 'Reservoir Dogs' you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is 'The Gold Watch' section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his 'Die Hard' facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. 'The Gold Watch' has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. 'The Bonnie Situation' may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet 'The Wolf' (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally 'shot Marvin the face.' 'The Bonnie Situation' offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he 'walks the earth.' Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing 'Pumpkin' (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be 'Pumpkin' and 'Honey Bunny's' last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways.",9,20,45,16 August 2008
The Da Vinci Code," 'The Da Vinci Code' Suffers from a Repetitive Narrative
","'The Da Vinci Code' is the third film Ron Howard has directed since his masterpiece 'A Beautiful Mind.' Howard makes no mistake about crossing over to his roots and implementing techniques similar in his Oscar winning film. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is much like John Nash (Russell Crowe) with one big difference; Langdon has no psychological problems that nearly ruin his everyday life and the people around him making him far less sympathetic. Langdon has a phenomenal ability to break codes. He's, supposedly, merely a master of symbols, but when some random guy he's never met writes something that is incredibly insignificant to his life, Langdon cannot only figure out that it's an anagram, but he can break it in a matter of seconds. Who ever said stupid people go to Harvard? This Langdon is a genius and he figures out anything even though he's put in a situation he has never prepared for and is completely new to. As he cracks the codes, Howard uses the same highlighting techniques to show us what he's looking at as he did with John Nash who looked at a bunch of numbers and found a strategic pattern sequence, proving to be 'the best natural code breaker I ever saw.' Well that guy hasn't met Robert Langdon. This guy is so good at breaking codes he can figure out somethings in code in the first place.'The Da Vinci Code' has potential, but it's also extremely ambitious. Where 'The Da Vinci Code' struggles is not only with the thrilling chase of finding the truth and the hunting of people who try to expose them, but for the fact that it tries to come off as realistic when it's utterly unrealistic as it relies on a barrage of coincidences and false interpretations of history. 'The Da Vinci Code,' surprisingly, becomes boring two hours into the film as the quest of Langdon feels unrelenting. We feel the film has come to a rest once we find out the big secret that isn't all that impressive or shocking, but it keeps going and going and going. Not only is it repetitive, but it's long, drawn out, with one chase after another and one guy popping up after another. After about an hour it gets to the point where the entire country is chasing Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu, who somehow always seem to slip past these dumb, bozo-looking cops. In certain parts it becomes extremely ridiculous. For a long two and half hours Langdon and Neveu discover something, then are nearly captured (Sometimes getting caught and pulling a James Bond, and escaping capture), then finding a hiding place to talk about the discovery they found before nearly getting killed. This same act happens about four times. That's the plot for the first 2 hours and 20 minutes. Discovery, chase, escape, talk about discovery, then discover something else, and repeat. Since they never get caught, we get the feeling that they will always trick out, step aside, and out smart the clumsy nation that is after them. This is not at all thrilling and the endless talking is going to put people to sleep even if this stuff is pretty interesting. Some may argue it's not supposed to be taken seriously, but it doesn't come off as fantasy. It comes off as a fantasy trying to be realistic.The best parts of 'The Da Vinci Code' come from the style, the smart source material, and some of the performances (most notably, Paul Bettany who also popped up in 'A Beautiful Mind' and gave a very strong performance there). Bettany is incredible and delivers one of the best acting performances of the year as the tortured Silas. Silas, is the man doing Gods will. He's unknowingly killing people for the wrong reasons, but because his church saved him he believes he's doing good. He believes and trust them so much because they reached out to him when no one else would. He even inflicts pain upon himself to serve penance for all things he does for the greater good. He's a mislead soul, lost within the corruption of the powerful. He plays this role to perfection that could have easily gone over the top. He plays it with the perfect balance as he's not too restrained where he's not believable and not too far over the top where he's laughable. Too bad Tom Hanks' mullet is incredibly distracting and the furthest thing I think of when thinking of a Harvard scholar. Hanks is merely average here. The look, style, and cinematography are truly mesmerizing. The flashback sequences are phenomenal and the art direction is on an Academy Award worthy level. There are many different locations in many different cities across many centuries and the look every time has its own feel that adds to the film. The source material is smart and dumb at the same time. There are some historical inaccuracies, but it's a mildly well written script with a lot of great myth and mystery. The material is both a strength and its greatest weakness. There's quite a bit in Ron Howard's film, 'The Da Vinci Code,' to like, but there's also a lot to hate. A lot more.",4,6,13,19 May 2008
The Departed," Masking Good and Evil
","The 2006 Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese has brought us some of the greatest films of all time to American Cinema and stands as one of the greatest directors to ever live. With films like 'Raging Bull,' 'Taxi Driver,' Goodfellas,' and more recently 'The Aviator' and 'Gangs of New York.' Marty now has the best film of 2006 to add to that list of greats with 'The Departed.' 'When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?' This is coldly and meticulously uttered by Boston Mob Boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The significance of the memorable quote tells us that no matter who you are or what you've done; when death is staring you in the face, it takes no prisoners. Costello says this to a group of young impressionable kids and among these impressionable kids is Frank Costello's next and future pawn- the wise, savvy, charismatic, charming, and slick talking Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, who gives his best acting performance of his career on the heels of another great performance in Robert De Niro's, 'The Good Shepherd'. From the start we see Colin headed down a path of corruption and deception as he is groomed to become a spy in the Massachusetts State Police for Frank Costello and his Boston mafia. His counterpart, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a cadet who has been kicked out of the academy and the only way he will ever be able to serve the commonwealth is by going undercover and infiltrating Frank Costello's crew for Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen). Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are the only two people that know Billy is a cop. Academy Award nominee, Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the fast talking, always ready for anything, humorous cop that will make you think this is a comedy at certain points in the film instead of a thrilling drama. Dignam can be cold, callous, and most of all, a dirty cop like the rat he hunts for in SIU.As Billy and Colin rise in their respective fields, the tension mounts as suspicion in both the State Police and Costello's crew heats up in search for the rat(s). There are twists and turns in every direction. As they become more and more aware of each others presence the anticipation becomes almost unbearable as both look to find each other and take each other out to protect their own skins.The film brings in plot twist after plot twist and manages to maintain its structure thanks to a perfect script by Academy Award winner, William Monahan. The two opposing figures in the film- Colin and Billy- frantically search and scheme their way to the top all the while sharing a sexual relationship with a psychiatrist, named Madolyn. Both characters fall for her and both unknowingly become twisted in a love triangle that only she knows about, but has no clue how grave her situation is. The motives for each falling in love with the psychiatrist is something to pay close attention to. Look for the reasons Colin wants a girl, and look for the reasons Billy wants a girl. One is putting on an act at all times, and both men struggle to keep their identity in check.Costello puts fear in the heart of both Billy and Colin as he starts to question everyone around him as the heat is turned up on him. Jack Nicholson gives one of his greatest performances of his career, and an Oscar worthy one at that. The psychological fear and mind games that he plays with both Colin and Billy make them fear that their conscience might be getting the best of them. This is something to truly admire and become utterly stunned by as both actors do such a great job of portraying the paranoia. Costello is not your typical gang leader. He is upper class with a little L Street mentality still left in him. He like's to go and listen to the opera. He loves fine wines and lobster dinners (with a side of bloody hand that could make anyone queasy- especially the nervous wreck that is Billy Costigan.). He also doesn't mind indulging in a little annoying fly, that may be crossing his face at the wrong time, or even a little coke to set the mood so that he's comfortably numb. He has his flaws as every man does, but Frank doesn't recognize any weaknesses because he's just so good at making a habit of getting away with murder. The very deep characters surrounding Costello, along with Costello himself, make this a 'must see.' We watch the drama unfold as the pressure on both Colin and Billy mounts as their guilt of deception and criminal activity makes both men start looking for a safe way out. They realize they both can only take so much and neither sees a way out that doesn't result in death. Colin wants to become a political influence in the community as he goes to law school at nights while Billy just wants his identity back. Neither are able to depart from Costello as he has a strangle hold on their every day lives. This is where we see the characters become three-dimensional and where we start to gravitate towards the characters- good or bad. We see what they are and how far they've fallen. Their weaknesses make them so humane that it's impossible to not feel or root for them.As the body count rises and the pressure is turned up one notch at a time before the final standoff the film becomes mesmerizing. The shocking and surprising ending will leave some pleasantly surprised or some looking for answers and disappointed. For most directors this would be their crowning achievement, but for Martin Scorsese, it just another classic to add the resume.",7,9,16,13 August 2007
War of the Worlds," Flaws Galore, but a Visceral Experience with Great Suspense
","Even though 'War of the Worlds' isn't a great film, after the first thirty minutes, the film is so damn tense and suspenseful I can't help but give this a solid recommendation even though it has quite a bit of flaws. The images and CGI are simply incredible and as good as special effects film-making can get. 'War of the Worlds' really is nothing more than a purely survival narrative with little character development, which isn't too much of problem for me given the setting and everything that's going on. The ending was meh... a little pretentious and quite abrupt, but some of the scenes work so well, especially the scenes where Cruise and Fanning are stuck in the basement and the aliens are probing the area and there's this very long, prolonged search of the area, which takes this film to an extremely high level of film-making. It had me on the edge of my seat. The last ten minutes of the film is excessively rushed and quite bad, especially in comparison to previous hour and half, which is near perfection. The family waiting at the steps? They looked like they just had their morning tea and facial. Not a scratch or misplaced hair on their head. Just perms and smiles. I did recognize a bunch of head scratchers... like video cameras working, but nothing else, not even a wrist watch... people stopping and starring when something completely monstrous is coming out of the ground and ripping up the road underneath them, and a slew of others I wont mention so I don't ruin my own experience thinking about all the problematic areas of the film instead avoiding all the great aspects. The one glaring problem I have with it is the fact that everyone you think is going to live does. It tries to be too much of a crowd pleaser instead of the dark attack on the world it supposedly wants to be. It's way too optimistic with too much of a perfect little ending. 'War of the Worlds' wasn't nearly dark enough for me in the final moments. Sci-fi is not my genre, but I really enjoyed so much of it that I can ignore some of the corny coincidences and generally forgettable acting from Cruise. The more you inspect the film, the more problems you'll find, but they're mostly in the opening and the ending moments. The majority of the film is taut and masterful film-making. As usual, a technically brilliant film from Spielberg, if nothing else.",6,1,3,24 August 2009
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Vengeance
","'There Will Be Blood' is an instant classic, very much in the mold in of 'Citizen Kane,' but much more effective. This is one of, writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson' finest achievements and is certainly in the discussion for his best work along with 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia.' P.T. Anderson is quickly rising as this generation's best director and maybe the greatest visionary film has ever seen. On a technical level, 'There Will Be Blood,' is near perfection and may end up near the top of AFI' 100 greatest films list in another 20 years or so. The Cinematography is gorgeous. The score is incredible- sometimes a little overused. The acting is great, lead by one of the best of year- see Viggo Mortensen of 'Eastern Promises' if you want to see a performance that rivals one of this magnitude. Paul Dano was, however, over the top and just couldn't match up with Lewis as he was outclassed and out performed, but some of the smaller roles were played with incredible realism and felt completely genuine. The direction is flawless. The art direction will put you back in the late 1800s on through the late 1920s. The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis will the thing that's remembered for years to come as he now owns title to two of the greatest acting performances of the 21st century ('Gangs of New York'). Like, 'Gangs,' 'There Will Be Blood' is powered by Lewis as it's lead by Daniel Plainview, played magnificently by one of the best actors cinema has ever seen as he carries this ambitious film. Without this incredible performance to lean on 'There Will Be Blood' just can't hold up to what it sets out to do. As we watch the development of Daniel Plainview and his hatred culminate we quickly realize just how deadly Plainview becomes. Where there's oil there's greed, and where there's greed there's disputes, and where there's disputes there's blood, and there will be blood. The greed in this film is saturated through the characters with one after another looking for money. Oil is the source of money and no one can get at it except for Daniel, so his greed is going to come into conflict with the spectators greed, who all wants a piece of the proverbial pie.The best scene in the film is the big gusher scene and it's also the turning point in the film. The cinematography in this five minute scene alone is worth a nomination and the score will sing your ears as the fire will sing your eyes. After years of drilling for oil, Plainview becomes powerful, but not as powerful as he will or dreams of becoming. The big gusher represents Plainview's boiling greed and once the ocean of boiling oil erupts, Plainview, is overcome with the prospect of making so much money that he could move away from everyone and live in a mansion, away from 'these people.' He hates most people and he doesn't see anything worth liking when he looks at people. Everyone that crosses his path is just another spectator getting in the way and taking the money that he has rights to. He does all the work- the drilling, he does all the finding, and he leases all the land so he should get all the money. This is how this works, you see. When his adopted son H.W. goes deaf from the blast of the big gusher, Daniel, no longer knows of any way to talk to him. When his partner asks him, 'How's H.W.' as Daniel is mesmerized by the fire and the ocean of oil under his feet and the kind of money he can make- the real money- he uncaringly says he's 'not good.' Then, just like that, H.W. becomes a burden instead of cute face to help him buy land. H.W. is a tool in Daniel's eyes. Everyone is a tool. Just like a pickaxe or a drill, people are tools, and Daniel uses those tools to get what he wants, but when they start acting like people instead of tools is when we have big problems. H.W. just gets in the way like everyone else and the love and bond of a father and son seem to take a back seat to greed and competition.Daniel sends H.W. off to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. While he's away his brother Henry is the next in line of spectators getting in the way. And Eli Sunday as well, the evangelical preacher for the Church of The Third Revelation. Paul Dano plays Eli, and his twin brother Paul Sunday, and get's into dirty business to provide for his church so he can preach to a bigger congregation. Sunday becomes immersed in his own greed and eventually finds himself corrupt and looking for help from his 'brother Daniel' who doesn't exactly see himself as his brother. Greed and power sit atop the focal points of the film in regards to self examination. Sometimes you have to take a look at the ugly side of yourself. Some may question their actions as they try to change and some continue those actions without remorse. Daniel's plunge into madness is dark and prolonged and gradually alcohol and hate become the driving force in his life. As Daniel plunges into the never ending abyss we see that his hate knows no boundaries and he will hate anyone and turn on everyone. You'll come away questioning if he loved or cared for anyone. As Daniel comes to a point in his life where he wants to be: Alone and on top with his rivals drowning in a pool of their own blood. Whether he eats someone or isolates himself from people, he succeeds in whatever he does.",10,10,18,16 April 2008
The Good Shepherd," Edward Wilson Shepherds the Citizens of America
","'The Good Shepherd' is my second best film of 2006. A lot of people who have seen it will think differently and I can understand that. This film is not for everyone, but the viewers who have a love for US History, The Cold War, CIA, Espionage, or Spy films should be pleased with 'The Good Shepherd.' It is very subtle, but extremely effective. 'The Good Shepherd' is told from a series of flashbacks during a two week mission to find the significance of a document that was sent to the house of Edward Wilson by an anonymous person(s). We see the rise of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) from his ranks as a Skull and Bones member to the head of the Counter Intelligence section of CIA.Robert De Niro directs this epic, near-masterpiece, of the creation of CIA through one mans eyes, Edward Wilson. Matt Damon gives a great performance and one of his best along with 'The Departed' and 'Good Will Hunting.' Damon plays Edward Wilson who starts off as a Yale graduate and Skull and Bones member. He is recruited by an FBI Agent (Alec Baldwin) to spy on his poetry professor Dr. Fredrick's (Michael Gambon), who is believed to have set up a Nazi organization and is enlisting students and faculty members. Edward agrees to spy on his professor after some talking into and gets the names of the people Dr. Fredrick's has enlisted, which leads to his firing on the basis of his political beliefs.On Deer Island (Skull and Bones retreat) he meets Margaret 'Clover' Russell (Angelina Jolie) who seeks out Edward immediately and finds something about him quite intriguing. Matt Damon plays 'the man made out of stone' giving little to no emotional reaction to anything and just about everything. Edward Wilson is a man of few words, but he chooses wisely what few words he speaks.Edward Wilson falls in love with Laura, played wonderfully by Tammy Blanchard- a deaf women- but their relationship comes to an abrupt end as Edward finds that Margaret has become pregnant with his child and Edward is to do what is expected of him. This means he will have to leave Laura and marry Clover. A week after their marriage Edward has to go overseas during WWII, mostly working out of Germany, but is sent to London and joins the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), by General Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro).After the war Germany is crumbling and Edward Wilson is climbing the ranks garnering more and more trust. The Soviets are now looking to acquire as many scientists as possible. In Berlin, Edward Wilson meets his adversary, codename 'Ulysses,' and the back and forth battle between Wilson (His codename is 'Mother') and Ulysses is something to really behold and some of the best scenes in the film take part during their back and forth battle of disinformation and counter intelligence and deception and infiltration of spies sent into one another's operations and then each adversary takes out these spies, then sends the 'message' that these spies were found and disposed of. Was that confusing? Neither seems to gain much of any ground on each other until the end of the film where Ulysses sends a spy into Wilson's Agency and get's valuable information from someone very close to Edward Wilson. This information ruins the 'Bay of Pigs' invasion which turns out to be a costly loss and damaging defeat. Wilson has to make a tough decision between his family and his country.Edward Wilson was a man of selflessness who put his entire life into his country and did what he could do with his son. He makes sacrifices for his country and for his son. He sacrifices his time and relationship with his family for his country. He sacrifices his true love with Laura and marries Margaret for his son. If you were going to sum up Edward Wilson it probably would be best to use the term 'selfless.' Everything he does is for his country and the future of it. We never see him do much of anything for his own personal joy. This kind of behavior leads to a marriage that crumbles and falls apart. He plays the protector and is forced to do things such as have people killed and interrogated for the greater good. All over an idea- Communism. I loved it. It may take a few viewings to fully understand the complexities of this film, but it is well worth it and an intense film with some great action and conversation throughout the film. 9.7/10",6,15,21,27 December 2007
Raging Bull," A Poetic Masterpiece for the Ages
","Martin Scorsese' 'Raging Bull' stands as one of the greatest films of all time. Its the greatest work of Martin Scorsese' career and Robert De Niro's greatest acting performance. This film stands atop my all time list. Robert De Niro's performance is also the best and most authentic acting performance I have ever seen. What a transformation it is to watch him become middleweight boxer Jake La Matta in this true story of more than just boxing. It's a film of one mans decent into misery and loss. The film will stand the test of time because it's realness and its captivating look is purely mesmerizing, astonishing, and jaw dropping.Right from the start we are punched in the face as Jake La Matta is eating dinner. The ordinary dinner scene turns into a husband and wife fight like nothing you have ever seen. All over an over cooked stake that isn't ready for eating. Right from the start we see that Jake La Matta is a tormented and troubled man with serious issues ranging from paranoia to insanity to inadequacy to emotional instability to reckless abandon to raging anger. La Matta is a complex character that is brought to us in a riveting performance from one of films all time greats. Throughout the film we see La Matta battle his inner demons as he's always in a 12 round bout with himself. His emotional pain is relentless and his physical pain pails in comparison. He's always trying to prove himself, not to anyone around him, but his own demons and inner pains. His brother Joey (Joe Pesci) tries to manage Jake to a title shot, but that is nearly impossible thanks to Jake's relentless and constant problems that he causes. In a highly memorable 'Hit Me' scene following the dinner fight; Joey is ordered, then demanded, to punch his brother in the face by Jake himself. Joey after some talking into, starts beating on Jakes face until his cuts- from his previous fight- start to bleed and crack open. What is the purpose Joey asks. Jake responds with a smile and a playful pinch on the cheek. Right from the start we see that Jake has no purpose. All he has is pain. It would hurt too much to stop it so he takes it.As Jake climbs up the boxing ranks his tormented life and his inner demons start to take a toll on not only him but everyone around him. His life style mirrors his fighting style. Jake La Matta' fighting style is just like his personality. There's no technique or any strategy given to him by his corner. He uses outside forces to take out his opponent inside the ring and the inside forces take out the people outside the ring that he loves. He is relationship impaired and knows of no way to deal with women(or with anybody for that matter).Some of Scorsese' greatest moments come during the boxing scenes. We hear the cringing cat cries and exploding light bulbs and we feel the brutality even though we may not even understand what we're hearing. In a fight with the 'good-looking' Janrio, Jake is a large imposing animal taking out all his frustrations on the face of Janrio. He makes him ugly and pierces a hole right through his wife (Cathy Moriarty) who called Janiro 'good-looking.' Then as his career starts to unfold due to his misery and paranoia. He looses the belt, then he looses himself.After Jake retires from boxing a weight has been lifted off his shoulders- but physically a weight has been added. Now he doesn't have any responsibilities and he no longer has to worry about his weight, which fluctuates in the film and by films end; De Niro gains 60 pounds. Without any worries or responsibilities, La Matta is still incapable of being happy. He looses everything that he has ever fought for and in a brutally emotional scene at the end of the film where La Matta finds himself in jail; we actually sympathize for his character. We wish he did right, but he never does. Something appeals to us, maybe we see some good in him even though it never shows through. Maybe we want some good in him because it never shows through. Maybe we see how troubled he is and we just want to see some happiness in his life. The dark scene is shot in perfection and Jake takes his past regrets out on his jail cell's cement wall. Jake lets out a fury of punches and head butts, but not even this bull has a punchers chance in hell. After his cries of 'Why! Why! Why!' go unanswered. All he has is his 10X10 Miami jail cell to sit and stew in. Completely in the dark, Scorsese' final touches bring us into the cell as Jake breaks down emotionally. We see no remorse as he doesn't see himself as the bad guy that everyone says he is. He believes he's just a troubled man not wanting to hurt anyone. The worst part of it all is: He doesn't think he has hurt anyone; when all we see is that's all he's ever done- is hurt the ones he loves. There are no apologies. He has no acknowledgment of anything he's ever done being wrong, which is truly heartbreaking, because it looks as though he will never change. A brutally honest portrait of an animal. 10/10",10,11,21,11 August 2007
La Vie En Rose," Stunning Performance from Cotillard
","With any biopic, the film will either be successful or it wont based solely on the quality of the lead performance. It will either be good or bad just on the acting alone. How great it is depends on other aspects, but 'La Vie en Rose' is a showcasing of one of the most powerful female performances ever seen. Marion Cotillard is dazzling, heartbreaking, full of life, hate, self destruction and many other things. Cotillard gives as good a physical performance as she does an emotional one. She doesn't try to make this flawed human being likable. At some points in the film, I couldn't stand her. I couldn't believe the way she treated people. The way she acted. But, by the end, I was in love with her voice. Her regrets. Her accomplishments. Her flaws. She wasn't perfect. Her upbringing was painful. But her life... extraordinary. Cotillard gives the performance of a life time. This truly is one of the most impressive performance ever given, male or female.",5,2,3,13 January 2009
The Godfather," An Epic, Masterful Look into the Underground World
","'The Godfather' simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching 'The Godfather,' is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, 'That's my family, Kay. That's not me.' We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, 'Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.'That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, 'It's strictly business' when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a 'cold hearted bastard' at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like 'The Godfather,' that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.",10,109,148,29 June 2008
