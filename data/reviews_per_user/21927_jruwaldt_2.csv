The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst films of all time
","This is undoubtedly one of the worst films of all time. The characters are totally unsympathetic, not to mention they're complete idiots. I wasn't frightened. I wasn't even amused, which can save some horror films. Maybe I'm lacking just a little in imagination, but my girlfriend, who had plenty of imagination, was equally disgusted with the film. The acting was horrendous, the script idiotic, and the plot nonexistent. I have never detested a film as much as this one, although Clerks did come close. I definitely rate it a zero, since it seems to have no endearing qualities, whether in technique or entertainment value.",1,19,38,19 December 2000
Contact," Entertaining
","I don't usually go much for films that get into religious/philosophical concepts, but this one was fascinating nevertheless. The idea that another civilization might contact ours as a result of our telecommunications is wonderful.There were also some nice touches in the film. My favorite is a charming allusion to the star Vega, which features so prominently. When everyone's communing in the desert, among them are the Vega Car Club of Southern California. Perfect, especially since the Vega is such a forgotten vehicle these days, with very few left running. Not that it was a very good car, but I suppose it was a decent small car, reasonably priced. At any rate, this was very amusing, and it was such a blast from the past.",7,0,2,24 June 2005
