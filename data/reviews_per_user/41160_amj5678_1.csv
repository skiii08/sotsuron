First Man," Give it a chance
","I have no idea how people score this as a one star. I may have scored a point higher out of spite by all of the 'flag planting ' crap that people made into an issue, but my god what a beautiful movie. I would imagine that if you looked at all the one star reviewers they probably scored movies like 'White House Down and Mortal Kombat' a nine or ten. Do yourself a favor, go see a showing and take it in for what it is, and if you don't like it, maybe give it a fair rating, not a one because you believe the director 'hates' America.",8,1,3,17 October 2018
