The King's Speech," Good but not great
","Good things about this film: Colin Firth's acting, the underplayed emotion, the occasional humour, being based on a true story.Thinhgs I didn't enjoy: the slow pace, the long close-ups, Helena Bonham Carter's performance (no offence to the lady herself, I just couldn't reconcile her with my memories of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother), and the (all too usual) portrayal of senior churchmen as either incompetent or self-serving. I also found some of the supporting cast one-dimensional: Churchill presented views that hindsight says he should have had, rather than those he actually held at the time; the King's daughters were presented as fresh-faced kids, with no hint of the forces or pressures that would shape their future destinies; and Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife had very little to do.In summary: if your job, or someone you know, is connected with therapy, you'll love it. If you're a big fan of everything about royalty, you'll also lap it up. If you're a serious history buff, you'll only be slightly impressed. If you like fast moving action films rather than emotional stories, don't bother.",7,0,1,2 February 2011
The Expendables 2," If you like clichés, you'll be back
","(minor spoilers only) With a body count in the hundreds, pretty much every action film script cliché, and lots of explosions, the Expendables 2 has the virtue of giving action film fans what they expect. It also attempts some wry humour, from the Terminator cracks that appear every time Schwarzenegger does to the jokes about women who can't shoot straight. I'm not going to score it highly, though, because the sheer unreality of it all grates. Five guys can kill hundreds of armed men -- sometimes with unarmed combat -- with hardly a scratch? And why is it that the squirts of blood from those who have been shot are always in the same pattern, no matter where they are hit? Maybe I'm just getting old ... like The Expendables themselves, and I do have to give Stallone in particular credit for playing his part (and his age) to the hilt. (Literally ;->)",6,0,5,24 August 2012
The Hangover," If you liked Three Men and a Baby, DO NOT watch this
","I read a review in USA Today comparing this movie with 'Three Men and a Baby'. Hey, I thought, I liked 3 men and a baby, I'll go to see this.BIIIIG mistake. You have to look very, very hard for similarities between those two films. This was much more in the style of 'Road Trip', or for those old enough to remember them, the 'American Pie' films.I have to say, the acting was pretty good. Some of the characters are intended to be unlikeable, and boy did I dislike them. Trouble was, I found I had almost no interest in whether they succeeded or failed in their mission. And the events that unfolded in the film were meant to be increasingly outrageous, but I just found them increasingly beyond belief. Forget about the baby. This is about three men being juvenile. The so-called humour comes in watching them suffer. Ha-ha-not.",1,11,23,20 June 2009
United 93," Warning: This film can be gut-wrenching in both senses
","OK ... so how does a film about an essentially American tragedy play in Britain? I think 'good but not great' is the answer. No-one seemed to come out of the cinema sniffing or crying ... but a few stayed rooted to their seats, immobile, as the credits began to roll.This is a good film. Its biggest advantage is its fairness ... all participants are shown as human beings, with emotions, relationships, indecision, and so on. It's made in documentary-style, so don't expect any huge close-ups of reconstructed explosions (thankfully). But the personal stories, brief though they are are very moving - especially when you realise there were SO MANY of them.I went with a friend who was not too familiar with the whole story. I asked him what he thought of the film. He said he had to shut his eyes for much of the second half because it gave him motion sickness. So be warned, the film can be gut wrenching in more ways than one.Hope that helps.",7,0,1,16 June 2006
Finding Neverland," Land of 'Hope and Glory'
","OK, this film is about the guy who wrote 'Peter Pan', and what led him to write it (just for one review, I don't want to be accused of including spoilers). Much of what has already been written, particularly the comment by the divorce attorney and the 'Trivia' section, is worth reading. So what can I say that hasn't already been said? How about: boys in Britain really did dress like that once; Johnny Depp's Scottish accent is nearly realistic but not quite right; and despite being about Neverland, it's one of the most realistic portrayals of humanity to come out of Hollywood for some time. If you liked it, particularly the boys, you might also like 'Hope and Glory' from 1987 -- less of a tear jerker, but another good angle on British childhood in difficult circumstances.",8,2,2,27 January 2005
Fury," Almost as good as Saving Private Ryan, and bonus marks for character realism.
","Fury is intended as a 'horrors of war' film in the same way that Saving Private Ryan was, and there are perhaps too many scenes of deeply unpleasant injuries and deaths. However, it has two key strengths. One is the tank battle scenes, which I have not seen done so effectively before. The other is realism; it includes vignettes on the enormous psychological resistance to killing another human being; whether there are atheists in foxholes; and incongruous moments of humanity. It does include some war film clichés; there's a transformation from 'boy' into 'soldier man'; the usual 'band of brothers' stuff; and the Americans are not nice, but the Germans are nastier (though sadly, this reflects the reality of spring 1945 pretty well). There are also a few 'but why didn't they just ...' moments in the plot. It won't become that classic that Private Ryan is -- Private Ryan earned that status by being the first 'real war violence' film and also having a journey as its core plot -- but it's well worth the night out, as long as you have the stomach for the bloody bits.",8,4,10,24 October 2014
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," If you liked the first Harry Potter, you'll love this
","I read the Narnia books as a kid, and my imagination took flights of fancy that I would have loved to have seen on celluloid back then. Now I'm an adult and the technology has finally arrived. The various mythical creatures are brought to life spectacularly, the scenery is fantastic, there's some understated humour, and the final battle scene is a worthy successor to the Minas Tirith battle in Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.Indeed, this film both gains and loses by following LOTR. It gains because LOTR makes some of the mythical creatures in this film more believable. If you thought orcs, elves and hobbits were strange, wait till you see the magnificently rendered centaurs. But it loses some of its impact in the battle scenes because of its similarity to the LOTR battles ... though, in fairness, most mediaeval battles were pretty much like that, so it's hard to get much variation in.As for the Harry Potter connection, the stars of the film are all kids -- except for the White Witch, played with commendable iciness by Tilda Swinton -- with the youngest child (Lucy Pevensie/Georgie Henley) likely to take home the most plaudits. Also, if this film has a weakness, it's that (like HP & the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone), it stays a bit too close to the book from which it was derived. Don't get me wrong, the book is an excellent, heroic story -- but it's a children's book, and some of the 'this happened and then that happened' moments stretched credibility for me as an adult. Oh, and one or two shots were a bit obviously greenscreened with the characters superimposed on backgrounds.N.B. Much has been made of the Christian analogy in the story -- it's there, of course, but it isn't overplayed.In short, if you can see it through a child's eyes, or if you haven't seen Lord of the Rings, this is a must see. If you have ... well, it won't seem quite the franchise monster that LOTR was, but it's worth the night out just for the technical effects on the creatures, and the rest of it is pretty good as well.",9,0,0,9 December 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Independence Day with weather
","If you liked Independence Day, you'll like this. Otherwise, you'll cringe at the endless series of movie cliches that make Star Trek look intellectual (well, maybe not the 'Spock's Brain' episode :-)). Some of the set pieces are quite well done, with decent special effects, but if you leave your brain switched on, you may well be disappointed. And as for the plot inaccuracies ... <spoiler alert> ... the film seems to go out of its way to include them. If you don't believe me, try touching metal with your bare hands in temperatures far below zero (like the helicopter pilot does, or the guys on the ship do), falling 15 feet while unconscious, or raising a toast 'to England' anywhere in Glasgow. I'm not sure which would be the most painful.",6,0,0,28 May 2004
Yes Man," You don't have to be a Jim Carrey fan to like this feel-good film
","My wife usually hates Jim Carrey, but she liked this film. Carrey mostly subdues his Ace Ventura wackiness for his Truman Show empathetic self. Great premise, pretty well acted out, produces an uplifting film. Differs quite a lot from the book, so you can see the film and read the book and enjoy both. The plot isn't too original but the individual episodes are fun to guess about. Watch this if you liked Bruce Almighty ... and stay around for an extra clip during the credits. And take a friend if they stay at home all the time and refuse to come out to have fun ... or at least, buy them this film on DVD. It will do them good ... oh YES!!",8,1,2,28 December 2008
Ocean's Twelve," Self-referential: see 'self-referential'
","Ocean's Twelve works for me because it's self-referential; in other words, it plants its tongue firmly in its cheek, and scatters references through the film to the real life people/situations behind the film. I can't tell you how without bringing down the wrath of the IMDb spoiler police on my head, but let's say that if you enjoy Hitchcock cameos or the humour of films such as Star Trek IV ('Computer? Computer!'), you should like this one.It's also refreshing to see a film that treats Europe as being more than Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower and the Colosseum. I actually watched it in Rome, one of the locations used in the film, and not a single ancient ruin appeared (apart from George Clooney ;->); indeed, the opening scene of a line of cars all sounding their horns was familiar enough to send a laugh around the Roman audience.There were one or two plot oddities that'll probably show up in the IMDb goofs section (Arsenal FC going from Amsterdam to Barcelona?! By bus?!) but overall, a good night out.",8,27,41,25 January 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Every sci-fi that has a beginning has a disappointing end
","Science fiction trilogies have a habit of being great in the first book, where they ask the big questions, and dreadful in the third book, where they give the answers. Why? Because messages such as [VERY MINOR SPOILER ALERT] 'love conquers all and explains everything', 'evolution creates inevitability', 'just believe and it will happen' or 'the only restrictions are the ones you place on yourself' [END SPOILER ALERT] just don't cut it in everyday life, never mind in a sci-fi world where you need to have many things explained. I had great hopes that the Matrix trilogy would escape from this because the first film was so laced with spiritual/ philosophical/ Alice in Wonderland analogies, but no luck. In fact, I found myself having the awful thought that I was actually watching a re-run of Starship Troopers... There's some great special effects, sure, but even more action film/sci-fi cliches. I was going to get the DVDs of Reloaded & Revolutions for Christmas and watch them together, but I don't think I'll bother now.",5,0,0,11 November 2003
Knowing," A clichéd horror film redeemed by some good special effects
","I went to see this film because it was tagged as 'sci-fi'. In fact, it plays out more like a horror film -- and a pretty clichéd one at that. If I asked you to guess which part of the USA it takes place in, what the weather is like near ground level, what time of day most of the action takes place, and the age of the character at the centre of the strange goings-on, you wouldn't find the answers hard.The ending is far-fetched and features some major plot holes too, which I'll submit to the Trivia section. It's pretty, though.The film is saved from mediocrity by some decent acting, and especially by the special effect sequences.You might enjoy it if you liked 'Millennium', a rather old B-movie with Kris Kristofferson and Cheryl Ladd.",5,2,5,27 March 2009
Ender's Game," The most thought-provoking film I've seen for a long time.
","I really liked the film, because it's different. At first you think it's going to be another wimpy-kid-coming-of-age story, though set in space. But it isn't. Then you think it's a smart-kid-can't-unlock-the-key-secret-until-he-understands-himself, but it isn't that. Maybe it'll be another Hunger Games, teenager-uses-skills-to-survive-and-then-to-beat-the-system? No, not that either.In the end, it's a film about the rights and wrongs of war, and of training for war. And I do mean rights and wrongs, plural: this is one of the best films for a long time for making you think about more than one side of a complex issue. It also takes a hefty (though mitigated) swipe at video-game culture; but if you think that's a modern politically correct message, remember that the book was written in 1985. Its message is best summed up in one (sligh mis-)quote from the film: 'It's not what you do; it's why you do it.' It's one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen for a long time. If you come out of the film wanting to know more about the issues that the book raises, I recommend the excellent (if slightly academic) book 'On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society' by Lieutenant-Colonel Dave Grossman. It doesn't tackle exactly the same issues that the film raises (which is good, because that means the book doesn't act as a spoiler for the film!) but it does address the wider issues.",9,2,6,25 October 2013
Dunkirk," Bleak and hopeless.
","If you enjoyed the last twenty minutes of Titanic, then this film is for you. If you liked the bleak vision of humanity that Christopher Nolan portrayed in The Dark Knight Rises, you might like the atmosphere of this film. If you want a generic war-is-hell and survival is matter of chance film, you may well appreciate this.If you remember Dunkirk as a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat; as a near-miracle when for a full day a storm grounded the German air force in Flankers while the Channel was as calm as a millpond; as a day when sixty German planes attacked four hundred men on the beach and inflicted no casualties; as a time when men were buried hastily but with military honours rather than being allowed to lie dead on the beach; then this film does a huge disservice to the truth. Finally a note on accuracy. The film may look right but it is missing almost any detail that might bring hope into the situation. The images may be accurate; the atmosphere is more appropriate for a film about a concentration camp.",1,40,70,19 August 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Nothing really new, but a worthy addition to the X-Men canon
","The strength of X-Men films has always been to give a large number of characters a decent bit of the story, and to allow viewers to imagine what it would be like to have that particular power. The moral of X-Men films has always been the same: people who are genetically different have to learn to live in peace. This film is absolutely solid on both of these aspects, along with occasional self-referential humour. However, it doesn't bring anything outstanding beyond the above. It's set partly in the 1970s, and goes out of its way to include odd stuff from the seventies (let's face it, there was plenty); it charts more of the characters' personal development; it performs the necessary reboot that major franchises seem to require these days; and it has plenty of high-tech special effects. All perfectly competent (apart from one 'revelation' concerning a well-known three-letter acronym that nearly made me laugh out loud), and yet I walked away feeling I'd seen most of it before, in one form or another.See it of you're a fan of the franchise and want to watch the story progress. If you haven't seen any X-Men films before, it's a good night out but you'd be better to watch some of the others first.",8,2,3,24 May 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Another film sinking in the sequel swamp
","I found the teenage girl so annoying, I was hoping she'd get eaten by a dinosaur. Sadly, no. And the 'hair-raising' scene where the trailer hangs over the cliff was as corny as 'Vertical Limit' but without the views. The dinosaurs are realistic, and the film is true to Michael Crichton's book, but Arthur Conan Doyle's book with the same title is not only original but also much better written. I do like Steven Spielberg's films, but to me, this is just another sinking sequel. I just discovered that there's a 'Jurassic Park 3' out - must be straight to video. Do I dare watch it?3/10",3,0,9,22 February 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Much better than I had feared it would be
","When I heard, about a year ago, that Halle Berry was demanding a bigger role in X-Men 3 or she wasn't going to appear, I became very worried that the franchise was going to sink into ego-building mediocrity and lose the teamwork aspect which makes the X-Men stand out from other superhero sci-fis. The change of director also didn't bode well.In the end, the film feels like it took the constraints it was given and made the most satisfying film possible in the circumstances. The stars' egos get their run-out largely by cutting down on the number of X-Men who figure as anything other than extras ... and yet, because these extras are familiar from previous films, it doesn't feel like they're sadly underdeveloped. The special effects are also amazing, as ever.There are weaknesses to the film that may result from the new director ... the personality of the central character of the film could have been explored much more fully (and beneficially to the film's message), instead of having lots of facial expressions but few lines; most of the new 'bad' mutants are fairly clichéd baddies; and the sole new 'good' X-Man has his part woefully underdeveloped. So it's not quite as good as X-2, but still a satisfying end to the trilogy.Oh, and I read that a cameraman on a previous film complained that 'he was filming the most beautiful woman in the world but she's ... got white hair'. I was sure he was going to say, 'she's ... covered in blue paint'. Well, both he and I are going to be a little happier after seeing this film.",8,0,1,26 May 2006
Hellboy," If you liked LXG, you'll like this.
","Try imagining what would happen if X-Men had been directed in the style of Van Helsing. Well, OK, it's been done already -- that was LXG, which has a lot in common with Hellboy --  semi-supernatural characters loosely dragged out of literature who haven't died for a very long time, but do at the end of this film if they're bad; an ancient professor played by a British actor; highly capable mechanical contraptions run by highly antiquated clockwork ... you get the idea. The 'unique' feature of this film is that the characters are lifted from vaguely religious literary sources, but that's only slightly relevant to the plot. [end spoilers] It's really a bunch of special-effects-filled nonsense, but I just sat back and enjoyed the effects and the visual imagery, which was occasionally impressive -- I liked the overhead umbrellas shot. And as for cross-breeding films -- how about 'Hellboy meets Tomb Raider' for a sequel?",6,1,2,14 September 2004
The Bourne Legacy," Lacks originality - and from a Bourne film, that's especially disappointing
","The biggest thing that this film made me realise was that the entire Bourne franchise contained an internal contradiction. The first three Bourne films were praised for the gritty realism of their action - heroes who actually hurt themselves, journeys that were delayed by traffic jams, etc. Yet when the plot finally unravelled its secrets, we find that Bourne and his ilk are genetically modified super-humans.This film therefore has to treat these super-humans as, well slightly superhuman -- and the result is that the gritty realism is replaced with a character who's more like James Bond (but without the sophistication or humour) than Matt Damon's more realistic Everyman who was bewildered by his own capabilities. The script tries to deal with this by casting the hero as one drug-dependent man (plus Rachel Weisz) against the world, but it just ends up being another running away film, like the Fugitive.Poor Weisz is cast as a scientist who has to run from her employers and spends most of the film running and looking scared. I'm not criticising her performance -- she's good at it -- but she should be because she's played exactly the same role before (e.g. in Chain Reaction), right down to her upper clothing gradually being reduced till she's running around in a singlet. She's a better actress than this film gives her the chance to express.Some of the action sequences are pretty good, and the cast do their best with the material they're given. But the plot of this film is one you've seen many times before -- and from a Bourne film, that's particularly disappointing.",6,2,6,18 August 2012
The Dark Knight," Senseless Evil
","This comment is labelled as containing spoilers. In fact, it describes no actual events from the film, but it does talk about underlying themes, and it refers to 3 lines of dialogue. Read on if you wish.Batman has a new enemy - the Joker - and a new potential ally, Harvey Dent, the new up-and-coming District Attorney. The film quickly develops into a study of good versus evil.We discover the Joker's motivation for the evil that he does ... he has no apparent ultimate aim, he simply enjoys being evil. The sheer senselessness of his acts makes him unpredictable. As the film unfolds, the forces of good appear powerless; whatever they do, there is a greater evil, a more twisted motivation that they are unintentionally feeding. The film's title is, in fact, a triple pun ... it is metaphorically a 'dark night' for the city, and much of the significant action takes place in a single night. By the end, we are asked to consider whether good or evil are simply a matter of luck, and whether truth as well as law are an inconvenience to doing good.The film is therefore thoroughly postmodern. It could be described as doing for justice what 'Titanic' did for love ... showing it to be worthy and desirable, but ultimately unsustainable in the face of evil, corruption, and random blows dealt by Fate. There are some events in which good is seen to triumph, but in hindsight these are plot contrivances ... to do evil would have been so much easier.The film itself is also senseless in some ways. The factors that made the Joker what he is are never laid out. Nor are the (sometimes incredible) feats of anticipation and cooperation, which allow the Joker often to have an extra card up his sleeve, ever explained.There are two subtexts beneath the central theme of overwhelming evil: one is intentional, the other (I think) not. The first one is Batman's credo: 'sometimes, to do good, you have to act outside the law'. The second is based on a line spoken by the Joker: where good and evil clash on equal terms, evil is more powerful, because the good have to follow rules, whereas the evil have no rules.The film is well made: the special effects are very impressive, the acting is generally good, and it's technically very well made. But I found it disturbing and (literally) hopeless.",1,20,44,20 August 2008
National Treasure," Deep awe and reverence ... not.
","Good to see Diane Kruger again, but apart from that, this was a mixture of formulaic stuff with credibility-stretching escapades and, of course, deep reverence paid to an American national icon that we British would quite happily see lost! (OK, slight overstatement there, but come on ... when are film-makers going to realise that we in Europe care about 'ancient' American 'national treasures' about as much as Americans care about Belgium's national architectural style?) It could have been worse -- it could have been about basketball or baseball -- but I can't see this scoring with non-US voters anywhere near as well as it did with US voters. The only award it may deserve is for the sets, some of which must have cost a ton of money.",4,0,2,7 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Should Christians let their kids see this movie?
","This review is mainly intended for Christian parents who are unsure whether they should let their kids go and see this film. There are a number of stories circulating in the Christian community -- almost none of them good -- about Harry Potter books and their author, J.K. Rowling. Many of these stories are unsubstantiated and at least one is outright falsehood (see www.ship-of-fools.com/Myths/index.html) ... but any book or movie that seems to glorify witchcraft and wizardry is bound to cause legitimate concerns among Christian parents. This review concentrates on the movie itself.The short answer is ... that there isn't a short answer. This movie in itself is comparatively innocuous (that is, 'comparative' with the contents of many modern films & TV). The 'dark spiritual' overtones are only slightly nastier than Darth Vader and the 'Force', the theme of the film is good battling against evil, and the overall message of the film is that life at boarding school is great, and working magic is a bit like working with technology or electrical gadgets - lots of fun if you're careful to obey the rules, dangerous if you don't. It also happens to be a very good film, well-made and with several clever technical effects. The actors (especially the children) are also excellent. On the other hand, the movie inevitably portrays witches and wizards as (mostly) nice people who are slightly superior to ordinary folk; the concept of using magic to solve problems may well capture some young minds; and there's always the problem that if the kids get interested in Harry Potter, they may choose to read all the books ... and everyone I've asked agrees that the books get 'darker' as the series progresses. In other words, you risk starting your kids on a journey whose ending isn't yet known (the last 3 books aren't written) but which can't be considered to focus primarily on what is good, holy, pure, right and honourable. [Mind you, the same could be said of many other authors ...]So in conclusion: if you are strongly opposed to *any* influence of witchcraft or wizardry in your home, then don't let your kids see this movie. However, there's worse stuff on TV and in many books, so if you let them look at that type of thing, you're being inconsistent. Make your own judgement based on how imaginative you kids are and whether they are old enough to discern the differences between the film and real life.",Null,0,0,12 November 2001
War of the Worlds," Better than Independence Day, worse than Minority Report
","OK, I was been spoiled for this by a childhood spent listening to Jeff Wayne's musical version of 'War of the Worlds'. The opening track of that album was always a stand-out for me and I was mildly disappointed that this film didn't use it. Sorry, Morgan Freeman, but Richard Burton's narration beats yours hands down.Spielberg's film is effective if you've never seen anything like this, or anything by Spielberg, before. If you have, then you'll realise that the kids, and especially the small cute girl, are Spielberg fixtures rather than being part of the original story.In the end, the weakness of this film isn't the kids, who act convincingly, nor the special effects, which are suitably big-budget. It's the holes in the plot that make it impossible to suspend disbelief enough to believe in the machines. The biggest plot holes come from the shift of context from the book.(Spoilers start here) How did the machines buried 'millions of years ago' manage to end up in the middle of today's major cities? Since Cruise has his family with him, why head for Boston and into trouble instead of running for the unpopulated hills? How come their family's part of Boston was untouched? How did the heat rays keep just missing Cruise & his daughter but hitting everyone else? How on earth did his son survive? And why hadn't the son had a wash before his dad arrived? Where did they find an undamaged gas station for the car? If all electrical equipment was damaged by the lightning, how come the car was fixed just by changing one part? And why wasn't that part damaged? ... a solenoid is a pretty good conductor of electromagnetic radiation, if anything is etc. etc.(Spoilers end here) It's better than Indepedence Day, and Day After Tomorrow, but Cruise was better in Minority Report. 6 out of 10 for the original story, the special effects, and the reasonable acting. Very few marks for any adaptations to the original story, though.",6,1,3,6 July 2005
The Reader," Mystery, young love, law and war work together surprisingly well
","This film works for me because of the way it unfolds like a good mystery story, so that at the end you can look back and say 'Ah, that's why so-and-so happened'. It's not a mystery-story plot, though, more of a tear-jerker, though for reasons well removed from the usual 'I love her, she doesn't love me, smoke gets in your eyes' plot-line.The film cleverly mixes themes of war horror, law, young love, and self-development. I can't think of another film that is similar to compare it with. Recommended for anyone who likes thinking over films after seeing them, doesn't mind nudity, and likes films about character development ... this isn't a film of non-stop action or spectacular explosions.",7,1,1,8 January 2009
The Terminal," Been there, done that, didn't take quite as long
","I'm surprised to see this film scoring higher votes from a U.S. audience than an non-US audience, because parts of Viktor's experience are uncomfortably familiar to anyone who's ever been through U.S. immigration.  The unfriendly interrogation followed by an unsmiling 'Welcome to the United States', the determination of U.S. officialdom to stick to the letter of the law, the need to answer leading questions in a certain way ('Have you ever been a Nazi? Are you a drug dealer?' Yes, these questions are on the infamous light green form), and even the difficulty of figuring out how the public telephones work, all reminded me of my own experiences - and I speak the same language! (well, mostly :-)). So those people who criticised Spielberg for 'not knowing where the film is going' are missing the point -- the true theme of this film, to me, is how outsiders see America, through the microcosm that is an airport terminal.As for those people who criticised parts of the plot as being beyond belief, I have to agree -- I can't believe so many people slipped over on a wet stone floor in New York and didn't try to sue the airport (half :-))[End spoilers]",8,1,2,12 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Brilliant. Now bring on the extended edition ...
","Excellent film, fantastic, unbelievable. And yet I can't wait for the extended edition, because I saw Two Towers: Extended Edition a few days ago, and it became so obvious that much was cut from the original movie just to save time, not for the good of the story. The extended editiion is a more well rounded experience -- more on the Boromir/Faramir/Denethor background, more on Aragorn & Eowyn, more one liners from Gimli the dwarf, a scene from the Old Forest journey (missed out of film 1) transferred to Fangorn, and we see Tolkien's tremendous concept of the living Fangorn forest moving to Helm's Deep and swallowing fleeing orcs. Why can't we get an (possibly optional) extended edition on DVD of all severely cut movies? I can think of many that would have been improved that way. Just one criticism of ROTK: the scenes of Gollum fighting thin air look a bit contrived. Can we have a scene interspersed where Frodo in Ring-spooky-land finds himself struggling with Gollum, to get the feeling of the climactic fight better?Thanks, Peter, for doing this.",10,0,0,21 December 2003
The Replacements," Much better than you'd think for a straight-to-video film about American football
","I think it was a mistake to make this a straight-to-video film in the UK. It was probably done that way because films about U.S. sports often bomb over here. But Channel 4 have been showing the NFL on UK TV for many years, and besides, this film is as much about team spirit and getting a second chance at life as it is about football. It's a good light-hearted comedy -- and by 'good', I mean it doesn't go all out for gags in the 'Naked Gun' fashion, it's more that the comedy arises from a bunch of very different guys (and gals) trying to work together.I watched the 'Director's Commentary' on the DVD, and it became clear that the film was chopped to smithereens in the cutting room -- among scenes that were lost were (POSSIBLE SPOILERS START HERE) large parts of the first meeting between Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman, a locker room scene with Rhys Ifans where he tries to encourage the guys with a Welsh song which is all about getting killed (sounds like some Scottish songs I know :-(), the fact that Martell placed the tripwire in the tunnel before the opening game, and even an entire character - a striking player who crossed the picket line and became a 'replacement' - who never made it into production. (SPOILERS END HERE) As a result, one or two minor plot lines in the film go nowhere, and some of the characters are more stereotyped than I'd like. However, the commentary also makes clear some production successes, notably Gene Hackman's ad-libbing, and the second unit who shot 17 football plays in 9.5 minutes at half-time in a Baltimore Ravens game! All credit to these guys for producing a film that isn't an all-time great, but is well worth picking up for a lighthearted evening's entertainment.",9,0,1,3 July 2001
The Bourne Supremacy," Realism Rules
","Someone once said that to be successful, entertainment has to be either fantasy or realism. The B.S. is definitely trying for the latter, with lots of wobbly or blurred camera shots, several real life contemporary locations, and a plot that's largely feasible. While I found the shaky camera work a bit wearing after a while, and most of the locations to be (deliberately?) grey or washed out in colour, it makes a nice change to have the-world-outside-America represented by more than just London, Paris and Rome for once -- and in the other cities chosen, the tourist landmarks only make cameo appearances rather than getting blown up. The plot isn't bad, either - nice to see  the hero actually hurting himself when making a death-defying leap, and not suddenly recovering. The car chase at the end is also good, and creepily reminiscent of Diana's death - a bit too much realism, maybe? It's even feasible to drive Naples to Berlin in 2 days - it's only 800 miles, I thought it was much further. Must be that Italian traffic ...  [END SPOILER]All in all, a worthy effort. Roll on the 3rd in the trilogy!",8,3,4,22 August 2004
