Skyfall," Dark, well made, humorless.
","Well made, very entertaining, a good thriller, a good twist on the James Bond legend, but it's almost not a James Bond movie at all. Super action scenes, and it is good that it is not terribly gross or horrifying like many action films are now. It still has gross, bloody and horrifying scenes at times, I miss the times when I was a kid and could easily see all the James Bond movies, now it's almost too gross for a 12 yo, and impossible for a younger kid. Skyfall is lacking in humor, I'd like to see more of the coolness and the humor of the older type James Bond movies. This James Bond is getting very old and depressed and weary. Even the lovemaking scenes were painful, where's the sexiness? Also, I think it is horrible that M was turned into a man again, it was superb to have a female strong personality there. But, the scenes were well made, and kept me and my 13 yo son on the edge of our seats. The film was not all about just bombing and fires this time, it was a good story, keep up the good work there ;) On the other hand, how about less grossness, more humor, more kissing, less depression.",4,2,6,23 December 2012
Pacific Rim," A strong female hero YES :)
","It's about time to have a strong female role model in one of the new action hero movies. And one of the main roles here is definitely a strong, smart woman, fully clad, was not repeatedly 'helplessly saved' by a man, simply a cool role model for girls and a cool independent female for the boys t admire :) Yes there were strong guys there too, but we need more good female role models for girls and boys that are watching movies today :) Thank you. Kudos to the makers of this film :) I did not go happily to this film, I was dragged by my sons and a film about robots fighting monsters sounded very dull. But I thought at least I might get a nap during the film. But this film is fun, very well made, good action scenes, not too disgusting so my blood and gore-hating 7 yo son could enjoy it totally, I loved it :) And, oh, yes, I'm a middle aged lady :)",8,2,9,20 July 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A good story/book, destroyed by turning it into a cartoon movie.
","The graphics are great, but...The book is originally well written and a wonderful story, but obviously modern film industry had to milk as much money out of it as possible. All the morale is gone, and it's just made into an action movie with lots of clobbering - again and again and again. Lots of scenes are written into the movie that weren't in the book, and mostly they're just clobbering scenes, with the persons surviving totally improbable situations where they couldn't survive (and the book is not like that). Practically a Tom & Jerry movie. Tom & Jerry are fine, but mixing their genre with Tolkien is just stupid and awkward. The movie is 3 hour long, and they'll make 3 such movies, 9 hours out of this little book, good grief. It would be 1 fine 2-3 hour movie. This is very sad, because as I said, it's a great story. Also, because I like adventure movies. It's just sad.",1,12,23,14 January 2013
The Piano," Sexual abuse.
","This is a wonerfully welm made film. Top acting, filmin, cutting, story. The only thing bothering me, is that the film is really saying, that it is all right to sexually abuse a woman, it makes her falling in love with you. The message is chilling.",8,1,2,28 April 2019
