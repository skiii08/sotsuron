Howl's Moving Castle," An Anti-War statement without propaganda...Amazing
","Diana Wynne Jones novel is adopted by film-making legend Hayao Miyazaki to create a subtle classic.It tells the story of Sophie, a simple city girl with low self esteem, who works in a hat shop in a Eurasian-fantasy country plagued by war. The local celebrity, Howl, is a mysterious magician about whom rumors fly like flocks of pigeons. After a chance meeting with the sorcerer, and an unfortunate encounter with a more infamous personality, the Witch of the Waste, Sophie is transformed into an elderly version of herself. In seeking a way to avert the curse, Sophie finds herself caught up in the twisted politics of the conflict, but more importantly, she discovers that it truly is love, in this case, the love of a family, that is the cure for war.What makes this story so brilliant is that the environment is removed from our earth completely, so that no racial structure or borders can be identified. This reveals the true madness of conflict, which is used as the background for the kind of enchanting story that one might curl up with on a rainy day--or even a sunny one. Studio Ghibli's textbook superior visions are on display once again to push forward the technical quality of the film, and the capable U.S. production team and cast have presented the story in a way that does justice to the visuals. For those who are thrown by the message, think nothing of it--it took me a few viewings as well. But I did come to realize that this is actually a rather powerful allegory for our own war-torn world, and the things that really matter within--the desire to love, be loved, and shun yourself for others based on that love. Perhaps, like a fine wine, it will gain appreciation with the passage of time.",7,0,1,17 February 2007
Coraline," Nothing like the Moon
","Henry Selick again brings a tour-de-force by way of fascinating innovation in 'puppetmation'.The story, adapted from a fine Neil Gaiman work, features feisty 'tween Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning), fresh from Michigan and taking up residence with her independent journalist parents in 'The Pink Palace', a landmark on the edge of nowhere. The only other kid for miles, Wybie (Robbie Bailey), is a rambling nerd with a strange pet cat, her mother (Teri Hatcher) is absorbed in meeting her deadline, her father (John Hodgman) is, well, simply absorbed, and her neighbors are elderly oddities, especially Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane, in a role that suits him), a former acrobat from Russia with an appreciation for stinky cheese. Things aren't necessarily bad, just weird and dull.That is, until Coraline unlocks a door in the house far too small for most humans, and discovers another world, where another family awaits, similar to the first family, but with everything Coraline misses. All too soon, the lines between fantasy and reality blur, and Coraline is forced into making a decision that will either change her life or end it.The usual nitpicks may rear their ugly heads when comparing the film to the novel, but in general, this is a great adaptation, in that it captures the essence of the story. Reality and fantasy blur as quickly for the viewers as they do for Coraline, which helps to plunge us into the urgency. The flowing animation, some of the best I've seen for stop-motion OR go-motion, rivals the best CGI; even surpasses it in digital! Details are well-pronounced, from Coraline's wardrobe (as well as the other characters'), to the evolving garden outside, to the near ever-present moon, which plays a peculiar role in marking time and stretching the suspense. Again, the film is best experienced in digital, and a worthwhile experience in 3-D, if you can plunk down the extra cash.While the pace may drift in a few places, that is certainly a minor gripe. If you like a good suspense story, there's really no reason to stay away from the Pink Palace, unless of course, Grandma tells you to.",8,1,3,14 February 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Haven't had so much fun since Willow first opened...
","A year of overdone franchises, pretentious biopics, and realistic downers at the movies ends with this well-timed, refreshing piece, which is even more amazing considering it is indeed the most fantastic allegory of the Greatest Story Ever Told.In short, the four Pevensie children escape the war-torn suburbs of early 40s London, joining their relative, an eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent) and his governess-like assistant at his countryside manor. The kids have trouble appreciating one another, despite the harsh circumstances they have just faced. Gradually, they discover that the spare room wardrobe is actually a portal to a world beyond their imagination, the world of Narnia. They find themselves on the run from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), caught up in the centennial struggle between the Witch and the icon of justice, Aslan (Liam Neeson), and most importantly, becoming a family again.Despite its most serious origins, this story is just plain fun. I may be biased--I've read the wonderful source material from C.S. Lewis thrice. If accuracy in comparison to the novel would bother you, stay away. This is truly a big screen interpretation, but done most respectfully by Andrew Adamson, the director best known for the Shrek films. (Yeah! I know!) He shows quite a departure here, showing love and reference for the original story in this interpretation. Although a few stars are involved, one of the big reasons to see it is for the previously unknown talent, including breakout performances by James McAvoy (Mr. Tumnus), Patrick Kake (Oreius the Centaur General), and, of course, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley as Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy respectively. Breathtaking visuals, that quite frankly, outdo the best of Potter round out the mix. The final battle is not to be missed. Finally, nothing from the original work that was left out of the film will be terribly missed. (I was delighted, in fact, that the Christmas Party was not attempted. Arguably, the saddest part of the story.) The audience aimed at is certainly children, but don't be surprised to find yourself enchanted as well. Even though you may not like to, please, PLEASE stay for the credits to see the epilogue, straight from the book, as well as some nice compositions. A very good time.",9,5,7,23 December 2005
Spider-Man 3," Forgiveness, what a concept...
","By now, I've heard my share of conflicting reports on this movie. I made a promise to myself long ago not to go into films I haven't seen with unrealistic or unfair expectations. It's served me well, and it was no less of a learning experience this time, having heard most every critic and wannabe critic's take on it, several of them negative.I submit to them all, negative and positive, that they're missing the point. Spider-Man 3 successfully does what few films will even ATTEMPT nowadays. More on that later.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is on cloud nine. Things are finally looking up. As Spider-Man, he is the greatest thing since...well, the internet. A bona-fide celebrity. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) isn't doing too shabbily, either, having debuted in a Broadway show. Peter sees the perfect timing in finally proposing to MJ, for which Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) entrusts him with a precious family heirloom ring. Harry Osborn (James Franco) attempts the direct approach to exorcising his own demons in a confrontation with Peter, and as a result, becomes friends with him again. But not all is well in New York. Escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) has the heat breathing down his neck as he desperately looks for a way to reconnect with a repressed wife and a critically ill daughter. Meanwhile, upstart photo jock Edward Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) is looking to become Spider-Man's new unofficial PR for the Daily Bugle. Things get more and more complicated as protagonists and antagonists alike cross paths, and wind up learning something about themselves.I'll admit, it won't win any awards, save maybe an Oscar or two for the effects and editing, and some MTV awards for the fights. You've heard it all, I'm sure, by now, so I'll mention in passing that the special effects and animation in this film are truly eye popping. Cinematography is grand, which it ought to be, 'cause this one wasn't cheap. On a basic level, and considering the source material, the story is well-handled; Sam Raimi remains the most capable director as far as taking a comic-book plot, virtually sticking to it verbatim, and making it work in a film format. Everyone earns their paycheck in portrayals--and additions and deviations, where damaging in other franchises, are welcome here. Haden Church gives classic brute Sandman a firm measure of humanity, James Franco must be applauded for his stalwart handling of a highly conflicted character in Harry Osborn, and despite limited screen-time, Topher Grace, yes, I have to admit, did gleeful justice to the wall-crawler's most fascinating adversary.So what's different, you ask? What does Spider-Man 3 do that's so rare and great? The moral. Forgiveness, sadly, is a concept that's rarely broached in either fantasy OR real life. Particularly, at this most cynical time, and in our eye-for-an-eye, litigant-rich society, this is a lesson that kids from 3 to 133 could stand to learn and re-learn. If the cast and crew of Spider-Man 3 would take any pride in anything they've done here, it should be mostly for that. While I felt that the first two films were nicely done, this is the first Spider-Man that I actually wanted to buy.Here's hoping the world's most popular comic book hero has started a long-overdue new trend in storytelling.",8,0,0,11 May 2007
Corpse Bride," Exquisite (haven't seen that word in a while)
","Burton takes another playful swipe at his stop-motion heroes with this nicely-done treat.Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is a milquetoast. A bumbling, unlucky dreamer. To make things worse, his parents (multi-talented Paul Whitehouse and Tracey Ullman) are forcing him into the classic 'arranged marriage', which is more like a contract with the cash-strapped but aristocratic Everglots (Albert Finney & Joanna Lumley). Things turn around, however, when he meets his intended, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) who is actually very attractive, inside and out.The ceremony is as arranged as the marriage, unfortunately, and the frustrated minister (Christopher Lee) demands that Victor take time out to PRACTICE HIS VOWS. This too, is awkward, as in the midst of his rehearsal, Victor places a ring upon a corpse's poking finger (just the place to rehearse a wedding, a cemetery) thus rousing the title character (Helena Bonham Carter), who leads Victor on a voyage through life and death and an unwitting quest to figure out what he really wants.Exquisite, yes, and enjoyable, but not without a few flaws. Most of the songs, while well written, feel out of place, and potentially powerful villain, Barkis Bittern (post-Doctor Who Richard E. Grant) doesn't seem to be allowed to do enough. But the good far outweighs the bad--moviegoers who get past the title will find a light-hearted romp that is rife with parody and spoof, from the Harryhausen brand piano to the diminutive character Bonesapart (played by the diminutive Deep Roy). A cameo by Jack Skellington would have been cool (O.K., Disney) but Danny Elfman's Bonejangles does pull off an eye-popping number. Even the unsettling, Peter-Lorre-channeling maggot residing in the Bride's skull threatens to steal the show. Good cast (with many Burton stalwarts, incidentally), with the philosophy that less is more make for a good time.Like it or not, it is well-worth noting that this film delivers many firsts to film-making, including new-style digital camera-work on refined stop-motion. To animators and film students, this offering comes highly recommended.",8,11,14,12 October 2005
Watchmen," 'Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?'
","It is...a most interesting version of 1985. Nixon has been president for FAR too long, the Soviet Union struggles with the West over control of Afghanistan, and crime and social upheaval are at an all time high.And, oh yeah, superheroes exist.However, superheroes have problems, just like anyone else. The most notable of super teams, the Minute Men, had long passed their glory days and handed the torch to the next generation, whose problems were so severe that they wound up disbanded.But now, the murder of a veteran member causes these new Watchmen to unite again, with the purpose of solving said murder, and perhaps, saving the world once again.As different as the source material upon which this movie was based proved to be, I never really liked it. I knew very little of the mysterious writer Alan Moore at the time that I read it (somewhere between high school and college), but he would go on to write works that I enjoyed much more. I gained an appreciation for the dark themes and the social mirrors he explores. But after two readings, I found this particular story somewhat abrupt and naive.Now, a movie comes along. Surprise, surprise, it proves effective.Don't go expecting the typical comic book nonsense (aside from Christopher Nolan's take on Batman, and a scant few other examples, that is) to which we've been exposed up to this point. In fact, it's most effective if you attend with no expectations at all. This prompts me to wave a BIG flag before parents--it's rated R for a reason. In fact, there are many reasons.Some solid performances abound in a cast of actual character actors rather than stars. In particular, talking head followers should enjoy the fine actors portraying The MacLaughlin Group and Ted Koppel. The musical choices pull you in to the narrative, reflecting the troubled era well. (Who would have thought that a Bob Dylan tune would be such a powerful intro?) The film is faithful to the source material to no grammatical fault.This is one problem critics have had with the film already. One such critic, whose review I thought was rather good otherwise, put forth that the photo-play is so faithful to the novel, that it lacks any spirit of its own. I don't necessarily argue with that, but I do differ with the idea that the story is irrelevant due to the passage of time. (Since there's no Soviet Union, etc.) It's the reason for my title. Some will recognize the classic Chicago Transit Authority tune: 'Does anybody really care? And so I can't imagine why, we've all got time enough to die...' (Kinda surprised they didn't add that one.) If anything, the social and cultural connotations of a story like this are MORE relevant today than ever.In a world facing problems like economic downturn, increasing social upheaval, and families being ruined by a whole lot more than just war, perhaps it is the right time to revisit The Watchmen.",7,2,4,6 March 2009
Over the Hedge," A zany summer tribute to the state of Suburbia.
","The average American eats about 8 to 10 times a day.RJ (Bruce Willis), a raccoon, knows this all to well. So does his... acquaintance, a large grizzly named Vincent (Nick Nolte). Vincent has made a career of raiding the finest vending machines and stockrooms, gathering up a veritable, preservative-rich feast, which will be waiting for him when he emerges from hibernation.That is, it would have been, if RJ hadn't raided the cave.When the clever coon accidentally destroys Vincent's treasure trove, the bear gives him until the next full moon to serve up a complete, exact replacement, or DIE.Meanwhile, Vern the Turtle (Garry Shandling) has food on his mind as well--he and his varied family, Stella the Skunk (Wanda Sykes), father & daughter opossums Ozzie (William Shatner) and Heather (Avril Lavigne), a porcupine brood headed by Lou & Penny (Eugene Levy & Catherine O'Hara--fresh from Mitch & Mickey), and light-speed-but-slightly-off squirrel Hammie (Steve Carell) must find a way to fill their storage log with food before the season ends. Foraging is more of a challenge, however, when a huge hedge surrounds your home. On the other side, all around them, exists the tragedy of a housing development, brought on by career woman Gladys (Allison Janney). When starvation seems imminent, RJ steps in to introduce the virtues of having humans move in next door, especially the wealth of processed carbohydrates available. At the same time, he sees them as a way to pay off Vincent. RJ's plans expose the critters to the human public too often, however, prompting Gladys to call in animal control specialist Dwayne (Thomas Haden Church).The family wants the food, Gladys wants to eliminate the family, Dwayne wants to do the eliminating, Vern wants none of it, and RJ just wants to see the next season. Let the games begin.The tone of this movie? Take a set-up similar to the Secret of NIMH, replace the magic and philosophy with high cholesterol and lawn ornaments, swap out the rats and mice for Looney Tunes, and have Tex Avery direct the thing. It's that crazy--and that enjoyable.Just about everyone should enjoy this one (everyone except nature doctors)--there's plenty of energy to hold your kids' interest, and you may find yourself chuckling aplenty at the rapid-fire gags and one-liners. Don't expect a lot of self-serving movie quotes or tie-ins, though; the Dreamworks crew has now turned a corner. The closest they come to that is Hammie suggesting that the hedge be named Steve (as in Carrell?). 'That's a nice name!' This is a clear deviation for Willis, and he wisely treats the role of RJ as such. He's crafty, somewhat dishonest, and is always up for a good time. (Hmmm...actually, sounds something like Hudson Hawk, but we don't need to dwell on that.) Everyone else is brilliantly cast as well--Allison Janney voices Gladys with Cruella De Vil-type abandon, Steve Carrell employs auctioneer-level dialogue in the role of Hammie, and, well, to combine charm with general inertia, you just can't beat Shandling. It's not all laughs, however. The family helps RJ appreciate what a family really is, and RJ makes sure their lives will never be boring again.I read the comic strip this film is based on regularly until the local paper stopped carrying it. Grrr. My hope is for this movie to have the success it deserves, so that, if nothing else, they'll start running it again!",8,4,5,19 May 2006
Being John Malkovich," P.T. Barnum was right...
","...and I wouldn't be surprised to find that Spike Jonze is a relative.Let's make it quick--a milquetoast puppeteer (Cusack), his wildly environmentalist wife (Diaz), and his opportunistic co-worker (Keener) discover a portal which leads from the '13'th floor of an office building into the conscious of actor John Malkovich. It becomes a great way to make some quick cash, until the actor himself finds out and the true purpose of the portal is revealed.Granted--the film is definitely unique, and is a scathing, honest comment on America's overdone obsession with celebrity. Unfortunately, it has no staying power in the area of cinema. So many celebrities--and critics with celebrities for friends--sang it's praises so loudly that it came to mean nothing to those of us who aren't celebrity, thus the mission failed. The story pushes the point a little too hard, and there are almost no characters to like. Most heartbreaking is the character Orson Bean plays--having been used to him playing a cornucopia of charming characters, I was saddened to see him reduced to the role of a wacky, twisted cult-leader. I would not see this film again.Ironically, the only reason to see this contrivance is Malkovich himself. He firmly steals the show from the climax to the very end. After this film, I gained new respect for him as an actor. I guess it wasn't a total loss--okay, okay, one more star, but that's it!",4,2,5,4 December 2005
Ratatouille," 'It is about ze food, and zat is really enough to zell it to ze Americans...'
","Remy (Patton Oswalt) was born with the unique gift of deciphering smells and tastes, and marrying the two effectively--a gift any chef would give their apron for. Unfortunately, Remy was also born a rat. When it becomes apparent that his family cannot really appreciate his gift outside of its use in avoiding rat poison, Remy attempts to refine his talents in human kitchens. He even has the guidance of the late, great master chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett) to influence his endeavors. A series of unfortunate events unfolds, and the little rat finds himself in the big city, namely Paris, attempting to prove his talent with the help of hapless kitchen boy Tony Linguini (Lou Romano, Bernie Kropp in 'The Incredibles') to the most discriminating of palates, including that of tough-as-nails critic Anton Ego (Peter 'The Great' O'Toole). This is actually a nice piece of storytelling and an even better piece of animation. The environments of Paris and the French countryside are represented in grand scale--Bird's capable team and Pixar's diligent artists even manage to make a sewer look amazing! Meanwhile, you truly get the desperation and inspiration driving some well-designed characters, who are sure to remain memorable. Bird's fans might be a pinch disappointed in this one, though--it doesn't have that breakthrough stance employed so boldly with 'The Iron Giant' or 'The Incredibles', although it is nice to see him take on something a little lighter. A few lulls in the pacing make it feel a bit long, and technically, it's probably a little TOO good. It's evident that the Pixar crew did their usual in-depth study on the subjects, and while the rats are designed cute, the sight of millions of them gushing out of kitchens and houses made my skin crawl and took me right back to cult head-turners like 'Ben' and 'Willard' (brush up on your film history if you're unfamiliar with those). While far from Bird's or Pixar's finest, it's still a good time, and really a must for those of you (You know who you are!) who truly appreciate food. NOTE: Also dig Oscar-nominated Pixar short 'Lifted' before the main event, and stay for the credits!!",6,2,18,29 June 2007
Shrek the Third," Third Time's the Charming
","Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) have truly settled into married life, although for Shrek, the solitude of wedded bliss is somewhat hampered by the duties of a royal, having Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) as captains, and worst of all, the truly scary prospect of being trapped in all of the above by the passing of King Harold (John Cleese). The ailing royal frog does leave his son-in-law with a timely loophole--the existence of a truly distant relative. While Fiona, Queen Mom Lillian (Julie Andrews), and the rest of the female court attempt to ward off the ambitious yet juvenile Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), who has recruited the greatest fairy-tale villainy to his cause, the guys' latest 'whirlwind adventure' brings them into contact with the proposed heir apparent-- classic high school loser Artie (Justin Timberlake).If you fell in love with the mock product-placement rampant in the second film, or suffer from a short attention span, it's probably best you wait on this one. The essence of the Shrek universe is there for the fans to enjoy, however, with the true star of the film being how the characters have advanced--both technically and dramatically. A higher level of detail is noticeable, from the fluctuating real estate of Far Far Away to the hair of the chinny-chin-chins on the Three Pigs (look well, it's actually there!). The in-jokes are rather clever, but the filmmakers have taken a bold step by showing enough faith in the characters to actually explore them, as they did in the first movie. Although this is technically the longest of the three films, it seems somewhat short--since everyone has to travel a long way in a short time, and admittedly, the subplot of Charming devising a takeover by an alliance of fairy-tale villains harks back to earlier Shrek wannabe 'Happily N'ever After'--if something appears in your film that reminds us of another film, that other film should at least be...well, good. However, there are more good points: Timberlake doesn't ruin things--the character actually suits him, and rejoice concerned fans: he doesn't sing! Eric Idle provides his typical offbeat diversion as a Merlin whose robe is embarrassingly too short. All in all, things are kept enticingly light, eschewing wild stunts and nutty gags for the sake of a story. A move that deserves kudos on it's own. Bottom line, Shrek's about comedy more than anything else. Did I laugh? Yup, and quite a bit, so that made it worthwhile. If there's a single audience for the film, it's probably new parents--if you love these characters, check out their kids!!",7,11,22,18 May 2007
Transformers," Absurd. Ridiculous. Insane. Utterly Outrageous. DON'T MISS IT.
","A special military outpost detects an aircraft that's way off course. Two leaders on the team, Sergeant Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are present with the troops to greet the aircraft, which by military record, crashed and burned some time ago. All havoc breaks loose when this aircraft reveals itself not to be what it appears. When most of their unit is wiped out in the resulting assault, the sergeants are less concerned about making a report to superiors and more concerned with making it home with the other survivors in one piece. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, fast-talking high-schooler Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf--in just about every movie this year) is prepared for an important rite of passage. His dad Ron (Kevin Dunn) has agreed to buy Sam his first car. However, Sam somehow settles on a beat-up yellow Camaro, not realizing that there's--ahem, 'more than meets the eye' to this car.Okay, let me start by saying that this is very much a Michael Bay film--and as such, we know what to expect. (See the title) Grand doses of horrendous dialogue. Extreme twists in logic. Editing that would make most of us run screaming to the nearest kung-fu flick. That's all here, but it's far from the point. THIS is a summer movie in the way we've come to expect! High action, incredible pacing, and way cool music played very loudly. Bay channels a little David Zucker as well--there's some dead-on, rapid-fire humor that's actually funny! Note Lennox's frustration as he runs across tech support in India in his attempt to contact Washington. The one-liners we'd expect from him are also accounted for, but he has wisely stocked the cast with a who's-who of expert one-liner delivery personnel. (LeBouf, Gibson, Anthony Anderson, and John Tuturro to name a few.) Of course, the center piece of the film is the Transformers themselves, who are a sight to behold. I grew up on every incarnation, from TMS to Sunbow to Mainframe and beyond; and while I'd often say 'That's cool', I knew in my brain of brains there was no way to make me believe cars and planes were capable of such transformations. Now Digital Domain has shaken hands with Industrial Light and Magic and...well...let's just say I'm now in the market for a car, and I'm going to scrutinize those puppies VERY closely. You needn't be a fan, you just need a desire for solid summer diversion. If that's what you want, roll on out.",7,2,5,3 July 2007
WALL·E," An animated chick-flick? PIXAR breaks new ground again...
","WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) is the last of a series of machines left to clean up humanity's mess. But this is a sponsored mess, courtesy of friendly-neighborhood planet-seizing corporate titan 'Buy 'N Large', whose corporate logo nearly covers the waste-ridden landscape. WALL-E rather cheerfully goes about his 'directive' to the tune of his favorite film, 1969 Technicolor bombast 'Hello, Dolly!'. His well-developed personality combined with repeat viewings of the musical practically set the stage for the entrance of EVE(an 'Environmental Vegetation Evaluator', maybe?), who literally blasts her way into his environment, looking for signs of organic life. When WALL-E presents his houseplant to her, EVE hits a mission accomplished mode, and the road to fireworks is paved.Your circuit board's dead if you don't get a spark from this one. As effective as the somewhat chilling views of the ravaged earth are, along with what the long space-borne human race has become, adventure and intrigue take a firm back seat to romance. Chick-flick? Sure it is. Proof? PIXAR has truly managed to forge new territory in getting women and teenage girls, like the ones in my showing, to weep over a couple of machines. I admit, this central love story is heart-felt, as even the survival of our species is less important to us than whether EVE and WALL-E will end up together. And will they? You'll just have to go see it. This is a very good time at your theater.As much fun as the movie is, the opening short may very well be even better! Check out 'Presto!' and find out why Alec the Bunny is my new most favorite PIXAR character.",7,2,10,30 June 2008
Rango," Rango -- There's No Western Like It
","I realize a review is supposed to talk about the movie, but indulge me for a moment.I enjoy Westerns. But, that wasn't always the case. My mother of all people turned me on to the virtues and value found in 'Bonanza', 'Cimarron Strip', 'The Big Valley', and 'The Virginian'. Later, I would discover what made everyone from Sergio Leone to Clint Eastwood cool. I came to respect the romance and intrigue inherent in the genre; rarely was I turned off.It's that much more pleasing when the genre is taken in a different direction. We have an excellent example this year! It starts with a neurotic pet chameleon (Johnny Depp), naturally well-versed in drama and portrayal. Cruel fate sees him stranded in the wasteland, literally guided by voices, as he spends an amusing opening trying to survive. A chance meeting with strong-willed rancher lizard Beans (Isla Fisher) gets him a ride from the sewer to the toilet, a last-legs town, appropriately called 'Dirt'. There are water problems as well as outlaws aplenty. Mr. Neurotic lays eyes on a label in a saloon, spins a few tall tales, and Rango is born! After more dumb luck sees him nail a hawk and run toughie Bad Bill (Ray Winstone) and his gang off, Rango becomes a name in the community.But, can he figure out what's behind the water shortage? He's on a clock, since to said outlaws, a sheriff's star may as well be a bulls-eye.Prior to rushing out to see this, I heard a couple of pre-cog complaints about ugly character designs. That's easily answered, along with many other stigma you true believers may be having. First, if you are into clean, perfect, 'attractive' character design and execution as displayed through the rose-colored, 3-D VR helmets borne of the PIXAR/DreamWorks debate, stay away from this film. That goes triple for you parents looking for the next animated film before which to plop your kids down, where any animated film will do. Don't do it. Save money and gas...go see 'Toy Story 3' for the twelfth time.None of that here. Just as men are men and women are women in the Old West, 'Rango' is it's own film. More 'Shane' than 'Shrek'. More 'Foreign Correspondent' than 'Finding Nemo'. It's gritty. Raw. Filthy. Surreal. Disturbingly violent at times. But with just the right amount of well-placed humor to break it up. Gore Verbinski's trademark pacing, put to increasingly awkward use in the 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' franchise, works surprisingly well here. Equal attention must be paid to animation director Hal Hickel and the ever-improving staff at ILM, as they trade firm handshakes with art director John Bell and production designer Mark McCreery in the successful effort to craft stunning, unforgettable visuals, accented by outstanding lighting, which puts the fruit of the current 3-D, hi-def craze to shame. The not-so-original, yet solid story receives further grand support from a sweeping score by the winning Hans Zimmer and the further contributions of co-producers such as Mark Bakshi. (Yes, he's related to that Bakshi. Those in the know need not hear anything further. The rest of you, get to Googling.) Everything about the film cries 'unorthodox', including the performance of a highly capable cast, who actually performed their scenes on sound stage, near-to-unheard of in animation procedure. Keep eyes peeled for humorous set pieces and important cameos. This is well worth your repeat viewings.So, head on west. But leave the kids at home to wrestle with PIXAR, DreamWorks, and the other juveniles of the terrarium.",8,1,6,4 March 2011
300," Testosteronicus Maximus Anno Domini
","In about 480 B.C., the actual Battle of Thermopylae was fought in the narrow pass of the same name, which inspired many persons to come after, from military strategists to artisans. In our time, one such person, provocative graphic novelist Frank Miller, was also inspired by the tale, and has in turn inspired director Zack Snyder to produce what must be hailed as two parts art, one part history, and a full seven parts wild, unbridled anarchy.The classic historical event is played out with a good measure of drama; as King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his force of 300 of the legendary Spartan army join with the rest of the Greek forces to hold the pass from the vast forces of Persia, his queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) fights her own battle on the home front, attempting to sanction reinforcements for her noble husband. Both heroes face incredible odds. Butler's Leonidas was not done justice by the film's trailers, which painted a bloodthirsty maniac--the actual portrayal shows a wise and cunning leader, as capable of understanding and forgiveness as he is patriotic and defiant to the enemies of honor and decency who rise against Greece. This of course makes for a fascinating character. Additionally interesting are the characters of the veteran Captain (Vincent Regan), proud to rise to the challenge alongside his son, and Queen Gorgo, willing to do anything to uphold the ideals of her husband, and of all Sparta. There are, of course, wild liberties taken with the account--although debauchery indeed ruled in Persia, and animals may have been larger, they were perhaps not so heavily armored, and King Xerxes, while intimidating, was not twenty feet tall. But, hey, it's art, right? It's a sure thing all of this takes a back seat to the stunning visuals, and the tremendous carnage of the battle scenes. Unless your clan views evisceration as a virtue, consider leaving the kiddies at home. Prepare yourself for a wild ride, with, mind you, the HINT of a history lesson.",6,10,23,9 March 2007
