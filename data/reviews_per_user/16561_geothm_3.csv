Iron Man 3," A lot of Tony Stark, not so much Iron Man
","Yes, I'm a little late to the Iron Man 3 party, but better late than never. I've had the chance to read a lot of other reviews to this title and I honestly find a lot of the criticism brought to it unfair.Yes, it is somewhat childish and not altogether compelling. They tried going for a slightly more mature feel, but it didn't really work. At least not in the way I imagine they had hoped it would.We get to see a lot more of Tony Stark out of the Iron Man suite, and we get to see more of Tony Stark period. His fears and insecurities in this -post New York invasion- world. RDJ plays brilliantly, as always, managing to add complexity to his beloved character.The plot, this is where it gets messy. Initially I enjoyed the idea of a villain who isn't evil just for the sake of it and who is somewhat integrated in the political struggles of our time. And then there's the plot twist. Which if you have seen more than, lets say, two movies in your lifetime you will be able to predict from early on. And from there on the movie doesn't expand properly, it doesn't give the appropriate amount of details or background to is characters.The visual effects are good, nothing breathtaking, but passable. I enjoyed the tech and watching the characters use it, even if isn't even remotely rooted in anything realistic.But most importantly, the movie is fun. RDJ makes you laugh at every turn and the truth is you enjoy watching Iron Man win over his enemies and get out of sticky situations, even if after a time his escapes become rather simplistic.",7,0,2,2 September 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Simple story, beautiful effects, amazing acting
","First of all, I have to say that I am not an old school Star Trek fan. Not that I have anything against the franchise, but I am not old enough to have been with it from the beginning and I somehow never found the time to pick it up from the start.That being said, I liked the movie. It wasn't awe sticking, but it was OK, if you're in the mood for an actiony SciFi. The plot isn't deep enough to generate a long analysis. The story is pretty straight forward and the plot twist (if that's what it was) is extremely predictable. Also, the movie kind of dragged on for me with long action, special effect riddled scenes. I realize that is part of the appeal for most SciFi movie goers, and the special effects where impeccable, but I usually loose interest during these scenes.The acting was amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch gave a stunning performance. Way above the standard for these kinds of movies, just going to show that he can really pull off any type of movie/character. The rest of the cast wasn't bad either, not at all, but it was my personal opinion that Cumberbatch sort of left them in the shadow.All in all it's not a bad movie to watch, especially if you're a Cumberbatch fan, but don't expect surprising turnings of events or thought provoking depth.",7,1,3,27 August 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Adorable movie!
","I absolutely loved it! I didn't know what to expect going in, but I ended up with a lingering smile on my face and a warm, fuzzy feeling on the inside.The story isn't very complicated, even though the number of characters might make it seem so. It's a simple story of love at an age where love is deep and life lasting, seen through the innocent eyes of a couple of children stuck in a world made messy by the mistakes of adults. They don't understand everything that goes on around them but they feel it all acutely.It's also the story of redemption, making the point that it's never too late to change your life and make it what you want it to be.The acting is very good especially surprising coming from the young actors which I, personally, hadn't seen before in anything else. I don't think that anyone needs telling that Bruce Willis and Bill Murray gave wonderful performances.This is definitely the movie for you, if you're in the mood for a slow paced love story that gives you time to think about it all and also gives surprising laugh-out-loud-by-yourself moments.",9,2,4,27 August 2013
