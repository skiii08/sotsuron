The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Poor acting? Slow and boring? Did we watch the same movie?!?
","I don't believe all of you commenting! When I watched this movie the other day I was blown away! I don't understand what your issues are. Allow me to retort on some of them.Long anticipated set up: well, yes, and I think it was necessary to cut the film into two parts. If it wasn't split like this there would be so many complaints on how so much from the book was cut from the movie, due to time constraints. Two parts works for this one as well, not just harry potter.The acting was amazing, on nearly all accounts. Jennifer Lawrence may have been slightly over the top, but in her defense, if I walked through my demolished hometown with hundreds of my dead neighbors' skeletons, you bet I'd be freaking the heck out. If my sister went back during an evacuation to save a cat and almost killed herself, I'd be freaking out.My point is her character went through a lot of troubles and everything is going horribly around her, her character is believable. Josh Hutcherson, fantastic! Liam Hemsworth, fantastic! I didn't see anything else that was wrong with the acting. (granted, i'm not a film critic and this is my first review).I didn't think the movie was slow-paced. It may have started slow and jumpy, but the rest of the movie had action, horror, propaganda, and then more action. Obviously, it's for set up to the big event, and I'm not faulting it for that. Technically, the behind the scenes aspects were well performed, and the original song was heartfelt and capturing.This is not just your common set up for the end, this movie stands out in a way that was similar to catching fire if not better! A must-see movie for the year! 3 1/2 stars! 10/10!",10,27,69,21 November 2014
