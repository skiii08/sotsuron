Kill Bill: Vol. 2," One of the best sequel of all time.
","Kill Bill Volume 2 has to be in the sentence with Aliens, Terminator 2, Evil Dead, and The Godfather Part II. this has to be one of the greatest sequels of all time. Quentin Tarantino hits it out of the park with his great storytelling, especially his dialogue.The movie begins with a flashback of the wedding rehearsal. This is the first time we see Bill, who was wonderfully played by Bill Carradine. In volume 1 we only saw actually never saw his face.This just as Pulp Fiction is a movie full of homages, from spaghetti westerns to giallo films. I see this movie more as an spaghetti western more than anything else. First, the music which was full of Ennio Morricone, it felt like the Dollars Trilogy all over again.Just like any Quentin Tarantino film this movie has great acting, great dialogue, and great storytelling. My favorite piece of dialogue was the 'Superman' speech by Bill.I rate this film 4/4.",10,36,75,16 May 2007
Spider-Man 2," Look out here comes the Spiderman!! (spoilers)
","Spiderman 2 directed by cult director Sam Raimi(Evil Dead Trilogy) has to be the one of the best comic book adaptations. this movie has it all romance, action and a great story.Spiderman 2 is without a doubt the best in the trilogy.In this movie Peter Parker is losing his powers because of an unknown reason. Peter goes into a clinic and explains to the doctor that he has a dream were he is Spiderman and he is losing his powers. The doctor response is 'maybe your not suppose to be doing those things.' Peter focuses on that and has a flashback were he is talking to uncle Ben. Peter decides to be 'Spiderman, no more.' That story is what made this movie great, and of course the fighting scene in the train with Doc Ock.4/4",10,4,5,16 May 2007
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse WOW!(spoilers)
","This has to be the greatest Vietnam movie ever made. Its not a surprise that the director of The Godfather I and II made again another great epic. The most memorable scene in the movie has to be the opening scene of the movie.The opening scene begins with just a shot of the Vietnamesse jungle with a helicopter going around the jungle. Then all the sudden napalm all over the jungle, with 'The End' by the Doors playing, that is just an incredible scene. Then again it comes to no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola has yet another great opening scene. The story is simple. Its about a Sargent Willard getting a mission to terminate a renegade Colonel named Walter E. Kurtz(Brando). The whole movie sets in the Vietnamese river, Williard is with U.S. army sailors. The names of the sailors are Lance, Mr. CLean. Chef and Chief Phillips. During the whole time Williard is reading dossiers of Kurtz including records he set in his academy. Willard is impressed of Kurtz's records and does not know why the U.S. army wants him killed. With Chief Phillps and Mr. CLean dead, Chef, Lance, and Williard go to their destination. Willard gets caught and he is impressed with the wisdom that Kurtz has. Then he now realizes why they want Kurtz dead. It's a human feeling, a temptation to be God.This movie is my top 10 period. Brando's acting is just awesome. What i like most about the movie is that surreal feeling it has to it especially at the end, when Kurtz delivers his famous monologue.4/4 'The Horror, the horror'",10,0,1,16 May 2007
Pulp Fiction," Best of the 90's (SPOILERS)
","Director/Screenwriter Quebtin Tarantino remasters the gangster genre with this modern epic set in Los Angeles. This movie is a non-linear story, the tagline says it, 3 stories about 1. The three stories are titled 'Mia and Vincent', ' The Gold Watch', and 'The Bonnie Situation'. This film is my favorite movie of all time. The reasons are the dialog which is pure perfection all the way. The directing is great. I don't mean Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese great, but its really good. The main thing is the acting which its incredible. Before this movie came out nobody ever heard or talked about Samuel L. Jackson or Uma Thurman. Bruce Willis established himself as an actor in this movie. this movie has written perfection all the way. People call this a black comedy, I have to agree with this statement. Some examples are Jules' cussing and Marvin's death which is pretty hilarious.This film deserves a 4/4 this movie is just all that and a bag of chips.",10,0,2,16 May 2007
