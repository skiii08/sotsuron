Saturday Night Fever," New York Man -Walk the Talk
","There is magic of the disco in the 70s, as a transition kid ( too young for the disco ) who's too excited to see my elder siblings dress up and go to the disco in their teased hair and Vanderbilt jeans, this film is heaven-sent to kids like me who love to dance. It was rated R in those days so I relied on the retelling of my sister ( who edited the explicit part ) to me until I was old enough to see it for myself. By that time the hype is over but the memory of me cutting this out of the newspaper as a 'gotta watch movie 'I know I made the right choice. I can not imagine any actor doing the dancing as John Travolta did. He is the swag jumping out of the dictionary, strutting, enchanting the viewer. It also has a realistic depiction of how the poverty, religious beliefs and hardship of the working class family was in those days. Also the recklessness of youth, the lack of communication between friends, blind ambition are universal topics of then and now. It has a shoulder-shrug ending which up to now many people didn't get so my one point deduction is for that.",9,1,2,25 May 2018
Vertigo," Showcase of Phobia, Angst, Love
","If I had a time machine, I would have loved to travel in time and have dinner with Alfred Hitchcock. If then why, Stan Lee must have been inspired by the cameo roles of Hitchcock in his own films that he decided to peg it. This is such a classic and to see Mr. 'Nice Guy James Stewart out of his usual mister nice guy roles, this is a good movie. There is such élégance to the ladies and gents of the late fifties early sixties, and James as an acrophobic guy who fell victim to Kim Novak's charm and was the fall guy to masquerade a criminal scheme is very humane in his portrayal. And for a bombshell, Kim can act. For all those who have the patience for traditional suspense, this is a movie one should put in his or hers to watch list.",9,1,2,26 May 2018
Training Day," Scary Denzel
","Denzel, the chameleon of an actor never ceases to surprise us. He played the character to the hilt to the point you wish him ill towards the end . This is in contrast with the tame, uncorrupted, idealistic character of Ethan Hawke. This film is violent and brutal. As we all know, many coppers out there can't be trusted as they are all part of the scheme. For a different side on the usual good guys Denzel played, this film is his Jack-in-the-box and he'll jump right at you.",8,0,1,25 May 2018
The Mummy," Mummy-fied
","This is a fun movie, especially Part 1 and Part 2 , did the trick for me. Forget Part 3, just don't delve in there. Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser have this crazy, neurotic chemistry perhaps owing to the somewhat on-the-edge character of Evie ( Rachel) and the dapper-wrapper , knight on a white horse character of O Connell ( Brendan) . The fx is on pointe. It jumpstarted me from my seat then and when I see it replayed, it is still good laugh after many years. When I go to the musea and there are sarcophagus on exhibit, I giggle inside as I am reminded of this film franchise in micro portions.",8,1,2,29 May 2018
Troy," The origin of the word Trojan Horse
","Many a younger generation asked me why is a virus called a Trojan Horse, for those who love Homer or had some Greek mythology subjects, it is a no-brainer and we know why. This film is adapted from the tale about the lovelorn Paris and Helen- the face that launched a thousand ships. But it has been given some imaginative adaptations that Achilles became the center of the story. For all the ladies out there flocking to the cinema because there's finally an excuse to see Brad Pitt again , this time pumped up, rugged, muscular, glistening in sweat it's worth the wait and weren't disappointed. Resplendent cast of actors and as the story narrator, the reliable Sean Bean. Entertaining and admirable.",8,1,1,31 May 2018
Deadpool 2," Hilarious as expected
","Deadpool fans have been waiting for this sequel, and yes , there is no deviation from the foul language, parody, cheesy one liners, hilarious one liners, action, laughter, tears and yes, drama! As a side note, it is interesting to see how Josh Brolin, so in demand as he is, tries to differentiate one Marvel character of his from another Marvel character of his. There are some tints but maybe that's the entire point as this is not the glossy, intense superhero like the first one , which many of the lead actors already portrayed in the past so there will be some mild confusion at one point. Indeed a new group of oddballs anti super anti super super anti heroes, it is entertaining and childish fun.",8,2,3,10 June 2018
The Terminator," Futuristic, Suspenseful, Pacesetter
","When you are barely seventeen and see this for the first time in an era without much tech as now, this film sealed my deal in being a lifelong Schwarzenegger fan. When a story is so original, you do not understand entirely what is going on, you can not blink and left in awe trying to grasp what this machine man robot means . The 80s is captured for eternal here, the big hairs, seedy discotheques, synthesizer and more. As this film is going at such fast rate throughout, one was wondering why the need to kill all Sarah Connor, thus only when Michael Biehn , savior of Sarah played by the unassuming Linda Hamilton came into play was it clearer. The effects , those days standards, were so good, a lot of people were screaming at the theatre thinking that the Terminator gets out of the screen onto us. Arnold Schwarzenegger is convincing and I can not imagine what happened if Dolph Lundgren got the role instead as it was rumored that he was offered the role as well. From the T1000 franchise, this is the story and special effects pacesetter of many action films to come.",9,0,1,27 May 2018
Alien," The Inventor of Scifi Horror
","With films coming at an AK 47 rate, seldom will an audience encounter anything like Alien ( all sequels are still as terrifying ) with all the gut-ripping, face-locking, seemingly more intelligent than humans creatures in a spaceship destined for doom. However , it is also interesting to note that Sigourney Weaver immortalized the character, Dr Ellen Ripley. When something is new, be it anything , a toy, a car, books , films - our curious nature is always triggered , with Alien our imagination and fear of what's out there has been called to the surface. A lot of cast members here went on to establish film careers as a result. If you're not a scaredy cat, this film must be in your library.",10,0,1,2 June 2018
Suicide Squad," The Ho-hum Squad
","I went to the movie theatre with my husband with very little expectations about this film and left feeling even less enthusiastic about it. The points I have given are for the effects and for Margot Robbie's acting. She's a tad exaggerated as Harley Quinn but appealing in her effort to justify her role. The rest of the squad looked like they had all been hired the last minute and did it for the obvious reason, in dollar signs. If there's a chance for you to watch it for free and you ain't got nothing to do then it's your risk. I normally don't regret anything but having spent my money on this ho-hum movie , I mentally crucified myself for that .",5,0,0,7 June 2018
Forrest Gump," The most beautiful, unusual love story
","Did I cry at the theater with a friend while watching Forrest ? Yes, we did . Did we laugh loudly at him during the ping pong game? Yes , we did. Did we feel his pain and struggles as a child and when Jenny died later on ? Yes, we did. My friend and me are one of those many millions who know Forrest Gump line per line. This film is not exclusive to the ladies only as a chick flick for I also happen to know many men who love Forrest Gump as we do. We can put the blame to Tom Hanks' majestic acting , or to Robert Zemeckis for his out of this planet directing, or just because this is the most beautiful, unusual story of love we have seen of this caliber. A brilliant film that needs no further introduction as it shines like the sun in our universe with its honesty and simplicity.",10,1,1,27 May 2018
The Godfather: Part II," A must see for all cinebuffs
","The Godfather Parts 1 and 2 is something that every self-respecting cinebuff must see, whether once , or again and again, there is no shame in admitting that something as beautiful book story from Mario Puzo reaches a wider audience through the silver screen.As it is told in parts how Don Corleone escaped the claws of vengeance as a young child in Italy ( the young adult played seamlessly by Robert de Niro) and ending up in Staten Island without a word of English after being rescued by good samaritans, to the memories of his mother being assassinated right before his eyes, then intermittent change of scenes with Michael Corleone ( Al Pacino) in the present day who already took the mafia helm from his father Don Corleone. Betrayal by your own kin, plotting for revenge at every opportunity, slowly and wyly eradicating all enemies, this film is THE film no CGI or modern tech can remake nor surpass. Superb acting by the cast and the haunting music that became known as the Godfather's theme. It is just marvelous.",10,5,7,25 May 2018
Predator," You one ugly motha.....
","Folks who have seen this original and its multiple sequels or spinoffs will agree that Dutch ( Arnie ) versus the Predator is unbeaten. When we see something new yet possibly and not remotely real, we know it is our money's worth. The jungle is also unfamiliar for many , even those soldiers and mercenaries. Suddenly the team of Dutch had been disappearing one by one. I am one of those who three decades ago can't fathom what species The Predator was, and the musclemen might not be big names as Arnie and Carl Weathers , still - this ensemble works for us , the audience , as they are building up the action and tension one by one for us. The fight scenario between Dutch and the Predator is the best to boot, with the mud camouflage washing out , the trap which that thing somehow figured out, and Dutch's short victory over it as he also has to run the hell out to save himself from the nuclear level explosion. Indeed there are exaggerations but never mind that, we still think of that film to this date and never get tired of seeing it over and over again.",9,1,1,27 May 2018
Léon: The Professional," Action with heart and drama and humor
","In retrospect, I am happy to say that I am one of those who welcomes technology but I am not a slave to it. I can only wish for the younger generation to have been able to enjoy like we did until FB came coupled with the selfie sticks. The movie watching generation of now are quite limited in what they see, surprisingly not because there were not too many films but on the contrary you have zillions of things to watch out of boredom and everyone can be a superstar in YouTube. Lamentably, they are not accustomed to films like this. The duo of a battered child and a hired gun is action filled, yet we laugh with them and cry with them. Natalie Portman as the young , slightly irritating Mathilda is gifted with talent. Jean Reno as the distant yet fatherly figure of a pro killer is captivating in his role. They and the plant will entertain you ( like it did for us ) .",9,1,2,27 May 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Long Live Queen!
","This film made me wonder about a few things, first - if Sasha Baron Cohen aka Ali G got the role would the story be much different from the version that it is now with Rami Malek, second- if Freddie Mercury was diagnosed at a later phase would he have survive to live today as is the case with Magic Johnson? , third - if the second case was true would Freddie approve of the ' sanitized ' version of his biopic. This film will make both Queen fans and non fans cry. Yes, I cry for the reason that there is no music like that today anymore, let alone no one can perform like Freddie and sounds brilliant as Freddie. As an impressionable student during the 80s, I have vivid memories of the Live Aid broadcast and the shock I had as a very gaunt Freddie performed with Queen onstage. I also vividly recall the scandals, gossips from former lovers, partners. Most of all , I am one of those millions who cried when Freddie passed on. Fast forward to twenty plus years later, now a middle aged person, I saw the remaining Queen members two years ago with Adam Lambert. There is a genuine longing for Freddie as there is only a legendary Freddie. This film will remind die hard fans how fast time flies. Rami Malek is stellar in his performance considering for a young actor he also acquired the nuances and movements. Solid internalization for someone who might have vague recollections of the band. Well written story for the big screen albeit cut short in some parts. Must see for 70s, 80s and real rock music lovers.",9,4,5,11 November 2018
Justice League," Just a League
","Through Apple movies we're able to save the headache and pain of rushing to the theatres plus all the shoving and stress when it's one of those surefire, bookies-predicted blockbusters such as this one.HOWEVER, this film could change the title to just a league, not Justice League. Glossy, action-packed,cheesy one liners and a stoïc Ben Affleck didn't do it enough for me. The Flash is somehow a comic relief provider and his character is rewritten to present a stereotype of an akward, nerdy teenager whose character is in arrested development stage. Entertainment shouldn't BE limited to special effects, can't wait for the next Batman to tug that cape from the present actor , enough said.Lower your expectations by a few notches, for any of you who hasn't seen this yet, perhaps that will be your saving grace.",6,0,2,18 May 2018
The Pianist," Survival of the human spirit
","Adrien Brody got the role of his life in The Pianist. It is not difficult to be moved when you see the imminent horrors of you and your family's possible death sentence for reasons you grasp but somehow silently protest to and however lost you are in such situations, you will try to keep your composure and be dignified as a family. As the main character moves in artistic, educated circles, he was able to survive through the help of caring friends and connections. But that is only for a limited period, then rough reality sets in, lack of food, sickness, being locked from the outside of an apartment, bombings, hiding , whatever you might do in order to survive. Thomas Krenschmann is highly credible , definitely he shone in his short albeit crucial role as the high ranking officer who due to his love of music sheltered Adrien during the end days of the second world war . One can't help but agonize with Adrien as he suffers , suffers, suffers and suffers. I was welling in tears as I was so moved until this film ended, only a stone wouldn't.",9,0,0,27 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Too much going on all at the same time !
","When we viewers have become slaves to a certain title or series, or a franchise with parts one to infinity- this is what we're bound to be served- A smorgasbord of headache on the storyline, camouflaged by fast pace CGI , that at one point you don't know anymore how A got to B and so on. There were definitely some moments worth the laugh especially on the part where Quill was trying to measure up to Thor and Rocket said ' you're just a sandwich away from being fat' . I guess Stan Lee at his age still wants to have his say as to what makes people love Marvel stuff. But the fanbase is not limited to geeks and nerds, there are also plain folks who can't fathom the hell out of the film, people sitting next to me yawning and or yelling ' GDI, there's just sooooo many things all at the same time . My own take is that when there's just too many superheroes in one story perhaps with the aim of letting the audience choose their fave one, this is what happens- majority of the audience leave the cinema more exhausted than the story itself. If the box office is the only thing that matters, then just go full throttle and put every comic character in the Marvel planet in all the sequels until the viewer surrenders from brainbleed.",7,1,4,21 May 2018
The Theory of Everything," Infinite genius
","Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking is brilliant. This biopic has given the layman an illustration of the universe master, Stephen Hawking, how he was as a child,as a student, as a lover, as a husband and as everything. For those of us who are in awe of Stephen and his works, this film is a pretty close depiction of the man and his defiance of his debilitating condition which makes us all wonder if he could have lived longer to see some of his theories proven true. An awesome, humbling film.",9,0,1,5 June 2018
Schindler's List," The Accidental Hero Playboy
","No one argues about the ingenuity of Steven Spielberg , if you first saw this film in the 90s, it is guaranteed you probably left the cinema in tears. It is brilliantly dramatized and shot , the actors shine , no doubt. However , some months later I read a lengthy article from Schindler's widow contradicting the veracity of Spielberg's film version of the events and then Spielberg even being interviewed admitting that he felt ashamed not having done more research hence my changed perspective about the film. As to what extent can we stretch the viewer's imagination to elicit empathy considering that this is a reboot of a film released ten years earlier. Ben Kingsley can take any role with his versatility so his underacting as the accountant deserves more accolade. Ralph Fiennes as the brutal officer is theatrical and Liam Neeson pulls off a surprise as Schindler.",8,1,4,7 June 2018
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," I am Benjamin Button
","If you loved F.Scott Fitzgerald , then you will love this film. This is because the portrayal from the book to film is excellent. It has wonderful cinematography and special effects, moreover, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett have galactic chemistry on screen . What is of prime interest to viewers is the reversed-aging process of Benjamin , who was born old and hideous and was dumped by his rich father at an orphanage where the kind lady raised him as his own. He has seen the elderly die , heard them tell out of this world stories, until slowly it became evident that Benjamin Button is the opposite of all of us- he gets younger literally as time goes by. Nowadays I always hear men when complimented on their new haircut or after shaving, ' I am Benjamin Button ' , the common phrase that is born out of this excellent , heartbreaking movie.",9,0,0,31 May 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Liesbeth Salander Forever!
","If you read the books, this film version will not disappoint you nor fail you. First I was very sad that Michael Nyqvist passed on so early. Noomi Rapace fell into Hollywood's radar because of this trilogy when she played the barbarically abused Liesbeth Salander and avenged herself and the very few souls she cared for and when she could she did with pouncing brutality. This is the crowning glory of many Skandikrimi wherein the viewer is not only taken to the cold and isolated region of Sweden where only God knows what one truly does when no one is watching, no matter how rich or reputable a family is. This film is beyond-the-grave brutal and complex. The English version was only limited to Part One ( Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara) mind you that the story is not limited to that one and does not end there. To grind your teeth and self-induce a breakdown the viewer must watch until the end of the third, only then can one piece what happened and who did what in the criminal web. It is also saddening that the author, Stieg Larsson died before completing the fourth manuscript, there's surely still a lot to come from that brilliant mind of his. Any cinematista ( my own word invention) should possess a DVD -book collection of this monstrous masterpiece of a trilogy.",10,0,0,30 May 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Who doesn't love Quentin Tarantino
","I want to give my thanks to Quentin , first , for bringing a comic book material and giving it a life of its own , second , for his visionary way of directing- meaning he pays tribute to the Chinese films we watch on lazy weekends where kids like us pretend play with wooden sticks pretending it's a samurai sword- , third - for the continuous and tireless experimentation , perhaps because of that only he comes with this brand of crazy- his unique trademark of crazy. I have seen all his films and this so far is my favorite dish from him ( including the second volume) . Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and Co. are all memorable and exciting to watch. But the combat at the restaurant is the most mental scene one has ever seen on a movie. Artistic , bloody action that leaves a lot to one's imagination because it is also collagen with comic book frames to somehow lessen the gore but still, full of humor ( the rhyming names, the wagon , the whistling) and a well of surprises for the viewer. Stu-pen-dous!",10,0,1,30 May 2018
Mission: Impossible," The best in the entire franchise
","So our dear Mister Tom Cruise found himself a golden goose by making a franchise of their borrowed, highly successful title. However in all those 5 or 6 ? parts, the very best for me is the very first one. Why - because it has many unforgettable elements that are still being re-enacted in comic acts, satire, action etc. Also the cast is able to showcase that mystery , that air of suspense that isn't there anymore in the sequels . What happened is that everyone has shifted their expectations of a flawless story into flawless stunts. It became a victim of its own succcess, just like with many other blockbusters. Tom Cruise , with all his running here, there and everywhere, has been and always is eye candy. Jon Voight as the ultimate nemesis is no surprise as the man has plenty of character. Vanessa Redgrave as Max has to be crowned as the queen of scenestealing because she owned the character, Max and Max owned her. Highly entertaining value even after twenty years.",8,1,2,28 May 2018
Some Like It Hot," A riot with the bombshell and the mental duo
","Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe completes the saying ' Three's Company ' and the results are bombastic. The gents, cross dressing by accident to hide from the mob ends up with a group of showgirls and both have fallen to the charms of the kittenish Marilyn Monroe. Who gets there first and win her heart, and how they managed to disguise it and to be exposed in the end becomes double riotous in each frame of this wonderful, fun-oriented , classic of a film. Proud owner here of a VHS copy.",9,0,0,29 May 2018
The Shape of Water," Somehow flawed, somehow touching
","Guillermo del Toro has built a formidable reputation as a director over the years, however I have some reservations about this film; First- When I saw the trailer for this film, I was reminded of the childhood classic ' The Creature from the Black Lagoon ' and ' Children of a Lesser God ' meets a gloomy little mermaid kind of familiarity sort of impression. Second- some of the actors have no character development so the viewer is left with the predictable protagonists outsmart the antagonists kind of pace. Of Olivia Spencer and Richard Jenkins , I can only say that these two are engaging actors albeit underrated most of the times. They are the most relatable actors in this film entirety as well. For some reason Sally Hawkins as the deaf mute can not elicit empathy from my general viewer's senses. This is because she lacks in her performance here the raw expressiveness that goes through an actor's eyes in a role like hers so that the lack of dialogue is not translated into intangible chemistry with the creature as was intended to be.
It's either you kinda hate this film or you kinda like it. But it's not the unforgettable type and will not make one stop eating fish immediately.",8,2,4,15 August 2018
A Beautiful Mind," A genius mind like no other
","Personally I have too many favorite films from Russel Crowe , with lesser known roles coming to mind but this movie makes it to my Top 5 Russel Crowe films because of his flawless, as in flawless portrayal of a math genius who is battling paranoia. It only takes a bit of a push button from ' conspirators' and his powerful imagination to create a mental havoc that takes its toll on him. Jennifer Connelly is also magnetic as the wife. This film is as beautiful and sad as it can be.",9,1,2,5 June 2018
The Departed," A Good Adaptation of the HK original
","As this has been adapted from the Cantonese version, naturally I had some idea about the plot. I must say, Martin Scorsese is a real master in owning a story which may not be his originally but he owns it by turning the story as relatable as possible to the layman on the street. Leo 's performance is alright but to me, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen have done a far effective job. Jack Nicholson for some reason, always shines - in here , as a psychotic mob boss . Matt Damon is commendable as a two-faced state police. For the untwisting of the twisted, it is recommendable to watch this again on Netfix or Amazon ( if like me you had the unfortunate noise of the cinema crowd who are most likely Leo cheerleaders )",8,1,3,25 May 2018
Mudbound," Before Equality there was this
","I am born free, and we are all born free. Why do we form biases and why do we have to think ourselves superior than others because of the color of theirs and our skin, or because of having money and worldly possessions give some people a self-entitlement and think the lives of others don't matter? Sadly, slavery is a part of history and we can not hide the fact that even the present generation still bear some ignorance towards this subject. Set before the second world war in rural America, this is a film about two families, one White, the other black. Both families had sons who served and survived and coincidentally formed a friendship in a small town laden with folks who are members of the KKK. Needless to say, there are complications and later on a tragic event occurred . The opening scène is a flashback, the story unfolded then back to that moment of flashback crucial to the survival of those involved. Depressing and painful, but bear in mind, slavery is never a joking matter. Well acted and realistic shots, the viewer gets transported back in time. Sometimes dragging but worth watching.",8,1,5,28 May 2018
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Masterpiece and courtyard of chaos
","Having seen this film when I was a teenager, I remember feeling very sad and oppressed after going out of the cinema with an aunt who absolutely adores films of any genre. At that time my grammar is not even as developed as it is now, but the actors have clearly succeeded in showing me a masterpiece, one that haunts a person forever.Some thirty years later someone gifted me a 'classics cinema pass ' and decided to see this film once more. It's as disturbing and mind boggling as the first time I saw it. Some scenes will make a person think harder and again and again as if entering a courtyard of chaos and institutionalized yourself. For the simple reason that many of the characters here are to be found in our daily lives. Don't look further as the saying goes ' the only normal people are the ones you don't know that well '.Jack Nicholson is for me in character, simply the 'Van Gogh of actors' .",9,0,0,18 May 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," M.A.S.T.E.R.P.I.E.C.E.
","What words can describe such a great film as this . Limitless yet I only need one to compare this film to da Vinci's Monalisa, with such art that the generations to come will still be talking about this film , dissecting it to see what worked for many of us cinema bugs..Tim Robbins' greatest role is here in this film , unsurpassed and for Morgan Freeman , the thunder who never strikes twice at the same place , it is also here. What will you do if you were convicted of a crime you did not commit ask yourself ? I for one, most likely would not have survived as long as Jake and the bird, or any of the wayward pack , yeah boy, do we admire them for their tenacity against the abusive guards, and please remember that this film is set on an era where the inmates and the internal guvs are not as thuggish like it is now for the last 25 years and so, maybe if retold in the modern settings no one would have survived , escaped , got pardoned and let alone rebuild their lives. It is as touching as it can be , as marvelous as real gold in your hands and as clever as you would like it to be. Definitely in my to watch again and again list.",10,0,0,27 May 2018
Raging Bull," Boxing Fanatics , watch and learn from this classic
","There is such an ambience in this film reminiscent of the great Charlie Chaplin, because what we did not hear from him, we understood through his expression and gestures. Here it is the eyes and enigmatic contact with the viewer that gave us the understanding of what goes on inside a troubled boxer's mind . As a boxing fanatic myself I have always wondered about the fall and rise of many boxers knowing that many of them , if not all , are from rags to riches. Dare I warn that this film is not like Rocky at all, so spin your expectations in another direction and let this film get into you, like it did with the heart of the viewer.",10,3,5,1 June 2018
Rear Window," Repeat watch this Classic
","As a Hitchcock fan, I am guilty of serial-watching his oeuvres. An engaging tale about spying on your neighbours, which perhaps many of us are guilty of, James Stewart and Grace Kelly are timeless on screen. Is it paranoia or is it real ? If you're hindered and your leg is on a cast, will you take note of every single thing happening around you which may be only baseless, unfounded fear? Is there a killer on the loose? What are you going to do about it? These are the myriads of questions you ask when you watch this film. I am one of those skeptics when a Classic such as this gets adapted and recycled ( e.g. Disturbia with Shia Leboeuf )since there was only one Hitchcock, one James Stewart and one Grace Kelly. Go be creative and leave this Classic film alone.",10,2,3,27 May 2018
The Matrix," Revolutionary
","When I describe this film franchise as revolutionary, I mean not only in terms of visual and graphics but including the storyline. For some reasons I tend to think that this film is George Orwellian in nature, like being controlled and oppressed, the fight and battle for freedom and the strength of mind over matter. However complex it is, especially the very first release, it is still appealing to the mass viewers as it also has a lot of action in it. Keanu Reeves in his past roles before this, always comes across as a surf dude, but I give him points that as Neo, there's a depth that was not visible before. There's also good team chemistry between him, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano and the nemesis, Hugo Weaving. The other actors also delivered brilliantly and the Wachowski brothers deserve a lot more credit for coming up with something extra ordinaire.",10,0,0,28 May 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Existentialist Vampire
","Anne Rice has written a real good book. But as a universal dilemma of book stories being adapted into the screen, there's always the danger of interpretation and it will either by abhorred or adored by those who read the novel. Such is the case with this film because in some parts , it was mellow acting and one can't help but miss the intense fear when reading it. The performances of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and the young Kirsten Dunst borders on the forgettable for I can not recall a scène that has left its imprints on me. Watch it for the reason that you might be asking yourself the same question, what is the purpose of an eternal life?",8,0,1,2 June 2018
The Breakfast Club," The Brats of my yesteryears
","I was turning eighteen on the year 1985 and seeing this flick for the first time I half appreciated it. A few years later, graduated and all, I caught this film replayed on the telly. Then it dawned on me that I really can relate to this film and started to fully appreciate it. What our high school memory collage is made of, it varies from person to person ; bullied, awkward, spoiled, brat, ungrateful, never satisfied, restless, shy, anxious, angstig, nervous, happy, sad, shallow, and all the oxymoronic description of being a teenager comes to mind. But a few years passed before I really reflected on this film, and yes I have changed and so has everyone. A lot of these youngsters, Estevez, Ringwald, Sheedy, Nelson, Michael Hall are just the same as me and my high school friends, some made it, some continue to struggle but one thing for sure, we're all trying to survive this crazy, cruel but wonderful world. As a rite of passage film, still relevant personas up to this day. For the younger generation, the music of Simple Minds is perhaps worth adding to your ' like ' list.",8,0,0,26 May 2018
Gladiator," I came, I saw , I conquered
","Veni, Vedi, Vici- the Latin phrase translated to I came, I saw , I conquered. This is a master collaboration, between Russel Crowe (whom I have seen in other roles before and as Maximus Aurelius is supreme) , and Ridley Scott, the revolutionary Einstein of film making and the phrase comes to mind whenever I see this film. These two are the men's men and Gladiator is a movie about rising and falling and rising and falling again but with dignity and passion. Another standout is Joaquin Phoenix who played the conniving, power-hungry, incapable, brutal, unpopular emperor who killed his father for the throne and framed Maximus and killed his wife and son for it. Who will ever forget, ' And I shall have my revenge, in this life or the next ' . I disagree with some commenting that this film is testosterone packed for this is a tale as true as it can be and it's not only about the fight scenes and action but more about our own mirror of moral compass , survival, honor and love. A two thumbs up movie .",10,1,1,31 May 2018
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Father and Son , Best Tandem on screen
","While I am addicted to many franchises , I reserve my critique to the part or episode which appeals to me the most. I do pick my battles hence to conserve energy and preserve my sanity as well, I do this selective critique method . The tandem of Harrison Ford as Indy and Sean Connery ( ah the man) as Indy Senior is such a hilariously insane , watermelon combination. Like a watermelon both men are hard on the surface but crack it and what you get is pink-reddish , sweet , succulent fruit, just like these two as Father and Son. The highlight with the Last Knight and the message of sacrifice for family puts a small internal tear with all of us viewers. Solid gold entertainment .",9,2,3,30 May 2018
Back to the Future," Sweet Lord, Doc Emmett
","I will bestow my personally founded awards night to Robert Zemeckis for he has given all of us the opportunity of how it might feel if we happen to be friends with a genius inventor ( brilliant Christopher Lloyd) , his dog , and what might or might not happen if we go back in time and try to change the past. Didn't we all fantasize one way or the other of having a time machine ( even a Delorean at that ! ) Michael J. Fox is a fit shoe as Marty and the whole cast blends in like a smoothie in a blender . I beg those souls especially the younger ones to watch this film and just enjoy. This is entertainment best defined no doubt.",10,2,2,30 May 2018
