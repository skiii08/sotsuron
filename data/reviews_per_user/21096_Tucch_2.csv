It," IT... (a paedophiles dream, a Scooby Doo fans nightmare)
","I'm not gonna play around, I'll just cut straight to the points. Things I didn't like:Pennywise (the clown) sounded very similar to Scooby Doo, imagine Scooby Doo, with a slightly menacing voice and you pretty much got Pennywise voice down. Seriously I didn't know whether to laugh or what whenever he spoke, don't get me wrong he was scary sometimes but most of the time I was laughing at how much he sounded like Scooby Doo or struggling to hear exactly what he was saying (on one part he even sounded like Daniel Day Lewis in 'There Will Be Blood')Some terrible acting from the kid that took the pills in particular, mixed with every character not being likable, except the fat kid, neither none of the kids being relatable, neither much bonding or growth between characters either, I don't think the black kid in the film even got a chance to speak did he? For real characters were weak as hell.The violence towards children & amongst the children was absurd & I'm not even a religious person. I've played violent games like Manhunt, GTA and watched movies like Natural Born Killers, all my life, so you could say I'm very desensitised to this stuff. Although even I thought the situations the kids found themselves to be in were just borderline satanic and added nothing to any kind of horror, art or creative elements, just pure shock value. It just seems asif many scenes were made to set the bar even higher of what things can be shown in films these days. You know typically in a movie, if it's like a home invasion scene for example they'll show a man shot, even a woman shot. But when it comes to the child, you just hear the sound of the gunshot and maybe see a small body bag later on. This film does not do that. Within minutes we see a child with his arm cut off, and later, we see the same kid shot point blank in the head with a cattle gun. By kid you might be thinking like some 14 year old who looks like he can pass for 17... Nooo no, i'm talking about a 5 year old here, 6 at the most. Is this the kind of entertainment you wanna see? Really? I thought people were overly desensitised when films like Hostel and Saw came out, I shudder to imagine the kind of things people will class as normal in 10 years from now. (Shocked the rating was a 15 to be honest) The fact other people haven't mentioned this and shot it down for this has annoyed me too, it's disgusting.Another message the film seemed to convey throughout was sex and profanity amongst those viewed as innocent. It was asif Hollywood's top paedophiles, Charlie Sheen, Roman Polanski, Victor Salva and the rest of the gang all got together and decided to make their dream film, a film where kids run around in their pants, shout obscenities every 5 seconds, & make sexual references every 10 seconds. And we're supposed to believe this is set in the 80's? Go watch an 80's film, people didn't speak this bad back then, it's like they wrote a script for 2017 kids, but their environment just looks 80'sish. I think they really failed to capture the spirit of the 80's with the script. I know 18 year old, 20 year old, older, younger with more restraint than these kids, it felt odd throughout the entire film with just how much bad language was said.Why was it that eveeeeery parent was a big bad wolf, I'm not talking 1 or 2 I'm talking eveeeeery single one in the film. Actually no, it was every adult now that I think back, from a sexual abusing dad, to the emotional abusing dad, to the black kids overly harsh guardian, to the main kids dad who we see in one scene talking smmmmack to his kid (and his mom who doesn't exist) to the kid who takes pills who's mom had this evil way about her, even the pharmacist was a full blown paedophile, who the young girl just knew would fall for her young charm, like am I the only one seeing this!!!! I saw it with my aunt, and we both saw it the same way. There was a very menacing undertone throughout this film that either... (A. People are too desensitised to see it. Or (B. People are seeing it but nobody is talking about it.I felt almost asif the film is a part of an agenda to desensitise people to paedophilia, something which, would not surprise me with all the things I've heard from Hollywood.All in all I gotta say, horror wise it was better that most the crap that comes out these days, it's got plenty of scares that come at a really balanced rate, it's not just clowns either, you got zombies, abstract things, ghosts, all sorts, so as far as that goes it gets a good mark. The overuse of CGI (which was expected for the director of the unbelievably terrible Mama) really let it down though in my opinion, I can't seem to find things that I can see too be computer generated as scary. To be honest I could go on and on about this film, the ending was terrible, some parts didn't even make sense. I'm baffled as to how it's almost made IMDb's top 250 films of all time to be fair. I gave it a 6/10 and with its disturbing undertones and it's debauchery, it's lucky to have even got that, maybe if the films wasn't so obviously a product of the ages we live in and it could have produced scares withing sinking to sick levels, I could have rated it higher. But nope, it's a low 6 for me.",5,2,5,5 October 2017
Blade Runner," Meh... Letdown
","I've seen this movie about 3 times now, and I'll start off by saying I'm a huge Sci-fi fan, as is my aunt, it's probably our favourite genre. Anyway she had never seen this film before so we both sat down and watched it together; afterwards she said exactly what I expected her to say 'how is that, one of the best films of all time?'I truly can't believe how disappointing it actually is, maybe if it wasn't praised so much, therefore living up to an expectation, we could have enjoyed it more? I don't know. Harrison Ford was the most boring, uninteresting character I have ever laid my eyes on, there was nothing about him that grabbed me ever. He was just so stiff and generic, one of the dullest performances I've ever seen, and not only that, he basically rapes the replicant Rachael, that was actually very uncomfortable to watch, and made me hate him when I saw how he treated her, basically telling her what to feel, absolutely sick.Also was Deckard a replicant? I saw the final cut version each time I viewed the movie and it's never really felt to be explained, it's dropped in there slightly but not really touched on? Or was my attention drifting from boredom, I don't know.I've gotta say, I loved the movie Brazil, The Thing, Matrix, Dark City, 1984, and I felt like this was a bit of a mixture of movies like that, but one with a really lack of story, a lack of a moral message, no social commentary, I just couldn't find anything in it, I'm baffled as to how it's so praised.I will say the soundtrack was sometimes beautiful, the sets were done very well and are really immersive (especially when you take age into account) and it was certainly different from any other movie of it's sort. Also Ruther Hauer provided a legendary performance, it's a real shame how little of him is actually in the film, same goes for Daryl Hannah and the guy that made the little dummy things. It's for the reasons above I gave it a 6/10 (61/100).All in all, All the actors and actresses that played replicants, we're superb, especially Rutger. Great sets, creative with some good music, I just found Harrison Ford to be a bore, the story was boring, the script was mostly boring, and I found very little deepness inside the film, just a letdown really...",6,4,9,30 September 2017
