Hereditary," What did I watch?
","The actors played a very decent role but the movie was just simply bad.
The movie takes a very slow beginning and in the second half people where laughing.It seems the critics are split in tho 2 parts, going from the worst to the best movie.",1,1,7,2 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What did I watch?
","Complete boredom dwelled upon me... there is no story or plot, just fragments of other movies and driving cars.
The terrible end is inline with the movie.",1,31,52,16 August 2019
