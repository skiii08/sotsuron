Sucker Punch," This movie should just be called 'Suck'
","There is really nothing redeeming about this movie. It is akin to watching your friend play a video game if he is on god-mode and won't let you have a controller. Sure, the chicks are hot, but so are Victoria Secret commercials. I was irritated watching it, and now I am getting more irritated talking about it. It has already taken up too much of my life, and I am done with this crap. This movie was lame. End of line. ... Or not, the editor just told me that I need to rant some more. OK, the chicks are unrealistically hot, all (but one) of them men are portrayed as over the top lecherous bastards, the evil step-father, the fat cook, the abusive guards, etc. ... The story is weak, the film is entirely a CGI-showcase (at least in 300 there was a historical account that the story was based on), and the character interaction is retarded. Can I go now?",1,5,13,23 June 2011
Skyfall," Walk. Take your base.
","I say that because I considered the last movie a complete strike, and the first one a tip foul. If you don't understand baseball references, that won't make any sense to you. Oh well. I would have been more impressed if this was Craig's first Bond outing, and this was the actual reboot of the franchise. I was at least amused, if not satisfied with his use of gadgets, cars and women. Yes, Bond is supposed to use women, and if you don't like that, watch something/someone else. The idea of him being softer, kinder and/or gentler is just plain wrong. Go for Jason Bourne, or Jack Bauer (interesting that they all have the same initials, no?) if you want the non-womanizer operative type.The cinematography is OK. Not as good as The Spy Who Loved Me, or For Your Eyes Only. But the shots of Macau are fairly breathtaking. The acting is good, but I will have to say that the gay scene should have been cut, and whoever suggested it should be beaten severely about the head and neck area. The plot is interesting, as it does not contain a global threat like in Moonraker or The Spy Who Loved Me. There were times that I really didn't care if the antagonist won or not.Overall, I rate this movie as watchable, and now important to the franchise as it contains introductions to characters of note. However, it mildly deviates from the time-honoured Bond blueprint. This could be more easily overlooked, if not for the last two movies. But this movie will be more important in the long run than Quantum and Casino Roale.I was starting to get irritated with the amount of attention that has been paid to 'M' recently, ever since the position was filled by a woman. It also seemed to coincide with the neutering of James Bond. I truly hope that we are done with that chapter.Good effort, but significant room for improvement.",4,2,7,17 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I can't WAIT for Rogue Two!!!
","Not because I know a lot of Bothans will die in it, but this movie was AMAZING! This was the Star Wars entertainment we have been waiting for at the movies. And I say 'at' the movies, because this movie deserves the big screen and Dolby. 3D isn't necessary, but it's a theater experience.The visuals are outstanding, and the story is compelling, although we all know the outcome. And the final scene with Vader is now one of my all-time favorite Star Wars scenes.On the downside, I am a little confused to the point of Stormtrooper armor. If troopers can be beaten with a stick, then what is the point of the helmet? We've also been told that they can't filter toxins, just smoke. And they clearly don't have any aiming assistance software. And the breastplates don't seem to stop blaster fire, so ... why are they wearing it? On that note, finally seeing some dirty Stormtrooper armor was kind of cool, as was some of the other sets of armor.The music wasn't John Williams. And those are my only two complaints.Everything else was awesome. I have a new favorite droid, and the new spacecraft were really cool, and well used. Also, it makes sense why they aren't present in the next 3 movies. The locales are very Star Wars-esque, and the fighting finally feels like this franchise should be named as it is.If you are a Star Wars fan, you want and need to see this movie. If you aren't, then ... we aren't of like minds, and Anyway, I rank this movie third in the series, and I have very high hopes for further Star Wars stories.",8,3,11,27 December 2016
The Danish Girl," Saw it twice ... it went from 'bad' to 'worse'
","I recently had to sit through this movie a second time, because my mom, my uncle and my aunt wanted to see it, and they didn't listen to my warning from my first viewing. Anyway, I thought it was a terrible movie, and it didn't get any better the second time around. In fact, it was even more annoying.He was selfish. Bottom line, no two ways about it. Once he started pursuing his wish/desire to become a woman, he neglected and abandoned his wife, and his job. At that point, a person is not a man, regardless of gender.However, she (the wife) displayed a remarkable amount of love, patience and devotion to her husband. She bent over backwards for him, and did everything he asked. Even the final act, which ultimately killed him.During the first viewing, there were several times that I forgot this was a period piece, but would be reminded by something in the background. To me, there is no story behind people dying from archaic medical procedures ... ESPECIALLY if they were advised against it by doctors. If Doc says no, and you do it anyway, it is not considered a 'tragic' death, by any stretch of the imagination.Ultimately, it seems that this movie was just trying to cash in on the Bruce Jenner situation. It didn't tell me a story that I felt needed telling, for any reason. It was not an entertaining movie, and it didn't educate me to anything I found relevant. I truly hope that I never have to sit through a single scene of this horrible film again. To summarize, I felt that he selfishly abandoned his responsibilities to pursue something that he wanted, and it ultimately cost him his life.",2,7,14,16 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," Reservoir Dogs in the West
","This movie bored the hell out of me. I really stopped caring about any of the characters at all fairly early in. I'm also really not sure what the point of 70mm was if most of the movie takes place in one room. A la ... Reservoir Dogs. Yeah, the scenic shots were beautiful, but ... that was a very small part of the movie.It ended fine. In the spirit of a typical Greek tragedy, because it was definitely not a comedy. Perhaps his art is lost on me, because I only really like one movie of his. The others are OK, but Pulp Fiction is the only one I'd go out of my way to watch. This didn't add to that list.I'd rather have gratuitous t&a than the violence. I'm not squeamish, but the poison scene was a little bit on the excessive side. Again, I feel that his art is lost on me, and his movies all feel very similar to me.I'm giving it a 5, because it wasn't terrible, but I'll probably never watch it again.",5,14,42,28 December 2015
Quantum of Solace," I want my Bond back ...
","James Bond seems to be on a serious decline, and this movie made it feel like more of a free-fall experience. Bond is supposed to casually and smoothly hook up with the most amazing women, and be unapologetic about it. He is supposed to have impressive gadgets and cool cars (he does show off the Martin Aston in the first scene, but then it's gone). He is supposed to have witty banter with Q, his Quartermaster. He is just supposed to be cool. I saw this in the theatre and felt horribly let down. Saw it again on cable and was reminded why I have seen every other Bond movie several times, but this one only twice. Someone neutered James Bond. Please please PLEASE find the jar with his balls and give them back. Sir Ian Flemming would be mortified if he knew what Barbara Broccoli had done to this franchise. ...",3,6,8,23 June 2011
Twilight," This movie is absolutely horrible
","First off, I have to admit that I was not able to make it all the way through the movie without using the fast-forward button. 45 minutes into the movie, the characters were completely undeveloped, and the storyline was not gripping, entertaining, or even vaguely interesting. Perhaps if I was a freshman girl in high-school, I could have identified with the main character better, but I'm not, so I was extremely bored and now irritated that I was watching the movie. The first part of this grade is based on it being a bad movie. Horrible effects, sub-par acting, and a yawner of a story.However, it gets worse. This story involves vampires, but does not follow any of the accepted stereotypes of vampiric lore. If you are familiar with anything written by Bram Stoker or Anne Rice, this movie will seriously make you want to bite someone in the jugular. Possibly even inflict bodily harm on yourself. Count Chockula makes a more convincing vampire than any of the vampires depicted in this film.Bottom line: This movie is a shining beacon for the demise of modern-day cinema. Not even worth the time to download. You will feel dumber after watching it.",1,8,11,3 November 2009
Non-Stop," Worth one watch, but has very little re-watch value
","It's a vaguely entertaining movie. It shows a little bit of character development and self-realization of Neeson's character, but it's very minor. It did keep me guessing about the antagonist, but I find this far from an excellent film. I fell asleep on it several times, and after I finally finished it, I deleted it immediately. I have no desire (at ALL) to watch it again, and it is hard for me to recommend it to people. It wasn't horrible, but it was far from great.Apparently this review was too short, but I really don't have much else to say about this movie. The plot was unique, but the plot holes and goofs were noticeable. The floating gun really bothered me, but that was near the end of the film, and by that time, I just really wanted it to hurry up and end.",6,0,1,9 June 2014
Unknown," Jason Bourne's retarded cousin
","This movie would have felt more original before Jason Bourne hit the screen, but we already have one black-op operative with amnesia out there. I truly wonder if anyone mentioned the similarities when this being proposed. Granted, there is a good plot twist when he is told who and what he is, but smart people would have noticed something wrong when he drives like a professional, and fights as if he'd been trained to. Just like Bourne. I did not find very many original concepts in this movie, and once I make the comparison to JB (sorry, I mean Bourne, not James Bond or Jack Bauer ... JB is just a good set of initials for this sort of thing I guess!) - I kept thinking that there was more ingenuity in the Bourne movies, and a lot more investment in character development. This movie is watchable. ... Barely. And I have no desire to watch it again.",6,25,33,23 June 2011
The Hurt Locker," This movie made me lose even more respect for the Oscars
","This movie is absolute garbage. First off, it is not a good depiction of 'life on the ground' from any aspect. Actually, strike that. There is one good scene in the movie. ONE. The depiction of looking downrange through a scope for a ridiculously long time happens and it sucks. That scene, I thought, actually captured the essence of what a crap job that is. However, the rest of it was absolutely ridiculous. Running off by himself in Baghdad? Get your head cut off. This movie has zero redeeming value. The fact that it won Oscars is proof that the Academy is an effing joke. War is a drug? Shut up. No it is not. Weed is a drug. Coke is a drug. Smokes and coffee are drugs. War is something that some men go through, and those who don't know anything about it ... should remember that.",1,12,16,24 June 2012
Grudge Match," A knockout of a non-boxing movie about boxers
","I found this movie outstanding. I do love Rocky and Raging Bull, but this was a movie about not letting go of things that hold you back. Like grudges. This is a movie about what is important in life, like family. This is a movie about what it means to win with honor, and to stand on your feet and be a man about it. I think a lot of people were expecting this to be Raging Bull 2, or the next Rocky installment, but that's not what it's about at all. It uses those two characters to convey a different message that is important for all. I highly recommend it.On top of it all, Kevin Hart provides a great amount of humor (because he is hilarious), and Stallone and DeNiro are veteran actors who are not past their prime at all. This movie is well-cast, well-acted, and original.",9,13,23,19 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," There is a reason there is no buzz about this film
","This movie was terrible. There was no advancement in the story line of Star Wars. The characters are all inconsequential, even in death. The women in this movie are all superhero amazing, and the men are bumbling idiots. Take that as you will. There is a new twist on the cantina scene, but I found it mind-numbingly asinine. The movie lacks continuity, and plot lines that are introduced go ... no where. On the plus side, I saw some (two) cool things with an X-Wing, but then a really dumb one for comedic purposes. However, I also saw a spacecraft use gravity bombs. Yes, gravity. ... In space. There is more ridiculousness that happens in space, but I won't spoil it. But, it was truly a jaw-dropping, WTF moment in cinema. It made me wonder if the people who wrote this script had ever seen a Star Wars movie before. The only possible way it could've been worse was if the Klingons had shown up, or if their warp drive needed more dilithium crystals or something. I saw Star Wars in the theater 40 years ago. I do not intend to see Episode IX, even on cable. I no longer care what happens in this story. Disney has ruined it.",1,18,27,25 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Top shelf
","Loved this movie. The characters are great, the plot works, the CGI is well done, the 3D is tasteful, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing.It is an all around entertaining movie, and that's supposed to be the point. It also ties in with the Marvel universe, so that is a nice bonus for anyone who has been enjoying watching comics come to the silver screen of late.Obviously, not all movies are for everyone, but this one has very few flaws, as far as I can tell. I (and most people) are avidly waiting for the next one. This movie could easily spawn several sequels at this pace, and I'd be quite content for a long time.Better than Star Wars? ... No weed is that good. Just stop. Star Wars will remain untouched, simply because of it's originality. Everyone knows what lightsabers and X-Wings are. And MOST of the cast. Nothing will ever be better than Star Wars.Back to this one. Hell yes. If you haven't seen it. Do so. It's good alone, and great for a date.",10,3,8,16 May 2015
The Hangover Part II," Laughed a LOT
","This is a good sequel. It keeps the same flavor of the original and provides lots of laughs. Some people in my theatre got offended for the people of Bangkok; but in asking her about it, she told me that she'd never been there, and ultimately admitted in the elevator that she didn't know what the hell she was talking about. Her boyfriend let me grill her, which was even more amusing. If you are easily offended, then please keep your ass at home. This movie is not for you. It is more of a guy movie to show what happens when repressed guys have a chance to absolutely cut loose. Good fun, which is what movies are supposed to be.",8,1,2,23 June 2011
Elysium," Bad. Just bad.
","I REALLY wanted this movie to be better. I got suckered in by the previews, and that always irks me. I really like some of the visions Blomkamp has. His exoskeleton suit was awesome, but I really don't think they bothered to explain why it made him faster, stronger, etc. I have seen more than my fair share of sci-fi, so I didn't need much explanation, but my date didn't get it at ALL. The Kalashnikov was cool too, but I'd rather just see a movie of all of these things in action, the whole time. The back story was ... bad. And some of the important technical aspects of the sci-fi seem to have been overlooked. How did the people on Elysium breathe? There didn't seem to be anything keeping the atmosphere in the ring. Even with the weapon advancements I saw, I don't expect a shoulder fired missile to be able to take down a target almost 20 miles away. If that existed, why aren't people just taking pot shots AT Elysium whenever they are having a really bad day? How did she establish a no-fly zone? Did she just tell everyone to stop flying, and they said ... OK? If her daughter hadn't been sick, would that have meant he wasn't inspired to go to Elysium? I could go on and on, but it seems like it was just poorly written, and the '4' I rated it indicates my feeling on it.I would love to see Cameron and Blomkamp work together. I really like some of the vision they bring to the screen, but Blomkamp needs to step back and quit trying to tell us about poverty in South Africa. We get it. And you suck at story-telling. And as much as I liked him in D9, it was really hard not to find Kruger almost like an unwelcome houseguest.Not a good date movie, because the movie was just bad. We both left the theater with an odd look on our faces. ... I wish we'd gone to see Pacific Rim, instead.",6,1,3,26 September 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Nothing to see here, please move along
","I found this movie painfully boring. I specifically wanted to see the raid scene, so I made sure I was awake for those thirty minutes, but that was still boring. I understand that the raid happened at night (hence the name of the movie), however, a director isn't supposed to have shots that are almost pitch black. So the final thirty minutes is a combination of night-vision shots, and no-vision shots. The two hours before that is interrogation, or looking at films. And some random conversations between characters that have a forced interaction with each other.Chastain is a horrible actor. Bigelow is a worse director. Neither of them should be nominated for anything, but they will because they are women, and because of the subject matter. I do not feel that all of the events in the movie are properly tied together, and it simply drags along in places. The best actor in the movie was Jason Clark. Everyone else was fairly wooden. Chris Pratt is hard to shake from his Parks & Rec role, so I am not sure that I buy him as a DEVGRU team leader. At all. However, it doesn't really matter as the SEALs have a fairly minor role in the movie. You see them get the op, and you see some first-person shots from them in night-vision during the assault. Which, as I said, is painfully anti-climactic.Now, some of the reviews here are all caught up in the use of torture or 'coercive interrogation'. I, for one, have no problem with it whatsoever. I remember the way that I felt on September 11, 2001, and if an individual had anything to do with that in any way, shape, or form, then water boarding would be the least of his worries from me. So, I don't find that this takes away from the movie. My problems with it lie elsewhere.I was not entertained by this movie, and I never plan on seeing it again. I sat for 2 hours, waiting to see the part of the movie that sounded the most interesting, and that was like watching paint dry. Bigelow missed harder here than she did with Hurt Locker (which, I thought was misguided garbage through and through. ... War is a drug? Oh please. Validate that statement please. ... That's what I thought.) and there is nothing redeeming about this film. It is a waste of time, and sure to cause your legs and/or lower back to cramp.",1,49,115,29 December 2012
Arrival," boring
","I see several reviews touting this as a 'great' sci-fi film, but they are lying to you. This is not the next 2001. It isn't even Interstellar. There is very little redeeming about this movie. The dialogue is forgettable. There are no special effects to speak of. The aliens look like finger puppets. Literally. And, if the big reveal at the end truly wows you, then ... you are probably too simple to have read this far in my review.Nothing to see here. Move along.Apparently, I need more lines of text to tell you that this is a boring, bleak movie. It took me more than one attempt to finish it, and I got absolutely nothing out of it. I will never watch this movie again, and if anyone asks me directly about it, I will attempt to warn them away from it.Boring, boring, boring.",4,18,36,16 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is still asleep
","I, like many people, saw the original in the theater. Also, like many people, I waited in line for an unmentionable amount of hours to see Episode I, and then trudged through two more. So, I went into this movie in a fairly familiar state for a lot of fans. Also, I'd like to point out that I did like this movie. However, most everything in my review is going to be negative. The rating score is being inflated by nostalgia, which originally had me ranking this movie as a 9 or a 10. But, in conversations with other fans, and on re-viewings, I have since adjusted the score. The good: It's Star Wars. Definitely felt like a Star Wars movie. SO much, that this bullet point is going to appear in the next paragraph. There were some cool new X-Wing visuals, and you see the Falcon basically doing the asteroid belt evasion scene, but through a junkyard. OK, every good point is obviously going to be tainted by it, so we might as well move on ...The bad: It's Star Wars. We didn't get a new story. At all. It's been almost 40 years, and we were just retold a chapter? On one hand, I wasn't let down like I was in Episode I, but I would have enjoyed some originality. Somewhere. We got almost identical terrains as we have seen before. Tattooine was replaced by Jakku, and Hoth was replaced by the surface of Starkiller Base, which was clearly the Death Star 3.0. Even the 'new' characters are not new at all. Rey is the Jedi side of Luke. While Poe is the pilot. Finn is Han Solo, and BB-8 is R2-D2. Maz is the new Yoda, Threepio hasn't changed. The plot? Hide plans in droid, get them to the Rebels ... err, the Resistance. Blow up big planet killer through the one point you can. I've seen this movie before. Loved it, but I've seen it.A lot of people argue that the characters WILL be good. I don't care about what might come to pass, this is a review on what I saw. We can discuss Episode 8 when it comes out. As of now ...The villain is a pussy. Think about how intimidating Darth Vader was from the first time you saw him, up until he had the Emperor over his head. Kylo Ren inspires none of that. At ANY time. And he cried. I found him better at comic relief than a terrifying villain.Rey is a great example of a Mary Sue character. She can do absolutely everything, and yes ... it feels like she has been made into the next Disney princess because of grrl power, and I have a bad feeling about it. For the most part, I liked Finn, but he IS a traitor. He broke his conditioning at the sight of his mate's blood, but then he had no problem firing on his other mates with a cannon. I hope he gets some training, gets stronger, and gets the chick. But, we'll see.I did NOT like the new droid. BB-8 is a horrible replacement to R2, in my opinion. First off, it's propulsion method is completely illogical. It looks like they designed a cart before the horse. For instance, place a bowling ball exactly where you want it, and do the same thing with a book, or a shoe, or a anything with say ... a FLAT surface to surface contact point? Now, start adjusting the angle of that surface, or ... it's friction coefficient, to simulate ice, or even just a wet deck. How did that thing move across the sand? How was it supposed to get back up those stairs it went down? I have no problem with electromagnets, but if the droid loses power, does that mean the head detaches? It was designed to be cute more than functional, so I do not like it. It's basically a new Ewok.Captain Phasma was as much of a let down as Maul in Episode I. I expected a lot more coolness from the Cylon/Stormtrooper crossover that I thought I saw in the previews.No new spacecraft? In fact, we lost some. No A-Wings, B-Wings, Tie Interceptors or even Bombers. Wait, sorry. I guess we got to see the new landing boats, which were pretty cool and provided an interesting LST-type viewpoint as the Stormtroopers landed in a hot LZ.I don't really understand who they are 'resisting'. It's only been 30 years since they won, and how wrong could it have gone? Maybe they shouldn't have overthrown the established government if they couldn't actually control the galaxy. But, it feels like the enemy is the same as it was before, so it's almost like going back to Iraq or something.The ugly: All in all, I loved it the first time I saw it, but that feeling has waned. I realize a lot of it was nostalgia, but I wouldn't call this movie a strike. It was just a tip foul, like RotJ (for those damn Ewoks). Episode I was three strikes and three outs all in one swing, and II and III didn't do too much better. I have watched it more than once, and I do plan to watch it again, but it's not a complete movie. All of the characters, the plot and the story all heavily depend on Episode 8, and that's obviously not out yet. So, to quote Fan Boys ... 'what if it sucks?'",4,5,12,23 May 2016
Flight," Outstanding movie
","The movie is not well showcased by the previews at all. However, if you find Denzel Washington at least a 'good' actor, you will be very entertained by this film. Personall, I find him an exceptional actor, and I thought the acting was top notch throughout this film. I found the character development believable, and the overall plot engrossing. However, I made the mistake of watching this movie before flying from LA to Seattle, and I strongly advise against anyone EVER doing that. Do NOT watch this movie, and then get on an airplane. You will have a horrible flight. Now, if you do not have any air travel planned in the next 24 hours or so, this is a movie worth watching. I always like Washington in movies, and I thought that John Goodman and Don Cheadle played excellent parts as well. Solid film.",9,1,3,26 November 2012
The Hangover Part III," Barely belongs in the 'Comedy' genre
","I barely broke a smile during this movie, and rarely laughed. The plot is poor, and the humor is non-existent. The plot holes make it cringe- worthy. (spoiler: how could he lift the bags full of gold when he couldn't swing a sledgehammer? ... then. why didn't they immediately use said sledgehammer to drop a wooden door while he was dragging 21 MILLION dollars worth of gold bars to the car?)The movie doesn't hold true to the title, which is the format of the first two. Actually, the title is misleading in and of itself. It's never been about hangovers. It's been about black-outs. ... But that isn't the point. This movie didn't have a black-out scene until the very end, and I refuse to accept that I watched that whole thing as just a build up to that final scene. (another spoiler coming up) Speaking of that final scene: if you know anyone who ever got a boob job, and you were around during that first week, you were probably watching the end scene with a raised eyebrow. It is clear that they were trying to out- do themselves from the second one, but ... do it in a way that makes any sort of sense. That was just dumb.I didn't find the 2 fat people mating funny. It was just awkward and ... whatever. Two social rejects who talk horribly to their mothers and have Type-2 diabetes. Not comedic gold to me.I gave it a 2 because it could have been worse. Not by much, but I DID chuckle when they realized they were going back to Vegas. Other than that, I was completely unamused. Deleted immediately and will never watch again. Horrible end to the trilogy, in my opinion.",2,2,4,26 September 2013
Spectre," Refreshing change of pace from the last two Bond suckfests
","I consider myself a Bond aficionado, and I truly enjoyed this movie. It started off a little rocky, as I had a problem with some of the video-game physics that you see in the movie. First, the helo (helicopter, whatever you want to call it) doing barrel rolls is just ... dumb. Anyone who has been in or around helos knows that they just can't operate inverted. It simply would have crashed, and weed whacked the crowd on it's way down. However, my date didn't notice this, as she has never been in or around a helo. So, maybe only horribly bad to a limited portion of the population. Second, the Jaguar going down flights of stairs bothered me as well. I'm guessing that vehicle has a ground clearance of about 20mm (I can't find any specific specs on that car, but that is standard for supercars, and it definitely didn't look lifted or modified), and that just ain't going to work down a flight of stairs. I can accept the Aston-Martin, because it was modified for an agent, and they are filled with all sorts of tricks and goodies, but I would have expected to see a broken in half Jaguar after that little excursion around Rome. Again, not a deal-breaker, but it made me scoff at the screen during that part.Third, the restraints opening up because of the watch-bomb. ... Why? If they were previously locked, and the controlling terminal is now offline, in what possible situation should they disengage? I know it was crucial for the plot, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.Fourth, and finally, then unloaded handgun. This always bothers the hell out of me, and I demonstrated it on my date after we left the theater. I handed her my gun, and told her to notice the weight of a loaded gun. Then I cleared the chamber and removed the magazine and gave it back to her. Again, I told her to notice the weight, and I asked if she'd be able to instantly tell the difference. I carry a Glock 17, and 18 9mm rounds are notably HEAVY. Unmistakably so. There is absolutely NO way that a person can pick up their own weapon, and not be able to tell if there are bullets in it, or not. MAYBE, the one round in the pipe, but the weight of the stick balances out the weight of the weapon. They become very VERY front heavy with no ammunition. However, again, this is probably not something that is obvious to people who do not handle firearms, as I had to demonstrate it to her when we got to the car. But, to someone who HAS, and frequently handles firearms, it is painfully moronic when movies or television take that route.Now, the good. I like that Bond 'got' the proper amount of girls. One is absolutely not enough. Three is just right. I like that he 'got' a Bond car, especially a prototype one. I am starting to feel a lack of gadgets over the past few movies, but I am willing to overlook that one more time. I got used to that quick tour around Q's office where you got to see gadgets in development. Yes, it was usually comic relief, but it was part of the Bond ritual. Hopefully, we'll get back to toys and tricks in the next one.I was over-the-top impressed with the white cat, and immediately following that, Ernesto Blofeld revealing his name. I liked how they made SPECTRE feel like the sinister organization that we all remember it to be. I feel that the efforts done by M and 007 should have legitimized the double-0 program, and would ideally make MI-5 and MI-6 separate entities again. (Although, being an American, I have no idea if those two agencies cooperate better or worse than our FBI and CIA elements.)I liked it. I thought the story was good, the plot moved at an appropriate pace, and the characters were who and what they should be. Possibly a bit much of Moneypenny, but it was integral to the plot. The scenery was gorgeous (Austria ... I'm talking about you.), and the action was engaging and not too cartoonish. (Although, 007 hitting a helo engine from an unstable, moving platform ... at night, was a bit much. At least it took him several shots, but ... .32 cal is not usually considered an effective or efficient way to take down aircraft.)Well done. It was a great connection of the old and the new, with the final exclamation point being Bond driving off into the sunset in yet another beautiful car. tl;dr - I found it campy at times, but I saw Moonraker in the theater, so I could handle it. I thought it stayed true to the legend of Agent 007, and I will absolutely go see the next one.",8,5,11,18 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Absolute garbage. Another franchise in the crapper.
","I grew up with Mad Max, and The Road Warrior, and I apologize for Thunderdome. I was 13 when it came out, so I was clearly a target demographic. But that one was to save the kids, and now we're saving the chicks.Yes, I heard all the uproar when it came out, and it concerned me. I also remember watching the previews with an arched eyebrow, and ALL of those fears came true. The flamethrower guitar is ridiculous and pointless. Just dumb. Mounting your blood-donor to the front of your car, and then using nitro? Seriously? Hogtie him, and throw him in the back-seat, or the trunk. Isn't it important that you keep him alive if he is giving you a constant blood transfusion? But, it looks cooler if you strap him to the hood, and don't put any eye protection on. It's just a desert. No rocks, or dust or anything.Every single time a woman bit it, there was a stop in action to reflect on the loss. EACH time. When the preggo chick fell, it affected EVERY cast member in the movie. It was TRAGIC to lose a woman, but dudes were getting offed a mile a minute. And their clothes stayed amazingly pure and white throughout the movie. Every male in the movie is either horribly flawed and evil, or exists to serve the women. Max and the kid are the only 'good' ones. At the end, the benevolent women turn on the water for everyone. ... In, what has got to be, the WORST water-distribution system in existence. I'd like to believe that Joe was actually rationing a limited supply of water, and now these silly binks have just made the world's largest mud puddle for a week.This movie did not remind me of the first two, at all. Yeah, they had the double-barreled shotgun with the dead shell. Whoopie. Did that one-armed chick, really hold a guy by his leg for a couple of minutes, while crushing a speeding car between her rig and another? Mmmkay. He weighs, what? 200 pounds? And she's going to one-arm it, with her robot arm that is strapped on? Wow.I am VERY glad that I refused to see this in the theaters. This is not something that I would have liked to contribute to. Thanks BitTorrent, because I would have been IRRITATED to have paid for this crap. I did notice that the commercials for it stopped pretty much as soon as it came out. That usually means it's all promotion hype, and that usually means a mediocre experience at best. I was so bored and uninterested at times, I put it on pause and went and did other things. I was never glued to my couch, and I felt that I was struggling to finish it.Craptastic. On ... just about every level. Should have been titled: Mad Max - Chopped & Screwed.https://youtu.be/6sk5IuIjr1E?t=50",3,67,140,23 June 2015
