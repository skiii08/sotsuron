Black Swan," Perfection
","If you follow the director's movies, you know what to expect already.The movie is complementary to his earlier Requiem for a Dream and Wrestler, exploring what it takes to follow, repress, or give up on your dreams. It's visually stunning, frequent with beautiful and haunting scenes. The acting is superb, accompanied with great choreography and sounds. This is probably director's finest execution to the time. He reminds us the dark side of pursuing the dream. Unable to let it go, we may keep struggling, no matter the costs.We may continue, sometimes for many years, overlooking destruction we cause not only to our relatives, but often to ourselves. Hoping it is worth an elusive moment of an achievement.This movie will not work for everyone, sure. But if theme of a dream resonates strongly in you, I would recommend to watch it, along side with Requiem for a Dream, with gentler approach to your's life.",9,2,3,8 May 2011
