Requiem for a Dream," Seee it and don't forget it !!!
","I voted with 9 not because i like that movie no i hate it . But no i think that everyone must see it once in his lifetime and its better to watch it min 18 and max 25 years old!!!! Watch it and understand that there is nothing absolutely nothing in this 'shits' There is no life with them there is suffering and hell !!! Think about it do you really wont to live trough two hells .....this movie has remarkable script and the acting -can not be better!O i almost forgot the camera experience can make you crazy ,it is really hard to watch the detailing pictures that they are showing, but do it -dont mist any second because you will not see this movie twice i am sure .Be warned that this movie is not for everyone .",9,0,1,30 April 2005
