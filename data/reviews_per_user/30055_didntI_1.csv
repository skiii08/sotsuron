The Benchwarmers," Stinky
","The storyline just blew. It had all of the right people but the jokes were terrible. Why would it be such a big deal for the older guy to become a member of Tim Meadows team when it had been 3 adults versus all young kids the entire time? David Spade was good like always but even his jokes could have been funnier. I felt as though I was watching Napoleon Dynamite the sequel. This could have been a lot funnier if the jokes were made to be more crude. For example, the constant reference to Rod Schnieder's wife's ovulation cycle.. since it was possible to include that in the dialogue, why not other things that would have actually made me laugh. I give this a definite 2 thumbs down.",1,4,9,9 April 2006
