Blade Runner 2049," Too silent, too shallow, too boring. Good visuals tho!
","I didn't get those long silent shots which happened way too often. Usually when something like that happens I go through in my mind the feelings of characters and the philosophy behind them, not this time. Felt like there was nothing to work with.
Shallow characters. Long sneaking scenes to a plot point (can't say twists) which can be seen coming mile away. There was not a single shot that stayed in my memory scene wise, except the glorious vistas and view of the cities. Visually Blade Runner 2049 rocked, but there was not much else.",3,3,6,25 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Finally a movie that has a heart and warmth and brings nostalgia to ones mind.
","I dare to say that this movie, considering modern day standards can be compared to movies like for an example Star Wars (1977) and Indiana Jones (1981). I would have never thought that i'd see movies with such high entertainment value as those ever again. It is so rare to see movies with such likable and identifiable characters and so well thought pacing. This movie had me thinking movies of my childhood and what makes them so unique, and at the same time had that something fresh what i've been craving for so long. The team of heroes is very well balanced, although some of them steals the show sometimes here and there. I think the reason why i compared this movie to Indiana Jones and Star Wars is that the humor between the characters is quite similar most of the movie.I was a little disappointed on the main antagonist though. And some jokes were a little out of place considering the overall spirit of the movie. For those two things i lower my score from ten to nine.This is the the roller-coaster ride of this year emotion-action-humourwise!Ps. Rocket Rocks!",8,1,5,5 August 2014
Midsommar," The best movie I've ever seen, and which I will never see again.
","Right from the start of Midsommar we are introduced to the traumatic vision of Ari Aster, which feels a little too realistic for just being fiction.
It is as if Ari had first hand suffered the things that happen in the movie, not the cult part, but pretty much everything else.There were couple of scenes that disturbed me down to my core on a personal level.
This is not a horror movie in a traditional sense, instead of fear you end up feeling traumatized and a little bit dead inside (this might be due to my experiences in my real life.)Ari has really created something unique.
He has pushed horror as genre drastically forward. After seeing Midsommar, all Hollywood horror movies with their unnecessary cheap jump scares feel like nothing.Midsommar was perfect vision of dread, hope, and in the very end, twisted deliverance.",10,4,14,25 July 2019
Prometheus," Underrated masterpiece.
","Oh boy, you people bent on hating this marvelous piece of art. I have grown to like movies, which won't spoon-feed you every little detail of the plot. I'm one of those people that like to get their minds working and processing the thing they are seeing every second of the way. Only thing which had me little confused me a little was part where two main scientists took their helmets off although the atmosphere wasn't necessarily safe to breathe. Aside from that, Prometheus succeeded in creating a grandiose beginning for xenomorphs, expanding it to even bigger galactic proportions. There is so much more to do now with the alien-mythology that i can't even begin to think where they are taking the franchise. I hope they make good use of the now expanded universe of the xenomorphs.So about the movie, Prometheus is visually stunning, well written, and keeps you asking questions with more often than not giving you answers to them, it doesn't undermine your intelligence. I understand if some people don't like this kind of approach though. Prometheus has intense scenes which are on par with the original alien, like the surgery pod scene, i rarely get to see such realistic and gritty scenes in movies, though cgi could always be better. I could go on for miles about the glorious visuals that should be already enough to see Prometheus, but i think it is better for you all to go see it for yourselves. If you decide to see this movie, you should watch it as a beginning of something greater and a premise to bringing something a little forgotten, aliens, back to life.",9,3,8,25 December 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," I don't understand actionmovies nowadays.
","I was sure that this movie will be spoiled with Mclane being a superman, what was that truck vs. Harrier thing? Every minute of this movie i felt like the the plot was written considering the action scenes. I Still wait for that action movie which will satisfy me with it's plot, because i think that good action movie isn't all about action. I think that plot has to be good too for it to create the suspense, reflecting itself on the action, and by this improving the action scenes remarkably. But all that i have seen nowadays are like this one, boring, full of cgi and billion dollar budget ;), leaving the suspense miles away. A sentence that describes this movie and many new action films: 'You can't buy emotions.'",3,3,5,23 August 2007
