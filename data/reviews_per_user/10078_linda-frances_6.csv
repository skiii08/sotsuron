Saturday Night Fever," Relevant at the time
","I saw this at the cinema when it came out in 1977, I was a teenager and it was a reflection of the youth and disco era at the time. It was my era, the clothes, the music, the attitudes, spot on. John Travolta made his name with this film, the BeeGees came back into prominence with their amazing soundtrack ( I had it on cassette) numerous men donned the famous white suit, it was a sensation. Now when I watch it, it looks so dated and surprisingly Travolta's next film has gained more prominence in recent times, Grease, but Saturday Night Fever will always be up there for me, a nostalgic film for me now, but it was great!",10,1,2,11 August 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Disappointing
","I'm a huge fan of Queen and Freddie Mercury was such a legend, his loss was a tragedy to the whole music industry, so I was so looking forward to this film, but for me it falled flat. The music, of course, was the only saving grace and the clip at the end of the film with Freddie singing 'don't stop me now' was the best part. The actors looked like a badly scripted tribute band, Rami Malik's teeth dominated his face and just annoyed me. Brian May's part was just boring, the story was uninteresting and lacked depth and drama, so disappointing.",5,1,2,21 September 2019
Bird Box," Great psychological thriller
","I don't understand the poor reviews, it was a great psychological thriller. Sandra Bullock was amazing in the lead role and the kids just broke your hearts. I think it was better that we didn't actually see the things, added to the suspense.",10,2,6,30 December 2018
Titanic," Too much emphasis on a love story
","I live in Southampton, the city where Jack and Rose embarked on the ill-fated Titanic. Many of the crew and the captain himself were from Southampton, many women were widowed and children left fatherless when the ship went down. It was a major tragedy for our city and my children went to school with children who descended from those who lost their lives. I felt a certain lack of respect was shown at times for the English crew, portrayed as bumbling and rude and this is unfair to the families left behind. Having said that the film was spectacular and I don't begrudge the love story of Jack and Rose, but when the ship started sinking I wasn't interested in seeing Cal chase the lovers through the ship, more attention should of been given to the disaster itself, the other people on board, but I still give it an 8 cos it made me cry.",8,3,5,16 July 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," Not for me
","I wanted to like this film, as I'm a fan of Dicaprio, but I didn't like his character from beginning to end, he lacks any moral compass, totally self centred and celebrates ripping people off to fund his drug fuelled life style. Stopped watching half way through, no gripping story line, lots of soft porn scenes, got boring, but then I'm not a bloke",2,3,4,17 September 2018
Braveheart," Poor history lesson
","I wonder if people watching this film are aware that Edward 1st was a Plantagenet king who probably spoke little English as French was spoken at court. In fact Henry IV was the first Plantagenet king to speak English at court and he ruled many years after Edward. England along with Wales and Ireland suffered just as badly under the Plantagenets as Scotland did, so enough of the anti English so called historical films, as unfortunately a lot of people take them as gospel",3,1,8,12 January 2020
