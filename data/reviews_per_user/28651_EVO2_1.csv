The Ring," Unanswered Q's
","Some of us movie lovers out there will like this film (and I mean some!). Yes Naomi Watts is hot... and yes it does start out well and keeps you intrigued throughout the bulk of the movie. Does it die off or get weird toward the end? Yes!!! Of course it does! that's how you build for a sequel. That's why there are so many unanswered questions. If you do some looking around for the original 'Ringu' you'll see that they had to make a sequel to it (seemingly because there is enough story to keep going-I know I want to know more). Maybe for some the answers don't come easy enough. But for me, thinking and wondering is part of the experience. Enjoy!",10,0,0,19 October 2002
