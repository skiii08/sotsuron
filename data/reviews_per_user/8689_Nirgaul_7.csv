Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Night Falls on the Old Republic
","Its more interesting to look back on this now that the series is complete. There were some great opportunities here that got blundered. Instead of interesting parallels between the son and the father, we have repeated stanzas -- only its clumsy; Like when a high school band plays 'The Imperial March' at a homecoming game. Amateurish. Instead of foreshadowing, we trip over what is to come. We can feel Ron Howard's presence on the set. Tatooine has retroactively become Mayberry.This is probably the best of the prequel series from a conceptual standpoint. The designs are outstanding. The first twenty minutes have some overwhelming eye candy and we're off to a great start. But by now you know the real tragedy of this series. This was the last time Lucas would ever rely on real sets to anchor his myth in something tangible. Henceforth, everything would be as digital as possible. American audiences will perhaps be more keen on the political satire now that *Sith is out. Congressional gridlock was the biggest domestic problem we seemed to have back in '99. Here the epicenter is more China vs. Tibet -- rather blatantly. 'Amidala' is almost an anagram for Dalai Lama. Perhaps that's why her ceremonial dress is red and gold.A filmmaker is in a unique position to contribute the line 'Your focus determines your reality.' This is where that focus started to blur.",Null,0,1,20 August 2005
Star Trek," Not bold, not uncharted. Missing thrusters.
","At some point many years ago, big budget summer films became devoted to the central theme of the Earth's destruction. This is now ubiquitous. Look at the summer lineup. Angels and Demons, Transformers 2, Terminator: Salvation, even the documentary 'Earth'. Usually there is a device that the bad guys want to obtain that can destroy the planet. The villain is of course mad, and wants revenge for some transgression we're about to have explained to us. Nearly everything follows the 'Paradise Lost' mould that Wrath of Khan used so well. Screenwriters don't seem to understand that the scale of vengeance doesn't have to be so massive to be effective, to create tension. Its about the two rivals in an opposition of mind and spirit, playing chess like warring titans, leveling mountains in their path. A nemesis might know everything that a lover knows, all of the vulnerabilities, only they're willing to cross the line and twist the knife, and say 'I told you so'. Eliminating this as a plot element makes the story mechanical. Who cares if the world is at stake if every soul in it is generic? Show me one soul worth caring about, and I'll teeter on the brink of my seat.The actors in this seem to have been chosen because of their intrinsic youthfulness. Its almost the kind of stylization you'd find in Japanese manga, with the characters in younger form having bigger, more expressive eyes. No wonder that the story shows the new Kirk being delivered by a creature with larger than life eyes.Everything is dialed up for the MTV crowd. Instead of the minimalist camera movement in the original films, there's a lot of orbiting and rotation around the characters. Everything is done to indicate that this is a modern action film, with average values. To really deliver the point that we're in alien locations, the angles are more obtuse, even the lenses are fish-eye at times. Kirk drives a motorcycle, is basically Matt Damon as Good Will Hunting trying to become Buck Rogers. He gets into fights in loud bars, boozes up, and gets lippy with authority figures who try to drag him out of his loser lifestyle. Because of his latent Hero Gene, and nothing more, he ascends to greatness. The writing only aspires to pantomime the original cast using recognizable phrases and plot elements. It doesn't expand the mythos, it just plays off of what the average fan will probably remember. No chances taken, and so its like patrolling the Galaxy in a pontoon boat, remembering a world so far away it must have happened in an alternate universe, where screenwriters had vision, and directors had balls.",6,6,12,21 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Rubber Soul
","I saw this with low expectations, and still found it disappointing. No matter what type of action film, there are always opportunities to discover something new and entertaining. There are a few moments where this borders on being innovative, and walks away.The biggest problem with this movie is there is too much going on, and not enough time for the audience to become invested in the world. There are some great locations where we could get to know the characters...let the atmosphere sink in, but it never lasts. In fact, we're given caricatures, not characters. We see Bryce Howard's expressive eyes and her innocence, but never get to know her character's soul. Christian Bale knows how to convey intensity, but it seems like he's forgotten how to convey the sort of passion that he showed in Empire of the Sun. That kind of desperation and resilience and fear is what I'd rather see in his character than the coarse monologues about surviving and being tough, one after another.For a story that tries to define what it is to be human in terms of emotional registers and taking chances, it sides with the logic of the machines. It knows how to pacify audiences, but fails to win their spirit.",4,8,26,20 May 2009
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Shaky Cam and Rehashed Action Ruins It
","Moviegoers above the age of 13 will recognize most of the action set pieces and plot elements from other films. There's an elevator fight, which we've seen before. Evil cops, evil suits, 'big brother' danger, some running from fire and more explosions. The fundamental problem with these movies is that you never feel like the main characters are in any danger. No matter how much of a beating Captain America takes, he's going to live to make sequels. The same goes for all of the popular cast members. Given the immortality of the good guys, the only question is How they're going to get out of peril. Don't expect anything new here.The best writing is happening on television, sadly. Film-quality writing is going to HBO and independent networks, and television directors are moving to the big screen.This one is all washed up. Hail hydra.",4,85,203,6 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Faust
","This is the part of the new series that Lucas was waiting to tell, and everyone else was waiting to see. Everything that precedes it is filler -- magnificent at times -- but something to keep fans in suspense and sustain the cliffhanger tragedy in the public mind. For all the lambasting Lucas receives, he is a good orchestrator of ideas, though he has lost touch with the energy and pacing of his earlier films. He has the same kind of foresight that Mephistopholes has in this play. It is a grand, but flawed vision, full of coercion for the fans through relentless persuasion in the media. In a way, this film feels like a confession. It is a commentary on the dehumanization of films through technology. Gradually, these movies have lost the real actors that were the vitality of the series, and piece by piece, have been replaced with CG 'clones'. The product of this vision is now more mechanized, so it feels like it is only sustaining us, keeping us alive enough to feed the Empire. One of the last shots in the film is a chilling one. Anakin's human eyes are replaced by computer-generated vision.",7,3,5,9 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Relentless
","I usually watch this show every two years to keep a fresh perspective on it. This is the first real film experience I ever had, and it remains the strongest influence on me. The thing that amazes me about this, time and again, is the ingenuity of the pacing, the orchestration, and the motion of the vehicles and ships.This is a triumph of editing.The motion control work is so artfully done, it puts CGI to shame. Watch how the ships move. They dance alongside the camera, swooping toward and away from us. Look at the terrain whiz by in the snowspeeder search. No CGI can convince like that. This is basically helicopter footage on fast-forward, through the cockpit of a prop ship, but it works. The amount of activity going on screen at any given time is frenetic.And then we have Frank Oz. Forget that we live in a world where there are Yoda pajamas, animal crackers, dolls, etc., and just focus on this wonderful character in this one film. He is more lifelike than many of the actors we have working today. When he is on screen, I believe he exists. That is pure movie magic. Mark Hamill is given a tough job with this. Whenever you have a multi-million dollar film that hinges on the performance of one person and a sock puppet, there's pressure. People have blasted him for years over his acting, but it works. He pulls his share of the work and sells every scene.From the opening crawl onward, this never lets up. The music is simply beautiful. This is why I go to the movies.",Null,4,7,11 July 2005
Jurassic Park," Its no longer a flea circus.
","I credit this film with changing the nature of summer blockbusters more than Jaws or Star Wars. It presented a new formula that was so compelling in terms of what could be accomplished on screen, and what resources could be spared, that frugal studio moguls were bound to seize on the opportunity. I can imagine the head of every agency making the 'We can have a coupon day..' remark. Spielberg saw the power of this new technology, and made the film about the discovery of CGI. There's a lot of good philosophy here. Filmmakers take note. Just because computers _can_ generate an effect, doesn't necessarily mean that they should. This is no longer a flea circus we invent in our minds based on clever suggestions of the camera. We literally see the fleas on the merry-go-round, animated like Cirque du Soleil acrobats. This allows the creators to be lazy and the audience's imagination atrophies.Jurassic uses the technology effectively and I don't mind that it showcases itself a bit. If only these films were constrained with a lysine contingency. Now they run amok. CGI is everywhere, in the hands of dwarfs who stand on giants.They bred raptors.",Null,0,1,10 July 2005
