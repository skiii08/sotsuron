Scarface," a very successful movie
","I am not loving this film because i am a huge Al Pacino fan. Scarface is a film that has the power to make Al Pacino the best actor ever. The accent, music, message are clear and given in an effective way. I can not understand those critics who found Al Pacino's acting in Scarface bad. The posters of the movie are still on the walls. The quotes saying 'make the way for the bad guy' or 'say hello to my little friend' are all classic. The relationship between Tony and his sister is depicted in a very sensible way. This is one of my all time favorites. American dream could not be depicted better. The rise and fall of Tony Montana is a lesson.",10,0,2,26 March 2006
Mission: Impossible III," MI:3 seized my imagination
","First of all, i must say that i do not enjoy action movies. But yesterday i had the opportunity to get a free ticket given by DHL.(In one scene DHL bus is seen in the movie but it was not a good advertisement) The film grabs you from the very beginning until the end of the film. There is surprisingly no scene that is unnecessary or boring. If you live action movies and especially a classic like Mission Impossible, you have got to see it. It was a breathtaking adventure that Tom Cruise had. I really liked him for the first time. Last but not least, Philip Seymour Hoffman is a good actor. He has the ability to play any type of character. All in all, it is a successful film.",8,2,4,5 May 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Sensitive and Inhibited LOVE between two men
","BBM is truly a sensitive movie. It makes sense with the general look on Ang Lee's face. i firstly could not figure out why Jack suddenly got intimate with Ennis by putting his arm around his body in the tent.Because until then the conversation between them did not seem to be that much warm. However, as the story unfolds itself, it made me believe that there is a very passionate love between them and especially at the union and the shirt scene were quite touching. It was a very sad ending and made me CRY! and think of how love can be that much strong just like the one in 'Angels in America'Finally, i must say that this film will not be forgotten not because it freely tells about two men's secret relationship in a world where most of the people say that is wrong, but because it reveals love in a much sensitive way than the other films where the love is between a man and a woman. congratulations to Ang Lee.",10,28,32,6 March 2006
