The Expendables 2," You get what you expect, which isn't good
","When I sat down to watch The Expendables 2, I knew exactly what I was getting into from the start. I knew it was going to be over-the-top action and enough testosterone for 100 films combined. It delivered on expectations, but did nothing to exceed them. The plot is paper thin, there is a significant lack in logic, and none of the attempts at emotion did anything for me. I didn't totally hate the film because it is so silly, and rarely pretends that it's aspiring to be anything more. I also like a number of the actors in The Expendables 2, even if they weren't given much acting to do here. It has moments of dumb fun, and I can appreciate that in small doses. The worst aspect of The Expendables 2 is that they shoehorned in so many terrible cameos and references to their past movies. Bruce Willis at least had some purpose in the plot, but throwing in Schwarzenegger to awkwardly spout off 'I'll Be Back' and 'Yippee Ki-Yay' was painful to watch. Then there's the truly stupid Chuck Norris scenes that made me groan so hard I missed the next couple of lines. For what it is, The Expendables 2 is watchable, but if they had tried a little harder it could have been a bit better than a trashy action film.",4,0,0,15 April 2020
Underworld," Not great, but gets a few things right
","I was already starting on a bad note with Underworld, because I've never been a fan of occult creatures and magical monsters. Sitting down to a movie about a vampire who hunts down werewolves instantly turns me off. It began to win me back, though, because it has a noir vibe to the beginning, and Kate Beckinsale's character is like a detective in some ways. While I don't love the grayed-out color palette of the film, if they were aiming for this kind of neo-noir feeling, then it would be fitting. Where it falls apart is that it blends a bunch of Matrix-style action into a movie that was already trying to juggle two wildly different genres. It just becomes noise and chaos, and ruins any sense of drama or excitement when there are guns blazing constantly.The one thing I do kind of appreciate about most vampire or werewolf movies is that they establish some rules about how one of these creatures is injured or killed. Yet, in Underworld they make those rules fuzzy and confusing. Sometimes the creatures are knocked down by a few magic bullets, other times they can take a million without batting an eye (which then begs the question, why are guns the chosen weapons for either of them?) I found the entire plot to be a bit convoluted and at times stupid. There were some decent casting decisions in the movie, even if it was a bit obvious where certain loyalties lied when I saw actors that tend to get thrown into the same kind of roles in every film.My biggest question as Underworld got going was 'why are the vampires the good guys in this scenario?' I kept wondering this, because both are dangerous creatures and we have no reason to take a side other than our protagonist is a vampire so her people must be the heroes. But I have to commend them, because they did address this later on in some fashion. I'll say no more, but at least they didn't completely drop the ball on motivations and explaining why we should care. So, while there wasn't much I enjoyed about Underworld, I did give it a slightly higher rating because they handled the storytelling a bit better than I had anticipated. It might not have been my kind of film, but at least it wasn't a total waste of time.",5,0,1,12 June 2020
Concussion," Too soon, there's still more story to be told
","Concussion is a film about one of the doctors who officially reported on the damaging effects that playing football can have on the human brain. It is a truly fascinating topic, even for someone like myself who is a big fan of the sport. Yes, I can enjoy being a spectator while still recognizing that it is probably a horribly unsafe thing for people to do with their bodies. Somewhat early on, this film has a great visual illustration to show the dangers of playing decades of football on the human mind, and I don't know if it ever gets as compelling as that one moment. Will Smith does his best to play Dr. Bennet Omalu, although the character is a bit understated and measured. While he has moments of passion, his personality isn't as bold as I'd like for the lead in this kind of biopic. I wish Albert Brooks and Alec Baldwin were in the film a bit more because their interactions with Smith were some of the most exciting scenes in the film. I've never been a huge fan of biopics, but there's one big reason that I think this one is a bit underwhelming...A podcaster I know said it best: 'The biggest problem with Concussion is that the whole story hasn't been written yet.' There is so much more that will probably change in the coming years as the NFL is forced to continue exploring the best route to player safety, and as more truth is revealed from those who were in the inner circle of the league. Don't get me wrong, it's not that there is no value in exploring Dr. Omalu's part in putting a name on CTE, or publishing his findings so that it would come to the attention of the national media. The problem is, he is not the most important player in this whole thing. The film tried to make it small by focusing on his story, but it's really a massive tale of corruption and greed that has infected an entire sport. I didn't even like how Concussion addressed the dangerous push-back Omalu received. It seemed like minor annoyances with the occasional threat, then all of the sudden it cranks up to a devastating level with little warning. I don't want to totally discredit Concussion, because it tells a relevant story that some people may need to see, but I simply feel it isn't as effective as it could be, or perhaps will be in the future.",6,0,0,27 April 2020
MASH," A mess that barely qualifies as a movie
","My biggest struggle with Robert Altman movies in the past is that he is an avid fan of improv, and using the screenplay as a general outline instead of a script. You can certainly get a sense of that in M*A*S*H as the characters freely chit-chat about things in a way that feels awkward and unnatural. Most of the humor is mumbled and treated like throw-away jokes, which can work in small quantities but it falls flat when there is no life behind any of the comedy. I tolerated a lot of this aimless jabbering because it came from a good cast of accomplished actors, although I couldn't help mentally imagining what it would sound like with the cast from the TV show who had more time to lock in these characters and flesh them out. Improv of this kind gets better the more you understand the person you are portraying.Perhaps the bigger issue I had with this screenplay (or the way it was handled) was that it lacked a narrative of any kind. There's no plot progression, no character development, and no momentum to the film. It feels like a series of vignettes slapped together in a hasty fashion, to the point that you could shuffle the entire film around in any order and accomplish the same thing. While watching, I totally understood how someone saw M*A*S*H and thought it would translate into a good TV show, because the film itself feels very episodic. There's the one about Radar catching Frank Burns and Hot Lips making out and utterly embarrassed them, and then the episode about the guys going into another unit to work on a senator's son, or perhaps you'd enjoy the one where they have to play a big football game against another unit, and so much more! It's a series of short stories, not a plot.Then there's the issue I had with the content of the comedy in M*A*S*H. It was horribly misogynistic in a way that doesn't just feel like a product of that time, but actually harmful. The things that this movie presents as hilarious jokes are the most extreme forms of sexual harassment imaginable. Yet when anyone suggests that these men be punished for their crimes it is dismissed and all is forgiven. I think we are meant to ignore or laugh off the misconduct because these men are seeing the horrors of war, and they will stop at nothing to lighten the mood. Yet we never see them confronted with the darkness of the Korean War. They are working on wounded men and have some patients die, but we don't see that impact them in any way. The surgery scenes are just like filler between the attempts at humor in this mess of a movie. Honestly, the film makes me afraid to revisit the TV show M*A*S*H, because I'm afraid it might have been this terrible and I never noticed.",3,0,0,7 July 2020
Underworld Awakening," Poor decisions sink what could have been the first good Underworld movie
","Underworld: Awakening starts off so promising. I like the concept of humans finally discovering that these mythical monsters exist in their world, and it makes sense that their reaction is fear and violence. Making humanity the bad guys is intriguing, and at least with humans I could relax in knowing what their weaknesses are, so they don't take thousands of gunshots and survive only to be killed by a single knife to the chest. Likewise, it would be fascinating to see how the vampires and werewolves would have to band together in order to form an underground resistance to preserve their kind. Yet they completely skip over the entire war with humans. That's right, this movie makes the moronic decision to jump ahead 12 years to the point that there are only a handful of the undead creatures still in existence. While this might increase the importance of Selene since she's part of an endangered species, it also skipped over some of the most interesting dramatic things they could have done with this franchise.This might be a minor spoiler for Underworld: Awakening, but they also don't really show a war with humans when we get to the future. Instead, it just boils down to the same mindless fights between vampire and lycan. I continue to find these battles boring because it is unclear why at one moment you can easily rip a skull in half, and then later you struggle to even stay alive against the same creatures. Also, the effects are just a joke at this point. The lycans look like old Ray Harryhausen stop motion creatures when they don't just look like 2-dimensional cartoons. I can't take anything seriously when I'm watching goofy monsters that look that bad. There are a few story elements that work in this chapter of the saga. I thought the bond between family members was interesting, and I will always enjoy Michael Ealy in anything. I keep wanting them to figure out the Underworld franchise and make something decent, but they continue to make films that are average at best.",5,0,0,16 June 2020
Rush," Good acting, but not that much beyond that
","It's probably best if I start by saying, there are few recreational activities that I care about less than car-racing. I am an avid fan of sports films, but this isn't really a sport, so Rush doesn't get any benefit of the doubt from me. That's not to say there's nothing good in this movie. The character work from Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth is great, and that's what gets you invested in the story. Niki Lauda (the man that Daniel Brühl plays) proves to be the most fascinating person in the film, because he has such a uniquely abrasive personality, and yet shows that there are some emotions underlying that rough exterior. I was definitely interested in where his journey would end up. The fact that this was all based on real events made it that much more powerful, knowing that he had overcome so much in his life to be a success.James Hunt (the man that Chris Hemsworth plays) is much less fascinating. He is simply a jerk that seems to care about no one. That's where Rush lost me. The one lame 'save the cat' moment that they give Hunt is not nearly enough to make me like him. The end didn't click all that well, because I couldn't buy that one conversation and a single good deed could turn their rivalry into a friendship. I was afraid he was going to remain the protagonist for the entire film, and his tedious relationships would become an important plot point. Thankfully, later on the movie focused in on Lauda much more, and his intriguing marriage. I enjoyed aspects of Rush more than I expected, particularly the acting, but it never could get over the hump to be a movie I loved. Frankly, I think an ESPN documentary on the subject would be a bit more effective.",6,0,0,20 April 2020
Grease," Toe-tapping fun, until the plot starts
","Coming of age movies in high school are often a tough sell for me. They have to include characters that I connect with on a deeper level in order for me to enjoy them. Grease is overloaded with characters I find obnoxious and annoying. These are all the 'cool' kids who value how their friends see them over being a good person. What infuriates me even more is that the film seems to think that Danny is correct for not wanting to be real, and that Sandy should change her entire personality so she's cool enough to be with him. The other plots aren't any better, including a pregnancy scare, and a girl who is too dumb for beauty school (yet somehow she will be able to handle high school.) Also, I just have to mention, I hate that the only intelligent person in the film is presented as a stereotypical nerd and is mocked mercilessly.It's just too bad that the music is so darn fun. I want to hate everything about Grease, but I can't help singing along. I love a good musical, but it's rare for me to enjoy the music in one so much more than the plot itself. Even the choreography and sets for the songs all accentuate the playful joy of the music. This is why Grease is a soundtrack that I own, but a movie that I never wanted to own. It's a shame because there are great scenes built around the songs, and yet they have to combine it with all this terrible plot in between. It also makes rating and ranking Grease a nightmare. Within any given 15 minutes of the movie there are at least a few minutes where I'm having a good time, so I should rate the whole thing highly. Yet, so much of what I like about movies is the plot, and this is a plot I'd rather never see again. In the future, I think it's best if I stick to the soundtrack and avoid the movie itself at all costs.",4,1,1,13 March 2020
Lilo & Stitch," Some odd choices, but still a charming film
","There is a great deal of charm to Lilo & Stitch. I'm always a sucker for movies that celebrate the bonds of family, I have a fascination for movies that take place in Hawaii, and the sci-fi element doesn't hurt either. This is yet another in a never-ending line of Walt Disney films that deal with orphaned children, but I appreciated that this movie explored the real-life struggles that children face when left without parents. I also found Ving Rhames voicing the big burly social worker to be a humorous addition, while maintaining the reality of how these broken family situations can lead to problems keeping the kids together under the same roof. The odd juxtaposition of aliens tracking a runaway monster with this realistic family drama makes this film truly unique. I found most of their bumbling attempts to trap Stitch to be the funniest aspect of the film.I think where I struggle in accepting the plot structure of Lilo & Stitch is the abruptly shifting behavior of Stitch. First of all, when the doctor establishes what he was designed to do, we are supposed to view this creature as a danger to all life as we know it. Yet his behavior continues to present as merely mischievous. He never seems to desire death and destruction, just general trouble-making. I've seen April Fool's Day jokes that are more dangerous than Stitch. Then it takes relatively little time, and not much correction to turn him into an upstanding member of the family who actively tries to save Lilo's life more than once. My dog isn't even that quick to learn proper behavior, and she's not biologically programmed for evil. All that aside, for what it is, Lilo & Stitch is a high-quality film. It has a lot of heart, and plays on familiar themes in a way that should please audiences of all ages.",7,0,0,13 April 2020
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Mindless fun done the right way
","I'll be honest, I didn't have high expectations of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, because it looked like a ridiculous concept used as an excuse for another over-the-top action film. It absolutely was everything I expected, and I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. This movie is fully embracing the silliness of its concept, and doing it in all the right ways. Logic is out the window as the film seems to take place in olden times, but the heroes have an arsenal of modern weapons, a full concept of diabetes and insulin, plus they use some modern slang and profanity. They do nothing to hide this anachronistic feel either, and have so much fun blowing away witches with everything from a shotgun to a modern Gatling-style gun while dropping several F-bombs. The film also fully embraces the existence of witches with dangerous powers, and uses that to make them a formidable threat to our heroes who could seem indestructible. Every aspect of this film is crazy, and I could totally see if someone thought it was dumb, but I loved how writer/director Tommy Wirkola understands where to draw the line between camp and crap. This is the kind of movie that I can justify telling people to 'turn off your brain and enjoy it.'There is a solid plot at the heart of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, that has personal elements for our heroes, which increases the stakes. Most of the plot points are predictable, but this isn't the kind of movie with a complex story that is supposed to puzzle or surprise the viewer. I particularly liked how they handled the reveals of Hansel & Gretel's history, because it was not dragged out too long since we knew what was coming. I think the only story point that was dragged out too much was the way they explored whether all witches were evil. The cast of witches, led by Famke Janssen are delightfully evil in all the stereotypical ways, and the makeup effects on them were perfectly repulsive. Jeremy Renner is basically playing Hansel as another version of Hawkeye, and I didn't mind, because that fits the tone of this film perfectly. I love what Gemma Arterton brings as Gretel, because she is tough and dangerous. I will say, I wish she had spent less time being a damsel in distress and had kicked more butt, particularly in the finale. Otherwise, despite some minor complaints, I found Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters to be a total blast. This is the kind of movie I will watch when I feel like a crazy action spectacle that doesn't require much brainpower to enjoy.",8,0,0,20 April 2020
The Fault in Our Stars," Not entirely cliche, but also not entirely enjoyable
","I think most people have heard enough about The Fault in Our Stars to know what they are getting into. So, making complaints about the way it manipulated me emotionally seems a bit foolish. Yes, it is a tearjerker, much like any movie that deals with cancer and death. I expected to cry a number of times with this film, and I did. That's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, because it's what I anticipated, the only thing I was hoping for was that I'd get something else I didn't expect. This kind of heavy romantic drama can utilize a lot of clichés, and I was hoping this one was beloved because it broke the mold a bit. In some ways it did, I was particularly pleased that they didn't fall into the trope of the jealous and controlling parents who don't approve of their daughter's romantic relationship. Instead they were kind and loving parents who merely wanted what was best for their daughter.There's another somewhat unexpected element to the story, but I'd rather not discuss that in case someone reading this plans on seeing the film someday. I think where The Fault in Our Stars disappointed me, though, was in the plotline of the author. I won't go into too much detail, but a lot of weight is put on a particular book in the film, and there are some interactions with the author of that book which I found to be a frustrating cliché. It feels like a cheap plot construction merely to get the main character to face her fears, instead of a useful part of the story. Aside from that, I can't criticize too much about The Fault in Our Stars, but I also can't say it's all that enjoyable to watch. I suppose if you're in the mood for a therapeutic cry, then this might be the film that could accomplish that for you, but watching teens suffering with cancer and facing their inevitable death isn't my idea of a good time.",6,1,1,30 April 2020
The Pianist," Sadly, I've seen this same story many times before
","I'm just going to bite the bullet and say something that is potentially quite ugly and offensive, so I'll apologize in advance for how this makes me sound. I've seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity's history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I've seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn't muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle, and almost feel like I've become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can't continue to break every time I see it. In fact, I just watched a couple of similar films based on the true stories of Jews fleeing the Holocaust within the last month, so perhaps it was just bad timing.I think the other reason that The Pianist didn't connect with me as well as any number of similar stories is the passive role that Szpilman plays in his own story. In many ways he is merely an observer of what happens. His story is about fleeing, watching, and others helping him. Once his family is removed from the equation, we don't form much of a bond with anyone else we see suffering. I'm not suggesting he did anything wrong, in fact his story is quite impressive. However, when I've seen films about people inside the concentration camps, or forced to endure heinous acts of cruelty, it's hard to be as impacted by a guy who is hiding. I hope this doesn't make me sound too much like a monster, and I certainly didn't hate The Pianist. In fact, I was looking forward to hearing him play more, because the actual music was marvelous. It's impossible to be bored by a movie like this, because there's always some new horrible thing around the corner. I guess my standards for movies in this genre have just been raised too much, and it will take something truly original or outstanding to hit me with the power of Holocaust movies that came before.",4,1,3,20 March 2020
Ghost Rider," A lackluster film with a ridiculous hero
","I was never a fan of Ghost Rider in the comic books. The idea of this demonic spirit inhabiting a man, and yet being used for good always puzzled me. This movie tried to give a logical explanation for how the contracts worked, but I never fully understood what made this different from any other deal with the devil (or Mephistopheles, if you prefer.) I also didn't know why the demons were bickering with one another to the point that one created the Ghost Rider in order to hunt down the other. That's not even addressing the fact that, if Mephistopheles had the power to create these Ghost Riders, why did he need them to do his work for him? But let's pretend the nonsense worked. Even forgiving all that, the anti-hero known as Ghost Rider would still bug me because he has a problem that has always annoyed me in superhero movies...no defined weakness. When he's fighting it's hard to tell when or if something is hurting him, and I have no way of knowing if his 'life' is in danger. The demons have a similar problem, so all around the fighting loses me because I don't know who's dominating and who's losing aside from their physical body language.As for the human story that plays alongside the supernatural one, well it's a bit weak. I kind of like the craziness that Nicolas Cage brings to the role, because he is the kind of guy you could see taking insane risks with his life. However, his romance with Eva Mendes falls flat since the two have no chemistry. Also, they don't have a full story arc because the Ghost Rider stuff keeps getting in the way, and they end up resolving it without really addressing the underlying problem in their relationship. I did love what Sam Elliott brought to the film. He is an ideal actor to play the mentor in any movie, and he has a swagger that fits with the backstory we learn about his character. The CGI effects weren't always great, but I feel like they embraced their limitations. They allowed Ghost Rider to be this ridiculous thing exactly as he's depicted in the comics, and his penance stare was a delightfully wacky effect. I will say that I found it a bit tedious that they kept introducing pieces of Ghost Rider's costume from the comics one bit at a time. It almost became laughable how the movie would stop so he could put some spikes on his jacket or throw a chain on his chest. But overall, I think Ghost Rider is an average superhero film, that is perhaps a bit more enjoyable if you laugh at some of its ridiculousness rather than take it as a serious story.",5,0,0,12 June 2020
Gran Torino," Great story if you can stomach the racism
","There's something extremely relatable about the character that Clint Eastwood plays in Gran Torino. Perhaps it's just because I'm getting a bit older myself, but I could totally understand how he was stuck in his ways and struggled to connect with his kids and grandkids. Perhaps those relatives were depicted in a way that was a bit too negative, but there is a lot of truth in the different ways these generations prioritize things. I could also understand our main character's struggle with the young priest who continues to irritate him. But the heart of Gran Torino lies in his slowly developed relationship with his Hmong neighbors. I cannot say enough about my enjoyment of these interactions. It was funny and heartwarming in all the right ways. They took time to develop things as well, so I never got the impression that people were changing on a whim, but they were actually growing and maturing into a true bond of friendship.I want to say I loved everything about Gran Torino and just be done with it, but there was one aspect that soured the experience a bit for me, and will probably keep this from becoming one of my favorite films. I struggle at times with characters that are written like Walt Kowalski, who have such open and unchecked racism. When it's this aggressive, it can feel like the writers are hiding behind a 'misguided character with a heart of gold' to spew hate speech and play it off as 'funny.' Trying to excuse it by showing that his speech is just as vile with his friends doesn't do enough to make it charming for me. It certainly doesn't help the racist bent of this movie when it becomes a massive white-savior story. I allowed myself to forgive Gran Torino because you can view it as the neighbors saving him from his own grief, loneliness, prejudice, and hatred. There is also an element of regret in Eastwood's performance, and I tried to convince myself that was good enough. Besides, the story is so enjoyable that I was trying to ignore the negatives, but I wouldn't blame anyone who is horribly offended by Gran Torino.",8,0,0,1 July 2020
Alice in Wonderland," Better than most give it credit, and an actual plot!
","I can't imagine a fantasy world more suited to Tim Burton's visual stylings than the insane place known as Wonderland, created by Lewis Carroll. I've often heard people criticize this film, and I can't figure out why, because I think it's actually one of Burton's best movies. It is a marvelous thing to behold, and has some wonderfully over-the-top performances. I also loved how they used the CGI in order to accentuate those performances and make things look a little off. Instead of entirely fabricating a Queen of Hearts, they have Helena Bonham Carter deliver a hilarious performance and then inflate her head to insane proportions with the computer. Even when things were entirely practical, there was an otherworldly style to them, like Anne Hathaway's playful performance as the White Queen. The one grounding force of the film is Mia Wasikowska, who is charming and comes across as normal, but gets gradually changed by the magical oddity of Underland.The one downfall of this adventure of Alice in Wonderland is the inflation of the Mad Hatter's role, simply because Burton has a love for Johnny Depp. His character is relatively inconsequential in the story, but is forced in more often than anyone needs. There are even moments when the movie stops its forward progression so the Hatter can have a scene in the limelight. I'm all for broadening the characters in this story to make them resonate more, but I think it doesn't work that well here. Otherwise, this movie works great. But all of this should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have no affinity for the original animated Alice in Wonderland. What delights me about this movie is that it injects an actual plot into the seeming drug-induced nonsense of the original. Plus, it does all this without unwriting that movie, but implying it just happened in the past. I feel like I'm in the minority on this one, but Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a movie I'll gladly watch again anytime.",7,0,0,17 March 2020
Love & Mercy," Another by-the-numbers music biopic
","I've been a fan of The Beach Boys music for a long time, and even though I'm not typically a huge fan of biopics, I expected my love of the music to make Love & Mercy a winner for me. Yet I felt like this wasn't a film that cared about the music as much as the man. We are shown Brian Wilson working on a few of the more complex songs, but the film seems to be more focused on exploring his mental issues and how his experimentation with drugs intensified those problems. This means it falls into a lot of the same tropes as other music biopics. I was also a bit surprised how much they limited the roles of the other band members. There are moments when they give their input and argue with Brian, but it never feels like they are major characters in the film. In fact, we hardly ever see them perform a song, we just see the recording process.That's not to say that I was entirely untouched by Love & Mercy. Paul Dano and John Cusack do a good tag-team as Brian and you can see they worked with each other to get some of the mannerisms down. Paul Giamatti is great as the Svengali who takes control of Brian's life, although I wanted to see more of the in-between time so we could understand how Eugene Landy came into the picture. While the film didn't delve as deep into the history of Beach Boys music as I'd like, it certainly did pay respect to the elaborate lengths that they took to create some of their best songs. I'm a sucker for any of the scenes where Brian is struggling to perfectly manufacture the sound that he hears in his head. I only wish that was more of the film. This is frequently the case with biopics, even when I enjoy them, I start to wonder if perhaps a documentary would deliver more of what I want to see. Love & Mercy isn't bad, but I want the rest of the story.",6,0,0,22 May 2020
Limitless," Fun, but leaves something to be desired
","I remember several years ago when Lucy came out that people were saying that Limitless was a more enjoyable spin on the whole idea of using 100% of your brain. I do have to commend this movie that it only mentions how little of our brain's potential we use, and doesn't spend time pretending this is based on real science. The pill might as well be magic for all the time they spend explaining it. This is a film that understands what it is, while Lucy was trying too hard to be a more serious film, which just made it seem dumber. I like the idea of someone who uses smarts to get ahead in business and simply make more money. That's the reality of what we all would do with this kind of power, so it makes sense. There was still one of those scenes in this movie of the hero using his brain-power to win a fight, which was kind of stupid, but at least that wasn't his main focus, and he didn't become some super-smart vigilante.I think where Limitless falls short of being a high-quality film, is in the story structure. While I like the setup, and I think Bradley Cooper is a good actor for this role, it felt like the plot didn't go anywhere. Worse than that, it set up a lot of things that it never pays off at the end. It's almost like the filmmakers forgot that they started some of these subplots, so they never remembered to get back to them and explain to the audience what happened. I think the biggest frustration I had (with regards to the lack of follow-through) was the fact that they establish he has a master plan to work on, but then we are never clued in on what that might be. The conclusion suggests what his idea might have entailed, but since we didn't see him preparing for this outcome, it feels like the biggest deus ex machina imaginable. I still enjoyed Limitless as a refreshing take on some common sci-fi tropes, and I can see the potential for a TV series that some executive also saw. It's not a great film, but it is a fun one.",6,0,1,9 March 2020
Hercules," Not one of Disney's best, but watchable
","I never had a massive interest in mythology, but I certainly had some vague knowledge of Hercules before I ever saw this film. It is an odd story for Disney to adapt, and they needed to bring a boatload of bleach just to clean it up enough for it to be a kids movie. Knowing a bit more about the actual myths now, it's kind of funny to see this sanitized version of the tale that manages to make so many of these characters seem righteous. Perhaps the funniest aspect is the perfect relationship between Zeus and Hera. The other odd choice with this film was the decision to turn the muses (the narrators of the story) into gospel singers. Utilizing a genre of music that is traditionally Christian in its roots to tell the story of a Roman demigod is so weird it makes my brain hurt. Of course, I can't deny that the tunes are catchy. In fact, the best part of this film is the music. That's not a big surprise since Alan Menken is still the song writer, and he knows how to make great music.The story they write for this interpretation of Hercules is not all that interesting. It kind of feels like a retread of Superman, and frankly I'd just rather watch that film instead. I guess this movie has Danny DeVito shoved in there for something different, and for some people that might be a benefit. Personally, I found the character he plays to be a bit annoying. Although he is infinitely better than Pain and Panic, the little demons voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer. I guess these guys are in there because every Disney movie needs their goofy little creatures that are thrown in entirely for comedic effect (perhaps to win over young children.) The saving grace of the film is James Woods as Hades. He is entertaining and fun, with a sense of humor that actually works for adults as well. I don't have any active hatred for Hercules as a film, it's an acceptable way to pass 90 minutes. But considering the glut of amazing Disney animated films, I'm more likely to just listen to this soundtrack than watch the movie again.",5,0,0,7 July 2020
RED," This is what 'turn off your brain' movies should be like
","RED is the story of a group of Retired Extremely Dangerous people who are being targeted for assassination by the government they once served. I am a sucker for a man-on-the-run story, and there's something fun about one where the guy on the run is also smarter and stronger than everyone chasing him. I love going on this journey, and Bruce Willis is the perfect guy for the lead role because he looks like someone who is getting older but could still hold up in a fight against anyone. I like the layers of planning that go into all these operations, and how they carefully execute their plans so that they can continue to come out on top when faced with insurmountable odds. I also think most of the comedy is solid, particularly with John Malkovich as the hyper-paranoid former agent who is constantly shown to be justified in his paranoia. I also have to mention how much I always love Karl Urban, and his performance here was amazing.I will say, there are a lot of people being killed in RED, and many of them are government agents who are just doing their jobs. You have to be willing to accept that the protagonists of the film aren't all that concerned with killing other people and potentially causing some collateral damage as well. Since the action and violence is so exaggerated and extreme I kind of accepted it, but when my mind starts to think too much about the film, then I realize these are more like anti-heroes than anything else. There are also a few too many convenient last-minute rescues that started to make it feel like these people could do anything. I can let a lot of that slide, though, since I know this is all based on a comic book and there's an added suspension of disbelief in those stories. While RED is far from a great film, it is an enjoyable one and that's all I really needed from it. I had fun watching RED, so it accomplished what it set out to do.",8,0,0,2 July 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Brilliant, thrilling, and timely
","There is so much to love about Da 5 Bloods, and I think it has something to offer several different audiences. Let's see if I can break it all down for you:If you're looking for a film that feels like a war movie, and has action and excitement to spare, then I think you'll get just what you want out of Da 5 Bloods. I was thrilled by all these sequences, and often couldn't believe my eyes as the violence escalated. It was a truly remarkable and downright disturbing thing to watch. Whoever handled the effects on this film did a masterful job at making the violence feel real and horrifying, even in the times when the blood splatter was clearly CGI. Spike Lee also knows how to film the action, so even in the chaos of battle, you can keep a tab on where people are and what is happening to our heroes.However, if you're looking for a film about the bonds of friendship forged in war, Da 5 Bloods has that in spades. We get to see these men who have grown close over the years, and on this journey they find common ground and discuss the past, present, and future. It didn't take long before I felt like I knew these men and could see what brought them together and what threatened to come between them. It's not always smooth sailing and we get to see how they all deal with conflict. It's a heart-wrenching journey at times, and I was close to tears more than once. You start to realize that, even with all the crazy stuff happening, it's the bonds of friendship and love that are the most vital.Finally, if you're looking for a film that talks about the history of racism in both America and Vietnam, then look no further than Da 5 Bloods. Spike Lee opens the film with one of his patented montages of news footage from the past that details some of the things this film will address (or puts certain aspects of it in context.) Throughout the movie he will even insert shots of news reports or printed media when someone references a historic moment from the past, as if he wants to make it clear to viewers that this movie may be fictional, but the events they are discussing really happened. There is symbolism in other ways throughout the film that calls back to the racial themes.There might be even more to Da 5 Bloods that flew over my head, but these are the three most obvious genres you'll find when watching this film. Now I'll admit, some of the more political stuff that he addresses would turn me off in some movies. It serves as a distraction from the plot, and I don't enjoy when a film-maker takes extra time just to hammer home the themes instead of addressing them in an organic way in the story. However, there's something about this moment in history that made me forgive Spike Lee's choices here. This doesn't seem like a time to be subtle, and perhaps Da 5 Bloods is the slap in the face some people need. In every other way I loved this movie, and it's one of those rare films that I want to watch repeatedly so I can analyze and pick it apart to see what I missed the first time. It now claims the title as my favorite Spike Lee film.",9,11,32,12 June 2020
The Pursuit of Happyness," Depressing, but inspiring tale of hard work and dedication
","The Pursuit of Happyness is a movie that tells a true story about the most difficult time in a man's life. His struggles are tough, and it's never what I'd describe as a fun film. I appreciate seeing how a man works through the dark times in order to come out in a better situation, because it shows the value of hard work and dedication. The power of all this is magnified, and the stakes are increased, because he is raising a child through it all. I was a little put off by the fact that he probably wasn't providing a better home for his son, and by all rights should have sent the son to live with his mother if she had a stable living situation. However, I do know it might have killed his determination and by letting the son go, he might have never seen him again. Also, many of the complaints that I would have about the actions taken by characters in the film have to be forgiven simply because this is all grounded in the real history of Chris Gardner. There is an authenticity to the story-telling here that reinforces the fact that it is a true story. While I'm sure they took some artistic license, it still felt grounded.I'm on the fence about the narration in The Pursuit of Happyness. I almost feel like it should have been done by a third-party narrator, rather than Chris Gardner himself. Also, titling different parts of the film as though they were chapters in a book did nothing for me. However, I appreciate the shorthand they were able to achieve using narration. It could be hard to visually show some of the things that set the main character apart from the other interns, so explaining it in a couple of lines helps a lot. I think Will Smith delivers an amazing performance as Chris Gardner, and this is a difficult role to master with all the emotional beats in the film. But in my opinion, the entire movie is a bit too dour. I know the point is seeing the hard road taken to achieve success, but we get such a brief moment of joy, that it can be tough to wait until the movie gets there. I still appreciate The Pursuit of Happyness, though, because all the despair makes the ending that much more powerful, and it's hard not to cry. It's not exactly a movie I'll want to seek out for multiple re-watches, but it is a solid story.",6,0,0,14 April 2020
The Proposal," Could have been great, but doesn't meet potential
","The formula of a great romantic comedy certainly exists in The Proposal. You've got big-name attractive stars, who have been successful in rom-coms before. You've got a plot that is reminiscent of other films, where two people who don't get along must pretend to be in a relationship. Why is it that the creative team simply couldn't make all those elements work to form a solid movie? My first guess is that they started with a sub-par script. The comedy never quite works, and I didn't even find myself chuckling at the situations. There are a few moments when Ryan Reynolds will deliver a line that feels like a throwaway joke, and those made me laugh more than anything else in the movie. Even the amazing Betty White didn't get any good jokes, unless you find her dancing around in a Native American headdress to be funny.I think one of the other things that hurts the Proposal is the fact that it doesn't feel like the right casting. In my opinion, Sandra Bullock has more of a girl-next-door quality, so she doesn't work so well as this hard-nosed workaholic who mistreats all of her employees. We're supposed to see her as the equivalent to Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, and I just don't buy it. This also means that her transformation throughout the film doesn't have a natural flow because she's quick to settle into her comfort zone, and that means the devil-woman disappears too fast. All the flaws don't change the fact that I still enjoy some of the rom-com tropes that are included in The Proposal. It has those moments of conflict and reconciliation that warm your heart and sell you on the relationship. It's not going to be added to my list of favorites of the genre, that I gladly rewatch on a regular basis, but it's certainly not the worst.",5,0,0,11 March 2020
Draft Day," Costner knows sports movies, and this is another enjoyable one
","I've been an avid fan of the NFL for most of my life, and find great joy whenever watching a game. However, I've never been one of those guys who follows the off-season stuff, especially the draft. Since I'm not a college sports fan, I don't know any of the players, so watching a draft feels pointless to me. As a result, I was not all that hopeful that Draft Day (the film) would click for me. The NFL draft has always seemed like such a dull process and I could not see how they would make an interesting movie out of it. I should have trusted the magic of Kevin Costner in a sports film, which has only failed me once. I found this movie delightful. It presents the draft as a fascinating chess match that requires a ton of planning, and a team of advisers who try to explore every possible angle. Even with all that preparation, when the clock starts ticking it can rattle even the most seasoned professionals, and require a lot of thinking on your toes. I know dramatic twists like we see in this film are probably few and far between, but it's still fun to explore the possibility.There were a couple aspects of Draft Day that didn't click quite as well for me. The biggest problem was the family relationship subplot. It worked to show some of our main character's history, and it did establish one more point of pressure that he had to contend with while trying to do his job. However, it didn't quite have the impact on the central plot that I would have liked, and the payoff with his mother at the end lacked the strength of the other dramatic moments. It didn't bother me that any of this was included in the film, but I wish it added more to the story. My other minor nitpick is simply the Cleveland Browns of it all. Believe me, as a lifelong Detroit Lions fan, I know what it's like to root for a franchise that can never get it right. But having the Browns as the central team in this story had me chuckling more than once. It's just hard to buy into the fact that any manager (even in a fictional film) could do something special enough to make them a winning team. Needless to say, these are fairly minor nitpicks. I loved Draft Day, and I'm considering a re-watch soon.",9,0,0,14 April 2020
From Here to Eternity," A high-quality film that just didn't click for me
","There are a bunch of stories all going on at the same time in From Here to Eternity. It becomes overwhelming at times trying to take it all in at once. It's not that I was confused, or didn't follow any of the stories, because I thought they were all told well. In fact, I think most of this stuff comes together at the end to make a good cohesive film. However, when we're bouncing around getting snippets of each character's story, I started to feel overloaded with the drama and desired a bit more focus. I do think, now that I see how it all links up in the end, I might enjoy it more on a second watch. This is a well-told story, and I have a feeling the novel might be even better because the author would have more pages to tell each story that the director had to condense into 2 hours of film.The cast of From Here to Eternity is amazing. I was particularly impressed with Montgomery Clift. He brings a lot of heart to the film, and has a challenging part to play. I totally connected with his emotional journey as he resisted the pressure to go back to boxing, even when it meant he would have to endure punishment and ridicule. His choices later in the film all made sense to me, because of this difficult journey. I also thought Frank Sinatra's subplot opposing Ernest Borgnine was powerful. Surprisingly, the romance between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr that leads to the most famous scene in the film, was probably the least interesting aspect to me. Before going in, I thought the entire movie was going to be about them, and by the end I found their story underwhelming. However, it's hard to point to one thing that I found bad about From Here to Eternity. It's a high-quality film, and I think over time it will go up in my estimation. I can certainly see why others love it.",6,1,2,20 March 2020
