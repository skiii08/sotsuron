The Incredible Hulk," Best Hulk of all movies since 2000s.
","Yep, that is true. I still go back and re-watch this Hulk from time to time. Edward Norton performance is outstanding - and not as Hulk but as Bruce Banner struggles to suppress his green Mr. Hyde alter nature living on the outskirts of civilization. On the other hand we have a wonderful performance of Tim Roth who plays Norton's antagonist - a devoted high skilled soldier who wants to be the best warrior in the world at all cost.",8,1,1,23 September 2019
