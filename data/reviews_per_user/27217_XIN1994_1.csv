Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," some thoughts after watching(may like some funny thoughts)
","After watching the first one of star wars, interestingly, the most impressive part for me was the collaboration of the princess Padme amidala and gungans. This has to be related with my current situation as a social work student doing placement in the central Australia, which means the social work practices here is largely related with working collaboratively with aboriginal people and communities. The collaboration in the phantom menace has brought me some thoughts in this context.First of all, there's a general question that how far do we think sci-fi plots are from the reality? As a friend and I was discussing about the third book of the three-body problem, she told me a plot in the book is that human beings had no place to go eventually and were all settled down in a desert area in Australia. Sounds like the place -- the central Australia region, especially Alice Springs where I am currently located. There's no dramatical surprise for me that 'wow, social work can be related with sci-fi fantasies.' As the rooted motivation which spurred me to come to this unique town is the post impacts of colonisation, and the connection between the reality of Alice Springs and sci-fi fictions is encompassed with this conception--colonisation. The point for me is that do people regard themselves as colonisers or indigenous people?As the social issues here are still severe, indigenous people live in poverty in a rich country, bearing the aggravated environmental consequences, and more despairingly, where to go? the original lifestyle cannot be found back as a result of the massive change of natural resources, forests, waterholes and food etc. From the other side, forcefully fitting into western frameworks is an abandonment of self-identities. Should they? can they? can we?I agree that the way to go is collaboration between colonisers and indigenous people. The doubts occurred to me is how to collaborative at a community level? as community level is more like a practical level to talk about actions and changes, instead of political ideologies.For Gungans and Padme represented different cultures on the planet naboo, though this doesn't closely match the colonisation model, but it gives me thoughts about how two very different cultures live together within the same 'planet boarders'. Briefly speaking, it's about creating a sustainable ecosystem, autonomy, support and protection, to incorporate 2 cultures as a whole. when crash happens, all parties have been changed, Do we acknowledge the change? do we incorporate the change so to expand ourselves or?",5,1,2,31 October 2019
