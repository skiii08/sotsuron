The Blair Witch Project," Just didn't do it
","Maybe it was the hype, but this was an all around mediocre film, which I probably liked less because the hype was so much.  Excellent concept, excellent premise, but it was no 'The Omen'.  I understand what was trying to be done here, but to be honest the one piece of information which you didn't want to know (that all three are going to buy the farm) was plastered up on the first frame of the movie.  After that it was an exercise in conclusion.  You knew they would die, it was just how that was the issue. And the how was a pretty boring trip.  I must admit that the stick figures creeped me out and the last 30 seconds were intense.  But honestly I just am not intimidated by a pile of rocks.  I know, I know, it's the simplicity of the whole thing that is supposed to make it work, but I just didn't find it very scary.The other thing, and this bothered me too, is that streams turn into creeks turn into rivers turn into lakes and oceans.  In the first 30 seconds they show that they have a field guide with them, but apparently no one read it. Follow the stream!!!!  It was almost like watching a cheese film where the dumb victim runs upstairs when the zombie is chasing them.  I suppose the possibility of intense magic precludes this as an option but we never get the inkling that that is the reason.  Instead, by the end, I almost felt like our heros get the benefits of their stupidity.Regardless, I must give kudos for I wouldn't have done better with $60,000 and I've seen much worse with 10-100 times that amount.  It's an OK summer movie, but it is not overwhelmingly scary or intimidatingDavid Campbell",3,0,1,8 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's still a CGI
","I remember vividly the final scenes of Return of the Jedi, when Admiral Ackbar announces 'It's a trap!' and we see the Rebel fleet coming about. The agile X-Wings and A-Wings rapidly breaking off in the shadow of the larger frigates and cruisers.  I remember especially how the large MC80 cruiser turned, twisting on three axis albeit slowly, just as one, I guess, would expect a huge spaceship to turn.  To me, this was part of the magic of Star Wars from beginning to end.  There was a sense of real to it.  A suspension of disbelief which said 'I am watching the stories of people I don't know but care about' instead of 'I am watching a film with many special effects'Now story has been reduced to eye-candy.  Attention to detail is now 'how many tricks can we pull' instead of 'can we pull of the  tricks well' Frankly, I couldn't break away like I did in the other three movies.  The Ewoks, for all we hate of them, were actually living creatures.  Now we have Man meets 'A Bugs Life'.  The spaceships look sterile and flat because they have an unbelievable perfection to them.  The only scene which got my blood to boil were light saber duels.I wanted to care about these characters, but I couldn't.  Jar-Jar never shows a glimpse of intelligence or likability and Lucas repeats the same shtick with him every time he was SGI-instantiated.  Which is often!  I wanted to hate Darth Maul like I hated Darth Vader but with so few scenes and no lines when he actually does appear it doesn't work.  Our first encounter with Darth Vader had him crushing a captive's throat with his bare hands.  We knew by the end of his first scenes that he was evil, psychotic, intelligent and strong.  The perfect villain.  Darth Maul shows none of these characteristics .And worst, I think, is how the plot relies on so many divine interventions to pull itself along.  Even the final scenes of RotJ which involved the improbable sequences with the Ewoks, everyone acted with purpose.  There was no, 'what does this button do?', no 'Maybe I'll bump into the answer?', no 'maybe a mysterious failure will help us?'.  Sure Star Wars had plenty of luck, but not blind luck.  I was frustrated by how many times a 'good thing just happened' which saved our characters.Anything else I say would probably be spoilers.  There are still moments of irresistible fun throughout and it was worth the $10 I paid.  But unhappily, I don't think this Star Wars is anywhere near the caliber of its antecedents.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
Die Hard 2," Easily the stupidest movie I've ever seen
","I've seen Ishtar.  I've seen Howard the Duck.  I've even seen Mortal Kombat II.  None of these hold a candle to the blatant stupidity of Die Hard II. The premise that you can hold planes hostage in the air over the area of the world with the MOST airports is pathetic.  Fer cryin' out loud Andrew's Airforce Base is a short drive from Dulles and that's where the president lands.But what I love most about the movie is how the day that the day the terrorist uber-lord is going to land at Dulles??? the worst blizzard in the history of the world descends on the East Coast.  Good timing folks!  The terrorist plan involves millions of dollars in high-tech gear, a subverted American military unit, and enough ammunition to take down a third-world country.  My question:  why not spend $10,000 and bribe the pilot of the plane?  Doh!  Perhaps he would know how to aim a gun too!  For certain these highly trained terrorists didn't go to any NRA training camps.To conclude my rant, I would just like to offer this:  What happens when a 200 lbs man in full combat gear is sucked into the engine of a jet-liner? You probably expect serious damage to the plane.  Maybe an explosion. After all, a 2 pound bird can take down a military jet.  Now what do you think happens in this movie?Take a guess.  Perhaps you can enjoy this movie for humor value of the parallel universe physics.  Only Piccard saying 'end holodeck program' right before the credits could save this disaster of implausibility.",1,23,49,30 May 1999
A Bug's Life," Over a year and I still cry
","This is maybe the funniest movie I've ever seen and certainly one of the most ingenious.  I saw it in the theatres twice and just got the DVD. EVERY time I watch it I laugh hard.  Every time I watch it I see something new to laugh at.  Whether it's the facial expressions of Tuck and Roll, Slim waving his hand while flying, or 'FLAMING DEATH!'.  If you've seen the movie you're probably smiling.  If you haven't, well, you need to.  Jeez, just thinking about it is making me crack up!",10,0,0,26 May 1999
