Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Can't wait for the rest
","First of all I must say that I am a Star Wars fan and therefore am biased towards the movie.With that said and done, I think that every critic who has slammed this movie should be fired. Most critics make two points which I will handle in turn:1. Too many special effects -- it is true that this movie revolves around special effects. However, these are breathtaking to say the least and are what make it a great movie instead of just a mediocre one.2. Not enough human emotion -- this entirely not true. Humans are seen clearly to triumph over robots. Robots are entirely unable to fight humans and the force.REMEMBER: When watching the movie, one must remember that it is only the first of a trilogy. The plot and the characters build up over all three. Therefore, any emotion lacking in the movie is due entirely to the fact that the producer has enough sense to let us explore new traits of the characters' character in the second and third movie.CONS: it does take a while to get goingGENERAL VERDICT: Not to be missed on any condition. Watch on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can find.",9,7,9,26 July 1999
