The Hangover," Comedy Of The Year
","wow now i know why they're making a second part of the movie when it wasn't released yet! Thee best comedy movie this year for sure, i don't think i can stop watching it. The movie starts when they start the hangover experience, when they did i knew i am about to have some good time. The funny scenes are infinite; the masturbating baby, the Chinese lucky charm, Tiger Tyson and Aleen is the king. Fav comedy movie after Tropic Thunder. I think that in the next part they gonna have to do a much harder working since they rose the bar so high in this part. I really don't think that they should remove or add any people to the 4 guys because they're already hilarious, can't wait for the second part.",10,10,16,21 July 2009
