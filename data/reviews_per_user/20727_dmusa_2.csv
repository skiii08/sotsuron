Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," what was the point of this movie
","it would have made sense if it was only 2,3,4,5,6 episode 1 was useless at the beginning of 2 Anacin and Padm'a should meet and obi-wan ken-obi should meet Anakin and Yoda should have trained obi-wan like Ben said in episode 4 it would have been a better trilogy no a better saga. and i think they should redo episode 4,5,and 6 to make it less confusing and with better graphics and obi wan shouldn't look 50 years old it has been only 15 years i think.and on super shadow.com it says if they do episodes 10-12 it wont have any sky walkers what .make a star wars without any sky walker that is impossible.call the cops on George if he does do it.",10,3,6,27 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the falcon in this movie
",i know some of u people think that the should have showed the millennium falcon but they didn't your wrong ha ha ha okay if you want to see it when they are coming after killing count Duke and they are coming in the nice spaceship not the half spaceship that is on fire.look at the bottom right and you will see the millennium falcon landing . so you are thinking oh Han solo i driving it.No he is only 5 I'm pretty sure he doesn't have a permit to drive it yet. i think Lando's father is driving it.then Lando gets it then Han solo wins it.so thats just a little star wars trivia for you and for anyone who reads this tell your friend make u look like a smart guy,9,1,4,27 November 2005
