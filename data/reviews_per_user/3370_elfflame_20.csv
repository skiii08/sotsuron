Howl's Moving Castle," One of Ghibli's best!
","Went to see this with my husband, and absolutely loved it. I like it much more than Sprited Away, and that says a lot right there, because I loved Spirited Away quite a bit. We bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. The voices in this were lovely, and Billy was especially wonderful. I'd forgotten that Christian Bale did Howl's voice until the credits, though. The plot's not perfect, but what's there is excellent. I was a little worried about this, because one of the bad reviews I saw on Rotten Tomatoes (and there weren't many...) said that the writing sucked. Though there are plot holes, the story moves along fast enough that you don't really notice them until you think back on the movie. And there's so much else to focus on that the holes aren't really a major issue. The movie is humorous and solemn in turns, and there's so much to see that the plot holes just don't matter.As far as characters, I fell immediately in love with Howl, who's very devil-may-care, but with a good heart. There's a great mix of other characters, from the main character, Sophie, who is cursed by a powerful witch because she's caught Howl's attention; to Calcipher, voiced by Billy Crystal, who is the main source of Howl's power. The characters feel like they have back-stories, even though we never learn most of them, and that's fine, given the limitations of a movie of this type. In fact, it makes me more inclined to like the film, as it makes the characters feel more like real people. Yes, I want to know more about them, but it's not necessary to know, and just knowing that there is a history there is enough.The world is wonderfully rich--kind of a mix of natural magic and the Great War period, with flying ships of all descriptions, odd tanks and battleships, and fascinating mythology, which, while not given much detail, still feels a part of the world, rather than something overlaying it. The Castle itself is not so much a castle as an amazing moving house, which has its own inherent magics, thanks to a fire demon. There were a lot of things that went unexplained, but given the time they had to explain, they did exceptionally well.That's really all I have to say, aside from the fact that anyone who enjoys Ghibli films should not miss this one.",9,3,4,23 June 2007
12 Monkeys," A Truly Amazing Film
","God, where to start?  This movie is one of the best movies, Sci-Fi or otherwise, that I have seen in recent years.  If you don't like time-travel stories, it may not be for you, but otherwise, you really need to go see this film. Bruce Willis is a f***ing amazing actor, and highly underrated, with this and Sixth Sense (one of the few other films I would rank in my all-time top ten) under his belt, no one should be able to say that he can't act.  He truly pulls off an amazing performance, considering that he is travelling through time, and each shift shows exactly how confused he is. Gilliam has outdone himself with this story, and lets the viewer ride along with him as he shows the rediscovery of what actually caused the plague that destroyed the future world.  The search for answers leads the viewer on a roller-coaster ride that doesn't stop for a minute.  you are there with each discovery as it is made, and cannot help but root for them as they try to stop the inevitable from happening. If you haven't seen this film, check it out.  Especially if you are a Bruce Willis fan.",9,0,0,21 June 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A worthy sequel
","It was the best of the movies I saw the summer it came out. Not hard considering the other two major releases were X3, which was pitiful, and Superman Returns which was enjoyable, but had some serious flaws. Pirates easily beat them both. I love Johnny Depp tremendously, and nine times out of ten, his movies are excellent. I was just hoping this wouldn't be the tenth time. It wasn't. If you loved the first movie, if you loved the characters, the setting, the mysticism, heck, if you love The Secret of Monkey Island, go see this film! Oh, and for those of you who like to, there is an extra scene at the end, so do stay past the credits.-- Spoilers past this point --There were less references to the ride this time around, but there were enough references to the first movie to make up for the lack. All the big names are back: Jack, Will, Elizabeth, her father, even Norrington and Barbossa. Davey Jones is excellently played by Bill Nighy, who's got quite the range, and I think he did an excellent job. Will's father was also an important part, and well-played, though I would have liked them to have hired someone with a bit more likeness to Orlando Bloom, given how much they went on about Will's likeness to his father in the first film.The new nasty in the movies does seem to be Davey Jones and his crew, but there's an underlying historical nasty as well: the East India Trading Company, whose presence is felt from the beginning of the movie to the end. One might call them the first example of true corporate greed (no, I don't need previous examples, thanks). They were so concerned with controlling the flow of goods that they really were the first example of the new capitalism that became the cornerstone of the US. If they couldn't have it their way, they found new ways to bend people to doing what they wanted anyway. The beginning of the movie shows just what lengths some would go to to get what they wanted, even if, in this case, what was wanted was mythical, it wasn't far from historical fact, either. I like that they've downplayed its significance throughout this movie, as I imagine that they will have a much larger roll in the next, given how the movie ended.Stuff I liked:* Racing up the cliffs in the cages* The way they did the cannibals was much more realistic than most 'savages' are portrayed in these sorts of movies: Jack was their god, therefore he needed to be released, and his flesh to become part of the tribe. Yeah, gruesome, but still...* Davey Jones's crew were amazing. The choices of each crewmember's affectations of the sea were incredible.* The Voodoo lady/witch/queen, however you prefer to refer to her, was excellent. So much there that was just *right** Elizabeth going off on her own, dressing like a boy, 'haunting' a ship, all great.* The explanation of the compass. Very cool idea.* The three-way fight over Davey Jones's heart, particularly the part on the runaway water-wheel.Less than perfect:* I missed having Anamaria on the crew. Is there some sort of contract that says you're not allowed to have more than a small handful of women in speaking roles in action adventure movies?* I was expecting, from the end of the last movie, that this one would be about the gold again. I'm not sad it's not, but it makes no sense to have that ending, and the evil monkey, if you're not going to use it in some way. Then again, it's always possible they will by the end.* Bootstrap seemed under-used for someone that was talked about so much in the last movie. I would have liked to see more of him, really. I was pleased about his entrance into the movie, though. Great intro.All in all, a great movie, and definitely one I will be adding to my collection the moment it's out. Go see it.",8,0,2,18 June 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Everything I could possibly want and so much more
","When I heard they were doing a motion picture of Narnia, I had a little checklist of things in my head that the movie absolutely had to do right for me to be happy coming out of the theatre. They had to show the interaction between Lucy and Tumnus well. I didn't want Tumnus to come across creepy and squicky, especially. I wanted to see the scene between the Queen and Edmund. I wanted to see the presents from Santa, even if we didn't see Santa. And they absolutely HAD to have grown-up Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy on a hunt at the end. I was not disappointed by any of those scenes. They were all there, and they were all wonderful.Tumnus was perfect and timid and just wonderful to watch, and the costume and effects for his hooves were perfect. Even his scarf was lovely. The scene with him lulling Lucy to sleep by playing his pipe, and Aslan breaking the spell is absolutely gorgeous. And his horror at what he's been forced to do was well-played. Tilda was lovely, if extremely understated. I'm still trying to decide if I would have wanted someone more over-the-top for the Queen. I love Tilda, but I was expecting more histrionics, I guess. On the other hand, she was gorgeous, and definitely coldly cruel. And the scene where she made a hot drink and Turkish Delight for Edmund was perfect. The scene with Santa was almost exactly word-for-word from the book at the beginning, though I did miss him giving them the presents for Edmund as well, and apparently the beavers deserved nothing... I do understand why they cut that part of the scene, but still.But my favorite scene was the Hunt. I was so worried they'd sell it short and keep them kids, but I desperately wanted to see the older versions of them, and the return to the 'real world' as it were. It was so perfect, and the falling out of the wardrobe kids again was exactly how I'd hoped.Now, I'm a long-time fan of the Narnia books. Read them several times over the years. And though I didn't see the Christian imagery when I was a kid, it's blatant to me now. And while I'm stridently anti-religion, and those sorts of things usually annoy the heck out of me, I can honestly say that the scriptwriter did an excellent job on transferring it all across. There was no new imagery to 'suggest' further religious stuff, and I don't particularly think they toned down what CS Lewis actually had in the story itself. I thought it was actually quite well-handled, considering.Other bits and pieces:* Jim Broadbent as the Professor. Such an excellent casting choice. He really does the childlike surprise and interest well.* Aslan. I would have liked a stronger voice, actually. I love Liam Neeson, but I don't think he was strong enough for the part when it came right down to it. I guess it felt to me like Aslan was holding back a bit.* The Beavers were fabulous. The animation was perfect, and the interplay between the two of them was wonderful. And Dawn French was fabulous, as usual. * I have heard others say that Edmund steals the movie, but really, aside from one scene at the beginning of the movie, everything I saw in the movie with him was stuff that was straight from the book. And the boy they got to play him did an excellent job.* Peter--the young man they got to play him was excellent. He is how I have always seen Cedric Diggory in my head, if a touch younger than Cedric in GOF.* I quite liked how they illustrated the realities of the children's situation before they got on the train, and also how much the kids really felt like siblings. Whoever was responsible for that did an excellent job.* My husband was thrilled at 'Aslan's on the move.' Rather important line, and nicely done. Sent a thrill through me when I heard it. And another wonderful line that I'd totally forgotten about until it was said: 'Ward Robe in the land of Spare Oom...' Which makes me think of Rock and Rule now, but it's an adorable line.* The wardrobe itself was an absolutely gorgeous thing. WETA outdid themselves, and not just on that, either. The costumes after they arrive at Aslan's camp, and the weapons and crowns were all gorgeous.* Tumnus's punishment. I was practically biting my nails waiting for Edmund to stumble across Tumnus in the Queen's courtyard, but when they showed him it was utterly perfect and so miserable. Poor Edmund...* And OMG, the swordfighting. I kept snickering at Peter using his sword like a gun, keeping it trained on whoever he was fighting, but I love that in the final battle sequences they were actually swordfighting--meaning that they weren't fencing with the ruddy things or using them like clubs. Tilda especially shone in the battle sequences.So, yes. Good movie. Watch. It's worth it.",10,1,2,18 June 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," If you want the real story, read the book
","This movie was standard disaster-movie fare. I am sure I would have been very annoyed if I'd gone to see it in the theatre. This isn't Independence Day by any stretch of the imagination, no matter who directed it. The problem is, that there was an important message hidden in the garbage, and I can't help wishing that they'd made this a better movie so that that message wouldn't be ignored.I have to say I feel a great deal of sympathy for Art Bell, whose book this story idea came from. I'm sure he'd rather it had been ignored than laughed at.",6,2,3,23 June 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The best of the series
","If you are a fan, go see this movie. It is the best of the trilogy, hands down. And I never say that about sequels, so that's saying something. It is the perfect culmination of everything that's come before.Just go.Now...for the spoilery bits...There was one of two ways this movie could go. It could devolve into a mess of nonsense that no one could follow, or worse, try to copy itself. Or it could follow up on everything we've seen these two movies leading up to. It did the latter. Perfectly. Now, if you didn't care so much about the first two films, or didn't pay attention to them, you'll get lost within the first ten minutes. But if you're a fan? It's absolutely amazing.Let us not forget that this movie started out about a little girl with a dream and a wish. Elizabeth is the centre of these movies in so many ways. She is the one who has the medallion. She is the one who loves the idea of pirates, and freedom. In the second film, she is the one who doesn't trust Beckett and takes her fate into her own hands. Jack has his own agenda--not that we ever have any clue what it is. As does Will--when he's not letting others push him around. It's Elizabeth who gives the movies their backbone and direction. Without her, it all falls apart. Not only did Keira stand up to her role in this movie, but she literally blew me away. From the moment she appears on screen, she's stronger and more amazing than she was in either of the first two films.But she's not the only one who's finally gotten a backbone. For me, one of Will's failings in the first two films is that he's such a wimp. His sole purpose in life is to respond to how others think of him. We get a small glimpse of who he might be once in a while, particularly the scene in Curse where he finally takes his fate into his own hands and 'fixes' the curse. Not here. Finally he has a true purpose. Yes, it's still about someone, but for once he's standing up for himself, and willing to really do what it takes to get what he wants. He's so much stronger in this film than in either of the others. I just love him so much more. Oh, and his hair at the end just made me drool. *happysigh*I was completely impressed with the complexity of this story. The first was rather straight-forward, and the second, while a bit complex, was only a bit more so. For this to be a summer movie, especially of the blockbuster variety, was incredibly impressive. I came out of the theatre completely satisfied that every loose end that needed to be was tied up. I loved it.Favorite bits:* The song gave me chills.* The Asian pirate town and Shipwreck Cove, or whatever that pirate town was called, were both absolutely cool. I particularly love the first view of the pirate city, all lit up. It was gorgeous.* Pentell and Ragetti were wonderful as always, and their new little friends at the end of the movie were great. :D If any continuation of this should be made, it should definitely focus on those four.* The moment the Black Pearl crested the sand dune, I knew they'd done it right. So perfect.* Loved the mythos in this. They took everything in the first two films and added more that just made it work. Particularly the addition of Callypso. I loved the parallel between Callypso and Davey Jones and Elizabeth and Will. And the idea that one of the other pirates might have thought Elizabeth was Callypso was terrific.* Keith Richards's cameo was lovely, and I loved seeing he and Johnny on-screen together.* The pirate council was terrific, particularly the fact that each pirate was obviously a different nationality. I also loved that their pieces of eight were pieces of junk, and that Ragetti's been hiding Barbossa's the whole time.* Oh, and while we're on Ragetti? Him breaking the spell on Callypso was gorgeous.* The 'rocking the boat' scene was great.* Seeing Davey Jones's original form was lovely, and the scene between he and Tia Dalma was perfect and so bittersweet...* And that was the best wedding ever. And the climax of the fight--with Jack and Davey followed by Will and Elizabeth and Bootstrap... Even expecting something, the fullness of the scene was so unexpected as to startle anyone watching. Excellently done, and the wedding only lent to it.* Bootstrap Bill's part in this film was so poignant...between his memory loss, and his role in his son's fate... Amazingly well-done.And whatever you do? Do not leave before the end of the credits!",9,4,6,18 June 2007
The Prestige," A classical style thriller, but it misses the mark
","I don't like horror films, but these days, most thrillers tend to be packaged as horror films, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the commercials for the Prestige when it first came out. I didn't get to see it then. Too much going on, and more important movies to see when I did go to the theatre.I have to say, after waiting so long, I'm glad I didn't. I'm very underwhelmed by it.Hugh Jackman was a bit stiff in this, and that makes me worry, because I know he can pull off good acting. The rest of the performances were generally lovely, though.The flow was a bit confusing at first, but not overly so, and as time went on, everything was set in its proper time frame. But I do think people who like linear films would have difficulty with the first hour or so of the film.The sequences with Tesla felt like they should have been in a different story. Something more action-oriented. They didn't fit with the flow of the rest, really, and were only there for the big shocker, and to give Bowie his cameo. I would much rather have seen a growing thread of mishaps and attacks from each of them as Angier worked out the secret.The ending left me cold, and to be honest, rather ill. I think the writer sold himself short. Or thought they were writing an episode of Twilight Zone.Borden's secret was obvious less than halfway through the movie or so, and while it did seem as though at times they might have been working towards another explanation, in the end, it turned out to be just what it seemed.All in all, a vaguely interesting story if you're into stage magicians, or are fond of the actors involved, but not at all what it could have been, given the right attention.",7,9,19,2 July 2007
The Butterfly Effect," A thriller the way thrillers should be done.
","I need to preface this review by saying that I do not like Ashton Kutcher. That said, I do remember seeing the preview for this movie and thinking, 'hm, that doesn't look too bad.' But I stayed away. Because of him.So when I watched it, I was completely blown away. It's very well done. Maybe some of the ideas weren't fully explored, but they did an excellent job with what they did explore, given the time constraints on a feature-length film.By the end, I'd totally forgotten the main character was Ashton Kutcher. And that's a very good thing, if I can forget who the actor is and start to enjoy the film in spite of that. Particularly when the actor is someone I dislike that much.The ending was perfect. Not happy, but not sad, either. Just a touch melancholy. Perfect. Definitely a movie to see.",8,2,4,23 June 2007
Batman Begins," A fresh start for a franchise that desperately deserved it
","This movie lot of fun. You should definitely see it if you don't mind canon changes (again, after all, this is DC we're talking about), and/or if you like Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman or Morgan Freeman. All fabulous in this.--spoilers past this point-- I love Gary Oldman. He made this movie worth watching for me. Every time he was on screen, I squeed. And you could tell he was having fun, too. Particularly when he got to use the Batmobile. ;D And they showed his family! I wanna see Babs! (But I'm more than willing to wait.) Things that worked: the training sequences, particularly the final training fight between Christian and Liam, which was excellently choreographed. The idea that Wayne Enterprises was being run by a board, because his father was a doctor in canon, so it was a nice nod to why there was a corporation. Where the bat-toys came from! OMG, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. And he was excellent. 'Mister Wayne...Don't think of me as an idiot.' :D The slow development of Bruce Wayne, depressed and guilty millionaire's son to Batman was just about perfect. Also, Ra's Al Ghul's part in the story was perfect. I had my doubts when I saw that the person playing him wasn't well-known, but trust me...he's PERFECT. Also, I loved that they used Crane/Scarecrow in this very first story. And that for once, the did multiple villains *right*. It ends up setting up everything to come. The final scene with Gordon and Batman on the rooftop (another great line... 'I couldn't find a mob boss'), and his clue for this Arkham criminal Batman's going to have to capture (no, I won't say which. It's obvious when you see the clue, but it's a biggie.) were excellent. Gives me hope for good movies in the future.The bad: I felt rather beat over the head with the 'Fear' mallet, specifically at the beginning. And they didn't follow through on it nearly enough. They were obviously having too much fun with the car-chases, blowing things up, and other action scenes. Oh, and I don't hate Katie Holmes, but does she have any other acting style? I swear she was just being Joey from Dawson's Creek. Not what I wanted to see. I would much have preferred to see Talia (Ra's daughter) as a love interest. Seeing as how she really didn't do much for the plot, and their 'romance' was nonexistent. Michael Cane was nice, but felt mostly unused. I would have liked something more for him to do than snark sweetly at still-evolving Bruce.What I would like from the next one? More thought, less action, more plot. One villain (Joker or Two-face would be nice, but not necessary). And a true love interest...who doesn't find out/figure out who Batman is, or even get taken to his cave, k?",7,2,2,23 June 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," This isn't the movie it should have been
","I wasn't very impressed with X-Men 3. There were good things, and there were things that really ticked me off, but it wasn't as bad as say, Men in Black 2. It just wasn't good. If you're a fan of the series, leave it at two, and save yourself the annoyance.--- Spoilers past this point ---Okay, I was originally drawn into XMen by the Dark Phoenix storyline, so I knew this would be make-or-break for me. And it was a bad sign that my first thought upon seeing Famke on-screen was, 'What did they do to her hair?' It looked like a dye-job gone horribly wrong. There were a few scenes where it almost worked, but it generally just looked bad. Her best scenes were the moment at the lake before she killed Scott; the scenes at her parent's house; and the final scenes with Wolverine. But there was too much missing. Where was her internal conflict? And where was the Phoenix effect?Now, this is not to say that the change from being a universal force to a top-level mutant bugged me. I understand the need to simplify for movie matters, but if you're going to change something so significant, you need to explore it far more thoroughly than they did. And I understand why Erik/Magneto needed to be part of the plot line. After all, he's been in the other two, so he needs to be in this one. But I don't think he should have been center stage. That should have been Jean's struggle, with Erik moving in the background at most.Oh, and speaking of Erik... Magneto has never been stupid. He's flawed, yes, but highly intelligent. He simply wouldn't discard someone simply because they've changed. In fact, he'd likely take Mystique and do experiments on her to find out exactly what they'd done to her. And, more than likely, discover that it's not a permanent change. Other characters:* Logan was center screen again. Not bad, though he's becoming a one-note character. If they do any further movies, it would get old. I did like the play between him and Jean, especially since they killed Scott so early on in the movie. * Professor X seemed to be sleepwalking through the story, and I get that he was being distracted by Phoenix, but still. And his death, too, seemed a waste. If anything, it should have woken Erik up.* Scott should not have even been in this movie. It seems as though he had one point to being there (waking up Jean), and then they killed him. I would have liked to see the Scott/Jean/Logan triangle played up far much more than it was.* Bobby grew up in this film, which was nice. I particularly liked the appearance of his ice-form finally. And the battle between him and Pyro was perfect. But the Kitty/Bobby/Rogue triangle seemed unnatural to me, particularly with Peter right there. I think it was ridiculous to create a triangle like that, to give Rogue a reason to angst about not being able to touch him. It didn't even need to be there at all for her to do that. It could have been entirely innocent and she still would have done it.* Callisto was cool. I liked the actress, and the Callisto/Storm action actually got to my fangirl heart, even if she wasn't the Callisto from the books. Cause that Callisto would never have put up with Erik's attitude. She would have kicked his butt. :P* Kitty was great. Not perfect, but lots of fun, and not too far off how I actually think of her. I would have liked more interactions with Peter and less with Bobby, though. The race through the building was lots of fun, and even though her bouncing into the wall was expected, it was great to see how quick she recovered to get the boy out.* Peter was cool. But where was his accent?!? I was thrilled to see the fastball special, not once, but twice in the movie. Very nice.* Kelsey Grammar was one of the highlights of this film. His Beast was as good as I was expecting, though I had hoped for more of his quotes during their fighting. But then, he wasn't in much fighting, really, which is a shame. I did love his intro, hanging upside-down from his office ceiling. * Pyro is so not a level three. I did like that he had gloves that allowed him more immediate access to fire, but without them? He'd have nothing. * Juggernaut: Hello? He's Charles's stepbrother. Why didn't they at least have a spark of recognition there? Oh, and while we're at it, his helmet is the source of his power. Hence no mutant ability for the boy to negate. * Warren was only in the movie for two purposes: to give his father a reason to make the 'cure,' and to rescue his father at the end. At the very least, he should have had an argument with the XMen about letting him go with them, and/or hiding out on the jet.There's probably so much more here I could cover, but I've gone on long enough. All in all? Too much to cover properly in one movie. It had no proper focus. If Singer had still been in charge, and had the budget not been slashed to ribbons, it could have been as great as the other two. As it was, it was just mediocre. If you're not a fan of the comics, you'll likely enjoy it. But it's just not what it could have been.",5,5,6,18 June 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Overall interesting, but not as good as the original
","The first thing I must say is that I read this or was read this book when I was very small, so I can't recall the differences between the Musical and the book. Despite that, I could tell that there were a lot of places in the movie that went back to the original source material, just from what I remembered. I also think Tim had a huge impact on the changes from the original storyline, and anyone who knows his work will see it.I did enjoy it, but could have done without his special addition, to be honest.Johnny- I love Johnny. I'm a fan from way back in the teen idol days. I watched 21 Jump Street as consistently as my parents would allow (in other words, not regularly). And when he moved to movies, I made sure to watch as many as I could. I love how his career has grown, and how careful he is with the characters he chooses to play. They're always different, and he never plays the same guy twice. Even if it feels like the same role at first. I liked him in the movie. But... when I first saw the original commercial for the movie, I was a little freaked out. And I couldn't figure out why he creeped me out for a long time. Until something made me compare him to Gary Oldman. His Willy Wonka reminds me of Zorg from the Fifth Element. Not that he was evil in that way, but in the horribly plasticky look they gave him. And I do understand they were trying to stylize him, but even so, it left me cold. And after seeing the movie, I also have to say that he just kind of floated through the part. He was good, he was believable, but he didn't always feel all there during some scenes, and I mean that in the not acting way, not in the 'he's insane' way. As far as I'm concerned, he didn't claim Willy Wonka as well as Gene Wilder did in the Musical.The kids- * Charlie was lovely. I think the kid they got to play him did an excellent job, though there were moments in the movie where Tim (or possibly Roald, I'm not sure if the scenes were straight from the book) got a bit too preachy about how good and wholesome Charlie was. Luckily, there weren't too many. * Agustus Gloop almost felt like he was a computer animated character before they ever got to the factory. But I was pleased that his mother got a bit more screen-time in this one. It wasn't just her shrieking about Augustus. * Varuca Salt was perfect. Evil and conniving and petty. * Violet had an interesting twist to her character: her mother was the one pushing her to be competitive. I also liked that she and Mike TV ended up with reversed parents. Instead of Violet's father going along, it was her mother, and instead of Mike's mother, it was his father. * Mike was the one I had the most trouble with, to be honest. Instead of being a simple TV junkie, which I agree doesn't happen so much any more, he was turned not only into a video-game-shooter kid, but he was also rather a genius when it came to technical stuff. Now, the technical stuff worked as far as his wanting to use the Wonka-vision, but I kind of wanted to see this violent streak, which they alluded to a few times in the movie, used in his punishment in some form. Well, now that I think on it, it was a bit, with the way the Oompa Loompas smack him around while they're singing, but it didn't seem enough, really.Tim's addition- now, anyone who knows about Tim Burton knows one of his themes is fathers. Which is fine. But did he have to add it to this movie? It had themes enough of it's own. I wanted to see the bubble room--though the way the Charlie acted in this one, he'd probably be too perfect to try it. And my husband said he missed seeing the office and the signing of the contract. The father stuff worked okay, but I would have rather seen the original story, and not a story that was chopped in half and changed into a Tim Burton story... They just didn't feel like they were part of the overall story to me. But since I knew the story beforehand, that might just be me.Other bits- I loved that the grandparents (grandpa Jo and grandma Josephine and grandpa George and grandma Georgina) all had extremely distinct personalities that came out on-screen. And particularly enjoyed Liz Smith (who played Letitia Cropley in the Vicar of Dibley series) as grandma Georgina. I loved the Disney-esquire entrance to the factory, which then proceeded to blow up and catch on fire.I know this sounds like I hated it, but I really didn't. It was a lot of fun to watch, even if there were several wincable things. It's worth going, just be prepared, because it's definitely not the same.",7,0,1,23 June 2007
Big Fish," A lovely fable by the modern master of fables
","I'm a Burton fan and a Ewan McGregor fan, so I'm rather annoyed I missed this in the theatres. Quite calm for a Burton flick, though. Not that it wasn't full of oddities, but that it wasn't as weird as some Burton flicks. I loved Ewan and Albert. Their performances were fantastic. And the scene where his son makes up the 'surprise ending' for him was perfect, really. Even more, though, I loved the idea of this man who was trying to figure out the truth of his father, when really, he had it all along. The idea that people can be so obsessed with the details that they miss the big picture. Not sure I need to own it, but I definitely enjoyed it. And I'll almost definitely watch it again.",8,0,0,23 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Back to the good stuff
","I've seen it twice, now, and love it. It's not my favorite, but might be my second-favorite. I'm not sure if it's because I liked this book better than GOF, or the direction, but I enjoyed it more. This one actually felt like the first three, unlike Goblet. Even with the darkness of the film, I loved so much more about it than Goblet. It might be that I just didn't like that story, and this one calls to me much more.Good - I cried the first moment they showed Sirius. And Sirius calling Harry James during the battle? That moment was possibly my favorite moment of the film. And I really enjoyed it, so that's saying a lot. It was just so perfect. Especially the look on Harry's face. Umbridge was perfect, if completely evil. She pulled it off perfectly. It was so easy to hate her. Minerva facing off against her--she might have had to back down, but I loved both their scenes together.DA scenes were incredible. Particularly the Patronus scene. And Neville growing up and strong! I missed not meeting his parents, but I think the replacement worked well.The endgame at Hogwarts was lovely. Particularly Snape's reaction to Harry's outburst, though I would have liked some more evidence that he went to tell the Order Umbridge being taken by the Centaurs...hoisted on her own petardby both Harry and the Centaurs. Anyone says that she didn't deserve it doesn't get just how horrific she was. I do have one complaint, though. Was it really unimportant that Umbridge sent the Dementors after Harry? I would have liked to have heard her mutter it, at least.Bella was good, though even after two showings, I still can't quite get a grasp of her. I did like the moment of Lucius/Bella there, when he was telling Harry how kids could never stand up to Death Eaters, though. And the beatific grin on her face when Voldemort started whispering to Harry was perfect.The fights at the Ministry were well-done. And if it hadn't been Gambon, I would have loved the fight between DD and Voldy. Did anyone else actually believe his blather to Harry afterwards about loving him? His lines came off so stiffNot so good - My biggest complaint with this movie has to do with Draco -- not only did he not get enough screen time, but they also didn't show the Death Eaters' arrest, and he didn't threaten Harry at the end. It's vital for his character development in the next movie. After Harry and Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville, Draco's the next-most important kid in the series. By this point, we need to see more than this cardboard cut-out. I don't know its a script problem, or a directing problem, or an acting problem (no, I don't particularly like Tom.), but if this is the Draco we get in the next film, I probably won't see the last. Sure, it's more dramatic to have the Dementor attack in a tunnelbut honestlydid they think we wouldn't remember that that playground was a lot closer to Privet Drive in POA? Not to mention that it was surrounded by HOUSES And while I'm on that scene, did the actor who plays Dud really think that worked? He looked like the Dementors had been successful in their attack.Quidditch  surely Rupert's got to feel a bit left-out by now? That was Ron's biggest development in the whole series! And the fight! And Harry and the twins being banned from playing ever again! And Umbridge taking their brooms! And a whole major Draco sequence taken out there With Trelawney, where was the explanation that it was her who gave the prophesy? We missed several details because of it was done. Like Neville being the almost-boy-who-lived, or that it was overheard by someone.The point of the Occlumency lessons wasn't to learn how to break into Snape's mind. Harry was supposed to be keeping Snape from breaking into his own. Which he failed to do. But still, that's hardly a reason to stop. We needed the Pensieve so that we could see that even hero Harry can sometimes be in the wrong. I'm sorry, but I can't be okay with how Cho's role changed. Made her far too sympathetic. Where was the crying? It's going to make no sense for Harry and co to still be avoiding her in the next movie.Twinsseemed a bit wooden in this one. Yes, we got WWW, and the scene with them leaving Filch the doctored candy was lovely, butI wasn't feeling them this time. I will say I loved the scene where they left, though. The firework dragon managed to hold up against the memory of the one in LOTR. And the Decrees all falling off the wall? Perfect! I also thought Harry collapsing in the middle of the twins escape worked quite well for moving things forward.Bella did not use AK on Sirius in the book. She actually used red spell. The only red spell JK has mentioned was the stunning spell. She's made a point of mentioning it, in fact. But the death itself?Remus holding Harry back was just a heartstring puller. Yes, I cried. Even if they did do the death wrong.Good movie. I do recommend it. More than GOF.",7,0,0,18 July 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A good, thought-provoking story
","I went into this knowing a few vague things about this story, and a recommendation from my sister. I like Jim Carey when he does something different, and this is definitely different. And I adore Kate Winslet.But even beyond the actors, I wasn't disappointed at all. It's a fabulous film, as long as you don't mind a slight mind-bending experience that really makes you think. The idea that you can just wipe your memory is intriguing, and Elijah Wood's character is pleasantly creepy. The interplay between reality and memory, both created and real, is quite well-done. It's a fascinating film, if you're willing to wrap your mind around it. And the ending, while ambiguous, works quite well.",8,1,3,23 June 2007
The Mummy Returns," Not your average sequel
","Now, admittedly, I adore Brendan Frasier, and think he can do no wrong. However, that said, I remember walking out of the theatre with a huge grin on my face.  I really enjoyed this movie.  This cast works exceedingly well together, and they didn't just rehash the same old jokes again.  The storyline's quite different, and the action scenes are, if anything, better. Yes, there are plotholes, particularly when you combine the two stories of the original movie and the sequel, and the immense commercial throughought the movie for the Scorpion King movie with the Rock was horrificaly bad. (At least that movie went down like a lead balloon.  Imagine, a wrestler trying to do an egyptian warrior.  Doesn't work for me.  Then again, I didn't see that one.  I wasn't interested.)  Even my sister, who does not like horror films, had fun with this one.  I do recommend it, especially to those who like the love story in the first one.",7,1,2,12 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not even half the story this time--and certainly not the important part
","An intro: I am a Harry Potter fan and I hated this movie.Just so people who read this review will understand where I come from, I have to say I'm a Malfoy-booster. It's not that I think they're good-hearted or anything like that. I just don't think they need to be turned into cardboard cut-outs. I was thrilled we got to see them at the World Cup, but even though they had lines, they just seemed too flat. I wanted Lucius and Arthur glowering at each other. I wanted a Harry/Draco faceoff!And the Ferret scene? Just painful. Why did he go into Crabbe's trousers? And we were completely robbed of Draco in dress robes. But it was the graveyard scene that really upset me. In the book, that scene is chilling, and Lucius still managed to somehow hold his own against Voldemort. I was glad he was there, but he just sounded like a whiny kid.Snape fared better, but his best scenes were completely disposed of. I did enjoy him knocking Harry and Ron's heads while they studied, and his scene threatening Harry with the Veritaserum was nicely done. But even so...We needed to see that Snape had the Mark on his arm, and to see him shove it in Fudge's face. I came away from the movie thinking 'There's no way they'll be able to keep going...They've dropped too many threads.' No Bella. No explanation for how Barty Jr escaped (or why the guards wouldn't have noticed...). No blackmailing Rita Skeeter. No explanation of WHY Moody's lesson affected Neville so heavily. And, of course, there's no absolute certainty that Snape's a Death Eater! Or how about Fudge's utter denial that Voldemort is back? They've left so many of the pieces unmentioned that the next movie will have no cohesion at all.Oh, and the major subplot--Barty. Now, I knew this would make or break the movie, because it's the central part of the plot. And they totally failed. I know they were trying to avoid having to explain certain things, but honestly, this is getting ridiculous. In the book, there's a lovely ambiguity to Barty Jr in the Pensive scene. It's utterly important to have that to show how he and his father interact, in my opinion. And that not everyone is JUST good, or JUST bad. It's part of JK's message. They made Barty into this total caricature, and it really didn't work. Other bits:* The pensive scene: I can understand why they did only one scene, but it should have been Barty & Co's. That would have been much more effective to show the Crouches's relationship. If they didn't want to deal with the Lestranges, they could have cut them out. It would have worked fine without them. And it would have made both characters far less ridiculous than they became.* I do think that Fiennes was excellent. Not creepy so much as subtly evil, and I think that was exactly what we needed--a slow build to the fight. The cauldron changing with him was a bit much, but walking around barefoot was a nice touch. When he moved Cedric's head with his foot, I shivered. The end of the scene--the fight and escape--came too abruptly, though I'm thrilled they showed the 'shadows' at least. Lily and James actually got to speak... And speaking of parents, Amos cheering for his son when they appeared... I think my heart nearly broke... * I loved Cedric. I think some of his scenes seemed a bit much, but when it came down to it, we got all of his character in one movie, so they did a good job, considering. I did want to have Amos going on about how his son beat Harry Potter, though. It seemed rather central to his character. He seemed too bland in this one.* The DE costumes: I can see how they could take those tall pointed hats as sort of the ultimate wizarding accessory, but they looked ridiculous. Couldn't someone have said, do we really want them to look that idiotic, or that much like KKK members? I did like the way Voldemort whisked the masks off their faces, though.* I wasn't sure about Gambon in POA, but now--I don't like his Dumbledore. He's too angry throughout this film, and it really bugged me. Harris would have pulled it off so much better.My favorite bit: Neville. Neville and all his reactions, particularly Neville and the gillyweed! Nev actually got to help Harry for once. And Neville dancing. Neville and Ginny forever, man! He was so adorable. I just wanted to give him a big kiss on the cheek.",6,1,1,18 June 2007
Enemy at the Gates," An interesting historical drama for those who enjoy WWII stories
","Enemy at the Gates was quite nice. The plot line is nicely complex, and doesn't glorify war in the least. The actors: Joseph Finnes, Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris were all excellently chosen, really, and did a wonderful job.The lovestory is a bit predictable, but then, there are only so many ways to tell a lovestory, I suppose. And Rachel Weisz's face during the big sex scene looked like she was in horrible pain. Still she and Jude Law were quite pretty together.I do think that this is a tale that had not gotten the attention it deserved, so it was nice to see this tale told, at least, and that, if nothing else, makes it worth watching.",7,0,1,23 June 2007
A Beautiful Mind," A brilliant story about a true genius, and a tragic life
","A Beautiful Mind was incredible. Having missed this in the theatres, I can't help but urge people to watch this one if they can.Russell Crow and Jennifer Connelly did an incredible job of showing the difficulties of living with an illness like Schizophrenia, not just for the person suffering from it, but for their loved ones as well. I don't know much about the actual Professor Nash, but if he dealt with even half of what they show in the movie, he must be an incredible man.The thing that took me by surprise in this movie is that there is only one scene in this movie that was before his hallucinations. They do such a great job of blending the early hallucinations into the move that you never question them until you realize what they are. You hear all about the dangerous hallucinations when it comes to this sort of illness, but never the seemingly innocuous ones. This movie showed the dichotomy quite well, I thought.Definitely a movie worth seeing.",9,1,3,23 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Still nowhere near as good as the originals
","I'm one of the original fans of this movie series. I went to Star Wars with my mother as a kid, and adored the first three with a passion that was exceeded by nothing else at the time. But then Lucas decided to make these prequels.Should I feel ashamed to say I'm glad that it's over? Okay, so it wasn't as bad as the others. But it was in no way as good as Empire. The opening scenes on the ship were good until Duku appeared. I really expected more from that sequence. It was just so flat. I did like the end of the fight, with Palpatine egging Ani to kill Duku, and Duku's shocked look. You could almost see him saying 'but master...' The Padme/Ani stuff didn't bug me as much this time round. Still wasn't great, though this time she bugged me more than he did. Like the second she was in love, she suddenly had no other life beyond him. Oh, and she was just not big enough to be pregnant with full-term twins (and both of those babies were definitely full-term). They should have been tiny. I did think that Ani's journey was a lot less whiny this time round. He actually seemed confused, and I felt like he was trying to work it out... The scene with him thanking Ben before he left to get rid of Grievous was excellent, particularly since the next time they saw each other, they were on opposite sides. And his turning was near-perfect.I could see Ani struggling with the ideas he'd been fed from both sides, and trying to figure out which was right. Still a bit wooden, but better than his scenes in Clones. You can almost see that if they'd just trusted Ani a bit more, things might have gone the other direction. There was real horror in his face when he realized Palpatine was Sideous. He would have helped them if they had arrested the man. But Windu and the rest of the council are so blinded by what 'must be done' that they just don't get it.The scenes in the temple were the only bit of plot that got me close to crying in this film. I cried at the end, but that was because it was over, and I was feeling emotional from realizing the future Luke and Leia had to look forward to. Ani activating his lightsaber when the kid turns to him for guidance... So dark. And the confrontation between Ani, Amidala and Ben was perfect. Shows the true problem with 'just doing it for the knowledge.' You might be, but knowledge changes you. As does killing. It becomes a habit, and you forget your true intentions. I liked him choking the life out of Padme, very fitting. And the scenes between he and Ben were perfect. They played off each other well.The big fight left a bit to be desired, but the finale was perfect. No, 'Oops, I left my padawan in a lake of boiling lava...oh, well...' His warning to Ani not to do it, and that flash of lightsaber when Ani jumped were perfect. Gruesome, but perfect. And the best touch? Ben taking Ani's lightsaber as he left.The rescue and resurrection of Ani was great. And Palpatine telling him he'd killed Padme, too. I liked that he couldn't even recall what he'd done. His fit about it and seeing him pull free of the restraints was good, though it was hard to get much emotion from that suit. Though that's only to be expected.I hated the scenes where Padme died. She should have been in a coma for the entire thing, and hence unable to name the children. She was certainly far too coherent at the end there when she did... I wanted more from her side of the story, and felt ripped-off. I wanted to see her interacting with Bail, and a lot more interaction with Ben. Emotional connections. Plans. Something.Yoda really kicked ass this time. He was perfect. And Order 66? Eerily perfect. Though I did get a bit sick of Yoda's reactions each and every time...The dialogue is the worst bit, though. Who did he hire to write this? A six-year-old? Just made me want to tear my hair out. Not like he couldn't have afforded a good writer by now. However, I was pleased that Jar Jar had no lines.As I said earlier, the point where I got all emotional was the moment they showed Alderaan. I've been waiting to see it for thirty years. And it was beautiful. I really would have preferred a very different story here, since in the Jedi novelization, it says that Leia knew her mother, and I would have liked to see Bail/Padme, even one-sided. I think she was a strong enough character before she married. And it wouldn't have been that difficult to save her, but let Ani think she was dead.Watching Leia and Luke with their respective adopted parents just made me bawl. By the last shot, I had tears streaming down my face, knowing the future they had waiting for them. Oh, the 'training' Yoda sets for Ben? Felt far too contrived. I mean, I get that he was trying to connect that to the 'Jedi ghost' thing in the original three, but come on...Ultimate feeling on this? I only went once to the theatre, but I needed to see it there. Just once. And I have yet to get the DVD. Maybe we'll get lucky, and it'll age well. But it's not likely.",7,1,1,23 June 2007
Fantastic Four," Not as bad as some would have you believe
","I was actually rather surprised how much they did keep to the original idea. Sure, Victor wasn't in the ship with them in the original, and yes, it didn't take place on a space-station, but the original was written before space stations, and, well...they did have to have a villain right from the beginning, so why not Victor? It's like the Burton Batman starting out with Joker. It makes sense.Johnny was actually very true to the character I recall from the books, and while the actor who played him is only like a month younger than Jessica Alba, it worked, because she was so straight-laced, and he was such an immature show-off. Ben was exceedingly well-played by Michael Chiklis, who managed to hit just about every note of sympathy we needed to have for him.And I was quite pleasantly surprised by Kerry Washington, who played Alicia, and picked up the pieces of Ben's broken heart after his wife couldn't handle his new form and left him. It didn't bug me at all that she was black, even as a token character, because I know how important her character truly is, and if they do make a sequel, she'll almost definitely be in it (can we say Ben-Alicia-Johnny triangle? :D And, no for those of you who don't know, I'm not making that up in my head. It really happened in the comics.) Interactions: Victor was perfectly heavy-handed, both in his business dealings, and with Susan. The rivalry between him and Reed was well-done, both hating when the other gets the better of him, but Reed coming out on top because he always tries to do what's 'for the best' rather than for himself. The Susan-Johnny relationship really shows itself for what it is after the change, with her constantly berating him for being so impetuous all the time. Ben and Reed's friendship is wonderful, particularly Ben's constant attempts to get Reed and Susan back together. But the real delight is the Ben-Johnny arguments. They hate each other from the beginning, with a bit of a backstory that I don't recall from the original, and therefore probably wasn't there, that Ben had been his commander at NASA before Johnny had been tossed out on his ear. After the change, their animosity grows, and every shot they're in together when there's no action going on is great fun to watch.Stan Lee's cameo in this is impossible to miss, unless you actually leave the theatre the entire time he's on the screen. He has a little conversation with Reed in the elevator lobby of the Baxter Building, and they went so far as to give him an actual name.Other bits: the evolution of the costumes was nice. The evolution of Johnny's power was better. The skiing sequence is not to be missed. Victor's downfall is swift, and his reaction, which gets darker with each blow, is utterly perfect. Oh, and the entrance to Reed's 'office' in the Baxter Building just made me grin.The sequences during the storm imbuing them with their powers was a bit much for me. I could have done with seeing the cloud surround the station and left it at that. What did annoy me was Reed's insistence on 'curing' them all. Reed is painted as an uber-geek from the get-go. And if it's about science, he's all over it. Which to me says that he'd want to figure out what had happened to them first, not how to 'cure' them. The only thing that keeps that from totally destroying the movie for me is the fact that he does promise Ben he will cure him, which makes sense to me, as far as things went. But the continued need to 'cure' just seemed a bit much.",7,4,5,23 June 2007
