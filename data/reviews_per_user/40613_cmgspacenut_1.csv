First Man," Amazing!!!
","Absolutely amazing!! Love this film. I understand what they're trying to do with it, and the film has plenty of emotion in it. Wonderfully made and captures the heart of the book too. While it obviously isn't showy, it was made that way because it's a tribute to a person who wasn't showy.",10,2,5,25 December 2018
