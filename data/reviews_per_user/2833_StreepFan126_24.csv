Miracle," Proud to be an American
","This is one of those films that reminds people of the great things that Americans can accomplish.  If you have any ounce of patriotism at all, then this movie is highly recommended.  At the time that the actual event occured back in 1980, Americans were going through a very tough time. (The  Carter Years...thank God there was only four of them!)  This was just the thing that was needed to raise hope and morality.  Nobody who saw the actual event will ever forget it!  Kurt Russel gives an excellent performance that should be recognized with an Oscar.  The supporting cast is good as well.  Overall, an enjoyable film. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 9.",Null,2,3,21 May 2004
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Best Movie That Disney Never Made
","This film has all the traits of a great Disney film.  The only problem with it: IT WASN'T DISNEY.  Steven Speilberg once again spread his magic across the world.  And while this is a wonderful film, I still can't believe that this was the highest grossing film for a long time.  Star Wars was only five years old when ET came out so how did Et out gross the biggest popcorn movie of them all?",Null,1,2,30 December 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Calling All Cartoon Lovers
","Brilliant!!! Absolutely Brilliant!!!! My favorite movie of all time!!! Not only is the animation, acting, and visual effects great, there is another side to it.  There is that feeling that maybe Roger Rabbit, Bugs Bunny, Mickey mouse etc.. really do exist and can live alongside us.  If you have ever laughed at a cartoon, then you need to see this movie!",10,2,2,15 April 2002
Chinatown," The Best Screenplay Ever
","There is a lot to be said about this movie.  It has a great ensemble of actors, many of them giving their finest performances.  It is well directed. The art/set direction, costume design, and hairstyling are also excellent. But the best thing about this movie is the fantastic writing by the greatest living screenwriter of our time, Robert Towne.  he should have one every critic group award there was, in addition to the awards he did, which included the Oscar, the Golden Globe, and the Edgar Allen poe.  It is a fantastic example of dramatic storytelling, with great characters and wonderful dialogue.  It is no wonder why it is studied in cinema and theater classes around the country.",10,1,5,16 October 2002
Citizen Kane," The Great American Film
","While many fans and scholars debate as to what the Great American Novel is, it should be no question as to what the Great American Film is.  The obvious answer: Citizen Kane.  Many people will ask what is it about Citizen Kane that makes it so great.  Well, it's a combination of several things.  One, it has a fantastic script.  Two, it has the greatest ensemble of actors ever.  And three, it is told by Orson Welles, the greatest storyteller ever, with the exception of maybe Walt Disney.",10,0,2,3 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Disney Hits the Jackpot
","This is definatly one of Disney's best achievments in recent years.  It is also one of the best adventure films that I have seen in a long time, probably since Indiana Jones.  A great cast, combined with a fantastic script, excellent sets, costumes, and special effects, and wonderful directing, and Disney has a movie which is worth viewing over and over again.",10,1,2,10 July 2003
Beauty and the Beast," Disney At It's Best
","Beauty and the Beast is going to go sown as one of Disney's all time best films.  In the recent years, Disney has tended to turn out factory produced animated films.  Beauty and the Beast is a great departure from that mind set.  It is the best film that Disney himself did not get to oversee.  The Platinum Edition DVD is a collector's item.",Null,2,2,26 December 2002
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Well worth the wait
","On my birthday, December 6, in 2001, I remember a news item on the Fox News Channel announcing that Walden Media was also jumping into the fantasy book/movie craze and has just secured the rights for a film version of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. I have been waiting ever since. And I can say it was well worth the wait.The only major complaint I have is that they made too many small changes that I didn't see the point for.Tilda Swinton, despite being miscast, gives an excellent performance as the White Witch and deserves an Oscar nomination. In fact, I would nominate this film for Best Picture.Good job to everyone involved!",10,6,9,10 December 2005
Finding Nemo," Funniest Film This Summer
","I don't think I have laughed this hard during an animated film since 'Shrek.'  Ellen DeGeneras steals the whole movie as the voice of Dorey, a hyper fish suffering from short term memory loss.  This film is filled with many funny scenes especially when Dorey tries to communicate with a whale! I loved it so much, I saw it twice in one day!",10,0,0,1 June 2003
The Others," Should have been Nicole kidman's Oscar nominated role
","For the year 2001, Nicole Kidman recieved an Oscar nomination for her role in the very overrated movie 'Moulin Rouge.'  I thought that her performance in this ghost thriller was by far one of the best performances I have ever seen that year.  It reminded me of Ellen Burstyn's performance in 'The Exorcist.'  In fact, the entire film was greatly overlooked at the Academy Awards.  A must for your Halloween library!",10,9,11,31 October 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Great Horror Film
","Chilling adaption of Washington Irving's classic story.  It is easy to see that Tim Burton used to be an animator.  The art and set direction was outstanding.  The cast is good too, with Miranda Richardson worthy of special note.  But what is nost interesting is the twist the story takes. This is not a faithful adaption of the story.  Those looking for that, would do better with the 1999 TV movie, or the Walt Disney animated version. Instead of Ichobad being a school teacher he is a crimminologist investigating the recent crimes with new scientific instruments that he invented.  The plot gets deeper and deeper as he gets further into the investigation.  And then he finds out that...",Null,0,0,17 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Masterpiece
","The Lord of the Rings triliogy is already going down in cinema history as one of the best movie series ever filmed.  I'm glad I was privilaged enough to see it on the big screen.  Now I have not read the book yet, so I can not make a call as to how faithful it was to the novel.  But, in my opinion, it is one of the best movies of all time.",10,2,2,9 November 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Disney still has the magic
","Well, I was beginning to think that Disney has lost its magic touch, and that they would never create another animated film, worthy of the classics. I was wrong.  Here is a fantastic and incredibly funny film, for all ages. I mean, I went to see it with a bunch of people my age, 17-18, and we thought it was so funny!  Plus it does have a special message, which is typical for a Disney film.  Definatly a must!!!",Null,1,1,2 July 2002
The Exorcist," The Best Horror Film Ever
","I don't think that there will ever be a horror film quite like The Exorcist. No film will ever have that kind of terror and suspense, as well as excellent filmmaking and acting, all rolled into one film.  Amazing thing was that I didn't get disturbed by it like I thought I would.  However I wasn't born in 1973 when it first came out so I was already used to large visual effects movies.  But it was still a good chiller none the less.",10,1,2,4 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better than the first
","It is rare to find a sequal, even in a trilogy,that is as good as the first. Not only is the Two Towers a great sequal, it is better than the first one. Definatly worthy of a few Oscars.  Standouts in the already great cast, include Rhys-Davies, Wood, and Mortenson, all of whom should recieve Oscar nominations.",10,1,1,20 December 2002
The Mist," Did they miss any clichés?
","Did they miss any liberal cliché? Let's see: *the bible thumping freak...religious people are never normal in movies as of late...they are always fanatics and villains *the small town simple folk who are easily confused and dumb *the heroes are of course, artists and teachers and the like *the military is the bad guy *there was the speech about how the government was not funding education enough. Well, I think the only thing they missed was that 'global warming' was somehow not involved. And the dumb country people did not all take up guns while clinging to their bibles. Well, they did take up knives. Is that close enough?",1,5,17,12 May 2008
Moulin Rouge!," Overrated Freakshow!
","This film was so bizare!  The music came from too many different sources, and almost none of it was original.  I don't get what all the praise was.  I got a headache just watching it.  I get the feeling that the director.writer go thte idea after getting high, and then listening to show tunes while looking at a Toulouse Lutrec painting!",1,3,8,26 September 2002
Titanic," A Fad
","When this movie came out everybody went and saw it.  One year later, everybody was making fun of it.  Okay, this was not a bad movie, however, it got way too much attention.  And now there should be regrets.  Because this was so popular for three months, we made it the highest grossing film of all time, something that even Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings couldn't beat, and it bumped such good films like Star Wars and ET off the list.  Plus, 14 Oscar nominations and twelve wins for that!!  The only thing that was fantastic about it, was the visula effects and music.",Null,2,3,30 October 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Just enjoy it!
","You know what?  I'm getting sick of reading comments by people who are tearing this movie apart, saying it twists mythology, it is unimaginative, it is done simply for cold cash, etc..  Well, a lot of these people are the same ones who will go see the same action movie over and over again, despite the lack of plot and talent.  Hollywood just does not make good family movies anymore that are not animated, and I think that is very well done. The child actors are wonderful and have great timing for actors of their age.  Just enjoy it!",10,1,1,11 November 2002
Psycho," The most thrilling story ever
","All right, picture this!  It was the middle of a rainy night, and I was looking for something to watch.  It was about 1am, and i see that Psycho is being shown without commercials.  So, I decide to watch it, having never seen it before.  Needless to say I didn't get any sleep that night.  And the part that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up: (SPOILER!)  When the sherrif tells Lila and Sam, who say that the private investigator disappeared when he went to speak to the mother: 'Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Green Long Cemetary these past several years.  So if the woman you saw in the window was Norman Bates' mother, then who is that woman buried in Green long Cemetary?",Null,0,0,18 October 2002
Jaws," The Ultimate Horror
","In a movie, it is scary to see a monster or menace on the screen.  But it is even more terrifying NOT to see the actual killer.  That is what Speilberg did it.  For the first half of the movie, there is only a minor glimpse of the shark.  It is not untill halfway through the movie that the shark is seen.  (DON'T WORRY THAT ISN'T A SPOILER.)  Not seeing the evil made this movie one of the scariest in film history!",Null,1,2,20 December 2002
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Still the Fairest of Them All
","Before Wicked Witches ruled the sea, or evil lions became king, or pirates kidnaped children, there was an apple.  This opening is similar to the 2001 video trailer.  Snow White is the one that started it all, and is still the fairest one.  The Wicked Queen remains as good a villain, as any Disney villain to date. I recently purchased the Special Collector's DVD, and was amazed at all the stuff it had to offer. The DVD re-release itself won a Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films as Best Classic DVD Re-release.  It also won a Video Premiere Award for Best Bonus Features.  Definatley the best DVD I have.",10,6,7,17 June 2002
Halloween," The one that started it all
","As Snow White defined the animation genre, halloween defined the slasher genre.  Since its debut in 1978, it has been more common to see blood spilled then to see a kiss.  This film should be highly commended for the fact that you don't see much blood.  You don't have to. What makes this film so scary, is the fact that you don't see Michael Myers face, except briefly at the end, and he isn't something supernatural.  Better to see this film before its sequals for the effect is lost, if you see a sequal first.",10,0,0,16 September 2002
Signs," Excellent
","This was one of the most chilling movies I have ever seen.  It totaly keeps you on the edge of your seat.  As crop signs continue to grow in his field, Mel Gibson, a widower, begins to wonder what this means.  Apparently, it is happening all over the world!  Then they notice someone, or something moving in the field...",Null,1,3,18 September 2002
