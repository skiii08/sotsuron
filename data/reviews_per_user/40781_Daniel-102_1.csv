The Blair Witch Project," Oh...... My........ God..........
","Amazing! Genius! Incredible! Astonishing! I have never seen a psychological thriller so intense! This movie is the -best-, the -most intense-, -most crazy-, -most disturbing- movie of the year. You want to be in shock at the end of a movie, go see Blair Witch Project. 3 unsuspecting victims, 2 cameras, 1 movie, no special effects whatsoever and probably the best movie of the year. DO NOT MISS IT. GO SEE IT IN THE THEATRES. You will experience the terror, the paranoia, the fear theses kids are going through. Absolutely unbelievably wild. A definite 100 on a scale of 10.",Null,1,2,21 June 1999
