The Blair Witch Project," Like A Punch In The Jaw
","Man, I'm never gonna forget this movie. I've seen it twice and will probably check it out again before it leaves theaters. I agree with the person who says it's more like a tragedy, not a horror movie. It reminded me of those news stories you hear about people disappearing and then turning up later, dead. I felt like this movie portrayed the hopelessness and fear that people in those situations must feel. There wasn't a moment that I didn't feel like I was there, along with the characters, feeling all their emotions. I thought the improvisational acting was outstanding, and I appreciated not being handed my 'scares' on a platter; instead, the movie asks that you use your own imagination to make the movie work. This is by far the most original and unforgettable film I've seen all year.",10,1,2,24 August 1999
12 Angry Men," George Voskovec Rules!!
","I've seen this movie over a dozen times, it's near the top of my Ten Best List. In my humble opinion, it has the best cast ever assembled, of ANY motion picture, EVER. Anyone seriously interested in acting needs to watch this film and takes notes from (among others): Lee J. Cobb, Ed ('Know what I mean??') Begley, Robert Webber, Martin Balsam, and most of all, George Voskovec, who is truly the master of subtlety and deliniates his character perfectly. I won't echo the praises of my fellow reviewers before me, but I just want to say that the cathartic experience 12 Angry Men offers just can't be beat. Anyone who has seen this masterpiece knows what I'm talking about.",10,0,1,4 May 2000
American Pie," More Like Rhubarb- Blech!
","I laughed TWICE during this movie. TWICE! All the funny parts were in the trailer. Don't get me wrong- I'm totally down for a good teenage sex comedy with gratuitous nudity and assorted hijinks. But this had to be one of the most haphazardly written, badly directed flicks I've seen in a while. The situations made no sense, neither did the characters. The actors (save for Chris Klein) were annoying and embarrassing. The whole flick seemed like it was written on the back of cocktail napkins. And what was with all the sappiness? Give me a break-- and give me ELECTION-- or even UP THE CREEK any day. ** out of ****",5,0,1,28 July 1999
Pitch Black," Screeching Bats With Anchors On Their Heads Will Kill You Every Time!
","**SPOILERS**I was thoroughly impressed with this horror/sci fi hybrid flick, especially in its far-out visual ingenuity (sort of ALIEN 3 meets MAD MAX) and in the thematics of its script (religion, personal redemption, science vs. nature.) I felt like the writer/director tried to put his own personal spin on a story which was admittedly cobbled together from various other sci fi and horror films. For me, PITCH BLACK ended up being totally entertaining on its own terms:1. The aliens were cool as all git out. Not particularly scary, but not someone you'd want to run into in a dark alley. I loved the way they moved and screeched and such.2. The developing relationship between Frye and Riddick was interesting and added an extra dimension to the story. There was attraction, repulsion, mutual respect. Everything.3. Those poor Muslim kids kind of played the role of the old red-shirted guys in the old Star Trek tv series. In short, they were expendable.4. The folks you don't think will survive, do. I appreciated that.All in all, a solid 8/10. Keep your expectations low and you'll feel like you've been transported to another world. I dig movies that are able to pull that off.",8,0,0,24 February 2000
The Usual Suspects," Smoke and Mirrors
","This film is all about the screenwriter proving how clever he is. He creates a pointless story and tries to fool the audience into going along for the ride. There are no real characters, only pawns in an intricate chess game which we are supposed to care about. At the end of the film, I felt manipulated and angry for wasting my time on such an empty movie.",3,6,12,19 November 1998
Detroit Rock City," 'Incredible Hulk' Episodes Were More Entertaining
","I was hoping to like this one. I remember having contests with my brother when we were little, trying to touch our nose with our tongue, like the KISS guy.Needless to say, I could never do it.The film was occasionally entertaining, but also overbearingly crude and at times, moronic. I thought the main characters were jerks, save for Jam (Sam Huntington), who was the most 'human' person in the flick. Huntington does fine work and made me look forward to his next role. But many of the dramatic situations made no sense, KISS was barely in it, and the flashy directorial style was too much to handle. I also got tired of Shaye's one-note work as Jam's crusader mom and the broad, stereotypical characters. But I did appreciate the manic energy and just-wanna-have-fun attitude. 6/10.",Null,2,5,16 August 1999
The Iron Giant," I Am Not A Gun....
","This is one of the most well-written films I've seen, in this or any year. The script is like a perfect seashell- all the pieces fit together and you wouldn't want to change a thing. The underlying themes are perfectly integrated into a subtle story about tolerance and love. I hope THE IRON GIANT is remembered at awards season.",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
X2: X-Men United," Not an Improvement on the Original
","Nightcrawler was admittedly awesome, and there were scattered moments of imagination and wit, but on the whole, the film was at least twenty minutes too long, and the villain plot (featuring Brian Cox as Commander Stryker) was dull and by-the-numbers. My favorite moments were at the school, where new (adolescent) mutants were introduced, and the storyline with Wolverine (still impressively played by Hugh Jackman) trying to figure out his origin via torturous memories. The climax (in an underground dam) stretched on forever, and the film has at least six different endings. X2 showed the mark of too many writers trying to juggle too many characters. I'm still looking forward to part three, though. 6/10.",6,0,0,5 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," A bit overrated but still solid...Possible SPOILER
","Possible SPOILERS included!!Although I enjoyed this film, I feel it wouldn't have worked half as well without the casting of Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. They definitely deserve Oscar nominations. For me, the movie had a few high points, especially a late, emotional scene between Cole and his mother in a car, but I felt the story could have been told better, and that the writer/director kept too much information 'secret' for too long, in order to make the twist ending work. The ghostly visitations were scary at first- especially the initial one by the woman in the robe-- but then became kind of cheap and 'fake' to me. And I felt that any actor could have played the Bruce Willis part, that his character wasn't as well written as it could have been. Still, a solid film 7/10.",7,0,0,30 August 1999
Donnie Darko," Wow.
","Jake Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination for his understated work in this truly original movie. I also thought Holmes Osborne, Mary McDonnell, and Katherine Ross were excellent. The writer/director is obviously a major new talent and I thought Donnie Darko was intriguing and thought-provoking, while others seemed to have found it mystifying and confusing. (Don't listen to them!) The blending of genres into something brand new was exciting and I can't recommend this movie more strongly. Some weak supporting performances (Drew Barrymore especially) don't do much to detract from the film's merits. Along with Our Song and Hedwig & the Angry Inch, this is at the top of my list of the best films of the year. 9/10.",9,0,0,6 November 2001
