Casablanca," Great film!
","The director of this really knew what he was doing from lighting to camera angle. Every shot seemed well planned out before they even started filming. In some movies you can tell when they just threw in another scene here and there but not in this movie. Also the lighting on the each characters face was right on the money and allowed the viewer to really connect with every character. the camera angles allowed you to really enjoy the back ground as much as the characters in them, giving you a whole new spectrum of feeling. The feelings of World War II is also well shown in Casablanca (1942). The they talk about the war and the actors really doing a good job channeling the feelings of war and really there characters. Over all I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!",7,1,4,7 March 2012
Citizen Kane," What a great movie!
","Citizen Kane was a great film it was perfect across the board! To start the use of flash backs to tell the story was a great idea because it gave a new perspective each time some one was telling a piece of his history. as for the people who saw Citizen Kane know it is about Mr. Kane dying and the reporters are trying to figure out what Mr. Kane final words are. the lighting used in this movie was dark giving his life shadows which make it him mysterious.the further the interviewers get to know Kane's life the editing becomes slower because you are reaching the older Mr. Kane. Over all i thought it was a great movie because the movie conveyed every thing it wanted, love, anger, and jealousy,",8,0,1,11 April 2012
The Exorcist," Classic horror film
","this movie is what made horror films what it is today the special effect though there was not a lot, they used the limited amount effectively. the spitting of the green vomit made disgust and creepiness ever evident also the spinning of her head. the helplessness of the family also give the audience the sense of helplessness, that you wish you could change it but there was nothing anyone could do. when they had the chair block the door and the dresser sliding toward the mom really made the movie what it was, though the make up made it all seem real. the way her face got puffier and had like a rock look to it made the cute little girl into a monster. over all I like this movie it is creepy and no matter how many times I watch it I still jump at certain parts, and that is what a horror movie should do.",8,1,2,30 April 2012
Annie Hall," funny movie
","This movie made me laugh all the way through! Woody Allen and Diane Keaton made this movie so much like a real relationship between the of them it was just enjoyable. The editing and effects also had a lot to do with it. In the beginning when he is in the class room and his teacher ask what are you going to be when you grow up? then there is a zoom in shot of certain kids and say what they grew up to be like car salesman and addict. the use of subtitles at the part when they are talking but the subtitles say what they are thinking, is just amazing because everyone knows when you are talking sometimes you are just thinking a different thing. Also when Annie does not want to have sex and she said that she doesn't feel into it then a ghost version of her sit on the chair. these moments are the things that kept the audience so connected to this movie and it really shows a true side to relationships.",9,0,0,30 April 2012
The Graduate," such a funny movie!
","this movie is just a laugh out loud movie! they did such a great job making even the uncomfortable scenes funny for example when Ben is trying to get a room at the hotel to sleep with Mrs. Robinson! also the editing of the film was excellent no edit was edit seem by mistake. some films you watch it and you see a edit and all you can think is that does not look right, well you can't say that about this movie! another thing is the music in the movie is awesome, it could be because Simon & Garfunkal did it but, the way they inti-graded it into the movie was amazing. the repetitiveness of certain songs and the guitar slowing down as the car runs out of fuel. these things just help make this movie what is today. Overall this is one of my favorite movies! I really like the end when he gets the and he looks at her then when he turns away she looks at him. giving the impression he achieved his goal in getting the girl now what?",9,2,3,18 April 2012
Singin' in the Rain," not my favorite movie
","Though i really respect this movie for its up beat tunes and use of sets, it was not my favorite movie. To start out i'm not a huge fan of musicals and this movie had no point really. Yes it was suppose to be when films with sound just came out and they are trying to make a movie better then The Jazz Singer. they were trying to hard to make it a hit. regarding the plot they made it really corny though i know more recent musicals try to take more youth wide problems for people to relate. though they still never interest me. A couple of things I thought they did well with the shooting and lighting. they used the lighting to interact with the characters making it very visual. over all again I did not enjoy the movie as a whole but certain aspects were really great!",7,0,1,18 April 2012
Psycho," Classic Hitchcock!
","this movie is what Hitchcock was all about the over emotional characters to create tension, using the camera as another character interacting with the movie, has characters break clich√©'e, and using suspense as information. these things are just some of the things that he really showed within this movie. in regards to the lighting of the movie is quite stunning, when you see the outside of the house he makes look very bright making it look welcoming. though when any character entered the house, it is very dark and mysterious. the contrast he used in the movie were quite interesting. for example when the lady is being killed in the shower the contrast of the blood on the white tile and white tub gives the flow of blood definition. another interesting thing about that scene is you never see the knife make contact with the lady. it always has a jump cut to a blood splatter or it running down the drain. over all i think this is one of his best movies, the way he keeps you on the edge of your seat makes a movie for me and a added bonus is when a movie can continue to do it no matter how many times you see it!",8,0,0,18 April 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Great movie!!!
","First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie is so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted. the filming of this movie was great every shot seemed planned and you would think every film would be planned them but sometimes movies have little goofs. This movie though showed everything shot was planned, the composition and lighting seemed to be perfect. over all this is great movie everyone should appreciate the art of the film making.",9,1,2,5 May 2012
