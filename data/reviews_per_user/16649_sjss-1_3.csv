Mission: Impossible III," Similar to the others, but leaves you wanting more
","When I rented M.I.3 on demand I was expecting a movie that compares with the first two, I received just that. From Ethan and his crew to the villains and the twist at the end. The only difference was that the movie didn't fool anyone. You can guess the whole movie an hour into it. Other than this the movie was enjoyable. Tom Cruise doesn't disappoint and Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a wonderful villain. You know the kind you hate from start to finish. The ending does leave you wanting more, but the possibility for another sequel was mentioned. This is definitely a great addition to the series. I recommend this movie to any Mission Impossible fan or anyone looking for a good time. 7 stars out of ten.",7,0,0,2 January 2007
Hot Fuzz," Wright & Pegg, they did it again!!!!
","When I first saw the trailer for Hot Fuzz I didn't think they could make a movie that would even remotely compare to Shaun of the Dead. I was right, this was without a doubt better. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up again to show what a real cop movie should be like, with some spoofs along the way.I will say that I'm not real into the British Satire, but the way these movies are written and acted out make me appreciate their comedic ways. From Simon Pegg's facial expressions to Nick Frost's off the wall generalizations, this group of actor nail just about every scene they're in.You will love the references to American made action movies such as Point Break and Bad Boys 2. As well as laugh at the cheesy dialog that is used to make fun of action stars like Arnold and Keanu Reeves.Without a doubt one of the best comedies I have ever scene and I only hope this team of British comedians keep the movies coming!!! 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!",10,1,3,14 May 2007
300," Flawless!
",I went into this movie with high expectations and the movie literally blew them away. I have never been in a movie theatre when people actually clapped at the end. Granted it was an IMAX theatre so the movie looked amazing. The casting for this film was exceptional from the King Leonidas to the role of Xerxes. This may very well be the best film I have ever seen and could be number one on the 250 list very soon. I hope this movie is recognized for its sheer brilliance and Zack Snyder is seen as the director he really is. He did not disappoint us with Dawn of the Dead and this movie is unlike anything I have ever seen.Vote- 9 out of 10,10,1,5,14 March 2007
