Casablanca," The Golden Standard
","I urge everyone to watch Casablanca and preferably to own a copy of the DVD....The movie truly deserves to be considered one of the great classics and possibly the greatest American film ever made, along with the great acting performances you have an amazing script and some of the most memorable lines in movie history.Every scene in the movie is fantastic especially a scene that involves the German and the french national anthem at Rick's(Bogart) cafe. The theme song like the movie is a classic, the love story at the heart of the movie is somewhat tragic and beautiful in its own way... and 'As time goes by'...this movie will remain a classic... so Go see it, just go see it!!!",10,0,1,17 November 2004
