Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Menace is astounding
","The Phantom Menace was an outstanding movie that falls right in line with the original three.  The music was tremendous (even better than the other three) and the storyline was much thicker than some have given it credit for.  The effects were breathtaking.  The fight scenes were incredible. The movie, as a whole, just simply ROCKED!********** (10 stars, baby!)",Null,0,0,27 May 1999
