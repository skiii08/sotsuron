Sucker Punch," Give this film a chance!
","I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this gem of a film. I went in to the cinema not expecting much, because of all the bad reviews it received, but came out pleased and surprised and baffled at the same time as to why it was slashed by the critics. The most common arguments by the critics was that it lacked a story line,good dialogue &was demeaning to women. This is completely and utterly wrong. Anyone with half a brain would pick up the storyline although it could be interpreted differently, the dialogue was appropriate to the film genre,(u don't expect them to speak in a 17th century Shakespearan style)& I thought it was empowering to women.Yes the girls were in tight, cleavage baring attire most of the time but the film sent out a message of 'Never give in' & 'Fight for your rights and your freedom'. It is fun, action-filled, colourful, underrated and though provoking.",8,4,7,12 April 2011
