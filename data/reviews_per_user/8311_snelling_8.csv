Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Roger, shut the hell up!
","I had such high hopes in 1988 when I first heard the details about this movie being made. I read every article about it, anticipating its opening. Add Robert Zemeckis to the mix and I wanted to see it as bad as 'Back to the Future II' (another disappointment, by the way) and the release was finally here and I went on opening day. Sure, the combined animation and live action was genius, but the story itself needed a complete re-write, for starters. Bob Hoskins was totally miscast as the drunken detective. The opening cartoon was funny but that just started all the screaming from Roger to follow. When the title character is this pathetic and loud and annoying, it's not a fun experience. I tried it again twenty years after its premier and I still didn't like it much, if at all. Watch it with the sound off Eddie! Pl-leeeeze!",3,1,1,26 June 2020
Meet the Parents," There's Something About Mary Part II
","Beware! In order to critique this film I may have to reveal some key plot points!! Turn back if you don't want me to spoil it for you!!! OK, you were warned... I had high hopes for this movie. The trailer looked quite fresh and amusing. The first act started out cute and light, establishing the characters quite nicely. Ben Stiller (Greg) plays basically the same mensch he played in 'Mary,' a likable schlub who only wants to marry his sweet, loving girlfriend and live happily ever after. But first he has to 'Meet the Parents.' Actually he has to meet her father, Jack, played by Robert DeNiro. Here he's basically playing the same jerk he played in 'This Boy's Life,' but now it's for laughs, I suppose. Me? I was squirming in my seat whenever Jack was on screen. He would make any possible suitor nervous. But how can you root for Greg, who is the main central character, when the script stacks the deck so clearly against him from the outset?From the moment he arrives with his soon-to-be-fianc√©e at her parents' house, every single thing goes wrong. He says the wrong thing at every instance. He inadvertently lies because he is so nervous. Things get broken (and of course they are irreplaceable) and the cat goes to the bathroom on the debris. The cat! This cat named Mr. Jinx should have had second billing right under DeNiro's name. Jack is so in love with this cat, he immediately dislikes Greg when it is revealed he is more of a 'dog person.' And who tells Jack that Greg hates cats? His girlfriend Pamela! Oops, but what are you gonna do? Of course, Mr. Jinks gets lost. But how can we believe that Greg would be so naive as to think he could pass off a lookalike cat to Jack, its owner of fifteen years? Especially when the cat knows a myriad of tricks that no other cat could possibly know? Suddenly Greg is an idiot! According to the plot, Jack can read people. This means he can spot a liar a mile away. How can a man like Jack be so suspicious of everyone around him and yet not know his own son sneaks out at night, presumably to buy pot? This wasn't even played for laughs. It's simply an inconsistency in the plot. Later a bong is found in Jack's son's coat pocket. But since Greg was wearing the coat at the time, Jack thinks it's Greg's. Ha ha, it never stops. There are so many marijuana references, it's no wonder this movie was directed by a guy named Jay Roach. Seemingly insignificant plot developments are scattered throughout the dialogue to come back and bite Greg on the butt later on in the story. More truths are revealed between Greg and Pamela that only come out when Greg is on the spot with her dad. For instance, Greg buys a special gift for Jack upon his first introduction to him. It is believed that Pamela helped him select this gift (It's a rare flower that will bloom in six months.) on the condition that Jack used to be a florist. After Greg embarrasses himself thinking that Jack would loooove this little reference to his past profession, it's revealed he was never a florist at all. But who reveals this? Pamela! Why would she set him up for a fall like that? Some girlfriend! The writers of this thing even give Greg a silly last name to add insult to injury. You'd think with a last name like Focker, that every kid Greg ever knew growing up would have mocked him so mercilessly, he would have changed it or gotten used to it by now. By the end of this movie I was p***ed off because I felt cheated. I got more agitated by everything that went wrong for poor Greg. I just wanted him to get back at Jack somehow; yell at him or something. But, no. What does this script make him do? He takes his anger out on a dopey flight attendant whose only crime was making him wait until his row was called before he boarded his plane the hell out of there. Some comeuppance.And the ending is from out of nowhere. Booooo! Liked the cat, though, and I'm not a 'cat person.' Take that, Jack.",5,0,0,5 October 2000
Snatch," Homage or Rip-Off, Take Your Pick
","When is a movie an homage and when is it a derivative rip-off? I couldn't stop thinking about that question last week while watching 'Snatch.' It seems to be two cups of 'Pulp Fiction' with half a cup of 'Fight Club' mixed in a blender (at high speed!) with a sprinkling of Worcestershire sauce, making some of the British accents hard to digest, but the result is tasty. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but would I have liked it even more if I hadn't seen those two other films? Probably. Even having seen them I couldn't help making mental comparisons at most key points. The only real 'Fight Club' similarity is Brad Pitt as a rebel loner covered with carnage while a cigarette dangles from the side of his mouth. He plays a tough street boxer who can drop a guy twice his size with one punch. His incomprehensible jargon has to be heard to be believed. The comparisons to 'Pulp Fiction' are many and it is fun to spot them. So I will let you see what you can find as you watch it for yourself.The story itself is slight, but with all the characters this story juggles it would be harder to follow if there were more plot to deal with. We have a dozen gangsters and a settlement of pikers (squatters, or gypsies, to us Americans) who cross paths over a stolen 86-karat diamond. The bulk of the story is really inconsequential. It is mainly a frame on which to hang the run-ins of a gaggle of bumbling crooks who spout pearls of street wisdom off the cuff whenever they're not killing each other. The film is written and directed by Madonna's new husband, Guy Ritchie, and there is a reference to her music in one line. This is a funny movie that will need attention paid to the characters and the accents. For some it may not be worth all that work. Personally, I will see it again.",Null,0,1,16 January 2001
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," How Dare They Make Me Cry at This Schmaltz?
","Yes, it's a carbon copy of the original. But some people watch the original over and over again anyway. So they might as well make another adventure in the exact same vein. So every beat they hit is the exact same. Vacation time at Christmas. Kevin is left by himself. He is scared, sure, but soon accepts his fate and enjoys everything to the fullest. The two crooks threaten the kid, but then he proves how stupid the bad guys are by setting intricate traps for them, and they fall into each one. Harry and Marvin go to jail. Mom reunites with her son. The old weirdo that befriended Kevin earlier smiles at the end.Boom boom boom. Every box checked. I don't really care for either movie but I see them all the time on TV and it's hard to resist such brain candy. Damn thing still chokes me up but I don't understand why. Sappy music. Christmas themes. Culkin's acting. It should add up to nothing. Bah, humbug. Merry Christmas. All that malarkey.",4,0,3,30 October 2017
A Clockwork Orange," Still Frightens After 30 Years
","I could write paragraphs about this old favorite. I am 35 and I first saw this about fifteen years ago on cable. What prompted me to see it at all was reading the parody in Mad Magazine called 'A Crockwork Lemon.' I had to see what they were making fun of.   A friend had also been assigned to read the novel by Anthony Burgess for English class. It was this friend who introduced me to Nadsac (sic). This is the 'slanguage' used throughout the story, and was created by the author to punctuate the disturbing ideas we see. This language is supposed to be Russian-based with some other Euro-touches thrown on top. It might be handy to pick up a copy of the paperback if you are watching this for the first time on tape or DVD. Most copies have a glossary in the back so you can look up definitions while the movie is paused.   I've found that most women hate this film. It is too violent and misogynistic for the casual unsuspecting viewer, male or female. But once you start watching it, I recommend seeing it through until the end. The first half hour might be tough to stomach, but hang in there. It turns around quickly (the story, not your stomach).  You can read other comments posted here for the films' plot points. I am merely trying to pique your interest. Please give it a try if you've heard about 'A Clockwork Orange' but never seen it. Rent it for Halloween night, because it's also a bone-chilling experience. More in its prophecy than anything else.  Considering the dearth of horror flicks made since this 1971, this one still frightens more than any Hollywood slasher film because of its possibility to be one mankind's future scenarios. But how far into the future, that's up to the viewer.",9,0,0,6 October 2000
Titanic," Fun escapist fare; Nothing more
","If you like to turn off your brain for three hours, watch this. I am not saying this in a negative way because sometimes you just need a sappy movie to take to bed. Not everything has to be Shakespeare to be enjoyable. So get some chocolate ice cream and a glass of red wine and don't think for an evening. Trust me, it will be fun.",10,2,4,11 December 2017

Back to the Future Part II," Stupid plot altogether
","So to start: What was Doc's hurry to bring Marty to 2015? They could've taken months to devise a real plan, WITHOUT BRINGING JENNIFER. They had a time machine for god's sake. Second: why did they go all the way back to 1955 to retrieve the almanac from Biff. Just go back to 2015 an hour before Marty bought the almanac and either stop the purchase or buy it and burn it then. So you say, 'It's a different, altered 2015 by then, so they can't.' If it's THAT different then Biff never could take the almanac back to give it to younger Biff in 1955, so that alternate timeline could not exist. And Doc makes such a big deal about someone interacting with their past/future selves. Well, Biff gave himself (in 1955) the almanac and explained what it would mean to younger-self Biff. Nothing bad happened with that scenario. Or go back to 1955 a day earlier than they did, slash Biff's tires or otherwise hinder the meeting with his older self. They have a TIME MACHINE! If one plan fails, go back and try again. Plus, old 2015 Biff immediately works the time machine perfectly to go to 1955 and give his young self the almanac. Then, he brings it back! Why? Let Doc and Marty be trapped and try to figure something out. Maybe they could build another time machine in the dystopian 1985 but they would need money and probably new jobs and it would take years. And how did Biff get back to the same 2015 since he altered all future events back in 1955? This sequel script has more holes than a Swiss cheese. Turn off your brain and enjoy this complete mess. I only gave it five stars because I love ripping it apart.",5,1,1,1 April 2019
