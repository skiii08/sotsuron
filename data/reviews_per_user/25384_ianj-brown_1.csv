Iron Man 3," really great action and comedy
","Iron man/ Tony Stark is one of my favorite marvel characters after Hawkeye. In the previous movies I feel like it is just his tech doing all the work and fighting for him (which Captain America pointed out in the Avengers). However in this movie the director takes Tony Stark to a whole new level. In this movie Iron man starts to use fighting techniques instead of just blasting people sky high (but he does still blast people around). A lot of people said bad things about this movie and I disagree. Even though I thought this movie was great i did have a problem with The Mandarin. Seriously, I feel like the director just got lazy with The Mandarin. Maybe I wouldn't have such a problem with it if the previews didn't at like The Mandarin was such a big deal. At the end of the movie Tony Stark blows up his Iron Man suits and I would have been okay with it, but in 2015 they're coming out with another Avengers. I wonder how the director is going to pull that off.",8,1,3,4 January 2014
