Come and See," The 9th greatest film of all time.
","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet Army and experience the horrors of World War II. There's a popular story that's told regarding this film. It goes as follows: at a premier, there was an elderly German woman seated near the back of the audience who, half way through the screening, stood up and boldly declared: 'I was a Wehrmacht officer during the invasion of the Soviet Union, and I can declare that everything you see in this film is completely true!'. In studying war films, realism is a factor that features heavily in dictating the acclaim a film is given, and to what extent it can be a true success of the genre. Idi I Smorti's raw, sombre, horrifying, damaging and empirically sound content elevate it to divine upper reaches amidst the 'war film' niche to any historian or intellectual immediately. About a third of the way through the film Klimov, a Stanlingrad survivor, juxtaposes the historical face of dismay that the newly deafened young protagonist conjures, something that could speak louder than the script of any American take at the unparalleled devastation war brings, with a solemn, indifferent and colourful stalk (crane-like bird) that followers him through the deadpan lowland setting. It's a piece of camera work that brought me trauma and introspection. Stylistically, Idi I Smorti is superior to its western peers of the era, even though it is shot in a grainy aspect ratio, this only intensifies what Klimov is trying to accomplish with his work. In terms of substance, the way Klimov uses two strangers: a teenage boy and a teenage girl, their families ravaged and piled naked behind their home, cling together under mosses and ferns in a marshland forest, whilst the thick drones of German aircraft fly noir overhead, is something that hits especially hard to all that witness it. Following the boy's journey, through constant loss, fugue, blood, wrath and decadence is perfectly formed and perfectly balanced, all the way up to the final scene, where he shoots a series of portraits of Hitler as a series of montages display a rewind in his advance, starting with the burning villages of the boy's homeland and distancing further and further from such local horrors. But after what he occur has seen across rural Belarus, he cannot bring himself to shoot the portrait of the infant Hitler on his mother's lap. We feel at one with the character at this moment and his experiences of war are hammered home harder than any moment in any film that has ever produced. Idi I Smorti is real, undisturbed, pure film making that the likes of 'The Godfather' and 'Citizen Kane' can't match.",10,7,11,11 February 2014
Oldboy," The 2nd greatest film of all time.
","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, a man is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Number 2 sees a controversial choice: a film that has in fact been passionately set on fire with denouncement by a number of critics. Nonetheless, what I find in Oldboy is comfort of a strange kind. What Park Chan-wook creates in his twisted and surreal world is an untouchable empathetic consistency. The protagonist, named Oh Dae-su (Min Sik-choi), is quite frankly the most three dimensional, intriguing, inspiring and hard-hitting character ever to grace the screen. His conduct is real yet fantastic, defiant yet compassionate. Aside from Oh Dae-su's remarkable and unmatchable persona, sweetly showcased by his narration of the taxonomy of rock bream whilst indifferently wearing a stolen pair of women's sunglasses, or as he walks away, undisturbed by the suicide-by-falling of a man he has just told his story to, and what this brings to not just the film as a whole but its ability to connect with a certain breed of audience, the directing is arguably flawless. If one only has five minutes to spare, I recommend taking what could just be the most impressive scene of stature and presence in the history of cinema: the corridor fight scene, shot over four days (it is a continuous one take with only correction of punches comprising the totality of the computer editing intervention), where we are shown a trademark of the calibre of filmmaking that Oldboy contains. I've never seen anything like it. I watch it again and again, dumbstruck to its perfection, as composer Jo Yeong-wook's magnificent and moving score sombrely serenades over the visuals. Oldboy touches on some controversial and taboo subjects which deter the average viewer, but to the trained eye what Park has done with them is to create a piece of cinema that rip-roaringly strips back the layers of the heart to ultimate bareness, whilst still including some of the best action shots in any film to date. Oh Dae-su's tormented soul, battered and bruised both physically and mentally throughout, compliments the captured transition of his mental state into a 'monster' as well as the finest white wine with fish. Lee Woo-jin's distress, his patience and craftsmanship of a bizarrely pleasurable witty kind of sociopathic torture is portrayed with uncompromising genius: studying the sheer power of the final scenes in his penthouse and his ultimate relinquish into decline is taxing and infesting. Many cast Oldboy aside as a publicity stunt, and fail to see past the octopus. What I'm trying to say, in the end, is that Oldboy earns its place as the second greatest film ever made because of how is depicts the depth that human emotion can delve to.",10,4,11,11 February 2014
The Great Dictator," The 10th greatest film of all time.
","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? Fictional dictator Adenoid Hynkel tries to expand his empire while a poor Jewish barber tries to avoid persecution from Hynkel's regime. We start the top 10 countdown with one of the eldest of the collection of all-time greats, a later day work of a director we all know and love more often than not for his charismatic and vaudeville performances on the screen rather than his blueprinting off it. Along with all great directors throughout history, Chaplin's greatest work is disputed to a short fallen conclusion. Notable for his consistent recurrence of the themes of strife of the downtrodden and 'good triumphs over evil' fables, The Great Dictator is, at face value, no exception. But the film's rich tapestry holds so much more to it than that, elevating it to a stance of assuming easily the role of not only Chaplin's greatest but one of history's greatest. One has to admire the bravery of Chaplin to produce such a touching, topical and quite frankly worldly historic piece of propaganda entertainment in 1940 for his loyal subjects: the distressed, the downtrodden and fed up allied population. It's piece of work that, as it rumbles into life, seems to be a misfit and muddled fledgling of a picture, soon turns into the greatest comedy ever made. Yet, astonishingly, after it assumes this role, it proves ever more versatile to the dumbfounded and subdued audience, showing a climactic bout of emotional power and vigour in the form of Chaplin's Dictator's famous dictatorial speech. The skill to represent both the weak and the powerful with his interchangeable portrayal of two characters, who take turns in being the mature and immature of the pair, ending on the prior mentioned sublime and bittersweet monologue of conflicting internal ideals of the satirised Hitler as a largely solo effort, just goes to show the untouchable echelons of what performance and direction working in harmony in the right place at the right time can be like. The Great Dictator is often said to be a weaker film amongst its competitors of the 1940s and 1930s, but cometh the hour of darkness: cometh the document of courage and faith with both humanist and more serious intent.",10,2,3,11 February 2014
Apocalypse Now," The 11th greatest film of all time.
","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a covert and dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel who has set himself up as a god among a local tribe. Perhaps the problem that people have with Apocalypse Now is that they take it as a serious war film. I can't think of a genuinely serious American war film that could be considered a masterpiece, yet Coppola's proof that his top-running 1972 contender for the 'perfect movie' consensus could be made more perfect in every aspect: Apocalypse Now, is undeniably a masterpiece. So as logic stands, we must rethink what Apocalypse Now is generally assumed to be. Despite being one of the most well known and iconic films on the list, such a bright spotlight does not detract from its majesty. The opening scene to any film is always an indication of the shape of things to come, and Apocalypse Now benefits from one of the most stark, minimalistic sequences of intense pulchritude ever to be directed. What follows is both startling and balming. With a velvety narrative for company that relaxes for the most part yet still reminds us from time to time that what its discussing has the potential to be very upsetting, we are taken through a journey of immense significance to the world of cinema. It might not be a proper, thoroughbred war that the journey brings you through, but it is certainly one of startlingly beautiful decadence, torment and discovery. Just watch Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen) development and how he comes to terms with the task at hand as the jungle setting, filmed in such an aspect ratio to bring out its full potential of mystery and danger, rolls by in the background, and inhale and exhale. Of course, Apocalypse Now isn't just pretty to look at. It contains some of the most classic scenes of all time, above all the popular culture's all-time favourite of the strikingly bold attack on the Viet-Cong outpost in a fleet of helicopters beaming Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries'. Although this scene is as intense and vivid as cinema can reach, a scene of pure sensation, dazzling audiences with light and noise, laying bare the stark horror - and unimaginable thrill - of combat, it's the arrival at Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) camp that is the most curved apex of Hollywood's camera-work ever to be pieced together, an audio-visual descent through the threshold of necessary insanity and surrealism with the single plucks of a sentinel double bass to reinforce it. It's a simply staggering piece of American filmmaking. Apocalypse Now isn't so much an important work, a turning point or a revelation about how to make films like the next feature on the list, but it's something that exceeds all prejudices in purely showcasing the depth, finesse and density of simply pleasurable art that celluloid organic matter has been able to create.",10,1,2,11 February 2014
Rear Window," The 14th greatest film of all time.
","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? A wheelchair bound photographer spies on his neighbours from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder. The best and most famously triumphant pieces of America's cinema industry often make it into a legendary category: an elite club of perhaps thirty or so of the best of gangster, prison, thriller and western films ever to come from the continent. Foremost, one of the most worthy of the all the members is the immaculate, clever, savvy and unstoppable Rear Window. Hitchcock's arguable masterpiece shows how much diversity and resilience the mind can draw from one theme, three principle characters and one setting alone. Of course, Hitchcock is the renowned guru of such an exploit in cinematography, but Rear Window exceeds any of its peers in its presence, power, substance and style. The film moves as a fluid, lucid object in its entirety, to an unfashionably tense end executed end without violence, gore, or any other modern day routine condiments. But above all, Rear Window strives towards its place as a mythical, voyeuristic and popular icon because it's made in a way that does not only show great filmmaking, but exquisite film watching. Hitchcock disregards the restraints of: 'if you can see the enemy, the enemy can see you' and allows to audience to have a vantage point that's not completely transparent, locking them in sync with the experiences of the characters. Rear Window successfully becomes a film that isn't looking to be praised for profound preaching or artistic merit, but resides happily, proudly, as one that aims to immerse and to play with the nerve and patience of the audience. And despite everything, the film is amicable. It's not gruelling or bleak, the dialogues are warm and inviting, it's laced with an established and assured romance with the lead female role (whom Hitchcock usually chooses to use as a tool of misfortune) and the climactic scenes of action are only as raucous as they need to be to keep the audience gripped. With the stylistic heights of the film coming from every angle, it doesn't need to be. Bleakness is recognised in Rear Window as a utensil that must be used appropriately and in moderation, and instead we are welcomed with a sweet, thickly textured, exhilarating thriller for the ages. It's difficult to write extensively about Rear Window without going into detail regarding particular scenes and their power or impact. The final confrontation scene is, by personal and popular vote, the highlight of Rear Window, one of the greatest successes of cinema history, with Hitchcock picking minimalistic technique:, dark pastel filters and a deadpan soundtrack of both speech and music to create the holy grail of mid-century thriller moments. Yet the real triumph of Rear Window is its perfect balance, maintained with utmost consistency, rid of inconvenient ideals and leaving optimal conditions for the masterpiece of voyeurism to play itself out for 110 devilishly good minutes.",10,0,2,11 February 2014
