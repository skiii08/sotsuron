The Mask," A brilliant, wild ride
","This is one of the most exuberant, wild comedies ever, with Jim Carrey turning in one of the most absolute comic performances ever seen on screen. Sure, there's the make-up to help him along, but it's all nothing without his incredible body language (yeah, I know he doesn't really hop around like that) and his Carrey-esquire ability to push each gesture to the limit without violating the viewer's confidence in Carrey's underlying intelligence. Cameron Diaz's entrance must be one of the most amazing film debuts in history and, being a terrific actress anyway, she sustains the impact throughout. The supporting cast is great,especially Peter Greene in the critical role of Dorian, Nancy Fish as Carrey's landlady, and Richard Jeni as Stanley's buddy. What really elevates this film beyond simply being a great star-vehicle is - well, actually, a few things. The sets are suggestive of 'Edge City' - the name of the city in the movie - but nothing like the wasteland of Robocop or the Gothic urban-scapes of Batman. Sometimes, understatement works better - the movie has a comic book element to it, of course, but the sets themselves, while hinting at a sinister zeitgeist, don't fall into comic book sensibility. But the element that raises this to a 10, for me, is that it's simply a very well-told story with a great script. It's filmed tight, things make sense emotionally, the pacing is varied and compelling, and one cares about Stanley (Carrey) and Tina (Diaz) from the beginning of the movie. I am surprised at the rating this film receives from IMDb'ers - I would have thought it'd be higher. But maybe it's because recent first-time viewers are used to Carrey and Cameron, and even the tone of the movie itself. I saw it when it came out with one of my kids, and have watched it numerous times thereafter with them - and by myself as well. Catching 10 minutes of it on TV is still a treat some nights. It hit me like a thunderbolt when I first saw it and I still love it. If there's anyone out there who hasn't seen it, what are you waiting for?",10,1,1,21 April 2005
Citizen Kane," Give Welles due credit as actor
","Enough has been said in the comments about the use of lighting, directorial and editing techniques, etc. I love this movie and each time watch it enthralled. The plot moves along brilliantly, and while many of the techniques have been applied by countless filmmakers since, there's still something about seeing the trailblazer in all its glory - especially as it still holds up. But I just want to give Welles due credit for his acting. I think part of the absolute magic and impact of this film is Welles' ability to transmit a sense of someone larger than life in every way. When he's caught up in the chase of a great story - or the creation of it - his intelligence and vision and sheer conniving brilliance emanate from his every gesture and word. He is expansive and dynamic, he was incredibly handsome, and he seemed to burst from the screen when playing the young Kane. The figure of Welles himself creates a powerful internal tension within the film because he lights up an otherwise dark, morose palette. In many ways, his character has nothing to do with Hearst - Welles himself was a force of nature, and in some ways Citizen Kane is a prophetic vision of his own fate in Hollywood. Welles was a great actor, as was his co-star, Joseph Cotton, one of the great understated actors of the screen. Cotton is a perfect foil for Welles - as he is in that other absolute masterpiece (not directed by Orson), 'The Third Man' - because he hints at his own uneasy depths which are always being stirred up by Welles, whether as Kane or Harry Lime. I also see the end of Apocalypse Now, with Brando's dark, isolated, ruminating semi-madman as an homage of sorts to Welles alone in Kane's castle at the end of Citizen Kane. The two greatest burn-out male geniuses of the American silver screen, both gorgeous in their time and both expanding into bloated ruins, their 'potential' often seen as unrealized - but both perhaps having transcended even those expectations of themselves.",10,8,12,1 February 2005
Gone with the Wind," Can't get past the racism
","Okay, I know it's supposed to be one of the all time epic movie masterpieces, but is it really that good? I'll give the characters a two-dimensionality - barely - but they all play through to type. You can argue it doesn't matter with this movie, that film doesn't have the same responsibility as a novel to explore the nuances of its characters' emotions. But if a film is going to make a claim to be one of the greatest all time, it should show some greater development than Scarlett turning into a spunky survivor. Ultimately, I know the movie is beautifully done with many wonderful scenes, but it's an exercise in sentimental glorification of a world that was far more brutal, ugly, and hollow than the film even hints at. I don't expect a cinematic monograph on the evils of plantation society from a 1939 Hollywood epic, but I also don't have to swallow its assumptions wholesale. The gentility moaning away on their soulless spirituals recalls the 'pastoral scene of the gallant south' that Billie Holiday sang of in her anti-lynching song, 'Strange Fruit'. The irony is that the lynchings didn't simply date from the Civil War era in which the film takes place, but from the very year and decade in which the film was made and released. So sorry, I give it a 6 for all it does so well, but thematically it has aged very poorly.",6,7,19,29 January 2005
JFK," Great thriller and political commentary
","Above all, this is a great thriller, so you can always watch it from that perspective and enjoy it. And the superb cast - especially Lemon, Bacon, and Sutherland (Donald, not the CTU scion - if Jack Bauer had been around in 1963, maybe history would have been different) - keep the intensity level going. As for the politics, I think there's a lot to recommend it, especially if one applies the Discomfort Litmus Test, i.e., just note how many howls of outrage and dismissive splutterings were aimed at Stone and the movie. It touched a chord. 'JFK' has been unfairly painted as a conspiracy nut's fantasy. But Stone was making a movie, not a documentary - although heaven knows there's enough material out there in real life to make Stone's movie seem pallid. I believe that Stone's purpose was to show how smoothly and competently an assassination of the president could be carried out by the powers that be, how they could simply view it as a necessary step in advancing their own interests, and how expendable any individual is in the scheme of power politics. Stone certainly used a lot of material that is fairly well vouched for, and if he fictionalized the meetings at the upper levels of government, he was really saying, 'This is how it could have happened. It may not have been the same people as I'm showing, but if not them, then others. If you look at the evidence, it could have been something like this.' Viewed through that lens, 'JFK' is a provocative thriller that should be seen in a double feature with 'The Parallax View', which also dissects the mechanics of conspiracy and presents it as 'business as usual' for those who deal in that currency.",9,2,13,11 April 2005
