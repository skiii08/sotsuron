Walk the Line," not bad doesn't make it good...
","not having read the other comments i really only wanted to comment on the blandness of this movie. while the singing was refreshing, performances nuanced (I think Witherspoon deserves some recognition, but definitely NOT a little gold statue) and over all feel of the movie good, it was just that, a 'feel-good' movie. yet within this love-in lies a pretty corrupt moral- Jonny Cash, country legend, peoples hero, without much care for the people he brings into this world. a little saddening really. while you cant expect someone who is hanging out with Elvis (btw classic line about the chilli fries, tee he-he) to be an angel, you cant paint him as some misunderstood character either. having gone off the point, all i really want to say is just because its the first take on a recently historical character to be released by 'the Hollywood machine' in a while doesn't make it the best thing since ipod. or is it sliced bread.a movie fan",5,0,4,7 March 2006
Jarhead," just a comment
","It tickled me something to see the rating awarded to this US-rated R film in France, home of non-freedom fries.Suitable for all, including under 5-s. is that IQ? collective brain cells. who knows? Perhaps a comment on the appropriacy of going to war from the governing board en paysane- not an extreme (i.e. R) but a childish act (i.e. U).Still,a beautiful film. Visually creaking under its own weight...'the philosophers have only interpreted the world, the point is to change it'PS Is Sam Mendes still pursuing that crusaders thing? Id be intrigued to find out if anyone had any more information on the subject. I cant help but think there must be something under his sleeve given the relatively slow work rate.",9,0,1,19 May 2006
