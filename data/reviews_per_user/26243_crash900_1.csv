Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," EXCELLENT!!!
","I think that this movie continues the great traditions of the original Star Wars movies.  It is hard to get used to not seeing the original characters or ships, but overall I believe this movie is an equal to its legend.  A must see for any fan.",10,0,0,22 May 1999
