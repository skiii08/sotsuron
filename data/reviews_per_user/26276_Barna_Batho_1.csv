Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the most underrated science fiction movie of all time.
","The first, or chronologically forth Star Wars movie is bring us to the beginning of Anakin Skywalker's 'Jedi' life. The script is contain really bad dialogs, and sometimes really weird scenes (mostly the scene, where Jar Jar Binks destroy the half of the droid army, and stuff), but actually the Phantom Menace have a really strong story, with great characters, groundbreaking CGI effects, fantastic fighting choreographs, and really good music. The best scene - in my opinion - is the pod racing. I mean, damn. This is the scene, what everybody wants to see it in a science fiction movie. The only thing, what is missed in the movie, is a spectacular Anakin versus Darth Maul fight. Who wins?... Well... not the chosen one! :-)",Null,9,14,28 July 2011
