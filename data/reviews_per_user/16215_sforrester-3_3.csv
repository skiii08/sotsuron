It," I enjoyed IT (excuse the terrible pun)
","Before I sat down to watch this, as a huge King fan disappointed by many adaptations, I decided to leave the book behind and just treat this as any other movie. First of all I have to say I didn't find it scary however I did enjoy it and I was never bored. Although the film was set in a different time to the book, it was a good homage to the eighties. I feel that if you go to watch it with the book or the previous adaptation at the forefront of your mind then you may come away feeling that it was lacking but as a stand alone I thought it was definitely one of the better films this year. Once they settled into it, the kids did a great job and I enjoyed the humour. IT is a long, complex book and, given the running time, I think they did well getting the main stuff across. I'm just looking forward to chapter two!",Null,2,4,10 October 2017
Us," Confusing
","I must admit that after watching Get Out, I went into this with high expectations. I wasn't quite as disappointed as some of the other reviewers but I was slightly disappointed.
First of all the good stuff. The acting was good to the point that I forgot sometimes that the same actor was playing two parts. The overall feel of the film was good and I never felt bored. I enjoyed the basic story and the soundtrack was excellent.
Now the not so good. I was confused, even when the story was spelled out in an explanation near the end, I was still confused. I think my confusion arose from the quite massive plot holes that were apparent throughout. I got the beginning and I got the very end but a lot of it must have went right over my head.
All in all, I don't agree that this film deserves a rating of 1, there are some very enjoyable elements but I hope for Mr Peele's next film, he tries to be less of a smarty pants and just makes a solid film with a lot less holes.",6,0,1,30 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not the usual Tarantino
","I can see why people were disappointed in this film, but I loved it. It's not like Tarantino's usual fare with action and violence woven through the entire film. In fact the only real action lasts a few minutes at the end but that was fine with me. A lot of people seem to be saying there was no story and I think this is perhaps because they were expecting it to focus on the Manson murders which turn out to be a sideline to the real story of a Hollywood actor who's star is fading and his employee/best friend. For me, this has got to be the deepest, most touching film Tarantino has ever done.
Brad Pitt is brilliant in this, probably his best work. Even though I'm a huge DiCaprio fan, I think Pitt outshone him. I do agree that Margot Robbie could have been used more but I understand in doing that, it would have put the murders to the fore rather than the story that was really being told.
Go into this with an open mind and I guarantee you'll be drawn in as much as I was.",9,1,1,30 November 2019
