Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Not the Vampire flick we were waiting for, but the Vampire flick we NEEDED
","'This world could do without another vampire flick'. 'Enough already'. This is what I told myself. And even the trailers and promos of this film were kind of okay-ish but not exactly charming enough to drop-your-jaw. Until I SAW this film. I guess that should be more than enough to say anything about this movie. Spielberg better pull up his socks. His upcoming biographical saga on Lincoln will need something out of the blue to convince his audience that Lincoln was just a normal president with a beard and not ...you know what. Wanted took my expectation level to a stratospheric high. With this movie the level has rocketed to the exosphere. Wanted 2 better be that good Mr Bekmambetov. P.S.:Timur is one guy who hell sure knows how to make a film look and sound better than its trailer, one quality which film-makers seldom achieve. (Or maybe that's his trick!)",9,109,218,20 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing just about fits the bill.
","A critic once wrote that it is impossible to fathom anyone else portraying Spiderman other than Tobey Macguire. He'd willingly take back his words now. Garfield's Spiderman remarkably stands out in the instinctive humor which he displays, the sort of humor conspicuous by its absence in Tobey's Spiderman. The latter I admit was great in the first two movies but he didn't quite display any sarcastic behaviorism which we comic lovers really adore him for. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is also great and becomes more watchable considering that they are real life lovers too. Gwen Stacy is quite different and a refreshing change from Mary Jane of the previous movies. MJ was more of the usual damsel in distress who had to be there so as to keep Spidey in business. This time around Gwen might be another character vulnérable, but having a more headstrong personality and is a mainstay in the film. The film explores much of Peter's life before he actually dons the role of the web crawler for which he is destined. This ploy of a gradual build up to the more exciting stuff in the latter half of the movie made for a great viewing. Also the 3D must have been the best amongst all movies I have seen since Avatar. I'd say 'Amazing' just about fits the bill for this one.",5,32,81,21 June 2012
Brave," Merida WILL inspire. Brave WILL entertain. But the tale WILL NOT WOW.
","The experience of Snow White and the Huntsman left a bad taste and loads of cringe-worthy memories which I was quite eager to leave behind in my latest viewing of Brave. And as expected...Snow White who?? Merida all the way! If both characters were to be compared it would make a case of proton meets electron. Brushing character comparisons aside, THE FILM is your typical visual treat for the kids with nice underlying morals (but overdoing it a li'l wee bit). This animated tale of the feisty archer will definitely make for a good weekend trip to the cinema theater, but sadly only once. The film stumbles slightly in maintaining the tempo of the story. There are moments where kids might momentarily doze off or you might want to shove in a couple of loo breaks in between. Pixar has always maintained great standards in making such movies, whether it be animation or story-wise. So I might just warn that if you are looking for another Pixar movie which might blow your socks off, better hold back your expectations and you might just love it!",7,3,7,20 June 2012
Prometheus," Visually spectacle it might be, but it ain't no Avatar.
","The good old days of storytelling through film making is on the wane. Great film makers of yesteryear used to make great films. Now they're just about good. Steven Spielberg is one such example. Tintin was enjoyable but it was surely not your usual Spielberg fare. Another classic example in this league of directors is Ridley Scott. Lately the guy seems to be at sea regarding how to tell a gripping story. Robin Hood was entertaining but not endearing at all. Prometheus also suffers the same fate. It is at best a onetime entertaining watch. But it doesn't stay with you. Alien was one movie which haunted me, stayed with me. The tension while watching Sigourney Weaver going head on against the alien was palpable. In Prometheus you feel as if the things that happen were bound to happen. It feels strange that you're making a film on such a scale with loads of budget and you don't ponder over it as to what people would expect and how they would react. I'd say, the writers of fantabulous TV series such as Breaking Bad do better a job than these so called script writers. Noomi Rapace, the archaeologist is compelling, the android is portrayed by Fassbender with delightful precision and Charlize Theron is powerful in her short role. They got the right guys, but they didn't find them the right story. The movie is no doubt a visual spectacle, but it ain't no Avatar.",8,6,9,14 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A great movie action-wise, a big disappointment Nolan-wise
","So finally. I have watched The Dark Knight Rises. The movie that millions of Batman fans had been fervently waiting for, expectations sky-high (especially after the brilliance of The Dark Knight) and anticipating nothing less than a cinematic marvel that would blow them off their feet, a monumental piece of cinema with great acting, incredible action, the right dose of suspense and humour and an ending that would leave Batmaniacs gasping for breath.Unfortunately, it falls flat on many counts and despite the superbtastic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and some really impressive action sequences, The Dark Knight Rises fails to live upto the hype created ever since the name of the movie was announced.What are the positives here? Well, only a few. One of them is surely Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, a crafty, unapologetic burglar with a love- hate relation with Bruce Wayne and Batman. The latest toy of Batman- the flying contraption or the Batwing is another positive which induces a feeling of awe during the action scenes, which are very well-executed.But there are flaws aplenty. For instance:1. Clichéd, done to death plot- Consider most of the action movies in Hollywood, Bollywood or any other movie industry- most involve spies or some retired special agent who is 'called back for duty' to take on a villain who threatens up to blow up a city with a nuclear bomb. Exactly the same happens in The Dark Knight Rises. The aura of suspense is missed throughout the movie. Also, Batman's initial encounter with Bane doesn't evoke any feeling of dread and gloom.2. & 3. Bane and the Bane-Talia romantic angle- Undeniably the weakest link in the movie. Bane is a loser, wussy villain who sounds like an 80- year-old- granddad. The voice of Bane has definitely been altered, because you can notice in the prologue his deeper, more sinister vocalism. Damn you Christopher Nolan :-/ I felt like guffawing whenever Bane opened his mouth. Also, when Miranda Tate is revealed to be Talia Al Ghul, the pathetic Bane actually becomes emotional. Boy, what an embarrassment. Nolan's Joker would roast him alive if he ever crossed his path.One more thing, what in the bejabbers was that Talia-Bane romance? It reduced Bane to nothing more than a henchman of Talia who was 'fulfilling her father's wishes'. And if the ages of Bane and Talia in the flashback are as shown- an adult and a kid, then clearly Bane is a paedophile. He was whatboning the child Talia? PAEDO!4. The ludicrous ending- First of all, Christopher Nolan had said there would be no Robin in the movie. Then why in the name of all that is holy was the reference to Robin regarding Gordon-Lewitt's character- John Blake even made, eh? And the ending, oh wow, Batman flew away with the nuke in his batwing and its shown that before 5 seconds from detonation, he is still sitting in his uran khatola. No way he could have escaped and cleared 6+ miles to survive that blast. Batman is NOT SUPERMAN!Nolan also said 'we want to end it in the biggest way possible'. This was the epic end? A cheesy nuclear blast and the hero saved the entire city? Pah! Get more innovative, Mr. Nolan.5. Too many characters- In a superhero movie, the focus should remain on the superhero vs supervillain battle. In The Dark Knight Rises, its a complete clutter with many unnecessary characters. Its all about Gotham city, in fact. I was wondering if Bane was really required in the movie because his role is nothing more than of a thug doing the bidding of his masters.All in all, for me, someone who had spammed the timelines of people on Twitter and Facebook, assuring them that this would be the biggest superhero movies ever made, The Dark Knight Rises was a big disappointment.",10,1,4,21 July 2012
