Iron Man 3," must see
","if you've seen the previous iron man movies this is a must see to the sequels before it. great movie wicked sick action, and as always tony (Robert Downey Jr.) delivered an amazing show with spectacular incitement into the life of playboy, billionaire, and therapist. great movie with thrilling ending. overall Robert made an excellent role come true and aspire but yet again in this re-producing film. in the movie your seen with tony struggling to adapt to his new life after the feature duo film with great role characters Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye, black widow, and God of thunder Thor, known as Avengers. Tony does so with his new suit and new armoured iron men.",9,2,4,12 June 2013
