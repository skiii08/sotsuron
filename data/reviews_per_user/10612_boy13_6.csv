Resident Evil: Afterlife," A disappointment, not worth watching
","The movie turned out to be complete disappointment. It just seems like trying to cash the last drops by making sequels of popular series. The biggest loophole is the lack of clear plot. The movie is extremely slow in the beginning and is barely watchable. However it pics up some speed in later half. But it has the same old action scenes without any purpose or any flow if storyline. Mila too fails to deliver an effective performance. She seems to be in hurry to complete the movie and move to the next story. Also, her kick ass scenes are becoming boring and repetitive. People who has watched the previous parts would be disappointed with action scenes. And the new audience would be confused as to what is happening. Overall the movie does not even represent typical zombie flick. And made me feel waste of my time.",4,3,7,8 October 2010
This Is the End," Horrible drifter
","I was keen to watch this movie as it starred Seth Rogan and Jonah Hill. The movie starts well and seems promising. However, the story never really starts at any point. It just drifts aimlessly. With so many comedy stars one expects hearty laughs throughout the movie. Though there are few funny moments, i never hots the spot. Also, there is lot of references to previous movies which would go flat if people haven't seen them.I felt they could given Emma Watson a stronger character. Also they could have used the devil to add more scare and action. But it looks so fake and meaningless. The director seemed to be struggling to end it some how and had no clue about it. I just kept waiting for it to end.",4,2,4,11 November 2015
Interstellar," One of the worst movies
","Interstellar is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. The damage is done in beginning as movie starts with a lack luster plot and keeps dragging without getting in the main story-line. Though acting is fairly good. It is lack of interesting dialogs which makes people loose the grip. I was waiting for something to happen in the movie. Good editing and cutting out unnecessary incidents would have made the movie much different. Though it is compared to Inception, it totally lacks the fun punch and originality of Inception. Also, it keeps the viewers hanging and too many questions unanswered. The movie tries to do exciting by showing time travel and worm holes in last one third of the movie. However, it couldn't save it.",3,3,7,29 November 2014
Drag Me to Hell," A quality horror after many years
","I took the movie without much expectation. The movie turned out to be better than any horror movie have ever seen. The movie is unlike any low budget horror flicks focusing more on gore and usual scare clich√©s. The movie has strong story-line and it develops as the movie proceeds. The concept of curse of Lamia is wicked and clearly explained, rather than just showing some bizarre phenomenon. The movie is technically sound, well edited and proceeds with a fast pace. The acting natural and flawless. Mrs. Ganush is scary and convincing. The samll but important role by Dileep Rao is quite impressive and leaves convincing expression. Overall the movie is a rare find in horror category.",10,0,3,12 April 2010
Click," Movie makes you re think about the life, Must Watch
","The movie starts with various funny scenes and continues smoothly with brilliant performer from all the actors. The lead role, young architect is frustrated trying to keep balance between work and family.He starts skipping small problems in his life like cold and traffic but in due process he skips some bigger things and its too late till realises the mistake.The movie is delivers a much deeper meaning about the life with humorous touch. After watching person might look at his life from different angle. It has a touch of Eastern philosophy about sorrow and joy are essential cycles of life. If you skip the sorrow you loose the happiness too. The movie is masterpiece and must watch. Its very different from typical Adam Sandler's film.",9,1,3,15 May 2008
The Ugly Truth," Uninteresting movie
","The movie is extremely predictable with hardly any specific storyline. With any qualitative humor missing, the movie just drifts towards end. One can guess the end of the movie in first five minutes. Though the movie is considered a comedy, there is complete absence of any witty humor or any surprises.Only good thing about the movie is presence of Gerard Butler. After watching his Law Abiding citizen, I had hoped great hopes. However, he looks confident on screen and plays his character well. To summarize the movie, Butler is TV anchor who gives advice to females on how to get a male. After his advice to the heroin to find her dream man, they fall for each other.",2,2,4,25 March 2010
