It," Slow, meandering and uninteresting
","Who is rating this film highly? Have they ever seen an actual good film?The story is non-existent, the pace is so slow that you lose complete interest, the special effects are laughably bad and Pennywise provides no horror or fear whatsoever to the target audience. Underage viewers might get a shock, but certainly no adult should feel even a tinge of horror.The only real thought provoking or shocking element to the movie is when you question why they feel the need to show an underage actress in her underwear as an element of sexual provocation? Hollywood should know better!",1,0,0,27 September 2019
Toy Story 4," Why why why why why why why why why why?
","Did I say why? A plot barely worthy of being called a plot. Virtually everything that happens is out of character. Most characters may as well not be there other than to earn a royalty cheque for the actors.
This better be the last one they make, please don't do any more damage Pixar!",Null,4,7,20 October 2019
