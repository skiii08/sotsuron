First Man," Could have been so much better
",Ryan Gosling gives a decent performance but overall this is a great disappointment. It manages to take the thrill and awe out of one of mankind's most impressive scientific achievements. It's a much better investment of your time to watch the excellent and truly awe inspiring Apollo 11 documentary film.,6,0,1,4 August 2019
Vertigo," A haunting classic
",A superb film cleverly plotted that stands the test of multiple viewings. James Stewart is magnificent as the former policeman trying to piece together the mystery whilst trying not to lose his mind. Stunning performance too from Kim Novak. A film that you can view multiple times and still spot something more to admire. One of the very best films in the Hitchcock collection.,10,2,4,29 January 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Original and the Best
",Great thrill ride from start to finish with Ford and Allen perfect in the lead roles. Full of ingenious cliffhangers and iconic set piece scenes. One of Spielberg's finest films. Imitated but never bettered.,10,2,2,27 December 2019
Casablanca," One of the Greatest Movies of all time
",A fabulous film from the first scene to the last. Great performances all round- Bogart and Bergman perfect and Claude Rains excels. Great scene where the French out sing the Germans which given the films date is particularly moving. Who can forget Bogarts parting speech? The film is worth a hundred viewings.,10,3,4,13 February 2019
A Star Is Born," Two Stars at the top of their game
","Cooper convincing as the troubled fading star and Lada Gaga sensational as the star on the rise. Moving, sensitive and intelligent storytelling.",8,0,1,3 February 2019
As Good as It Gets," Charming film with excellent performances all round
","Another great performance from Jack Nicholson as the troubled, often obnoxious, and occasionally hilarious Melvin. Helen Hunt stunning too as the one person who can save him with fine support too from Greg Kinnear. A film with plenty of humour and soul that leaves you feeling better about the world.",9,2,2,26 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Stick with it - it's worth it in the end!
",Overall a decent addition to the Marvel Universe. The first 20 minutes or so is fairly uninspiring but after that poor start the film takes off in large part due to an excellent performance from Brie Larson in the lead role. Good support from a CGI modified Samuel L Jackson and from a variety of feline performers who play Goose! Would have been an 8 or better but for the first 20 minutes and ultimately leaves you wanting to see more of this character.,7,2,7,17 March 2019
Spider-Man 2," A fine sequel
",Maintains the high standards of the first in this series. Deservedly honoured for its special effects and the Maguire / Dunst combo is as strong as before.,8,2,2,14 July 2019
The Irishman," Great performances from Pacino and De Niro
","There is much to admire in this film, not least the performances of its two leads. The period detail is also superb as is Martin Scorsese's direction and there is a great supporting performance from Joe Pesci. You do feel that you have been transported back to the sixties and seventies. Not quite convinced about the de-ageing technology but the alternative would have required another actor to play the lead character in his early years. Then again that of course worked superbly well in The Godfather part II!",8,2,4,1 January 2020
"I, Tonya"," Doesn't Quite Get There
","There's no doubt that the three central performances by Robbie, Janney and Stan are excellent as are those from the young actresses playing the young Tonya. The film also has a unique quirky feel to it and a good soundtrack. The puzzling thing though is that as an overall piece it didn't hold my attention beyond the first 30 minutes and felt like a series of quirky sketches rather than a fully developed film.",7,1,1,26 March 2020
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Who are those guys?
","Many memorable scenes from the first to the iconic last, a great soundtrack, and three outstanding performances from Redford, Newman and Ross make this a film well worth investing your time in.",9,2,3,14 April 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Great introduction to the world of the Avengers
",Entertaining origins film that sets a strong standard for the films that follow. Great 1940's feel. Evans good in the lead role and strong supporting performances from Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter and from Stanley Tucci.,8,1,1,11 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Joyful tribute to a great performer
",Step back into the 1970's and 80's as Rami Malek gives an outstanding performance worthy of the outstanding performer that was Freddie Mercury. In some ways it's as much a musical as a drama with the soundtrack doing much of the storytelling and the finale leaving the viewer on a real high.,8,2,3,2 January 2020
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's Best Film
","A genuine classic. Cary Grant is perfect in the lead role of Roger Thornhill the advertising executive mistaken for a federal agent and thrown into mortal danger at every turn. 'I'm an advertising man, not a red herring. I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several bartenders that depend upon me and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting slightly killed'. Hitchcock treats us to a series of stand out scenes that have become iconic cinema - the crop dusting scene and Mount Rushmore amongst the most memorable. Great performances too from Eve Marie Saint and James Mason and an unforgettable score. A great thrill ride that makes 2 hours 16 minutes simply fly by.",10,1,2,27 January 2019
Doctor Zhivago," Sumptuous Epic with unforgettable Score
","A fabulous film full of humanity that charts the life of its title character before, during and after the Russian revolution. Magnificent direction from David Lean with Sharif and Christie perfect in the lead roles. Great support too from Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness. Stunning cinematography and an unforgettable score complete the zigsaw of an all time classic not to be missed.",10,0,0,30 September 2019
The Shining," Tour de Force From Mr Nicholson
","A performance worthy of the best actor award from Jack Nicholson. His increasingly unhinged central character together with a haunting use of sound and shocking visuals combine to create a very unsettling piece. Would have been better had they stuck to the Stephen King origins though, particularly as regards the Halloran character. Scatman Crothers is excellent in this role and deserved more airtime.",8,1,1,25 November 2019
Spider-Man," Captures the spirit of the comic books
",Strong performances all round and a decent story make this one of the more enduring superhero films.,8,0,0,11 July 2019
Zulu," Great recreation of an amazing historical event
",Heart pounding depiction of the events at Rorkes Drift when a small British contingent came under attack from overwhelming numbers of Zulu warriors. Stanley Baker superb as the commanding officer and Michael Caine convincing in the role of the posh young officer a few days his junior. Tremendous battle scenes and unrelenting tension once the attack starts. Noteable perfomance too from James Booth as Private Henry Hook.,10,1,2,17 February 2019
The Favourite," Plenty style; no substance
",Three outstanding central performances and stylish cinematography elevate what would otherwise be a pretty insignificant film. A number of laugh out loud moments and a couple of memorable scenes don't make up for the ultimately superficial nature of the piece however.,7,3,4,22 June 2019
Seabiscuit," Inspiring telling of a great true story
",Excellent and moving account of one of the greatest racehorses of all time and the three men whose lives he changed. Guaranteed to cheer you.,9,0,0,16 April 2019
1917," Original portrayal of heroism and of the horrors of war
",This film manages to look at the First World War in a different perspective to many others. It focuses on a race against time to warn a company against an imminent attack that is a trap. It's strength is the way that it combines at times incredible tension and danger with effective paced character development. This is only possible because of two stunning performances from its leads MacKay and Chapman. The ordinariness of these two characters makes the heroism more impressive and believable. A film that has real humanity .Great cinematography too.,9,0,4,22 January 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Noomi Rapace sensational in the lead role
",Having read the Millenium trilogy I felt sure that no one could adequately portray on film the unique and complex character that is Lisbeth Salander. I was wrong. Noomi Rapace is perfect in the lead role and has excellent support from Michael Nyqvist as Blomkvist. A superb production that does full justice to the first of Larsson's trilogy.,9,1,1,6 February 2019
The Dark Knight," One of the greatest superhero movies
",Stunning entry in the superhero genre. A film that is really an intelligent and dark morality tale dressed up in blockbuster clothes. Bale perfect in the lead role. Heath Ledger unforgettable with a truly great performance as the Joker. Great supporting cast. Strong score and cinematography add more plaudits to this excellent film.,9,0,1,31 July 2019
Singin' in the Rain," Joyous song and dance spectacular
",So many fabulous dance scenes in this peerless musical. Gene Kelly at the top of his game with fabulous support from Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. Good Mornin' and the iconic title number are majestic as is the unforgettable sequence with Kelly and the stunning Cyd Charisse. Quite simply one of the greatest musicals of all time that is almost guaranteed to raise your spirits.,10,0,0,7 December 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful film
",My favourite film of all time. George Bailey reminds you of what's important and what isn't. A film that still plays in cinemas 70 years later and which has been applauded at the end a number of times when I've watched it. We would all be happier if there were more George Baileys around and less Mr Potters; fewer Pottersville's and more Bedford Falls.,10,1,3,3 February 2019
Crazy Heart," Tough, gentle, heart breaking and heart warming all in one!
",Jeff Bridges is outstanding as the troubled lead with a majestic performance too from Maggie Gyllenhaal as his one real hope. A film that at times is a tough view but that also has real wisdom and a good heart.,8,0,0,13 August 2019
Heat," An acting masterclass from two of cinemas greats
",Pacino and De Niro are outstanding in this film and the scene in which they chat in the diner about the conflict to come is one of my top ten scenes in any film. Pacino's dogged and mentally exhausted cop in pursuit of De Niro's gang is arguably one of the greatest heroes in modern cinema.,9,0,0,1 January 2020
Green Book," Warm hearted film with two excellent performances
",Great period detail and two great actors make this film well worth a two hour investment of your time. Vigo Mortensen is barely recognisable and on top form as the tough Italian American transporting Mahershala Ali's world class musician across the Deep South in 1962,8,1,2,22 February 2020
