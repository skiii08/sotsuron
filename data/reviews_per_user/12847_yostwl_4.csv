Casablanca," Perfection
","They did everything right.  One of the few movies I can watch over and over again.  Bogart as macho, brave and vulnerable as any hero could hope to be, Bergman never more beautiful, the supporting cast all top-notch.  When they sing the Marseillaise in Rick's, I still get chills.  Love, patriotism, passion, heroism, cowardice, betrayal, loyalty, comic relief.  All done with excellence.",10,1,1,14 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Great Opening--Overall Pedestrian Effort
","The opening of this movie is one of the best battle scenes I've witnessed in 50 years of movie viewing.  So many appropriate superlatives about this scene have already been written by other reviewers that I can't add anything more.Unfortunately, once this scene is over the movie becomes a rather pedestrian WWII movie--just too predictable and, at times, stretching one's willingness to 'suspend disbelief' to the ultimate and beyond.  It's worth watching, but the bulk of the movie is just a rehash of cliches from just about every WWII film made in the 1940's and '50's.Opening scene rates a 10; the rest of the movie a 4; average 7.",7,0,0,13 April 2001
The Thin Red Line," Second Best Movie Ever Using War to Examine the Human Condition
","Much superior to the rather ordinary Private Ryan that garnered far more in ticket sales.  Ryan a run-of-the-mill war story with very good acting and excellent production standards.  Thin Red Line very close to Apocalypse Now as a many-layered exploration of human motivation and needs.  As with Apocalypse, the war is only a useful backdrop for this exploration.  The Thin Red Line forces thought and self-examination, in addition to ripping at one's emotions.  Ryan hits only at the emotional level--doing this very well, indeed--but not requiring any deep thought, just a vague 'gee, war is terrible' response.  Ryan is a really good movie.  Thin Red Line is great movie making with real meaning.",10,0,0,14 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," Think
","This movie requires thought--obviously those who rated it low are much more comfortable with Stallone.  The cinematography alone is worth an 8.0 rating--this movie will be recognized as a classic along with Apocalypse Now, Ran, and Lawrence of Arabia long after Private Ryan has been relegated to the one scene wonder bin (and it was a great scene).",10,1,2,3 August 1999
