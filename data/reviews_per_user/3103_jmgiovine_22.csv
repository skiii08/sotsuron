E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," As great as sci-fi adventures could get.
","While Spielberg already seemed to achieve the complete greatness in regards of the sci-fi genre, his newest installment seems to deliver twice the charm and delight, with a smaller scale, but bigger and compelling spirit, enough to make the average and passionate audience fell in love with its concept and execution, relaying on tone, family-friendly themes, and the now exploited traits such as the use of children to handle an entire adventure-like plot, E.T. is a timeless classic that still taught us the essentials of cinema.",10,1,1,1 August 2019
Rocketman," An unconventional and unique biopic.
","With a superb combination of dazzlingly energetic dance-musical numbers, terrific portrayals from Richard Madden, Jamie Bell and Bryce Dallas Howard, as well as the excelling main lead in Taron Egerton, Rocketman might fall into some conventional storytelling aspects, typical out of a biopic, but Dexter Fletcher's take on the iconic popstar has a unique (and surprisingly profound) way of telling its own story by adding context and thought-provoking themes to an already exhilarating film.",9,2,3,10 June 2019
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Poor and mockingly bad
","There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",2,1,2,6 June 2019
X-Men," Solid, small but effective!
","Bryan Singer offers not only a solidly structured humble film, but also an stylish and grounded story that represents the official blockbuster resurrection of the genre, showing how good superheroes can work with the proper production behind them.",8,1,1,6 June 2019
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Arguably, the definitive 'X-men experience'!
","With the comeback of director Bryan Singer and the return of the so-long anticipated original cast, as well as some newer ones and, of course, new additions into the vast Mutant catalog, Days of Future Past brings to life one of the characters iconic and memorable arcs ever since their conception, with heavy-weighted emotional drama, great action and amazing character chemistry, never mind the messy script by Simon Kinberg, but overall, an absolute improvement over the franchise and one of its finest.",9,0,0,7 June 2019
Toy Story 4," Unnecessary as it is effective!
","Despite it's obvious studio-by-the-numbers conception, this fourth installment in the believed 'concluded trilogy' dig some of the already explored traits in the beloved franchise, but despite being purely unnecessary for continuation purposes, first timer-director Josh Cooley successfully captures the effectiveness and heart of the original films, giving new life, characters and full circles onto a worthy sequel of PIXAR's unbeaten-now official-saga.",8,0,1,27 June 2019
1941," Funny at times, Dull for the most part.
","Steven Spielberg's brand new take on comedy might be effective at times, considering how risky his use of over-the-top slapstick turns in the end, escalating until concluding in a extravagant and exaggerated third act, also including a compellingly funny cast, but with a certain use of absurdity in its humor, this could result in either a love it-or hate it- entry in the director's filmography, also considering its profane themes towards a sensitive subject as World War II.",6,3,4,1 August 2019
Aladdin," Musical Dazzling but Poorly executed.
","Guy Ritchie's live-action remake of the 1992 animated jewel at times tries, at times doesn't really provides much effort to even recapture the original's charm, musical spectacle nor its famous extravaganza, lacking for the most part a solid structure towards its mimicking-script, or an evident direction that here its clearly imitating something far superior, the few good elements the movie possess relay on some visual aspects and a decently mediocre performance from the three lead roles.",3,43,76,4 June 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," Dull and weaker
","The first half is pretty much solid, but the film slowly falls apart later on with unimaginative and heavily pop-Cornish comic book action, that fails to provide the efficiency and style the previous 2 films accomplished, even when the characters still work as good as they did before.",5,0,1,6 June 2019
The Lion King," Unworthy and unnecessary
","Amazingly displayed in regards of its photorealistic animation, in the visual department, this remake of the 1994 immortal classic is mesmerizing, as well as it is impressive to appreciate, nevertheless, the substance and value that defined the original are gone, mostly due to its excessive-scene by scene-imitative structure, regardless of the potential of its voice casting, its uncanny value is the definitive element that makes Jon Favreau's latest an unworthy Disney entry.",5,3,5,30 July 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Good and meh, at the same time...
","Its action is noticeable and it truly delivers some nice X-spectacle, but Simon Kinberg's script lacks the strength of previous entries in the franchise, and Singer's direction at times is on point, at times all over the place with cartoonish and poor aesthetics, leaving behind the potential its cast and new additions might offer for a story many fans of the characters have waited to see in the big screen, delivering only a product that entertains, but has bigger shoes to fulfill.",6,0,0,7 June 2019
Logan," Exhilarating and worthy!
","Exhilarating, visceral and brutal, the last installment in the X-franchise is filled with enough action and nostalgia to satisfy not only fans, but audiences in general, making it a more than a worthy farewell to Jackman's relate and memorable character.",10,14,27,8 June 2019
Toy Story," Solid, whimsical and charmingly animated
","With a simple story but cheerful and whimsically energetic characters, John Lasseter provides an incredibly efficient and beautiful animated flick that'll represent PIXAR's quick-start full length feature, offering complex ideas that will be enjoyable for youngsters and adults alike, and delivering great voice casting that'll include the eternally appealing chemistry between stars, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, as the iconic duet; Woody and Buzz Lightyear.",10,0,0,24 June 2019
Toy Story 2," Improved visuals but equally effective in essence.
","With a noticeable improvement over the animation and style, but preserving its best narrative and spiritual elements, John Lasseter continues the success from the first PIXAR installment, this time, expanding the horizons and creating a bigger environment for this wonderful characters to keep their essence, adding new histrionic elements and effective plot devices that continues the story in such a proper way, it is only the lack of Hanks-Allen shared chemistry what keeps this installment from 100% superiority over the first one.",9,0,1,24 June 2019
Jaws," Intense, suspenseful and timeless.
","Immerse on itself by creating character, atmosphere, suspense, shock and even a riveting sense of joyful adventure, Peter Benchley's novel is crafted to life in a superb way, thanks in a great part to Spielberg's unique style and direction, along the timeless performances from Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, Jaws is an iconic masterpiece, the godfather of modern B-movies, and the mother of the entire blockbuster tendency, giving the film an immortal place in history, making of it a 'must see' for either fans of cinema or regular spectators.",10,0,1,1 August 2019
The Lion King," It places itself among the best animated productions of all time.
","Oscillating between big and colorful, the newest member of the Disney Renaissance marks a higher mark in terms of the stakes of the animation house, with a grand and epic story that possesses all the great Shakespearean traits, as well as the beautiful animation and the scope behind it, filled with charming, catchy and memorable songs, an amazing score, a worthy voice-casting and the best and unique elements every single animated flick should showcase, all in amazing-great deliverance.",10,2,2,30 July 2019
X-Men: First Class," Surprisingly Effective, as prequels go!
","It may not respect the continuity of the previous films, as a matter of fact, its script damages part of that substance, but in the end, all these changes settle for a far compelling story than the latter installments, with more depth and character development and an appealing newer cast, this prequel in the X-franchise offers vitality and colorful themes, as well as the proper gags from the source material and the surprisingly satisfying presence of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in the main roles.",8,0,0,6 June 2019
The Wolverine," Decently passable
","Not as strong as previous X-installments, but definitely not weaker, this newest spin off in the franchise corrects some mistakes made by its predecessor, and takes advantage of a serious and focused plot that benefits from Hugh Jackman's on point portrayal of the iconic mutant-main character, and James Mangold's stylish directional take on one of the hero's memorable comic book arcs, the film is good enough, only restrained by a standard-conventional third act.",7,0,1,6 June 2019
Toy Story 3," A close-to-perfection third installment from a close-to-perfection franchise
","Lee Unkrich manages to achieve the best out of a third installment, accomplishing something so far unknown for animated flicks, providing the same quality, the style but perfecting its animation and visual elements to an excelling degree, managing to deliver the best out of what makes this franchise so successful, as well as its own emotional engines that'll move both, little ones and the now-grownups that grew with the franchise with wit and genuine attachment.",10,0,0,24 June 2019
X2: X-Men United," Superior and ambitious than its predecessor
","Solidly written and directed, the second installment in the x-franchise upgraded the best elements from its predecessor, but it also offered a unique view that'll define how this franchise should be handle, with better technical aspects, performances and a promising further exploration for these characters.",9,0,0,6 June 2019
Easy A," One of the funniest-smartest chick flicks.
","By all means the movie could work alone just by Emma Stone's hyper-charisma and excelling appeal as the lead role, but thankfully, Easy A is a comedy that knows exactly what it is, what it tries to say and the means to achieve it, in such fancy and hilarious way, benefit by the presence of a great casting, all suited for a small but subtle indie flick that, good enough, transcends the barriers of a casual average chick flick in order to become universally enjoyable.",9,1,1,12 July 2019
Aladdin," A beautiful-Disney animated classic.
","Beautifully animated and bright colorful in both: visuals and plot, this Disney animated classic offers the best out of the studio, with a whimsical take on the timeless Arabic tale but with tons of personality, most of all thanks to a wonderful score by Alan Menken, a solid story and, most of all, the immortally memorable-bombastic animated-voice performance by the great Robin Williams, providing one of Disney's greatest characters to date.",9,0,0,4 June 2019
