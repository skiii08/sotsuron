Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What's Missing?
","The special effects are spectacular, no doubt about it. You can watch the thing over and over just for the eye candy.But the tone is different. What's missing?A Han Solo character. The movie takes itself entirely too seriously, and desperately needs someone like that old pirate Han to lighten things up. Think about it: Han at the Galactic senate, doing some wheeling and dealing. Han on the rescue mission. Han laying down some bets at the pod race. Han wheeling and dealing for some starship parts. Swashbuckling, cynical, sardonic, resourceful--everything missing from the movie, and vital elements that made the original trilogy work by balancing out all the talk about hokey religions and ancient weapons.Not that it needed to be Han himself, but the archetype was sorely missed. Jar Jar Binks is not exactly a replacement.",Null,0,1,14 February 2000
Shooter," Standard Issue
","Standard issue action flick. Huge government conspiracy: check. Fireballs in the background frame the protagonist as he walks away without turning around: check. Slimy, over-acting henchmen: check. Crooked senator: check. Gigantic plot holes that move you to the next shootout: check.All the usual tropes, including the standard-issue anti-American stuff. They even used the standard shot of a Reagan portrait on the wall of the evil cabal's lair. Reagan hasn't been president for neigh-on 20 years, but the shot is still trotted out to prove what a deep thinker the director is.I was hoping for more technical shooting descriptions as Swagger prepares his equipment and shots, but it's mostly just trigger pulling.Some nice outdoor scenery.",3,22,48,24 March 2007
