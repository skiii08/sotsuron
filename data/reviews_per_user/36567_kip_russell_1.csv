The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Truly excellent acting in a Peoples Choice Favorite Dramatic Film
","I've seen this film 4 times now (as well as having read the book after the first time). Let me caution you that this is not a film for everyone. If you were in the 'popular' crowd in high school, you may not be able to relate to the story. Since 'Wallflower' won Favorite Dramatic Film in the Peoples Choice Awards on January 9, 2013, a substantial (mostly young) fan base cares enough for this film to go and vote for it. The acting by the 3 main leads (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller) is really excellent, but Logan's acting is particularly outstanding. (Note that Emma also won Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress - partly based, I feel sure - on her role in the Harry Potter series.) Logan did not make the cut for Favorite Dramatic Movie Actor - which was won by Zac Efron. Logan has had much experience - see the IMDb list - including holding his own against Renee Zellweger in 'My One and Only'. It's a pity that Lionsgate/Summit did not support well the theatrical release of 'Wallflower'. Logan Lerman's acting is truly Oscar quality. His performance as Percy Jackson ('Lightning Thief') gave no hint that he could be capable of such great acting. Emma Watson tirelessly promoted the film, and praised Lerman's acting professionalism. Of course, there are echoes of John Hughes and many others in this film. However, this is no light-weight teen drama, but an emotionally draining experience for those who can relate to the damaged teens so vividly presented in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower.'",9,1,2,10 January 2013
