Walk the Line," Good!!
","I thought this movie was great. I like Johnny Cash. I think Joaquin Pheonix did a good job portraying Johnny Cash. The acting was great. I didn't know anything about his past and this movie was not only great, but it also lets the audience learn about the past and what drives a musician. What I thought was great was the fact that Johnny had so much love and passion for June. It wasn't just an actor lip-syncing, he actually did his own singing and it amazingly sounded like Johnny. Reese also did a good job portraying June Carter. It is definitely a good movie to own. I usually don't watch these type of movies, but it was a really good movie.",9,5,8,17 August 2006
