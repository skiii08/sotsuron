Hereditary," Scare me
","I haven't been truly scared by a movie in a very long time. I've kind of forgotten what that feels like. But I can definitely appreciate that a movie is scary and this one was. I jumped a couple times. I even said 'oh man' out loud at one point. I felt actual anxiety at times. And if I hadn't been in a reclining seat, I would have been sitting on the edge of it for the last 45 minutes or so.",8,1,6,8 June 2018
