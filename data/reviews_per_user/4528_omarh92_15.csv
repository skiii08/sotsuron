Blade Runner 2049," Either equal, or superior than its predecessor. Denis is the future.
","Director Denis Villeneuve promised Blade Runner's sequel is good hands when he accepted to direct one the most influential films of all time, and he kept his promise; Blade Runner 2049 follows up with a darker world than what Ridley Scott imagined, yet keeping the very same charm Ridley worked hard on. It is also the best looking movie ever created, Roger Deakins will never top his cinematography here ever.What makes this film special is all cast and crew were either fans of the original, or worked on the original; they all knew this can only be phenomenal, and with their teamwork, the sequel was beyond phenomenal. The core philosophy of the movie, like the original is still what it means to be human is still a major topic and it vastly more explored here than the first film; told through replicant's obsession with love of another person mainly. Acting was top on everyone's end; Gosling, Ford, Armas, Leto, and Bautista. It sadly lacks Leto and Bautista, those 2 characters had an instant connection to the audience, perfectly played. Gosling here is like how he was in Drive, only obviously speaks more, however, it can be an award winning role for him as officer K.Setting is how Ridley Scott planned his original only in the future environment got worse, the cyberpunk, and neo-noir look never looked so beautiful and its so pleasing to see it returning after a long time. Each frame is an art in this movie, it is the most beautiful looking movie ever made, minimal CGI, and lots of special effects. Denis was so key about the lighting effects in the film, the lighting made the film look breathtaking. The soundtrack, every time a futurist score plays, goosebumps and chills, the feeling brings you into that world.Story wise, like the original; classic detective in the future, investigation with a dark past, and can lead to a dark future; Agent K takes a case which leads him to look for Deckard (the question of Deckard being human and replicant is asked again by the way). Like all Denis movies, there is always more to the main plot, it will look a story of one character, but ends up telling someone else's story, and this is done through a huge reveal or twist which was a 'wow' moment I have not felt in a long time. You can skip the original Blade Runner, but it is highly advised you watch The Final Cut version before seeing this since there are many nods to the original film. Watching the original film, like 'Skin jobs,' VK test (sort of), an opening credit, 'retirement,' and unicorns as well. There is also another character other than Deckard who returned.... Watching the original will enhance the experience, and help you appreciate the story here a lot more.Once upon a time, Terminator 2 was called the greatest sequel ever, that time is now over; Blade Runner 2049 is the best sequel in history; keeps the charm of the original, but introduces fresh new elements, in the most amazing cinematography ever. Watch it on a big screen, because looks and surround sound will give you the best experience possible. Enjoy Blade Runner 2049, it may one day become as important as the original Blade Runner.",10,8,20,6 October 2017
The Expendables 2," A reloaded *** kicker and better than the 1st one.
","I must admit, the hype for the first film was too much and in the end, we all got some intense 80s style action but with a poor story. This sequel however actually has a story, a story of revenge. The first film introduces the gang so we get to know them. The second however, we already know the gang so now we actually see how they truly are and how they work. This film is better since the rest of the team (other than Stallone) get more screen time and they have their humor moments. Van Dammne played a very very very very very AWESOME villain, and towards the end of the film, he shows even at the age of 50, he is stronger than ever. Arnie and Bruce Willis had a great screen time too with perfect humor, seriously the chemistry between those 2 and the rest is great. Speaking of chemistry, Dolph Lundgren's role is MUCH better now and very enjoyable. Chuck Norris, you'd be surprise how he is. The cast was great, the story is better, the action is MORE intense, there is great humor. In conclusion, Expendables 2 brings back the 1980s action style with it's teaspoon of humor. Enjoy the film!",7,74,112,16 August 2012
It," Its like Stranger Things the movie, which was honestly great!
","IT is a solid film, however not as scary as the trailer showed, but still a really nice movie. Like you can go in thinking its a drama/adventure movie, and its great. Pennywise was amazing, Losers club was fun, if you love Netflix's Stranger Things, this is no different, you will love it then.The problem with 90% of horror movies today, they only have one objective, to scare the audience. Filmmakers do not care about the story whether if its good or not, they only care if they scare the audience. However for IT, now it tries to be scary, and the scenes are generally disturbing and uneasy, but at least they gave a good movie, like the filmmakers, just in case the film doesn't scare you, they still put great effort and gave you a really nice story. Its great to see early teenagers go on an adventure, do stupid stuff, think they are so cool and own the world, but unite together against a threat, because that is what friendship is, that brings a heartwarming feel to movie.As for Pennywise, Bill Skarsgard was excellent. Its honestly not fair to compare him to Tim Curry, because both are pretty different takes on Pennywise. Its like apples and oranges or Jack Nicholson's Joker or Heath Ledger's Joker, one Pennywise is more wacky and lively but evil, another is dark and disturbing and more evil. Its mainly which take you prefer. I honestly prefer Tim Curry, but I may just be saying this because I love Tim Curry a lot, but no doubt Bill was marvelous and excellent, he was creepy, which was great. I will say, I prefer the voice of the Tim Curry's Pennywise, he was more serious, Bill took the goofy sounding approach, which was good and it worked, both Pennywises' are excellent.Story was great, very 80s, tons of references, If watch the Netflix's Stranger Things, this is literally Stranger Things the movie, which was honestly great! Its also like The Goonies, or Lost Boys, young people involved in trouble. I never read the novel, but I know about many key events that happen, and this much closer to the novel for sure, with many references and throwbacks to it. Its darker, more disturbing and serious. The Losers club is so much fun to watch, you'll love all the kids there, even the really annoying ones. Pennywise was excellent of course. Henry Bower the bully is more to the novel, a proper disturbed psycho, he was great. Derry this time is little more light hearted than the original, the adults, not very different from the original.All and all, IT is a great movie, but really not that scary, but surely freaky and disturbing, amazing cast, effects, story, acting everything. Enjoy Pennywise the Dancing clown.",8,3,9,8 September 2017
Se7en," This is 1 of those movies can be watched only once a life time
","Another masterpiece, Se7en delivers complete realistic drama along with psychological breakdowns. One of the main beauty of this film is, as the movie tends to become much more serious and tragic, it pulls you into the mood of the movie itself, rarely a great motion picture can do that but Se7en was able to. For those who think Brad Pitt is just some commercial pretty boy (I thought so myself) this movie indeed proved me ever so completely wrong, this is one his finest movies, Brad Pitt is defiantly one of the best actors lurking around Hollywood, along side with veteran and lovable actor Morgan Freeman who also delivered outstanding performance like he always does in his movies, all and all, Se7en is a great marvelous film, the reason I say it can be watched once in a lifetime is because the ending breaks you down psychologically and it's a one time experience, watching it again and again will give you pleasure of a great movie but not the ending feel.",9,0,2,22 April 2011
Superbad," Super success!
","Now this here is a movie, a new type of comedy, not like any other cliché horrible teen drama/comedy, this here is the real deal, full of characters you are guaranteed to love so much, the randomness/stupidity is NOT horrible but actually hilarious and widely entertaining, the comedy grosses a high level not to mention the non stop laughing dirty sex jokes to. The picture of the movie may look old but that what makes the movie even a lot more brilliant, the style of it may look old like an 80s graphical movie when it actually came out in 2007, I guess the picture style of the movie is perfect for a teen movie like this. If your itching for a great laugh and a fun time then this movie is PERFECTO!",9,0,2,5 July 2010
Underworld Awakening," Not a well played story, more focused on action and effects
","Underworld went from a potential good series to now on the verge of being bad. The first movie started well, second continued in an alright pace, third should not be mentioned while the forth movie took a slight fall. The fall occurred due to the same mistake Hollywood keeps repeating intentionally, poor story, too much effects, way too much action and the worst of all, 3D. The story, which is attempting to continue the pace left at Underworld 2 is rather not bad and can result very well if played right, unfortunately due to the main focus on action and effects, the story was not focused on too well which could have made a difference in the entire movie. True the action and effects were pleasing, but even pleasing effects should have limits and must not cross the line only to be over done, in this case like many movies, the action and effects were over done, to a major extent. All and all, Underworld Awakening delivered the action which is in demand for the audience today, but the tradition of of good story telling must always be a movies back-bone.",4,28,58,19 January 2012
Man of Steel," The world's greatest superhero gets the world's greatest superhero movie.
","It excessively lives more than the hype of the film. What people saw in trailers saw nothing, the film has a lot more the trailers did not show, which is how it is suppose to be. Man of Steel like The Dark Knight raised the bars for superhero movies, again. This is the most different Superman take than any other movie, cartoon, game, or any of such, this is a fresh story for Superman.Similar to The Dark Knight, this movie is indeed dark. However, its a dark setting, environment, and tone, with a bright hope leading character that sheds light into the darkness of the film. There is a lot of action in the movie, jaw dropping incredible action, the special effects were out of this world. Story starts of as a biopic of Superman, then later reveals the major plot in the movie. All actors/actresses play their roles best. You don't get many films with both good story and graphics, it's always one of each, you have both in this film.Henry Cavill's Superman is at the level of Christopher Reeve (RIP) and Brandon Routh. Cavill was great, majestic, and comical as how Superman is suppose to be. Amy Adam's Lois Lane needed more screen time but she was portrayed almost as how Lois is in the comics. Russell Crowe's Jor- El is an excellent heir to Marlon Brando (RIP), he was significant. Everyone, from Costner, Lane, Traue, Lennix, Meloni, and Fishburne were amazing to their roles. A very special comment to Michael Shannon's General Zod. In all honesty, he stole the whole movie, General Zod became a new icon in this movie like how Terence Stamp first made Zod an icon in Superman II (1980). General Zod was a more interesting character than Superman. Why? He's an antagonist with a purpose, he can be sympathies with. For a villain he wasn't so evil as people expected, he was more of a dictator. Personally at one point of the film, I was rooting for Zod during his fight with Superman cause he was that good!Man of Steel broke few Superman traditions, but kept the soul purpose of the character and story alive. The flaws would be that its darker than Nolan's Batman, the movie felt pretty rushed and fast, and some comic fans will be pleased to some of the changes, but as a comic fan myself, its a realistic take on Superman so I am fine with it. This is an epic incredible movie. I would still get goosebumps watching it again and be blown away. Go watch it, enjoy it, love it, and please praise it, Man of Steel deserves it. As a major comic fan, this is one of the best treats for the hero that inspired almost all superheroes today.",10,5,12,13 June 2013
Dunkirk," Too perfect
","Fun fact, when Nolan said he'll make a virtual reality movie, but without the goggles, he wasn't kidding with Dunkirk, its too real.2D, 3D, or IMAX (highly recommend IMAX for this movie), you will feel like you are in the battlefield itself, this is a technical achievement, the sounds and visuals are so realistic you will feel you are in the movie itself. This is the most realistic war film ever.The movie is INTENSE, the sudden noises can scare you, the incoming danger of bombers will worry you, Chris Nolan captured the horrors of war so well, you will feel sad and bad for each soldier who dies, this film is a beautiful experience of the true horrors of war.Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy well done. Harry Styles, best debut ever, you will love him here, he can act. All the cast were superb, I mean everyone. Michael Caine cameo is also there, just his voice. The film does not have so much dialogues, but the story is told so well through cameras, sound, and actors' movement, which just increases the intensity. Its more of a survival film then war action like Saving Private Ryan (no comparison), but the action again is phenomenal. The film is also just under 2 hours, but because of pace, and uneasy yet amazing OST by Han Zimmer (his new top work), this will be the slow but amazing almost 2 hour film.",10,7,19,29 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Underwhelming due to lazy writing, but still a good movie with a fitting ending
","Its great, enjoyable, with some of the best moments, but its obvious that Infinity War was the better film. Think Infinity War like Star Wars V, and Endgame sort of like Star Wars VI.Endgame sadly suffers from absolutely lazy writing, from hyping up certain characters only to give them less than 15 mins screen time in this 3 hour film, to misuse of comedic moments because they did not want the film to drag, to plotholes which no sense at all, all the way to featuring few big fight scenes and occurrence of problems driving the plot of the film. However, they did piece a well made movie at the end.This film is certainly the original Avengers' swan song, some characters will not be seen again and to see them one last time here is an emotional experience, and they gave it their best shot in this film. Some characters were treated SO well and its amazing, some were absolute let down and disappointing to the point that Endgame did not need them in this film at all, which is not nice because some of these characters will continue with the new Avengers roaster.Visuals are top, sound effects as well, good humor, plot is okay but can be better, acting 95% of the cast were great, emotional connection is here so you will tear up in a few scenes. Enjoy the movie, all the events from the first film, Iron Man, leads to here with a fitting conclusion. Please note there is nothing during the post credits scene other than sounds of a blacksmith hitting something. Thank you Marvel, thank you original Avengers.",7,0,0,27 April 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Brad Pitt's best movie
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button most definitely deserved it's 3 Oscars and many other awards it won, this is off course an idea thought of many time but never executed well but David Fincher managed to do so and he has really out-done himself at this very film. Everything is here in the film: drama, comedy, romance and tragedy. Off course when a movie contains all those elements it is bound to fail or end up as a cliché but The Curious Case of Benjamin Button blends all those very slim and well and organized it perfectly to give this 3 Oscar win movie it's recognition. This is also most certainly Brad Pitt's best movie yet, Fight Club standing 2nd while Se7en being the 3rd. A highly recommended movie, a movie to watch with a close friend, group of friends, love one or families, any audience is welcomed here for their hearts to be touched.",9,0,2,22 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The only medal The Last Jedi earns is the 'At least you're better than The Attack of the Clones' medal.
","Disney just did the impossible, they ruined Star Wars. Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi was a major disappointment. It did not feel like a SW film, it just was a Disney space adventure. Mark Hamill gave it his all, but terrible treatment to Luke's grand return. All the hype on the plot of this film is rubbish; so much focus on Jedi books and myths, Rey's mysterious parents, sinister Snoke, and Luke Skywalker ended up being a major let down, also porgs are just there to sell toys.Disney refuses to write in 'dark' things from the Original films to this movie. The original films were not dark but it was violent and packed with great action and amazing dramatic moments. Star battles here are an absolute joke, and lightsaber fights are laughable. Attack of the Clones had more action than this! The Last Jedi amazing lightsaber fights, army of X-wings flying into battle, dramatic turning points and major tragedies, and natural humor. We don't want child/family friendly film which are worse than the prequels, we want a similar tone to the original films. However, credit to writers for not making this into an Empire Strikes Back rehash, and to Mark Hamill's performance; crap writing, but Mark still gave it his all, love his performance, hated his treatment. Snoke in the previous film looked scary, Snoke here is a bloody joke, replace Andy Serkis' Snoke with his Caesar and I promise it will be a 100 times more scary and menacing, than little Snoke in his golden robe sitting in this red crib. Rey's interaction with Kylo was useless, Rose was okay, nice new character, Leia was cool but had a very cringe worthy moment with the force, there is a sequence in the film in which if you remove this entire sequence it would have made NO difference whatsoever in plot and movie. Disney must learn that making anything child/family friendly shifts the overall tone. Star Wars is something many people grew to for many years, they should respect the old cast, and their legacy, plus tone, not erase it all movie by movie with lazy friendly writing. Believe me when I say this; as a fan who grew up to SW his whole life and had to deal with the problems of the prequel, it is safe to say I enjoyed Episode 1 MORE than The Last Jedi, yes very controversial. Why? At least Episode 1 felt like a SW movie and not Disney adventure, it still has the greatest lightsaber fight in the whole saga, OST was brilliant as well, star battles were memorable, comedy was natural and not force, had a great villain, heroes who knew what they wanted to do, YET it was a child/family friendly film which was not good, until I saw this. I am sorry but The Last Jedi was not a good movie. It is MORE child/family friendly than the prequels, lacks tragedy, action, drama, villain, SW tone. The only medal The Last Jedi earns is the 'At least you are better than The Attack of the Clones' medal. I feel sad Mark Hamill has to deal with this.I end this review with the Star Wars film rankings:Empire Strikes Back

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Thank you for killing my childhood favorite Cartoon...
","What can I say? I grew up to Transformers, loved the cartoons, toys hell even the comics, I love Transformers with all my heart and was so God damn excited when they announced the 1st movie which could've been better but this...THIS MOVIE! What the hell did you do Micheal! WTF! Literally no story at all, just Micheal Bay all 'Oh I'm just gonna throw in these robots, let them beat each other aimlessly for no reason, purpose and plot, maybe add some CGI to make it look cool, bring in some lame children comedy, put in some gay cliché, oh I should show Megan Fox's cleavage so I get more people into my movie' seriously Micheal Bay if I ever make it to the movie business 1 day I will re-make this franchise and EMBARRASS YOU! Seriously you ruined a mans greatest childhood memory thank you so much Bay, **** YOU! And I hope you never sit on the directors chair ever again!",3,1,9,31 July 2010
The Wolverine," Terrible, an embarrassment to the actual Wolverine
","MINOR SPOILERS CONTAINED! NOT MAJOR PLOT CHANGING SPOILERS!It surprises me that Wolverine fans enjoyed this movie, which means these are fans that were made from the movies and not comic books or cartoons. If you've seen the past X-Men movies, this movie is utter embarrassment in front of X-men and X-Men 2. Throughout the series, plot holes appear from nowhere making the word sense not a word in the dictionary anymore. This contains MINOR SPOILERS, which will not give away the very main plot.The plot in this movie is quite poor. It is all action an effects again. Logan is on a runaway journey after the events from 'X-Men 3: The Last Stand', he is disturbed and depressed. He then gets himself into some trouble, this is basically it. We see someone refereed as 'Viper,' who is actual MADAM HYDRA from the comics, once again a known character has been tampered, changed, and ended up looking terrible. For those hyped for the Silver Samurai, prepared to be disappointed, as he is only in the last 10 - 20 minutes of the movie. Prepare to be even more disappointed that Silver Samurai is A ROBOT, and not a man in an actual samurai armor, but a man in a giant robot. This movie is also rich in plot holes. One plot hole in particular really annoyed me. Now we all know when Wolverine unleashes his claws, it cuts the skin between his knuckles but get regenerated thanks to his advanced healing factor. Now in the movie, Wolverine loses his healing factor, he'll get shot and stabbed and be wounded with band-aids and antiseptic. However, he still unleashes his claws in a fight, so theoretically he's suppose to bleed endlessly once the claws come out because THE SKIN IS CUT, yet in the movie he brings them out and puts them in like old times with his healing factor, which HE LOST in this movie, temporarily of course. Note, in X-Men 1 near the beginning of the movie, Rogue asks Wolverine if it pains when the claws come out, and Wolverine replied that it always hurts but the wound gets healed very fast.This poor plot movie is masked with some okay action sequences, and lame comical humor (there are few funny ones), can be compared to Michael Bay's Transformers or James Cameron's Avatar, all action and graphics yet no or a very bad story. This movie is an insult to fans of the character.There is an after-credit of the movie which honestly is better than the entire film. It's a lead up to X-Men: Days Of Future Past (2014). 'The Wolverine' was terrible, end of review.",4,14,27,17 August 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Its not bad, critics are either paid off or biased
","Really, its a nice movie. Yes there are problems, which will be addressed, spoiler free, but the good points will be addressed too.Story: There honestly is not much here which is not good. Subplots are weak, substance of the story is weak too. If there were better subplots, this movie would be as incredible as Nolan's Batman. Bruce Wayne is investigating an incoming threat, along with planning to take down Superman, while Lex also plans the same against Superman. That is all I will say. If they improved the investigation part, automatically the subplots in there would be excellent. The movie is more Batman for sure, his introduction in the superhero world, however another lack is the fact that Bruce was already Batman for a long time, and they way Batman reintroduces himself, comes out of retirement was so.. bland and a let down, unlike 'The Dark Knight Rises,' Batman's return was memorable. There should have been more Clark and Bruce confrontation before the actual battle takes place. There is definitely a hint of an alternate future/time, which is classic DC and exciting. Story and tone of the film is dark, which fits film, there is humor, but the dark tone really gives the movie its strength. There is light, which is what Superman brings, its fascinating you have such a dark environment and you one character who restores positive feelings in the movie again.The story borrows from the comic 'The Dark Knight Returns,' 'Injustice Gods Among Us,' and one more comic which I cannot say because it is spoiling, but this comic is a very memorable one and you will know what it is when you see the ending of the movie, which by the way, I felt the ending was not the best decision story wise, but it did cover that part from its source material well. There are cameos of other JL members, but only cameos unfortunately, to set up a proper JL film, they should have brought them all together in the end, instead of only discussing it. Action: The action is top. Very violent, fun, and beautiful looking. The graphics are great. The Batman vs Superman fight is good, could have been better but good. The Batman action from his solo missions are very Batman; Batmobile, grapple gun, Batarang, Batplane, the punches, but there is something which will be addressed later. The final fight, Trinity vs Doomsday was honestly really amazing and a fan's dream come true. Very enjoyable.Batman: Ben Affleck is A GREAT Batman, he portrayed him well. We see Bruce Wayne work on his toys, investigating, speak another language, having his good heart, being his playboy ego and working with Alfred in his missions. Batman is grizzly, dangerous, quite scary and just a monster. There are 2 things however about this Batman which CANNOT BE ACCEPTED at all, its 2 things which Batman would never do and I was not pleased by it at all. Its hard to over look at these 2 things but we have a new take on Batman. Personally I'm not a huge fan of the new suit but I guess it suits the grisly Frank Miller Batman.Alfred: I dare say this is best Alfred, even better than Caine's Alfred who is untouchable. Iron's Alfred works with Batman more than Caine did. Iron's Alfred is maintaining and repairing equipment, advises Bruce, very smart and knowledgeable, helps Batman and communicates with him throughout his missions, he's actually a pretty dangerous Alfred which I love, surely my new favorite character. We see a new side of Alfred every comic fan reads, and its too good.Superman: Pretty much the same as Man of Steel, humble, funny, brings light to the dark movie, strong in what he believes in. Only new thing is he is conflicted from the government and people who hate him, what I love is even with all the hate, he still does good no matter what, because he IS Superman, love him or hate him, he will still help you no matter what, and this is why I love Henry's Superman a lot. Wonder Woman: You would think WW barely has a role in this movie and is just eye candy and kicking ass. Well that's a little true, WW's role was not as small as I predicted, she does get a good screen time, she speaks important things, she's actually useful, she's more than eye candy and kicking ass, she's a proper character. I was not happy with Gal Gadot being cast, but she did VERY good, I am happy with her WW, and I'm excited for her film. She's classic WW, lasso, sword, shield, flies, fights amazing, Greek background, amazing costume, smart, yeah we have a PROPER WW here, be happy and excited! Sure we only see her fight in the end, but really it was worth it.Lex Luthor: Casting Jesse was HUGE mistake, bad Lex Luthor. However, Lex's evil plans in the movie is classic Lex, his dialogs are pretty Lex Luthor, its just Jesse's take and personality on the character is a big miss, its literally a spoiled brat billionaire over a charming evil genius. To sum it up, Lex was written well, the character was prepare, they just cast the wrong guy to play him. All and all, good movie, but there are problems with it; some can be over looked, some cannot be at all, mainly the Batman and Lex Luthor part. If you liked 'Man of Steel' you may enjoy this movie. Don't go in expecting the greatest of all greatest ever, but you will be happy with the movie. Story was weak, but I'm looking at this as a set up movie, the future DC movies will probably be good.",8,2,6,25 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Good for non Star Wars fans, and a treat for Star Wars fans
","NO SPOILERS! It does feel like you are watching the original trilogy again, it really does, but with a modern twist, but do not worry, the modern twist is good. The new cast are great, excellent chemistry, and characters. Finn is great, Rey is awesome, Poe is cool, BB8 is adorable, Kylo Ren is public enemy #1, Maz is fun, the new characters are all good, and they work well together. Keep in mind, the new cast does take more screen time than the old cast.The old cast, well its nostalgia for us classic fans and its really fun for the new fans. Han is witty, cocky, and the same. Chewy is still the Wookie we all love, Leia continues to show her strength, C3PO is quirky and loving, R2 also, Luke.... I said no spoilers hahaha. They definitely played it safe for the writing of this film, the old fans will recognize it very easily. Its an old formula but it worked. I guess they did it that way to avoid any mishaps from the not so acclaimed prequel trilogy, and yes they avoided it, but to be honest, even though its an old formula which works, it can be a bit of a let down to the classic fans, but since this film is FULL of references from the original trilogy, it certainly serves as a treat. The studio are setting up the Star Wars world again. The Force Awakens WILL remind us of the previous films, so this means Episode VIII should be a completely different movie, after all, they can't be repetitive in all three films of the new trilogy. The film only looks and feels familiar because the studio are just reintroducing us to the Star Wars universe again, and they succeeded in that, this is a good way to go back to Star Wars. The next two episodes will be unique.What also makes this film good, now Star Wars always has its goofy and comedic moments. In the original its the right amount, prequel OVER done and stopped being funny, here right amount once more which is fantastic. The tone here is darker than the original. The lightsaber duel, I was let down, was expecting much better ones. The battle scenes, pretty good, although the space battle also lacked, and we love our space battles, along with a great lightsaber duel, it is one the unique parts of Star Wars. Do not be alarmed that in the beginning, it sort of does feel like it a different Star Wars film, but slowly the feel of the original trilogy does come back, you will obviously know when that moment arrives in the film. Ultimately, The Force Awakens lacked a bit, but it was a great reintroduction to the series. The Empire Strikes Back, and A New Hope are still the top films of the series. Return of the Jedi comes below those two, so The Force Awakens comes below Return Of the Jedi, which is fine because lets face it.... nothing will ever top the original films, but this new trilogy will be good, and The Force Awakens is a fine and good start to it. In technical film making terms, editing, special and visual effects, the couple of CGI, production, and set designs are all top. John William's music is the same and good as ever. Enjoy the movie, anyone can watch, family friendly, you'll have a great time. May The Force Be With You.NOTE: If you never saw Star Wars and you're interested in checking it out, then please watch it either in Release Order (4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3) or Machete order (4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6), just please DO NOT watch it in Chronological Order (1, 2, 3, 4, ,5 ,6)",6,5,21,17 December 2015
