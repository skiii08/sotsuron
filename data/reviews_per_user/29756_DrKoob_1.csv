Casablanca," The best film of all time
","I know, I know, Citizen Kane. But there are some of us who have to like the characters and the story too. So my vote for the greatest film of all time is Casablanca. The characters are unforgettable. The cast is beyond belief. Who would believe that these folks were getting script changes right up to shooting time. If you have never seen this, I highly recommend the DVD version. The black and white tones are incredible compared to what you see on broadcast or cable TV.",10,1,1,7 April 2000
