Changeling," Wineville Chicken Coop Murders
","I have been reading up about the truth behind this film. Bloody hell its far more disturbing than the film. Child abduction, murder of the child, serial child killers, rapist, child killers. The list goes on. But what angers me is the corruption within the LAPD. my god have they angered me. and the treatment Mrs Collins received at the mental hospital. my heart goes out to her and her son who was brutally murdered. The failure and blaming on the mother makes u angry so much. Stupid police in America Its just so messed up like any other police around the world. Things like these cases is still happening to this day, Madeline McCann.",10,1,2,10 January 2014
