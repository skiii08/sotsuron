The Ring," good
","This was a good movie. I liked how it took you step by step to figure out what was going on. If you like to keep your 11 year old little sister up all night terrified, this is the movie you should show her. It scared me too i screamed holy s*** in the theater.",Null,0,0,26 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," excellent
",This was the best out of all the Star wars movies! It was a million times better then episode one and i'm sure the 3rd one will be even more great! Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen had a great chemestry together.,Null,1,1,30 December 2002
