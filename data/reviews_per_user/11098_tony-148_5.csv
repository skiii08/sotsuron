Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," it's all about the timing
","With all of the discussion of the political incorrectness of this movie, one of the best things about it is being overlooked, the timing.Like Spinal Tap, producers have mastered delivering the joke and cutting immediately to the next establishing shot which makes the laugh even bigger.Also the biggest laugh of the film came not from some anti-semitic, racist, sexist or similar offensive comment but from when a saddened Borat drops his bag and you hear a muffled chicken cluck. The audience had forgotten about the chicken in Borat's bag at that point. Great timing.Yes I know I'm over analyzing this dumb movie but it's that good. Comedies are going to be measured up against this one for a long time.",9,1,6,6 November 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," An interesting remake of Independence Day
","Take out the aliens, replace them with weather.  Take out the multiple massive motherships threatening major cities around the world, replace them with multiple massive storms.  Keep the brainy yet misunderstood main character who's can explain what's going on and what's about to happen but nobody will listen.  Destroy New York and Los Angeles, be sure to wreck only well known buildings.  Keep the totally unrelated romantic subplot.Take the arduous trek from New York to Washington, DC and flip it. Keep the product placement.  Keep the technology, with lots and lots of  monitors. Keep the oval office set, the worst one you can find in Hollywood.  And most importantly, the first rule of summer blockbusters, never kill the dog.Environmentalists hope that this film will at least get people talking about global warming.  Perhaps it will educate a little about the interconnected nature of global climate and the importance of balance.  The in your face nature of any special effects laden summer blockbuster disconnects the audience so much from any message that might be gained that it's effect is lost.   This isn't a film, it's a video game.",6,0,0,31 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Okay, but far from incredible
","I'm not a Fantasy fan and I find the author's work good but I dont share the same ferver that other reviewers do.  That being said, I find this movie okay, but not the life changing experience that others have gushed about.The 2 biggest problems with this film are the cinematography and the length.
length: This would have been so much more of a film had about 60 minutes been shaved off.  Did the director fear the nitpicking fans so much that he couldn't bear to trim any more?  Film is a visual medium and as such doesn't require the level of detailed exposition that the book does.  I hope the next film will be a little more even handed but I wont be surprised to see it weigh in at 3:30 or more.cinematography: 2 big problems here, first the lighting.  Dark scense evoke a certain mood that can really help drive the story but like tool at the DP's disposal, too much of a good thing takes away from the overall film.  While it makes sense to have the underground scenes be very dimly lit, the audience shouldn't have to struggle to see the characters for so long.The second big problem is color, or the lack of it.  Once the story leaves the shire, the color is so desaturated that it becomes distracting. Beautiful settings like those of the elves are destroyed by the overuse of this technique.  While this too can evoke a desired mood, it is also too much of a good thing, both in the degree and duration it was used.After the film I stood in the lobby and stared at colorful movie posters just to remind my brain what color looks like.The current #2 rating (and one time #1) rating shows that this movie 75% hype.  At least this time the hype is coming mainly from the audience and not the studios/media.",5,1,2,20 January 2002
Moulin Rouge!," bizarre movie
","Moulin Rouge could have been best movie musical since the heydays of MGM, with it's unparralled sets, incredible theatrical style lighting, and last but not least it's massive musical and dance numbers, but sadly it falls short because all these things come crashing down as it becomes a parody of itself over and over throughout the film.Including contemporary music, costuming and locations, yet reatining the classic story and dialog realy worked for Baz Luhrmann in his version of 'Romeo + Juliet'.  These things drove the story and made it more accessible to a younger audience.Moulin Rouge! didn't need this, the story stood on it's own and didn't need gimics to draw audiences in.  The ridiculous overuse of  contemporary music turned what could be a classic into Vaudville.  Once it's clever, twice it's tollerable, but relying on this 'joke' throughout the entire movie ruins it's entertainment value.  One minute it's story and character development is drawing you in, the next minute a kareoke version of 'Roxanne' is being belted out.",3,0,1,22 December 2001
Event Horizon," one of the worst movies I've ever seen
","I've seen bad movies but never had the feeling of being cheated like I did leaving this movie.Interesting concept, good special effects, horrible acting and an even worse script.You couldn't pay me to sit through this movie again.",1,24,52,15 April 2001
