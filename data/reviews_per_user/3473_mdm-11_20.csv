E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The quintessential fantasy film - a cult classic!
","The sale of 'Reeses Pieces' suddenly surged, 'E.T. phone home!' became the catch-phrase, while children and parents alike pondered the term 'penis breath'.It was the summer of '83, and the world couldn't get enough of 'E.T.', another brainchild of Hollywood's Wunderkind Steven Spielberg, and the biggest blockbuster movie since 'Gone With The Wind'. The time was right for a sci-fi fantasy for kids that would also draw great crowds of 'grown-up kids' to the theaters. The Disney Production was the very first to require a PG-Rating, quite a departure for the previously 100% family-oriented (and G-Rated) Disney Studios. Aside from a few mildly violent scenes and 'no-no-vocabulary', there was nothing to keep even the youngest of viewers away from this cinematic delight.The story of a boy who first hides, then protects 'E.T.', an adorable 3 ft. tall alien from outer space who was left on Planet Earth by accident, is a feast of laughs and touching moments, throughout the nearly 2 hours of running time. Your eyes will be misty by the time everything is worked out in the end. Steven Spielberg pioneered the inclusion of 'sponsor messages' in video versions of films, enabling him to drop the excessive purchase price (up to this time around $100.00 per VHS tape!) to an affordable level ($29.95). As copies of the 'E.T.' videos flew off the shelves (setting a sales record that was not to be broken until Disney's 'Lion King'), other studios followed suit, and eventually video versions of theatre releases cost less than 2 meals at McDonald's. 'E.T.' was the pioneer for many great films to come. To me, there never will be another film quite like this one. I give it my highest recommendation!",Null,0,1,12 October 2004
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The Python Project to top!
","The Monty Python Gang may never out-do this one. 'Life of Brian' certainly is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen (and I've seen a few). While Monty Python & The Holy Grail poked fun at the dark ages, this movie makes fun of the Roman Empire and Jesus, and absolutely nothing is left out! From the Sermon on the Mount to Roman names, Jewish division, crucifixion, you name it, it's included! Unless the viewer is offended or considers the jokes 'blasphemous', laughs are guaranteed! As an added bonus, the DVD version includes the original theatrical trailer. This one is a big winner.",9,1,5,28 May 2005
Mulan," More Disney Magic -- Historically Accurate Legend
","There are too few 'girl' heroes in stories. According to Chinese legend, Mulan, the only child of an aging soldier, disguised herself as a male to take her sickly father's place fighting evil invaders. While in the disguise of a loyal soldier to the emperor, Mulan falls in love with her commander, who does not suspect the deception. When Mulan saves the entire fighting forces, what she managed to hide up to that point is discovered: She is a girl masquerading as a man. Rather than punish Mulan with death, the commander sends her away (presumably to die). In the end Mulan is honored with a medal for bravery by the Emperor himself. Although 'only' a female, she had saved the entire empire from certain doom.The finest moment is the scene where her father says 'I am proud to call you daughter'. Legend or history, this is a fine example of telling a story centering around a girl, rather than the countless tales celebrating boys as heroes. Like so many other recent animated Disney features, this is yet another gem in the treasure chest of Walt Disney Studios.",8,61,73,1 June 2005
L.A. Confidential," Off the record, on the Q.T. and hush hush! -- Delicious!
","L.A. Confidential has all the ingredients of a Modern Classic. The story of wide spread corruption in the LAPD of the late 1950s keeps the viewer spellbound through many twists and turns, delivering a big surprise ending, the total pay-off! Several (then) unknowns lead a stellar cast of actors, among them a pre-Gladiator Russel Crowe. Kim Basinger delivers the goods as the gangster-moll-going-straight Veronica Lake look-alike.This VHS version of the film contains a BONUS at the end. About 20 minutes of behind-the-scenes and commentaries by the director, screen-writers, actors add an impressive 'finishing touch', tying up any loose ends.This is a rare treat of a movie! Well deserved Best Picture Oscar nominee. Basinger WON her Oscar for a fine performance. Those who like the old-time cop movies will LOVE this one!",9,1,3,27 May 2005
Children of Heaven," Life's magic is in the simple things
","The simple story of a family's struggles with poverty is told through the eyes of children. A boy misplaces the worn out shoes of his little sister, and thus is forced to share his own pair of sneakers with her, taking turns attending school. Afraid to tell their parents, the siblings continue the deception for days.The father is hard working, yet poorly paid, while the mother appears repeatedly disabled by a slip disc condition. It is heart breaking to hear the parents discuss their money problems, mainly the unpaid rent and other bills. When the wife suggests an operation to put an end to her constant back pains, the husband insists that the dangers of permanent damage would be too risky, better to put up with occasional attacks. The viewer can recognize the true issue of money.There are few, but very sincere expressions of love. To see the boy's face light up when his father praises his abilities is beautiful. When the mother expresses how proud she is of the children for helping her at home, the little ones beam with happiness. There are also examples of charity and generosity, neighborly gestures of kindness, that are rare in most cultures, especially in lands of plenty. The final minutes of the film are both deeply touching and hopeful. The scene ends in the little boy's total hopelessness, while the viewer knows about the eminent ray of joy to enter the children's life.For people of other cultural background it is very pleasant to see how children here are compelled to unquestioned obedience towards authority figures, asking permission to speak by raising their finger, never daring to interrupt or be disrespectful. School work is seen as an honor, and talent as a gift. Despite obvious economic disadvantages, the absence of rebellious youth in this culturally different society is unknown to Westerners, and it is certainly refreshing. Winning many International Awards, 'Children Of Heaven' was also the first ever entry from Iran to be nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar. Pure and innocent, a true example of the triumph of the human spirit. I can highly recommend this film, especially to children unaccustomed to extreme poverty. Even without the ability to keep up with fast paced subtitles, one can appreciate the magic of this cinema gem!",9,1,1,4 October 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," America goes on after WWII -- Uplifting drama
","This film tells the stories of several couples coping with Post-WWII life. Through many moving accounts the audience learns how the War has changed people, while their human spirit went on to triumph.My favorite scene is where a young service man, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms up to the elbow) is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him. His girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn't be able to do, but that they would be fine together. Moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his fianc√©e in tears.The scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When he is initially refused as a 'high risk', a higher ranking bank official takes over saying 'You fought for our country and kept us safe--that's good enough for me. Your loan is approved!' 'The Best Years of Our Lives' won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living, even with a severe handicap. This film is a joy to watch over and over again. A true classic! Highly recommended!",10,1,2,22 May 2005
Barry Lyndon," Brilliant photography/costumes make long story delightful
","Most fans of the director agree that 'Barry Lyndon' is a departure from other Stanley Kubrick films, yet the master's signature can be seen throughout this brilliantly photographed gem. Admittedly long, 'Barry Lyndon' is never boring. Many of the scenes are drawn out not by action or dialog, but by the consumption of the breathtakingly beautiful countryside, appearing at times 'computer-enhanced', as the human eye is not accustomed to so much visual delight.The story of a young Irishman (played by a dashing Ryan O'Neil) of middle class standing, who has aspirations to 'marry well'. Handsome and well-spoken, the young Barry is still self-absorbed and in many ways stubborn and determined. Through trickery and scheming, he marries a rich Noblewoman (portrayed by Marisa Berensen), but quickly shows his true colors as shameless playboy. Abusive to his step-son, even plotting to assure his wife's fortune to be waved into his own pockets, Barry eventually alienates himself from all acquaintances. The final 'fate' with which he meets (after 3 hours of viewing) is sure to deliver 'satisfaction' to the audience.Kubrick's script received a nomination, but not the actual Oscar. Statuettes did go to the outstanding Cinematography, Costume Design, Set Design and Art Direction. Look for a deliciously fitting Epilogue in the final frame! Among the period dramas of old King George's Day, Barry Lyndon has a special place.",9,2,4,14 August 2006
The Exorcist," Be sure to bring your 'Depends'!
","During its original theater run, this film caused thousands of viewers to 'escape' from the theater, convinced that the action on the screen was not a fantasy, but real. This is indeed 'The Scariest Movie Of All Time'; everything people say about this film is true. It's terrifying, dramatic, compelling, edge of your seat entertainment. More than 30 years have passed, while the plot hasn't aged a day; it certainly still scares the proverbial 'living daylights' out of a new generation of film buffs.Linda Blair's electrifying and critically acclaimed performance as the possessed pre-teen catapulted the young actress to instant (if short-lived) world stardom. 'The Exorcist' became one of the most successful films in the US as well as Internationally. If thrillers are your bag, you are going to like this picture!",9,1,2,1 June 2005
The Usual Suspects," They don't get any better than this!
","This film marks a return to the 'classic thriller' genre, with fast paced action, superb acting, plenty of 'red herrings' and a total pay-off at the end.Kevin Spacey is great as the dumb-but-loyal small time criminal 'gimp', one of several 'usual suspects' the NYPD had been 'eyeing' in connection with a puzzling shoot-out on deck of a ship believed to have contained a multi-million dollar cargo of cocaine. The story twists and turns, leading the viewer into every possible wrong direction first, until eventually concluding with a WHAMMY!I place this thriller right up there with 'Double Jeopardy' and 'Face-Off', and of course 'American Beauty', as one of the absolute best films of the past decade in its genre.",10,0,2,20 May 2005
Dirty Dancing," The Dance knows no Class-Distinctions, it's for Everyone!
","This film has much more to offer than what the title suggests. It is a social commentary about early 1960s middle class 'snobs' who would visit resorts run by shrewd business men, where all of the 'help' is there to entertain and amuse the spoiled brats from the city.Johnny (very credibly played by Patrick Swayzee) is the 20-something veteran to this 'scene', the leader of a pack of singers & dancers at this 'posh' resort. Enter another batch of 'money folk', eager to have fun for a Summer Holiday. Everything would be as usual, only this year there are complications. The seemingly spoiled daughter of a Jewish doctor 'Baby' (played by the newly discovered Jennifer Gray who was introduced the previous year in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off') and Johnny seem to be more than 'dance partners'. Unaware of the difficulties a relationship 'between 2 different social classes' would bring, the couple continue seeing each other. There are a few 'formula' situations built in to give a hint of a story line. The incredible sound track includes many big hits from the 60s (most noteworthy 'Hey! Baby' by Bruce Channel and 'Love Is Strange' by Mickey & Sylvia), as well as original music sung by Patrick Swayzee ('She's Like The Wind') and the Oscar Winner by Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes ('I've Had The Time Of My Life').This was a surprise hit (like 'La Bamba' was the year before), but all of the praise was justified. Although not quite 5-star material, I find this film very entertaining, especially due to its timeless message. No matter what, we will always have the memories of fantastic dancing!",Null,0,1,10 October 2004
1941," Animal House Goes To War -- Big Budget Comedy Noir
","Do not forget to remember that this is supposed to be SATIRE, otherwise you may find '1941' to be a rather crude, over-extended joke. With US military personnel more interested in 'gettin' some' than in defending America, it becomes clear immediately that priorities are considerably confused. Two of the lead characters in particular seem hormone-raged and obsessed with 'scoring'.Considered by many an overlooked Steven Spielberg Classic, I agree only with the technical aspects. Visually and acoustically stunning, the macabre handling of serious historical subject matter and often repelling actions of bullies make this a less than 'great comedy' for me.Viewing this film on the now-obsolete laser disc format was a visual treat, mainly due to the lavish cinematography and brilliant score. Sadly, I do not intend to view this film a second time. For fans of the original SNL, the roles portrayed by John Belushi, Dan Aycroyd and other not-ready-for-prime-time players is an added bonus. Not enough for me, sorry.",4,0,1,11 September 2005
Good Will Hunting," Discovery of neglected young genius proves true piece of work!
","The story here is simple: A neglected 20 something ghetto kid anonymously solves the 'unsolvable' calculus problem at the university campus where he works as a janitor, then is hounded by intellectual scholars who want to furhter this untapped genius mind. One problem: The kid is a little eccentric, bordering on the severely disturbed, and only one 'shrink' is getting thru to him. Add a little love story and a happy ending an you've got 'Good Will Hunting'. Half-way-through you get a delicious scene, where the hero cuts down a 'bully' in the student cafeteria by going brain-explosion-verbally-ballistic on him! Not even Julia Sugarbaker could touch that one! Otherwise I was not nearly as impressed as cinema audiences and the Oscars Academy were. Once is enough for this one!",Null,1,4,16 October 2004
Empire Records," An Embarrassment to the 'Rock 'n Roll Movie' Genre.
","This film was a major disappointment. Knowing that 2 of the co-stars later appeared in 'That Thing You Do' (one of my favorite Rock & Roll oriented films), gave me false hope that 'Empire Records' would be another Rock & Roll music-driven joy-ride. No such luck.The plot is virtually non-existent, appearing to be made-up-as-they go. The opener has one of the half-dozen co-workers of a CD/record store run off to Atlantic City, determined to quadruple the embezzled daily takings, so the store won't be sold to a ruthless chain. Immediately the story switches to showing how each of the late-teen-ish store workers are 'messed up'.A young shoplifter who is prosecuted, then returns with a gun, is forgiven and offered a job (apparently all in the same day). A side-plot shows a has-been Pop-Idol (with far too much pancake make-up) as a shameless womanizing creep. All ends well, when a Party-A-Thon saves the store. Lots of teen-stuff, with references to inappropriate and dangerous behavior, glamourized and made appealing. This film is a disservice to films of this genre. Teens are not better for watching this poor example of how-to-be-a-success. Harldy any POOR decision has been missed by this teen-angst nightmare. AVOID this film. The small consolation is the VERY GOOD Soft & Hard Rock Sound Track. No other redeeming value. Sorry.",2,1,3,30 September 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Violence - The original human plague
","Today's news reports deliver us images of senseless violence each day. School shootings, child abductions, wars in various parts of the world, evil inflicted on innocent fellow human beings. We have long grown accustomed to this aspect of life, no longer shocked or even surprised at what goes on even in our own neighborhoods. 'A Clockwork Orange', although extreme in its depiction of terror, is actually not that far from the mark of realism. Made in 1971, this was considered a very brutal film for its time. In 2002, I still wonder why this movie is only rated 'R'. It contains a lot of scenes of rape, nudity, graphic violence, and other mayhem that I believe caused it to be banned in several countries. But it has also won praise from many critics and is considered to be a cult classic.Set in near-future England, this film tells the story of Alex. On the surface, Alex (played by twenty-something Malcolm McDowell) is a typical teenage boy who engages in meaningless conversations with his parents, puts on a good show in front his counselor... and does other things to keep up appearances. However, Alex is a gang member who indulges in every sort of impulsive criminal activity possible while listening to Beethoven to psyche himself up.One night, Alex and his gang break into a lady's house. The rest of the gang is outside while Alex struggles with the lady until he eventually kills her. After Alex leaves the house, his gang turns on him and leaves him to fend for himself until the police arrive.Alex is sent to prison. After a while, Alex wants to reform. He has a chance when a new behavioral experiment called the 'Ludovico' treatment is in need of guinea pigs. Alex volunteers. The experiment is a brainwashing method that causes Alex to be sickened by any form of sex or violence. It even causes him to be sickened by Beethoven's music. After Alex is released from prison, several things happen. His family disowns him, his former friends are now police officers that assault him, and the experiment has other side effects than just eliminating his urges. He is no longer able to defend himself when attacked as well.This is not an easy movie to watch with the numerous physically and emotionally violent scenes, but it does make you ask yourself a few things. Is society justified in destroying a predator by creating a victim? Or who needs reform the most: the criminals or the society that continues to punish them after their legitimate sentences have been served? The film is not one that offers any quick or easy answers, yet it shows a perspective of societal problems that is equally timely for 1971 or 2002.Clearly not for 'mixed audiences', this film demands an open mind as well as a worldy view. To look inside of the warped mind of a recreational violent bully and search for the 'human' hidden somewhere requires much forgiveness and a sense of wanting to help rather than seek revenge. An important film, indeed. Sadly, extremely violent and disturbing scenes make this film unsuitable for teens up to age 15 or 16. At a mature age, this film shold be viewed by everyone as a 'Scared Straight' lesson about the role of violence in modern society.",Null,0,1,8 October 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Different Angle of 'Goodwill Hunting' -- Overrated
","Ron Howard's 'Masterpiece'? Hardly. The true story of Nobel Prize winner John Nash, focusing on his long struggle with schizophrenia. Never quite 'fitting in', the young Nash developed not one, but 3 imaginary 'friends' who haunted him far beyond the point when he realized they were hallucinations.With his 'condition' climaxing during the Korean War Era, with the Cold War on everyones mind, Nash was obsessed with the idea of being a government spy whose Mathematical genius and natural talent for 'cracking codes' was invaluable to the CIA. Decades later, the once arrogant graduate student, now an accomplished PhD Professor, is honored by his peers for his enlightening findings in the field of Mathematics, which changed the world of Science forever. Receiving the Nobel Prize in 1994, Nash gives credit for all of his accomplishments to his wife, and cites that true love is greater than any science.The VHS video features an additional documentary of about 20 minutes, looking behind the scenes of making this film. The real John Nash was interviewed, as was his long suffering wife who saved him from self destruction.A remarkable life story, however a less remarkable film. Embellished accounts of facts to assure drama, along with many comments on the treatment of mental patients in the 1950s (still considered the dark ages of mental health), this could easily be condensed into a 60 minute 'NOVA' video at a fraction of the production cost. Best Picture? You're kidding.",5,3,6,28 May 2005
Shrek," Touching love-story -- similar to 'Beauty and the Beast'
","This state-of-the-art animated fantasy film is great family entertainment. The story is quite similar to 'Beauty And The Beast', with a beautiful 'fairy tale ending'. At the very end of the DVD there is a bonus of about 5 minutes of 'Kareoke' fun, featuring samplings of many well known Rock Songs, Oldies, even Motown Classics. I showed the DVD to my class of 4th-graders, who absolutely loved it! My only complaint is the fact that many jokes were included that were either 'over kids heads' or just not quite rated G. Even Eddie Murphy could tone it down for a kids film. The constant blah blah from the donkey character becomes tiresome quickly. Hold the babble water! Aside from these minor blemishes I give 'Shrek' 2 thumbs up!****",8,0,1,20 May 2005
Signs," Unbelievably far-fetched 'drama' - Gibson's worst!
","Using the long exposed crop circles hoax as a back drop, this story offers signs of alien visitors simultaneously terrorising various parts of the world. Focusing on unusual (if not completely incredible) circumstances of one family, we learn of a chain of events culminating in the acceptance of 'everything happens for a reason'. Aside from the extremely slow movement (several scenes are needlessly drawn out, as though to 'stretch' the plot) and the shoe string budget (Mel Gibson is the only major expenditure, as all 6 or 7 others appearing are unknowns), the 'coincidences' presented are just a bit much to swallow. Each of at least 5 major story elements have odds of 10,000 to 1. Add them up, and every family member should have been struck by lightning AND won the State lottery! The 'aliens' are less imaginative than anything ever shown on Star Trek. A skinny person in a green rubber suit, that's how far 21st century sci-fi has come? Embarrassing! The unsatisfactory conclusion leaves only one though: Was this film necessary? What a waste of everyone's time. Do yourselves a favor and find something better to do with an hour and a half of life. Mel Gibson has definitely picked the wrong script this time.",2,3,5,3 October 2004
Rear Window," Bored amateur sleuth witnesses crime across courtyard
","Hitchcock's favorite leading man, Jimmy Stewart, wheelchair bound and bored, does what every guy in this situation would do: He grabs a pair of binoculars and 'explores' the apartment windows across the yard. Of course he eventually gets an eye-full of funny business in one of the windows (someone murdered a woman and then disposed of the body by burrying it in the yard). Love interest Grace Kelly, totally keeping her cool, aides the handicapped amateur sluth in his quest to bring the murderer to justice. Also part of the fun is Thelma Ritter in one of her 6 career Oscar-nominated performances. This 'thriller' is certainly predictable, limping by on a bit of nail-biting tension and several 'almost caught by the bad guy' scenes. Otherwise it's just not up to Hitchcock's usual best. To anyone just discovering The Master of Mahem, I can highly recommend 'Frenzy', 'The 39 Steps' and the dark comedy 'The Trouble With Harry', assuming that everyone starts (and has already seen) 'Psycho'. If you are new to 'Rear Window', there are many better ways to spend 2 hours of your life (that you'll never get back).As a big fan of 'The Master', I find this to be his weakest work. He offers the beautiful, ultra-glamorous Grace Kelly (soon to be Princess of Monacco) and a visibly much older, favorite leading man Jimmy Stewart, further perpetuating the chronic 'older man, gorgeous young woman' love story that endured Barrymore/Garbo, Bogey/Bacall, Gable/Monroe and the likes. What is (and ever was) wrong with a 50 year old man dating a woman his own age? Stop the 'Daddy' stuff, it's no longer cute.",6,3,12,10 October 2004
The Wedding Singer," 1980s Flashback to a charming romantic comedy
","Adam Sandler (a Wedding Singer) and Drew Barrymore (a waitress) first meet at someone else's wedding. They soon meet again, when Barrymore is making plans for her own wedding (to a total jerk), even though deep inside she feels that she's 'settling' for security without true love. Meanwhile Sandler finds out about the two-timing bozo, when the groom-to-be brags about his adventures with every sexy girl that comes along. Secretly in love with Barrymore, Sandler eventually sweeps her off her feet.Look for a great cameo appearance by Billy Idol. The air plane 'proposal' is a sweet highlight, you'll love it! The soundtrack (all hits of the mid 80s) is a nice touch, too. From 'Love Stinks' to '99 Luftballoons' it's all there. -- This is my favorite Adam Sandler movie. Treat yourself to a bag-a-laughs and a few mushy moments, this is top entertainment!",9,43,54,13 October 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Depression Era South Nightmare
","Althoug many details are extremely far fetched, this story of rural Mississippi ca. 1935 has many realistic elements reminding of the 'dark side' of life 'down South' in the years prior to WWII. George Clooney is convincing as the street-wise and 'worldly' self-appointed leader of a 3-man team escaping from a chain gang. The trio encounter a series of situations, including a recording-session at a make-shift studio owned by a blind radio station DJ, encounters with a bank robber, a shifty crook posing as Bible salesman, and several near-lynchings. Inbetween scenes we see a rivalry between the incumbent Governor and his radical challenger.Several scenes are powerful testimony to the social injustices of the day. A secret nightly KKK rally is awe-inspiring. To see how an innocent man was to be 'offered up' due to nothing other than his skin color is a shocking thing to view. Another vivid reminder of 'how things used to be' is the sadistic prison official, who has a keen interest in 'law enforcement' (namely lynchings).Several critical moments turned out OK for our heroes, right down to the 'act of God' towards the end, which gave a satisfying conclusion to the story. I appreciated the many historically correct details, yet the entire story was quite unlikely (as in 'The Green Mile'). It's like getting struck by lightning AND winning the State Lottery both on the same day (and living to enjoy the fortune!).",7,0,0,21 May 2005
