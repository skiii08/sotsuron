The Lobster," Another gem from the great Greek filmmaker
","This movie is a master class in weird but meaningful film making. Want something fresh and original, weird but highly watchable. Then this is a movie for you.",9,5,9,20 July 2018
Come and See," A masterpiece, a must see war movie
","This movie has had to restrain itself from showing the true level of German atrocities in Belarus and Russia, in order not to be distracting. But what is shown is enough, and the movie is beautifully done. The director did not make any more movies because he said everything he wanted to say.This is war movie like no other. If you want to understand what happened, this is a must see. There are so many movies about Holocaust, but the level of suffering on the Eastern front is unfortunately for political reasons severely underplayed in the West. 20 million Russian and Soviet civilians died from the Nazi hand. The decency with which this movie tells the truth about the war is really worthy of greatest respect. There is not a second that is fake in this movie, it is pure, distilled soul of the Soviet people and their struggle against Hitler. If you want substance, look no further. There has been no other movie like this.",10,13,16,27 June 2018
Catch Me If You Can," Great fun based on a real story
","This is one intriguing movie about a very fascinating real life sociopath, that, fittingly, works for the feds nowadays. Movie is fast paced, grips your attention from start to finish, Leonardo Di Caprio almost redeems himself for Titanic, in any case he is brilliant here. The Spielberg shows his talents too. There is also a beautiful opening credits animation as an icing on the cinematic cake.",10,5,7,7 January 2019
Fight Club," This movie is overrated
","The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which 'borrows' ideas from Dostoevsky's 'The Double' and puts some 'Thus spoke Zarathustra' along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit.",7,5,11,21 July 2018
Train to Busan," Powerful zombie movie with a heart
","South Korean cinema is so good. This movie is part 28 days later, part Snowpiercer and another part The Cassandra crossing. But it still manages to be very original. The morality tale is strong, and we see a transformation of corporate self centered father into a self sacrificing hero. The movie disproves his early maxim that everyone should look for themselves in no uncertain terms. The selfish coward corporate train manager and his refusal to help others is given its due. And in the end, humanity wins in the perfect if hopeful ending. Movie is fun, fresh and still manages to be a good zombie/outbreak movie showing end of the world of sorts, in a way much higher budget Hollywood crapies can only dream to achieve. Kudos, South Korea!",9,20,34,26 August 2018
12 Monkeys," Surprisingly deep and on point
","This is one of the best dystopian movies ever made. But it also has another perspective, which is exploring the nature of reality. It toys with the viewer in a way that is really justified by plot. The lead actors both show the range of their skills here, in this more art than action effort. The movie has aged well. In similar class as Blade Runner, this is intelligent sci-fi at its best. Wholeheartedly recommended!",10,3,4,29 August 2019
The Babadook," Powerful Australian movie
","This movie is a slightly pretentious, but powerful and original movie about guilt ridden mother and some metaphorical horrors, that ring only too true. Good cinematography, competent acting, original story, nice concept. A bit contrived and pretentious, but well worth a watch.",8,9,16,20 July 2018
The Secret in Their Eyes," Good movie
","This is a memorable and good movie, proving strength of Argentinian cinema.While the movie is great on so many levels, some details of the plot are not so believable. However, strong delivery makes this not so important. It is atmospheric peace, that shows you some Argentinian culture and problems. However, it is also a powerful examination of justice in a dysfunctional system, has many memorable moments as a great movie would. So it can be forgiven its imperfections. By any means it is a refreshing and original movie, somewhat subtle which is what is the main advantage of such films over Hollywood industrial product.",8,6,7,6 July 2018
The Fifth Element," A decent, fun sci-fi action flick
","This movie is a somewhat forgettable, but fun sci-fi stylized and pleasing action flick, with Bruce Willis at his typical 90-s action star performance and charm, and not to forget the charms of Milla Jovovich as an untameable feminine beast of alien origin. That, and cute, cool (literately fogging with frost) flying cars and some state of the day special effects. In short, if you want some light sci-fi action fun from the 90-s, this is an OK movie for you.",7,3,5,29 August 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Some humor and some satire, but uneven
","This Taika Waititi take on superhero genre is original and feels different, but he does not quite feel comfortable in this sort of movies. The fake promotional interviews felt better as that was the medium his wacky humor could fit better.Overall, there are quite a few amusing bits, and the movie does not take itself too seriously. Some biting satire is chimed in, my personal favorite being about 'prisoners with jobs'.",7,2,5,12 October 2019
Match Point," A very personal Woody Allen film
","Woody Allen has made a very similar movie in the past, Crimes and Misdemeanors. Both movies are essentially this author's take on Dostoevsky and his 'Crime and punishment', and might be called 'Crime and no punishment' and contain a nearly identical pondering on the nature of conscience and how easy it is in fact to live with murder, as many people in the west, especially in the upper echelons of society, indeed do, both figuratively and, in many cases, literally, weather it is in the world of politics, military aggressions (the word 'collateral damage' comes in this movie in the end spoken by one of the victims) or ordinary life, with extreme western hypocrisy as a great 'resource' to ease the way. The similarities of the two movies (almost the same murder situation, and the same result, similar motives), and the director's penchant for autobiographical elements as inspiration, makes one wonder what aspects of his shady past gave rise to this story redone like this again and again. This movie follows more closely 'Crime and punishment' and there is even an old (but being he is anti-Dostoevsky, a poor one) lady that gets offed like a rat in a peanut butter trap.The characters in this story involve some rich inbred British people, an Irish protagonist (fittingly), and a femme fatale in its American version (Scarlet 'Lucy' Johansson), a failed actress but worth every cent in other, less reputable, domains, according to her own words. Faithful to the stereotypes, Irish turn out to have terroristic inclinations (movie was sponsored by BBC after all), American is 'innocent' and 'likable', British are boring, and there is even a Scottish detective (of Scotland Yard?!) who figures it all out, but to no avail, because blind luck was on the side of happiness of the elite British cream (who had been joined by another worthy member set in their standards of 'morality').This, at last, is a new element to the story. Luck. In the beginning, we have a scene where a tennis ball hits the net, and which side - by luck - it ends up on, determines outcome of the game. Very similar scene in the end in turn also determines the final outcome, i.e. 'happy ending' which is in fact a more realistic version of most 'happy endings' and 'missions accomplished' in the culture that did not bring us Dostoevsky, but did come up with infected blankets and rationalizations, conformism and hypocrisy to make it easier to quell whatever conscience is left in whoever is still not a sociopath. And brought us Woody Allen, with brilliant wit and experiences to match the point.",9,8,10,6 January 2019
Interstellar," Many plot-holes but a solid work of sci-fi overall, with some worthy moments
","First, the good stuff. Black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate, as confirmed last year by real life observations. This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter 'scientist' is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the 'critics'. Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority.",8,3,6,5 November 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," An almost perfect exploration of justice, revenge and redemption, with amusing and extremely witty dialogue
","This is a great movie whose only fault is that dialogue is sometimes too witty for its own good. But this is a deep and touching movie, that speaks the truth and inspires and touches the viewer. Like Blue Ruin, it has a lot to say about justice and injustice and has an ironic steak, but it is a somewhat richer and more interesting movie.Apart from great acting and interesting premise, it has a fun dialogue that sometimes comes across as contrived and unnatural, and that is the only objection to it. But it is great fun, and movie has a lot to say and it does in a way that uses talents of perhaps the best English speaking screenwriter of this age, if you are into darkly humorous tones and intelligent and profoundly true script. The best of the applied Irish literature at work.",9,5,9,19 July 2018
The Thing," A true, classic, cult masterpiece
","Few movies manage to outdo so many things as this one did. Better the first version of the movie, check. Be arguably better than one of the classic cult masterpieces, namely Alien, of the time, that it was originally accused of being a ripoff, check. Be vindicated as a cult masterpiece in time despite of negative reaction from both public and original critics, check. Be inspiration for many movies that followed, but never approached the original, check. Bring novelty on many levels, check. Have innovative special effects that look WAY better, more convincing and frightening than any CGI produced by modern supercomputers and expensive teams of animators decades later, check. Having memorable atmosphere, keen fan base and generally being perfect even in its flaws (that play as a lovely curiosity, like the chess engine), check.In short, there is a good reason this masterpiece is loved. It is, because it has and always had substantive true value. Together with Blade Runner, now remembered as one of the best sci fi movies of last century, but also transcending many genres, this is one heck of a GREAT movie.",10,7,12,10 July 2018
American Psycho," Classic masterpiece
","This movie is a masterpiece, and it is so underrated. So many quotable moments, true perfect cult piece. Violence is measured, much milder than in the book, which is improved on. It shows the true side of Wall Street morality, of all the little Eichmanns that lived and still live in Manhattan. Dark comedy genius, with classic shiny ax scene perfectly in tune with 'Hip to be Square' music, that Weird Al and Huey Lewis parodied in perfect meta homage. This movie works on so many levels, and although it was hated by the corporate elite and their paid hypocrite critics, time has shown that this movie is going to last. This is Wolf of Wall Street on steroids, wrapped in metaphysical, if murderous, clothing.",10,37,45,27 June 2018
Yesterday," Homage to Beatles and perks of plagiarism
","The concept of the movie is nothing short of brilliant, though delivery is solid, but not stellar. Still, it is a good movie, with lots of Beatles music celebrated in a nice way, but the movie is a bit light when tackling issues of plagiarism, cost of fame, corruption of the music industry etc. It can also be inspiring from time to time, showing how a true gift of genius must feel like and how it is, supposedly, validated despite of some misunderstandings and corruption on many levels in modern society. Some lighthearted humor and pretty formulaic love story is there also along the way. The movie is somewhat ruined by casting of one pretty lame SNL actress, who just cannot act and is so over the top disgust ing that she unwittingly parodies the intended music industry parody and undermines the otherwise pretty decent movie. However, music of the boy band from Liverpool saves the day time and again, and shows how true talent and genius looks like, almost by contrast.",8,2,4,28 October 2019
No Country for Old Men," One of the best brothers Coen movies
","If you want a movie about a likable but menacing hero (or perhaps antihero), then this is a movie for you. An effective agent of fate, Javier Bardem's character does not care what you think about his haircut or his ways. What he cares about are rules. But not your rules, he has a set of his own, just like in his world, he has the coolest haircut there is. And he wears it with confidence. The same confidence he executes his tagets, who have it coming. One way or the other, on the flip of a coin. And his ways are memorable, you have to give him that. This angel of death plays some sort of cat and mouse game, but this is not a man, this is a sublime being, and he is magnificent, inspiring awe. Cant say awesome since this word is ruined in the English language, but in 1940s, it would have been the most appropriate way to describe what the actor Bardem delivers. This is a must see movie...",10,8,11,19 July 2018
District 9," A masterpeace
","This movie is so original and nice, that I am not going to take points off for some over the top action sequences that take a bit from its genre and concept cutting nature. Like all sci fi master-peaces, this movie poses quite a few questions, gives us new perspective, that has not been explored enough if at all. And the frightening comments about aliens are even better when you learn that they were genuine, made about the human aliens i.e. refugees. But there is much more going on. This is a must see movie and a defining movie of the 21st century sci fi genre.",10,15,20,20 July 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A fun movie with a lot of Wes Anderson wit
","If you like Wes Anderson, you will love this movie. Witty, entertaining and pleasant, it is a comedy in his unique style, that hits all the tones and notes that make him a unique and original director.",9,5,7,27 June 2018
The Favourite," The most conventional Lanthimos movie
","This movie is great fun. Women, while always lacking in their contributions to science or art or philosophy, were never absent from the realms of power, as queens and female prime ministers, sometimes hysterical, but often extremely cruel, are well known through history. This movie sheds some light on the intrigue and backstabbing dealings on the court of Queen Anne, and shows that when sociopathy is concerned, women have it all over men, and that evil potential has been cultivated on the British isles, to the benefit of the aristocratic and powerful yet de generate, and via the violent abuse of the Indian and countless other imperial and later shrunken UK subjects, since Anne to Victorian age to Margaret the iron witch. A quirky, fun and cynical look into the British court, through the wise Greek eyes. Excellent!",10,3,7,24 March 2019
Get Out," This is an excellent movie
","This movie is pure gold. It has nice twists, works on deeper levels, has some fascinating premises, is acted well, is original. Really, really nice job.It is always nice to see movie with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought. But sometimes the twists are for the twist sake. This is not the case here. Everything makes sense, and in more than one level. The atmosphere of underlying racism is done in a way that makes people from across the world, who did not have contact with USA slavery issues, get good insight. But the movie is so much more than this, and will surprise you, make you think and leave you intellectually and emotionally satisfied. So few movies can do this as competently and decently as this one. This is one smart movie.",9,5,9,27 June 2018
Drive," Violent but stylized flick promoting adultery and Hollywood stereotypes
","Drive is about a couple of thugs in LA, a stuntman turned driveway driver turned brutal murderer, his limping fatherly friend, one unfaithful and confused criminal wife, virtually every one in the movie is in fact mob related and pretty cruel. They live miserable lives, and meet miserable deaths, stabbed in the eye, slashed in the wrists and hands (with artful if disg usting mobster 'compassion'), slaugh tered and left to bleed out, stumped on angrily and repeatedly like a cockroach, heads blasted in minute detail, romantically drowned on the edge of the ocean, all these deaths are seen by the wicked sin-romanticizing director as an opportunity to exercise his cinematic style and hypocritical misandry, and are crafted with love and dedication of a mythical sharkopath. Despite of this gratuitous violence the protagonist thinks of him self as a hero, and that he is a hero wannabe we are reminded by some annoying music through the movie, he even leaves a million dollars behind for no logical reason but don't expect logic when you can have f-reaking-art. Just as director thinks of himself as a great master of style, and not some misanthropic self satisfied Hollywood member that vents his hatred of the world using some over the top film violence that he sells as transgressive, just as the movie was sold by a deeply misleading trailer. He failed at the box office, but his cinematographic trickery nevertheless amount to some pretty amusing shots, that people who think of themselves as f-reaking-art lovers, heroes of their own delusions, but are in fact a much emptier bunch, interpret as beautiful.",7,2,3,24 October 2019
The Lives of Others," A true Gem
","One of the best German movies ever made, the Lives of Others shows one side of communism, but it does so with sincerity and a human touch. Highly recommended.",10,6,7,20 July 2018
Ex Machina," A good movie
","This movie is intelligent, inspiring, original and timely. Unlike the trashy and disappointing Annihilation, this Garland effort is a success. It delivers, if by minimalistic means. Effective and fun, it touches many themes and is well worth your time.",9,11,18,20 July 2018
Paranormal Activity," Overrated
","This is a prime example of marketing over substance. It is a tedious watch of low budget but also low on ideas film making. While Blair Witch Project was innovative both in marketing AND in execution, this remarkably successful flick is proof that marketing can do better when selling such low budget movies than establishment tra sh like Annihilation. It gets some redemption for this extreme low budget approach, but the only thing cult about this movie is how much money it made, or more precisely, how much money studio made buying the rights and then giving the flick to their marketing department. The ending was improved, and it is the single part that stands out a bit, but make no mistake, this is one boring marketing hoax, and the joke is on the unwitting paying viewers.",1,6,8,10 July 2018
Grindhouse," Great trashy&campy fun
","The idea of the movie is to make a homage/parody of B movies and recreate a distilled grind-house experience, with an oversized budget, A-list star cast and by two top directors, resources that none of the trashy genre movies had. It is a work of love and a guilty pleasure to watch, though the first part, Planet Terror, is much more successful and would rate 9+, while the Tarantino entry is somewhat of a miss. The fake trailers, the first of which resulted in an eventual feature - Machete, are great.Planet Terror is the very definition of camp, and its only (slight) flaw is how obvious and in-your-face that campiness actually is. This part is action filled, and works perfectly as great, over-the-top, always hilariously fun, gory cheesecake. The second part is slower and somewhat different in tone, and is perhaps better viewed separately, it has its moments but Planet Terror is the superior part.",8,2,2,11 September 2019
Groundhog Day," Clever film making, showing substance and talents of lead actor
","This is one warm, intelligent movie. It really lives to its reputation, which is overwhelmingly positive. A lot of substance, all understated, some laughs, respects its audience and delivers points cleverly. If you want to be encouraged and shown a positive perspective with almost no pandering, this is a movie to watch.",10,8,9,29 August 2019
Titanic," Great cinematography, even greater hype
","This Hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good. Great visuals, expensive sets, great hype, but ultimately shallow, it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets, but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met. So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces. This moneymaker is neither of the extremes, but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece, but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it, mainly of the technical nature.",4,7,12,20 July 2018
The Witch," This movie is a research project
","This is one great movie, but it is not really a classical horror film with cheap thrills or jump scares. Rather, it is a much more serious exploration of all things related to the witches tale, from the folk stories to the very medieval mindset that gave rise to Salem witch hunts and the consequent atrocities. This is a work of love, and a product of years of very elaborate and tedious research into the historical context and origins of the concept, and the frame of mind of Puritans that made their primitive prejudices possible. The movie also skillfully touches on the related widespread folklore, that gave rise to the stories from brothers Grim to contemporary Disney rendering of the witches universe. But though there are many layers of interpretation of the movie, it is really in essence an exploration of the primitive Puritan imagination, that made supernatural interpretation out of even the most mundane occurrences, let alone the unexpected ones. This is the place filled with ominous witches, where sin is rampant, where Puritan oppression - sexual and otherwise - can find outlet in fantasy, leading to atrocities and abuse of all sorts. And this is the true horror, the truly scary thing about the whole thing. For, the medieval puritan mindset of New England and their folk tales of witches might be things of the past, but bigotry and close minded stupidity and prejudice are alive and well, especially in America. Salem witch trials and executions are long gone, but bigotry still gives rise to savage acts in the name of 'spreading democracy', 'fighting terrorism' or 'communism', and to the unchecked USA atrocities all over the world. The origins of this horrifying, bigoted mindset are well explored in this movie. It is not supernatural elements that are appalling, but the palpable reality of human stupidity and wickedness of the nature of humans and their 'righteousness', that is really the root of truly sublime horror.",9,6,11,7 January 2019
Joker," In your face call for justice that upsets the corrupt elite
","There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a bad faith defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their charade might get uncovered. Joker might be delusional, but it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.
But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.
When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypocrites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.",10,5,9,5 October 2019

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A masterpiece
","The seventies produced some of the most interesting and worthy Hollywood movies. Before the era of blockbusters, and ever increasing dumbing down of the cinema art by the Hollywood power-brokers and greedy moneymakers, there was this short but truly amazing window of time that produced many of the timeless gems. A great portrayal of oppression, this gem should not be overlooked by anyone. Truly recommended.",10,23,26,20 July 2018
Downfall," There is more than just memes
","This ultimate meme generator is one great, seriously made movie. Its authenticity is its best asset, as it shows the last days of the fallen German regime as it was. The downfall is of interest to anyone wanting to learn about history, and history is the best teacher of life. The most famous son of Austria is not portrayed entirely as a monster, which is a plus given the authenticity is the goal. But it is the crumbling empire and the atmosphere of utter despair, as the Ruskies come to deliver some well deserved come uponce and tough justice to the country that get a bit over themselves one time too many. NATo and Americans, take note. This is where arrogance and criminality on world stage has ended in history and not once, but EVERY time. Take a good, fresh look what happened to Germany, and then take a good fresh look in the mirror, and perhaps ponder a bit about fate, before making next mindless meme out of some of the many rants of the favorite son of the German nation of the times. Perspective can change, it might take a few well placed bombs from the ever unforgiving Russians, but you can get there eventually.",9,7,8,20 July 2018
Parasite," Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea
","This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie 'Us' attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell 'like butter' and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.",9,29,48,16 January 2020
Blade Runner," The ultimate sci fi flick, well ahead of its time
","Perhaps the best sci fi movie ever made, this cult classic was underappreciated at its time. This only shows how shortsighted critics and American public can be. This movie is perfect in many ways, is prophetic, well made, and if not the best movie ever made is close to that, certainly in the sci fi genre.",10,7,11,20 July 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Much improved compared to a problematic hteful book
","The movie has a lot of Waititi brilliance, and imaginary Adolf is completely original and inspired. While the book Caging Skies is one htefest of crazed feminist misandry especially in its second half, which Waititi did not even read, he made best out of the source material that did not deserve to be honored by his great talents in fact. Interestingly, the book steals much from the Underground of Kusturica, and other Balkan inspirations are responsible for this little movie gem - from Tito and Me, another take on imaginary dictator friend, to Waititi admitting reading about wars in the Balkans to give the human touch to the story. For atroc ities and other ills, he had a lot of experience with the Brits, and na zi rallies to Beatles music seem like a perfect fit, as does the casting of some pretty ug ly inside and out Brit characters. Some humanity Waititi sees also in Germans, most notably the complex Sam Rockwell character, one of the heroes of the movie. Overall Waititi's faith in humanity shines through and he manages to distance himself from the pretty repugnant source 'book' luckily the first half of which did offer such opportunity with a lot of input from the Jewish-Maori genius.",9,3,11,15 November 2019

The Matrix," A bit overhyped, but with lasting influence
","This movie is one giant plothole based take on some philosophical issues, that has proved to be hugely influential. Quite original for a Hollywood flick, it is often given more credit than it deserves. The giant plot hole is that using people as batteries makes absolutely no sense. Contrived in its core, it however delivers many themes and is a decent movie, and the influence it has ups its rating a bit. But lets not get over ourselves, this is not Terminator or other such gem, not by any stretch. Still, worth a watch.",7,11,20,20 July 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," Excellent, original, fun
","This is one very amusing movie. Not taking itself too seriously, but managing to bring freshness and originality and many many new angles to the vampire genre. It is witty, it looks nice and is wholeheartedly recommended.",9,11,14,10 July 2018
Deadpool," Meta breaking 4th wall, juvenile humor and CGI action, with Iron Putin to save the day
","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.",8,5,9,14 October 2019
Green Book," Very authentic
","This is a nice movie with a very authentic story behind it. Both lives of the genius composer-musician, and his once driver tough-Italian guy, who ended up acting in mafia movies and series from Godfather to Sopranos, together with his son who won 2 Oscars, are very interesting, and the story has its authenticity to stand as its greatest strength. This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human. In the writing since the 80s, it gives 0 fs about the PC hyst eria, and can in fact teach our dear ment ally deficient woke friends what is the true face of disc rimination and how the real life heroes of the 60s, that they would in their stup ididty surely despise, in fact look like.",9,1,2,20 January 2020
Annihilation," Unoriginal
","This is one bad overhyped movie. The analogy to cancer is the only thing that it brings, and that to an extent, but is otherwise totally derivative of much superior classics like The Thing, or Aliens etc. Even the reviews are skewed because of the hype. This thing failed at the box office for a reason. It is neither intelligent, nor innovative, it is far from anything original even its pretensions are stale. This is not going to be a cult classic, there is much more outstanding sci fi out there, this is Hollywood rub ish at its worst. Not worth your time.It is also offensive how it uses science buzzwords, like HOX genes or refraction. Few sci fi movies insult intelligence of the viewers to such an extent, but it is just another proof of failure of its lazy, unimaginative, industrial production like aftertaste or rather, distaste, that is best, and thankfully easily, forgotten. Lucy has more substance - and less pretension, than this.",1,29,58,10 July 2018
Moon," Nice sci fi gem
","This movie, given its minimalist approach, is surprisingly engaging, smart and good. It is one of the gems of sci fi genre of the new century, and I cannot recommend it enough.",10,7,11,20 July 2018
The Social Network," Nice movie about psychopathic facebook founder
","Fast paced and interesting, this movie tries too hard to portray Zuckenberg in a better light than he deserves. He was not a good coder. He was much more exploitative than movie suggest, as his later love affair with CIA and selling personal data of facebook users for nefarious purposes proved. This guy is far less charismatic than portrayed (and he isn't portrayed as particularly charismatic to begin with) and far more calculating, menacing and Machiavelian than described. The only thing the movie did show worse than it was was Zuckenberg incel situation. Zuckenberg was dating a Chinese golddigger/smartdigger/Harvarddigger the whole time and they got married.But despite being more positive towards its subject than they would warrant, the movie manages to capture part of the psychopathic nature of facebook and its founding. Artistic liberties were taken in order to humanize these monsters, to make us care and for plot not to be boring. In that it succeeded, but humanizing monsters like Zuckenberg or Hitttlerr is never a good idea in a movie. However, you at least get an idea about the depths of the cutthrooat depravity that was only confirmed by the fact that facebook abuses the trust of its sheeple all the time, and a movie is fun to watch, and deserves a praise even if it is an idealised/sanitized/overseksed version of the sorry reality this movie is based on, and as a movie is well worth a watch, but keep in mind the reality was much darker and more boring at the same time.",9,6,8,25 July 2018
The Godfather," It is good
","This movie is often considered the best ever. And it lives to the hype, everyone should see this movie at some point. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic.",10,9,13,20 July 2018
