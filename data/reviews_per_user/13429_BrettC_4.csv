Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Bores : The Phantom Movie
","Okay -- the effects were great and seamless, there was a cast of great actors, a great score, and an awesome marketing campaign.  So what happened? No plot, no story, no human interest at all!  I was bored and not engaged by anything other than the pretty pictures.  I did not cheer, I did not fear for anyone's safety, I did not care.  JAR JAR sounded worse than a teletubby, this was Star Wars brought to you by Barney.  Cute and harmless! Give me the old story about a simple farmboy, a sassy princess, a wisecracking smuggler and his dog!  And most of all -- don't ruin my dreams about the best villain ever created -- Darth Vader.  I don't want to know that he was a slave to a flying warthog, that he skipped around shouting 'yippee!', or that he saved the day by accident.  I also don't want to know that the FORCE is a bunch of midichlorans in your cells, that takes all the fun out of it.  Some stories are better left untold.  The real PHANTOM MENACE is George Lucas.  He has lost sight of what made the movies great in the first place -- the spunk and plunk of the humans and the humans in robot costumes.  So you can make a 20 story fish eat a 40 story fish?  So you can make podracers travel at 300 mph before our eyes?  But can you make us care?  I did not care about anybody, and I can wait 20 years for the next installment.  Am I a killjoy?  I don't think the critics were HARD ENOUGH on this the most soulless movie since...well, I can't think of one.  And wrapped in such a handsome package to boot.  Amidala says 'Space is cold.'  Amen sister!",1,2,4,22 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park is Sweet Revenge Against the MPAA
","South Park the tv series has seemed to run out of steam -- the popularity and the ratings have dipped, and people seem to be saying that they have had enough.  Then along comes this movie, and suddenly I am in love with the gang all over again.  The movie surpassed any expectations I had, and gave me something to think about (surprise).  Very funny, very fast, and worth the price of admission.  They look great on the big screen, and honestly you don't have to check your brain at the door.  In fact if you look hard you can catch spoofs of the musical Les Mis, and more social criticism and parody than you could dream of putting into a movie. An A+, and a wonderful pinnacle to the South Park legend.",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Millennium? What is that about?
","Okay, I loved the movie!  It was wonderful and unique, an absolute stunner. But two times Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane refers to the millennium as if 1799 into 1800 was a millennium year.  It was just a turn of the century, no?  Anybody else bothered by this?",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Spacey Glittery Gay and Fun
","I loved VELVET GOLDMINE just because the movie was so well-designed.  The plot is a little bit thin, and sure they ripped off a lot of David Bowie's life without being a film biography, but it is so much fun that I am willing to ignore that.  The gay-theme of the movie is heavy-handed, and if that makes you uncomfortable maybe you should stay away.  But there is nothing graphic, and really everything is sacrificed to take you down a sequined trail that shows how rock and theatre merged from the hideous folk-singers of the 60s to the androgynous butterflies of GLAM.  I love the music and the images.  Let yourself get lost in that, and you'll enjoy this movie on a level that few films can capture you on.",10,1,1,9 April 1999
