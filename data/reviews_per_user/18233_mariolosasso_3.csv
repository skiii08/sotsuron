The King's Speech," F f f f fantastic!
","Yeah I know this one is late. But when you have young kids, you have to pick and chose your battles. Add in the astronomical cost of movies and you find yourself letting 'The Kings Speech' work its way into your Netflix que. That says nothing of the quality of the film. Its just that when you see maybe 6 movies a year, you should spend those dollars on films that need to be seen on the big screen. Films like the previous 2. But lets not confuse the issue here, they are not in the same league. Your lucky if you catch 3 great movies a year (a number that is growing smaller and smaller by the year). But 'The Kings Speech' is that great movie. A subject I knew very little about fleshed out in a beautiful narrative with a cast that acts the hell out of it. And that is how you end up winning Best Picture. Collin Firth was fantastic, tugging at your heartstrings one moment and than setting you off in a rage the next. Geoffrey Rush paces him turning in a performance that makes this acting thing look easy. The biggest surpass was Helena Bonham Carter who steals every scene she is in. I am sure you are sick of hearing the praise this movie is slathered in. Everyone knows its great. If you haven't seen it yet, you will go in EXPECTING great. And I don't think you will be disappointed. Its a truly good movie. It makes you appreciate what can be done when you have a great story and great actors. Its something we can only hope to see more of.",9,1,2,9 June 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Very Solid Movie
","Memorial Day Weekend is usually when the Summer of Blockbusters truly kicks off. Recently the 'summer' calendar has been bleeding towards easter, but Pirates marks this years first true mega movie event. The reviews have not been kind to the Disney franchise, nor was I too fond of the previous instalment. I was looking forward to a 'reboot' with a few new characters, plots, adventures and an overall lack of the painful-to-watch Bloom-Knightly combo. After all, this entire franchise is built upon Johnny Depp and his portrayal of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow. My internal Hype-O-Meter had been inching towards insane from the moment I found out Ian McShane (of the fabulous Deadwood) would be portraying the dread pirate Blackbeard. Pair him with the terminally underrated Geofry Rush returning as Captain Barbosa, and you had me at 'Argh!'. 2 hours and some minutes later I left the theater happy and entertained. A 4th installment had potential to feel played out, and that happened in a few small spots, but overall, it was a fresh take on a great set of characters. Gone was the CGI hilarity of 'Worlds End'. In its place was the character development, enthralling action and witty banter we have yearned for since 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'. I can honestly 'On Stranger Tides' is my second favorite of the series. Can it maintain this pace for the entire second trilogy? I doubt it. But it left me wanting more. I was less than enthralled with Penelope Cruz' character, but there was no where to go but up from the tiresome 'Elizabeth' portrayed by the vapid Knightly in all previous versions. We will discus my active hatred for 3D later, but ugly glasses aside, this movie is well worth the price of admission. It lives up to everything you would expect in a summer movie.",8,0,0,9 June 2011
Thor," How do you say 'Meh' in Asgardian?
","Great Odins RavenÂ… where to begin. I like comics. I like superheroes. While I consider myself more of a DC guy (especially Green Lantern and Superman), I have loved every installment as Marvel builds towards next summer's 'The Avengers' (yes, I even loved 'The Hulk'). But Thor was just flat. I had doubts from the beginning. How was a mythical Viking God supposed to fit in with the universe that gave us Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark? The answer? Not very well actually. Thor was riddled with Oscar winners, but it could not escape the average narrative. The costume looked much better than I expected, but the rest of Asgard felt like a soulless video game back drop. The CGI was so over the top that it became distracting (and actually made me begin to worry about The Green Lantern). Chris Hemsworth was very solid playing the lead. But the movies biggest flaws were with Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. Now you would expect 2 such great actors to knock these type of rolls out of the park. Instead, both struggled to maintain competence. Hopkins gave a mail- it-in performance on par with Jack Nickolson in the Departed. Every time he was on screen I found myself begging for it to end. Portman acquitted herself slightly better. i would say she was on par with Kirstin Dunst and her Mary Jane Watson chops from Spiderman. Obviously thats still pretty terrible. Sometimes a character just doesn't translate to film. I think Thor is that character. Cinema has struggled with the portrayal of these God-Like comic characters (see: Superman, All of them), for some reason no one has perfected a way to ground them to a reality based environment. Thor is not a character that lacks nuance. But his abilities do. This is literally a God who crushes all with his hammer. It just didn't work. I am hopeful that a supporting roll in 'The Avengers' will work well, but as a full length feature I will have to pass.",5,1,4,9 June 2011
