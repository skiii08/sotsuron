Vertigo," Curious
","I watched this film in Professor Fitzsimons's class. At first, the title of 'Vertigo' gave me the impression of sickness. I thought that this was the medical film, but actually this is the story of a mysterious incident. I can't keep up with this story, which is difficult without the professor's explanations. Especially, in the first half, I can't get how the story goes on, so it is vague for me and I am confused every time scenes change. However, later, I can know why I can't understand the story. It is because the first half drops some advance hints. My understanding can be more deep if I watch this film again. Certainly, it is difficult, but it raises my curiosity. The more the story goes on, the more interested I am in what is going to happen next or in the end. I like this story that has a surprise ending. Also, I like some expressions without any dialogs. For example, using kuleshov effect cleverly helps me realize what happens. Also the volume of back ground music shows increasing emotion, feeling and love between characters such as Scottie and Madeline(Judy).",Null,0,1,13 July 2016
Enchanted," Interesting
","Disney Animation perfectly protects children's dream. For example, Disney Animation prohibits voice actors and actresses to speak as the character with showing their face. Disney completely keeps such a secret. However, in this film, the forbidden rule is broken. Characters going back and forth between a live action and an animation. It is surprising, interesting and a great idea. Actors and actresses of a live action and characters of an animation are very similar and nothing strange. Both of them are all attractive and nice. Disney Animation succeeds in to full the real world with the dream and also shows that there is the dream even in the reality.",Null,0,0,25 July 2016
The Nightmare Before Christmas," I like it
","This is the film produced by Tim Burton. It looks scary, but characters that he creates are somehow cute, surreal and unique. Also, the main character, Jack Skellington is attractive. He is insensitivity, but keen, cool and have the leadership. I like them so much that I have been to the exhibition of Tim Burton. Above all, his idea of taking both of Halloween and Christmas is great. Everyone likes these events, so it arouses the viewer's interests well. Although all characters are something like ghosts or monsters, they have each characteristic. They make use of it when they make Christmas or fight against their enemy. I like it and Tim Burton's great skills and ideas. This is the film that I want to watch between Halloween and Christmas.",Null,0,0,25 July 2016
Pride & Prejudice," Impatient but Beautiful
","I studied this story in the class of Professor Yoshino. This is the story of love between Elizabeth and Darcy. The gentry-class women don't have the right to choose a job, so marriage is the only way for women to live stably. Then, women acquire culture and be attractive to be invited for dance by rich men in a ball, but Elizabeth thinks it is wrong and doesn't hope for quick marriage. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth who is different from other women. However, they misunderstand each other because of pride and prejudice. When they first meet, Darcy is too proud and impolite and Elizabeth has prejudice against him. This makes them apart emotionally. I lose my patience because they remains neither too close nor too distant. This film is the story of 18th century, but I can replace the present love in my mind. Misunderstanding is sad in all ages. I enjoy this film. Elizabeth is beautiful and Darcy is cool. It is nice to watch.",Null,0,0,25 July 2016
Les Mis√©rables," Expressive Power of Music
","This story is the musical. It has few spoken words and goes by songs and singing voices. Strength of the music expresses the characters' feeling and touches the viewers' heart effectively. Happy songs such as love between Marius and Cosette are nice, but sad songs are more impressive. 'On My Own' by Eponine and 'I Dreamed a dream' by Fantine are heart-breaking grief. Both of them pierce my heart. Above all, the main character, Jean Valjean's singing voice is especially good. He is in prison for a long time by a little mistake. Then, he decides to live right and changes. Because of the background, asking himself and showing his will are expressed strongly by his songs. His great voice inspires the viewers' heart.",Null,0,0,25 July 2016
Psycho," Scary but Great
","I watch this film in Professor Fitzsimons' class. The title, 'Psycho', gives me the scary impression. I am afraid of shocking bloody scenes like murders, wars and accidents, so I watch the film through fear. Marion stoles money because she wants to marry his boyfriend, Sam. It is the beginning of tragedy and mystery. I watch it, with wondering who psycho is. At first, I think Marion is psycho because she stoles money and loses her credibility for so private reason, but she is not, contrary to my expectation. It interests me more in what is going to happen next or in the end. I get chills when I find who psycho is. He or she looks nice and kind in the first half of the film. I am so shocked and I nearly lapse into a distrust of humanity. However I don't hate such a surprise ending. As I said, I don't like shocking scene, so I couldn't watch the scene of murder. However, I was enough scared by the background music. It works very well to cause a lot of tension and to fill my heart with fear. This film is old, but I have heard it (maybe on 'Finding Nemo' by Pixar). I think the background music is so famous that it is used for other movie or TV programme, also great and important for the film. Finally, please let me say this. I like Hitchcock's skills in expression. In the first half, he places taxidermy naturally and in the end, he expresses someone like taxidermy. Although I don't understand this without professor's explanation, I am moved by Hitchcock's ability and expressive power.",Null,0,1,13 July 2016
Aladdin," Freedom
","This is one of the films that I have liked since I was a child. Recently, I watched the play 'Aladdin' by Shiki Theatre Company. I like it so much. Aladdin is a poor but honest man. Jasmine is the princess of the country. There is the difference of rank between them, but Aladdin gets the magic lamp and his life changes. With Genie's help, he tries to be a man meets Princess Jasmine. It looks just like a story of love and magic, but I think the backgrounds that the main characters have are remarkable points. Aladdin, Jasmine and Genie are very different, but they have one thing in common. It is the desire for freedom. Aladdin wants to stop his poor life. Jasmine is tired of the castle life and hopes to see the wide world. Genie wants to be free and not to be follow his master anymore. They have the impossible desire, but I think this common point is the key of the story that makes them close and makes their impossible possible.",Null,1,1,25 July 2016
