Requiem for a Dream," It is painfully beautiful.
","What can I say? it's just a master piece. The photography, the music, the actors, the rhythm... Burstyn,Lassen,Connelly,Leto,Wayans,Kurtz, etc... all of them were excellent, the cast is really good. It goes straight to your heart and moves your guts. I don't know if any of you have or had a family member with addiction problems, well I do, and the way that the movie describes the domino effect in this situations is brilliant, specially Burstyn the mother, Ouh Lord... she is pitch perfect in that role, it moved me deeply beyond believe. I must tell you the story. It was a Friday night when I saw it on the cinema,I went with a friend, when the movie was finished and the lights were on, we sat down in our sits staring at the empty screen just thinking... what the hell just happen? and why I'm in tears? Like I said before it is painfully beautiful.",10,0,1,11 August 2015
The Exorcist," I just love it.
","I love this movie, it terrifies me since I was a little boy. even my husband that he is not into horror movies, specially the classic ones, or like he says: the old ones with crappy effects, never mind... He loved it!. The mystery, the tension, the silences, the personal dramas, etc... is really well done, is not just a horror movie of blood and guts,it is a really good thriller also! I can picture people in 1974 when it was shown freaking out.And finally the two actresses, the little girl, Linda Blair (ouh my... she is really good) and of course the mother, Ellen Burstyn, I love this woman,she is one of the best actresses that I know, and when I saw her in 'Requiem for a Dream'... wow! it blew my mind. Well that's my opinion. Best wishes from Barcelona!",10,0,0,11 August 2015
