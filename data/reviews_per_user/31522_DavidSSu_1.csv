The Devil's Advocate," More a 'horror' film than I thought from title
","I rented this expecting a legal/courtroom based drama.  It certainly provided that, but it also dove off a deep end that I wasn't expecting (and would not have rented it had I known).So that I don't ruin it for you if you still want to see it, the deep end had to do with a character in the film going mad, and the vivid depiction of that process.I'm not in to horror films.   If you are, go get it, because except for that, it was a well written, acted, directed & filmed movie.",5,1,3,2 January 1999
