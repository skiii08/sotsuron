Despicable Me 2," When a Sequel Is Done Right
","It seems unfortunately common for a good film to get a sequel and for that sequel to be a grave letdown. Sometimes they will change too much and lose the qualities that made the first film so likable and at others they seem to do nothing but rehash the same ideas that we saw the first time round. It's probably because it's tough to make common ground between these two possibilities to make the sequel worthwhile. Luckily Despicable Me 2 falls into neither of these categories, remaining as fun as the original and continuing to entertain us with the same visual based gags and ludicrous premise.The premise this time around being that Gru has given up being an evil doer and has instead begun to make jam (the jam causes the minions to run in disgust) so he can spend time with his three girls. But he is quickly recruited by the anti villain league and partnered with the secret agent Lucy to track down a new super villain. In the meantime his minions slowly begin to disappear being taken under various mysterious circumstances. It's a nice ridiculous plot that does have time for moments of real sentiment as we see Gru being a father and his attempts at finding love. Of course whilst sentiment and emotion are all well and good, just like the original film it is the comedy that never ceases to entertain and keeps us watching this franchise. It's a kind of universal comedy that can be loved by all through its focus on visual gags similar to something like Mr Bean or Tom and Jerry mixed with some hilarious dialogue (the name Ramsbottom still makes me chuckle). It doesn't matter if you're young or old, the silly nature of the film continues to make you laugh just as it did the first time round. The humour does die down towards the end with far fewer jokes being packed in to the climax, but it's still a film that knows how to make great comedy. But what is able to make the film so funny? The minion's of course! These little guys have become the franchises mascots, with the marketing being entirely focused around those little things. The next film's even going to be a prequel entirely devoted to the minions. I don't know whether the writers ever knew that these characters would become so big, but now they are instantly amongst the most recognisable figures in modern animation with their large eyes and squishy yellow body becoming a regular fixture within many children's bedrooms. All this because every second they're on screen you'll be assured some great laughs with their silly voices and their adventurous nature. After gaining 970 million dollars at the box office, this is a franchise that is not going to die down anytime soon. And I'm glad. It may not create the same feeling of fantasy as Kung Fu Panda does or the sense of adventure in the Toy Story films. Instead it makes you laugh at every opportunity and through this it is sure to become a classic as one of the best feel good franchises. I can only hope that all the future instalments have the same level of charm and enthusiasm that have made these first two films so incredible.",7,0,0,19 June 2014
Alien 3," A disappointing sequel
","Alien 3 is not a dreadful film. It has a few good moments. But it also has a whole lot of bad moments. Moments that are badly paced or that have incomplete cgi effects. After expectations were risen so high by the previous two films, this one was certain to be a big let down. It starts just after the events of Aliens. The ship crashes on a prison planet of around 20 convicts. Ripley is the only survivor and begins to realise that it was one of the Xenomorphs that sabotaged the ship. It quickly becomes a fight for survival as Ripley works with the prisoners to destroy the monster. It's not a bad story (even if the logic of putting 20 prisoners alone on a planet is questionable) but I would question the decision to kill off the rest of the survivors in the last film. They were very likable personalities and wouldn't have needed any exposition to build their characters. Instead we're left with 20 characters who we never learn much about and none of whom are memorable. I could go years without watching Aliens and remember all of those crew members. I've only just watched Alien 3 and feel like I've already forgotten most of the characters. But whilst the prisoners may be forgettable, luckily we do still get Ripley. Whilst the character isn't really expanded on, Weaver does bring an great performance to the role. This time she shows a true sense of anguish. The feeling that there is no hope. She shows total despair knowing that she has lost everything. But she never gives up. She refuses to back down and keeps fighting no matter what demonstrating a very real and grounded sense of bravery. She's one of the few reason that this film was in any way worth watching.But unfortunately the film does screw up the Xenomorph. Largely because we see too much of him. In the previous two films then the Alien barely even gets any screen time, with our image of the alien being built up through quick glimpses to create a more mysterious and threatening creature. Here he appears on screen far more and we see too much of him. He's less imposing and seems more like a run of the mill monster than anything else. .On top of this the decision to use computer generated effects to make the monster was a bad one. This was before effects could create a realistic figure and because of that when the alien does appear through cgi it never looks like it's really there. Worse yet many of these cgi shots were incomplete or done badly, causing many shots of the alien in the final chase to be extremely green or have a weird colour scheme. It's particularly unfortunate as when practical effects are used in the film they do seem genuinely impressive. What's annoying about this film is that it does have some brilliant elements to it. It could have been a decent film with the claustrophobic prison scenery and returning to the simplistic survival horror of the original Alien movie. But it's mixed with the likes of slow paced action scenes and the entire prison population having either underdeveloped or uninteresting characters. Probably this comes down to studio interference as Fincher cited it as the reason he left the film during editing as it did not let him achieve his vision of the franchise. He even believed it was so bad that he has since disowned the film. It does still have some enjoyable moments, even if they are few in number. Just don't expect it to live up to either of the previous films in the franchise.",5,0,2,13 August 2014
Mission: Impossible III," What is the Rabbits Foot?
","For the third outing of the Mission Impossible franchise, JJ Abrams was bought in to bring cruise back for a new mission. Considering that he had already been creating television shows done with a cinematic budget to a cinematic quality like Lost and Alias, it made sense that he take on the reigns of the multi million dollar franchise. But whilst he is able to keep the franchise action packed, his style is unable to flourish the same way that Palma or Woo were able to in the previous films.Some time after the second film, Hunt has decided to retire from active duty and is now training IMF agents. He also has new fiancée, forgetting Thandie Newton from Mission Impossible II, who is gone without explanation, and is now with a nurse named Julia (Michelle Monaghan). It's a situation similar to True Lies, with Cruise living a double life and his wife being entirely unaware of his life as a secret agent that Hunt has decided to leave in his past to be with her. But just like any other film about a retired agent, it's not long before Hunt has received a new self destructing message with a new mission which he chooses to accept, leading him to assemble a new team to save one of the agents he trained in the past. And just like every Mission Impossible film, his mission inevitably goes wrong. Thus Hunt is plunged back into the life of a spy, having to take down brutal arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), save his wife to be, and track down the mysterious rabbit's foot. What exactly this rabbit foot is, we're never really told. It's a Macguffin in a similar vein to the likes of the suitcase in Pulp Fiction. It could some kind of toxin. Or it could be a doomsday device. But whatever it is, we know it's bad, and that if the villain gets his hand on it there will be trouble. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide just how high the stakes will be this time around. As usual, Cruise is great as Hunt. He still has the American action hero charm mixed with some great stunt and physical work, with one stand out scene where he's sprinting through Shanghai at breakneck speeds. But as great as he is, Hoffman really steals the film as the psychotic arms dealer Owen Davian, who is throughout the film one of the most intimidating villains in a PG-13 movie. At the midpoint when he says to Cruise ''Do you have a wife? A girlfriend? Because if you do, I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna hurt her.' We believe him, since he really seems willing to do anything to get what he wants. The only downside to his character is that he does not get enough screen time. The film even pushes him out of the way for a while, instead focusing on the overused traitor from within the organisation cliché we've already seen in both of the previous films in the franchise. You'd really think by now IMF would keep a closer check on their agents.Abrams is able to shoot a confident action sequence, however he doesn't make the same mark on the franchise that his predecessors did. Few blockbuster films have come anywhere near the nail biting suspense that De Palma was capable of in the first Mission: Impossible and nobody's ever done it in quite the same way. And love it or loath it, no director can make an action sequence quite as over the top as Woo with his explosive 20 minute finale. But with Abrams his style is less distinct. It looks just like every other action movie, which isn't necessarily bad, but doesn't leave the same mark that the first two films had. Beyond this there's a certain repetitiveness to the sequences. There's only so many time you can watch the same high speed chases and good guys shooting bad guys before it can become boring. And whilst the locations change, throughout the film all the action sequences end up feeling largely similar. Whilst other spy franchises at the time like Bond and Bourne were starting to experiment with darker and more realistic film-making, Mission Impossible remained stuck in the same generic action that's been see many times before. It still lives up to basic expectations, but it never tries to exceed those expectations either and is instead just a very ordinary action movie.",6,0,0,14 September 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Monster's Come In Different Sizes
","Whilst 10 Cloverfield Lane is sold as a sequel, it is not a sequel in the traditional sense. J.J Abrams described it as being a blood relative to Cloverfield, with no direct links existing to its 2008 predecessor. Typically sequels that have nothing to do with the original do not have a good track record often just attempting to capitalise on the reputation of the original without having to put any effort in to creating a good film, such as Home Alone 3 and Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. But fortunately 10 Cloverfield Lane avoids this, being an effective thriller that stands apart from the original whilst still offering the same kind of horror and looming threat that made the original Cloverfield such a hit. We open the film with a young woman called Michelle as she is driving away after seemingly breaking off her engagement. There's a few vague mentions on the radio of something going on, but before she can pay this any thought, a car crashes in to her and drives her off the road. She awakes in an empty room chained to the pipe. Eventually a man named Howard (John Goodman) enters the room to tell her that the outside world is no longer inhabitable and that he bought her in to his bunker to save her life.And that's all that we know. It's this uncertainty and the unknown that casts a lurking shadow across the rest of the film as we, along with Michelle, try to put together exactly what's going on. There's another survivor in the shelter named Emmet (John Gallagher) who seems more trustworthy than Howard and is also convinced that somethings happened, but none of them are sure of just what it is. A few theories are thrown out there regarding Russians, aliens or apocalypse. Throughout the film we're left attempting to figure out exactly what's happened, but we do know that somethings happened and whatever's out there is keeping them trapped inside. But as threatening as whatever's outside is, our characters never seem that much safer inside with John Goodman's Howard posing an ever looming threat. He's similar to other great villains like Kathy Bates in Misery, with his unhinged nature making him both unpredictable and dangerous, constantly switching in to fits of rage every time one of the other characters talks out of place. And just like whatever has happened outside, throughout the film we're constantly trying to piece together just who he is and whether he was really just trying to save Michelle or if he had some other reason for taking her out from that car wreck. Whilst Michelle is held in the bunker against her will, she never for one moment becomes a passive victim. She is constantly using her survival instinct and being resourceful to gain an understanding of what's going on and figure out a way that she can get out of there. Further distinguishing itself from its predecessor, 10 Cloverfield Lane does not use any shaky cam throughout the film. Instead Dan Trachtenberg favours a more suspenseful style of shooting that follows from Michelle's perspective whilst better emphasising the often claustrophobic setting of the film. It's a thrilling premise that's executed in an unsettling way, trapping us within the same uncertainty and paranoia as our main character. Whilst we don't know exactly what we're supposed to fear, we know that whether it's the monster outside or the monster within, there is constant danger looming.",8,0,2,13 May 2016
Rocketman," Sex, Drugs and Elton John
","When watching Rocketman I couldn't help but compare the film to last years Bohemian Rhapsody, especially since director Dexter Fletcher ended up taking up the reigns to finish the chaotic production of Bohemian Rhapsody following Singers departure. Whereas Bohemian Rhapsody shied away from showing some of the more controversial moments in Mercury's life and seemed unable to live up to the larger than life presence of the band, Rocketman doesn't try to back away from Elton's R rated life and is infused with the kind of energy which an Elton John movie deserves.The story is the same kind of music bopic you've probably seen before in something like Ray, Walk the Line or Hard Walk: The Dewey Cox Story. Following a difficult childhood, an artist becomes one of the biggest stars in the world. However the stresses of fame mixed with their own personal problems leads them in to a life of addiction and push away all those they care about. This forces them to fight their own demons to overcome their struggles and find happiness in their life. I don't know whether I should criticise Hollywood for not greenlighting more original biopics or music prodigies for living such similar lives.Though what differentiates this story from a standard music biopic is Elton as a character. Whilst there's always a slight concern when the subject of a biopic plays a role as the producer of his own movie, since they may attempt to force a romanticised version of themselves to the screen, it's clear that Elton doesn't have a problem in showing the painful moments of his life or the darker side of his personality. Instead he embraces his pasts mistakes and own them as part of how he became who he is today.Another major part of bringing Elton's personality to life on screen is that Edgerton may have been the best choice they could have made for playing him. Beyond nailing his look, he seemed able to switch between the emotional wreck that he was in his personal life in to the hypnotic on stage charisma so naturally. In one of the films best moments we see him broken down and exhausted about to step on stage, before breaking in to a smile and a happy march the moment that spotlight hits him. With this and the comedic skills he shows off in the Kingsman series, he's definitely an actor who I'm curious to see where their career is going to go.But you couldn't have an Elton John movie without an Elton John Wardrobe and the movie does not disappoint. From the moment he steps on screen dressed as a sparkling devil, with wings so large you'll wonder how made it through doors, to the hundred other costumes we see Edgerton wearing throughout, the film this ends up being a greatest hits compilation of both Elton's music and his outfits.Unlike some other music biopics, this movie doesn't try to just copy Elton's musical performances. The filmmakers are smart enough to know that no matter how good Edgerton is, there's no way they could just use Elton's songs as it would never live up to just watching a concert film of Elton performing. Instead they claim their own versions of these songs, blending Edgerton's great voice with a style more similar to a stage musical to give them a separate identity to Elton's. Combine this with the impressively executed dance sequences, which similar to La La Land feel like modern day versions of a classic Hollywood musical, these sequences stand apart from Elton's as their own entertaining versions.The film mixes these great sequences with a constant kinetic energy which flows through every scene, moving song to song and blending scenes together seamlessly. Especially later on in the film, where Elton's drugged out state leads scenes to transition into one another at times like a dream and at other times like a nightmare. Though at times the film carries this momentum to a fault, with scenes moving so quickly that we hardly get a chance to breath before the films already moved on to the next song.We do also get a slightly rushed ending, with all the loose emotional plot threads in his life being tied together in a single scene and leaving us with a brief Animal House style of cliff notes for how the rest of Elton's life went instead of something more creative like a montage showing us the rest of Elton's life. But even with this, Rocketman is both one of the best music biopics and a thoughtful look on the self-destructive effects of addiction. I just hope that every future music biopic is given the same amount of care and thought as this film has been given.",8,4,10,26 May 2019
Alien: Resurrection," This resurrection should have been aborted
","I'm not certain of why this film came about. Whether it was because of a desire to end the franchise in a better way after the failure of Alien 3 or just cashing in on the name of a popular franchise. Either way Alien Requiem is a weak addition to the Alien franchise and one that does not live up to the legacy that preceded it. This time it doesn't even feel like a sequel, but rather like a reboot. 200 years after she died, Ripley is resurrected by a mad scientist who wants to use her DNA to create a new form of Xenomorph. But the aliens escape their cage using their acid blood (why they didn't put them in a special jail that wouldn't melt with acid is one of many plot holes) and take over the ship. Thus it's up to Ripley and a group of space bandits to defeat the Xenomorphs before they make it to earth. It's a bizarre story that is alright, but out of place for the tone of the franchise.The idea of space bandits is a good one (as evidenced by the fact Whedon used the same idea later to make the hit show Firefly). But unfortunately it is not executed particularly well here. Each character does have a memorable feature that will ensure you do remember the different characters, but it seems to lack the usual quick witted charm that makes most of Whedon's work so memorable. Whedon states the reason for this is a weak execution of the source material and some script changes after his draft. Possibly this comes from the fact that the director Jean Pierre Jeunet's style does not blend well with Whedon's with his melancholy, dramatic approach not being best suited for the script. Unfortunately just like Alien 3, Resurrection screws up the most important thing in the franchise. The Xenomorphs. Once again we see too much of them. What made them so iconic in the first two is that we hardly saw them. It was the fear of the unknown that made them so memorable. Here they appear a no better than some run of the mill monsters. They never feel as if they're too much of a threat and even their designs are different. On top of this they do some incredibly strange plot points with the Xenomorphs, the strangest coming within the final act. Out of nowhere a Xenomorph/human hybrid is born merging Ripleys DNA with the alien. That sentence alone felt strange to write They even attempt to add some drama in to it with the alien viewing Ripley as its mother, even trying to make us feel sorry for it. But when they constantly switch between sympathetic child and murdering monster the whole thing just loses its impact.Ultimately there's nothing in this film that is particularly memorable. There's little reason to watch the film since it doesn't add anything interesting to the franchise. But if you do watch it then don't enter with any expectations.",5,1,2,25 August 2014
Insomnia," 'A good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece of the puzzle. And a bad cop can't sleep because his conscience won't let him.'
","Nolan seems like he's a director who can do no wrong. Every film he's done has been a unique work with beautiful directing and complex scripting constantly trying to be different. Insomnia is no exception demonstrating once again why Nolan is one of the masters of modern cinema. Al Pacino leads as the veteran cop who is sent to an isolated town to investigate a child's murder with his partner. During this he is under investigation from internal affairs who his partner may be cooperating with. The pressure of this begins to take hold as the case goes on, trying to hide all his secrets. Whilst it was not written by Nolan, it is a story well suited for him to handle. Just like any Nolan film, it tackles meaningful themes of morality and guilt throughout with Pacino's veteran cop becoming conflicted on his own beliefs.Once again Pacino demonstrates why he is one of the best actors, with his character becoming more worn down as the film goes on. The look of his eyes alone show how exhausted he is and that the lies have taken his life away.Though as impressive as Pacino was, Williams is probably the biggest surprise of the film giving a chilling portrait of a serial killer who steals the show whenever he's on screen. It's very different to his usual role, but he plays it incredibly with an eerily calm demeanour and incredible dialogue delivery giving a memorable portrait of a killer. The killer works as an effective reflection of the veteran cop for both of them are trying to hide their own lies. The only difference being that whilst Pacino feels guilt for his lies and actions, the killer feels none. Insomnia is a masterpiece in filmmaking from start to finish. The directing, performances and writing come together with everyone involved in the film giving it their A game.",9,1,3,2 July 2014
Snatch," 'In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?'
","Snatch is Guy Ritchie's second feature film and a spiritual successor to his first film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It has a similar style, setting and mostly the same cast from that film. With some filmmakers this could risk being repetitive and failing to live up to a previous success. But fortunately Ritchie seems to improve upon what he did in Lock, Stock in every way remaining loyal in style whilst creating a wholly original and hilarious comedy. Its narrative is similar to something like Pulp Fiction, since there's no single plot that the film follows. Instead it follows many insane characters as they navigate the world of London crime and watch as their stories collide in to each other (both literally and metaphorically) as they try to do every crime from rigging boxing matches to stealing a 86 carat diamond. And seeing these characters interactions is definitely the best part of the film. Watching their over the top personalities collide is like watching a dark British version of old Looney Tune cartoons. Even if this film had no plot at all, it could probably be sold on these insane characters alone. To match their larger than life personalities, most of the characters will also have weird but memorable names including Borris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) a Russian gun dealer with the ability to dodge bullets and Brick Top (Alan Ford) a British gangster who rigged boxing matches and has an aggressive streak, chopping up any person who crosses him in to pieces and feeding them to pigs. But no character in the film is quite as bizarrely enjoyable as Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt). He's a Irish Gypsy traveller who is a bare boxing champion with the ability to knock his opponents out in one punch. He's given an Irish accent that even an Irish man would find hard to follow at points, largely in response to criticisms in the first film that many of the London accents could be hard to follow for American audiences. So this character was made so both the audience and other characters couldn't understand him. And he uses this to his advantage, setting up unfair deals and swindling all the English men out of their pockets. Even beyond the main characters, every side character are also very enjoyable. They seem to have a Coens Brother kind of charm to them when even if they were only on screen for 30 seconds, they kept you laughing so much in that short time that you'll still be able to leave the film thinking of them. Either because of the short dialogue having a distinct British charm to them or just because of great casting (like having a slow moving fat man as the getaway driver for a heist) that just ensures the characters all leave a lasting impression. Another great part about the comedy in this film is Ritchie is one of the few directors to still use the visual medium effectively to bring the laughs in his comedies. As smart and quotable as the dialogue in the film is ('Why do they call him the bullet-dodger?' 'Cause he dodges bullets') the films visuals are where Ritchie real skill takes over. The use of clever editing tricks like freeze framing on a stupid face or fast editing taking you off guard in a split second allows this film to have its own distinct mark on you.Out of all of his films so far this is definitely Ritchie's career high point. Its impressive soundtrack, instantly quotable dialogue and memorable visuals are both very enjoyable and easily re-watchable. It's quite easily one of my favourite comedies to come out in years.",9,0,2,3 August 2015
The Expendables," A great premise but in need of better execution
","My expectations for the Expendables were extremely high with the potential for some of the best on screen fights. I was expecting something equal to the Bruce Lee v Chuck Norris fight in the Way of the Dragon. But unfortunately what could have been one of the greatest action movies of all time ended up being nothing more than a generic action with little memorability other than its cast. Ultimately the film is centred around one gimmick. Get the biggest action stars and put them together on screen. At first the premise sounds like a good one, but the problem is that its a tough idea to get right. With so many people in one film it becomes difficult to let any of them shine as they would on a lone outing since they get quite little screen time. What would usually seem cool like machine gunning a room full of bad guys feels mundane when everyone else in the film is doing it too. Also many of the names don't get much more than a cameo with both Willis and Schwarzenegger getting less than 5 minutes of screen time.Possibly you could make the premise work with a really good script that can juggle all the characters as films like Ocean 11 had done before it. But unfortunately Stallone was not up to the job. Unlike the action movies that made us love these stars, it has no memorable moments. He seemed more relied on the cast to make the film work than using the script to make the actors more effective. The actors do their best to bring some charm to the film and at times it can lead to some cool moments but not often.The fights seem to blend together since nothing seems to happen other than a lot of explosions and endless numbers of faceless bad guys dying. Watching these fights actually bugged me to see how the actions have changed since those iconic ones of the 70's and 80's. Instead of the realistic blood pouches they used to use, we now only see extremely fake VFX blood splatter. This mixed with the fake gunfire draws little interest in to any of the action scenes and makes it far weaker than those classic actions that it's trying to duplicate. Plus all of the dialogue is so dull and adds little personality to these heroes. There's no 'I am the law' or 'I'll be back' lines that will have us quoting these films for years. The best the film will give is a wink to the audience by referencing these lines instead of making its own memorable lines. The script tries to capitalise on out love of great actions instead of making one itself.If you're a fan of any of the stars it may be worth watching as it's still an OK action. But the only way to get the best of any of these actors is watching them on their own.",5,1,1,13 July 2014
Blade II," Cool Characters and Great Action
","After the great success of the first Blade film and before the horrific disaster that was Blade Trinity, Guillermo Del Toro took the reigns of the Blade franchise for it's second outing to turn Blade into the first Marvel movie franchise. In spite of this being Torro's first venture in to action, he proves that he is clearly suited for the genre already having the trademarks that make him such a great director, including his flair for cool designs and his ability to create stylish and focused action sequences. Taking place 2 years after the first Blade film, a mutation has occurred within the vampire community that causes them to mutate into a new species called Reapers. These creatures are stronger, faster and have a far more extreme blood lust, sucking both the blood of vampires and humans at a rapid rate. Thus Blade and his team of vampire hunters are recruited by an elite squad of vampires called the blood pack, to hunt down the Reapers and save both vampires and humans from this new threat. Once again Snipes is on top form as the Blade, bringing the right mix of humour and sword wielding mastery needed to bring the comic book character to life on screen. But the best new addition to the film is the inclusion of the Bloodpack. Their incorporation into the film creates an interesting dynamic as they were originally trained to kill the daywalker, but put in this new situation are forced to work with him. Thus we're basically waiting for the timb bomb to go off throughout the film, waiting for the inevitable double crossing to begin. Although whilst they all look like the badass vampires they're supposed to and the team as a whole are effective in the story, several members of the team don't seem to get any real screen time. Out of the 8 in the team only 2 of them are being given more than the bare minimum amount of dialogue, making it too clear the rest of them are the vampire equivalent to a nameless red coat. But the members of the Bloodpack that the film does give time to live up to their badass looks. Ron Perlman plays the leader Reinhardt, who brings his usual tough guy attitude to the role, whilst sharing a cool unfriendly rivalry with Blade, where the pair constantly try to oneup each other. Then there's Nyssa who acts as the main liaison with Blade and his team. Whilst her role in the film is fairly typical as the standard love interest in spite of sharing little chemistry with Snipes, the character still has some great moments through her fight scenes and an interesting side plot exploring where her loyalties should lie.Toro takes all his talents from directing horror movies into the action genre, with the Reapers slit lipped mouths looking like they could have been ripped directly from a horror film. He's also able to adapt to the action genre by incorporating a constant sense of movement in his camera movement, making the already fast paced swordplay even more exciting. The only downside with the action is the CGI, which at times is rather chunky and ends up making Blade look more like an action figure. However it's so well implemented to maintain the flow of the fight that the effects never distract from the enjoyment of the scene. Not everything in this film works, with some characters having no real purpose and some poorly explained story elements like Whistler coming back from death in the first film. But what does work is so great that it's easy to look past these flaws. This is by far the best Blade film by delivering on all the cool things that made the first film so enjoyable, with it's fast paced action and awesome designs, whilst improving on the formula with even more impressive action sequences and a great story that leads up to an extremely satisfying pay off.",8,0,1,11 August 2015
Alien," 'In space no one can hear you scream.'
","Just as Jaws is the icon of horror for the seas, Alien is the image of fear for space. It's the film that all other sci fi horrors will look up to and try to imitate. But none have been capable of matching its brilliance remaining the defining picture of horror in space. And it's easy to see why with visuals that hold up as well today as they ever have and one of the most threatening monsters put to screen.When it was released we got an image of space exploration unlike any that we'd seen before. Scott ensured that there was a realistic and believable example of space exploration. He carried this out with groundbreaking special effects being used to create the vast landscape of space and the claustrophobic design of the spaceship. All this detail was vital in creating the terrifying setting needed to isolate the crew and secure their doom. The vast emptiness of space reminds us that there is nobody there to help them and they are alone against that monster. The ships narrow corridors and enclosed environments reminds us that they have nowhere to run. On top of this we truly care for the crew. They are all believable characters with distinct and memorable personalities that make us want to see them through it alive. But we constantly doubt there survival each time the Xenomorph strike by appearing as a indestructible monster. Whilst the design of the Xenomorph is one of the most impressive of cinema, what made it truly iconic is how little we see of him. Even in the iconic trailer of the film we never once see him. Because the film is not about the attack, but instead focuses on the fear leading up to it. The creature lurks in the shadows. We see only glimpses. The sharp threatening teeth. A blank emotionless face. That smooth skin. Any sight we do get of him simply makes him into a more imposing and threatening figure, without any single feature of humanity visible. We see him just the same way the crew can see him thanks to these quick glimpses. And just like the scared crew we know that it can strike at any given moment. There is nowhere they can run to in space, so they are never safe. In every lingering shot we never know if or when he'll strike. It's this anticipation of the attack that makes this film so incredible. Doom appears as a certainty to the crew members with nowhere to run to. When it does strike it's brief and one sided with the crew standing no chance against the monster.",9,0,1,19 July 2014
The Town," 'I'm proud to be from Charlestown. It ruined my life, literally, but I'm proud.'
","In his second time directing, Ben Affleck demonstrates once again his skill both in front of and behind the camera. In the unique setting of the neighbourhood of Charlestown he creates a great film held together by strong characters and an authentic environment of the crime ridden Charlestown. We follow criminal Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), part of a group who carries out many high stake bank robberies. After taking a woman named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage to ensure a safe escape, Doug follows her into a Laundrette to discover whether she knows anything. But as he talks to her he begins to care for her and slowly begins to have feelings. These feelings mixed with his guilt over the harm that his life of crime can cause others and the FBI drawing closer he begins to want to leave Charlestown and start a new life with the woman he loves. Affleck performs well as the lead whilst juggling both his directing and writing duties with a very restrained performance of a man longing for something different in life. He comes across as very likable in spite of his crimes and does get over the difficulty of balancing his loyalty towards the town and people that raised him with his new found love and longing for a normal life. Though the highlight of the film is definitely Renner who plays a fairly psychotic, but surprisingly sympathetic character. He plays James Coughlin, a man who is like a brother to Doug who shares an unspoken loyalty with one another willing to put their lives on the line for one another. In spite of this loyalty they are also both very different people with Doug's longing to leave the life of crime contrasted with Renner's acceptance of it and a true product of the criminal underworld. Whilst Affleck's character is often hesitant on harming others, James is constantly prepared for it bashing in a cashier's head for speaking out of turn and being quite ready to kill their hostage at any risk of getting caught without even giving a second thought. But this film is more than just about it's characters. It's about a place called Charlestown in Boston, which the film states in its introduction that it breeds more bank robbers and armoured car thieves than anywhere else in the world. It's a dangerous environment to be raised in when everyone around you lives such a life it leaves a person with little choice to do otherwise. This is exactly what made Doug MacRay who he is in the film. He's not a bad person, but he's put in an environment where he had no other choice but to turn to a life of crime or betray his father and friends. Even when he tries to leave it seems as if his friends and employers keep sucking him back in like a dark pit with no escape with people like Coughlin keeping him trapped in the world of crime. On top of his ability to create convincing human drama on screen, Affleck also demonstrates his skill as an action director with several memorable heists throughout the film. Each heist keeps an intimidating atmosphere through the gangs use of threatening masks and the feel that they are in complete control of the situation making them come across as real professionals. The heists also incorporate an interesting element often overlooked in heist films which is the psychological intimidation being one of the most effective weapons. Whilst pointing guns and yelling certainly creates great threat, for a guard to hear the name of loved ones or their own addresses the level of intimidation reaches an entirely new level. This combined with the impressive shootouts and driving sequences demonstrates how Ben Affleck has really evolved as a filmmaker. Whilst his career had dipped before, this was a real sign that Ben Affleck was deservingly back in the highlight. He made a great choice of material to work from and uses his expertise as a filmmaker of knowing how to work with his actors along with his ability to keep the story fast paced and exciting to make the film a real standout.",8,0,1,27 May 2015
Suicide Squad," They're the bad guys. Well, kind of bad
","On paper Suicide Squad seemed like it should have been DC's golden child. It had a stellar cast that included Oscar winner Jarred Leto and rising star Margot Robbie, it was being helmed by director David Ayer who's written great villainous leads in the past such as Alonzo Harris in Training Day and the trailers made it look like we were going to get everything that we'd want from a Suicide Squad movie. But somewhere along the line all this potential got wasted and Suicide Squad has ended up being the biggest misfire from DC Entertainment since Green Lantern. The Suicide Squad is based around a group of dangerous meta-humans put together by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) and led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). This team includes the most deadly shooter in the world Deadshot (Will Smith), the Jokers girlfriend Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), an Australian thief called Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), a fire conjurer called El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), a human reptile called Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and a woman with a sword capable of trapping the souls of its victims named Katana (Karen Kukuhara). Unfortunately the film seems to glaze through all the character introductions as quickly as I've done in the last paragraph, with Viola Davis presenting each of the characters in the beginning as if she were reading off the background summaries from trading cards. Even Harley Quinn, who has one of the darkest and most interesting backstories of how she entered an abusive relationship with the Joker, has her history summed up in a very brief two minute flashback. Although she still gets more time to be introduced than most, with some characters just showing up out of nowhere to join the team without any explanation whatsoever. In spite of the core concept of the suicide squad being that they're a task force of dangerous villains, the film makes every member of the squad seem like very noble characters. Whilst the film constantly reminds us that they're 'the bad guys', there never seems to be much to differentiate the Suicide Squad from any other superhero team. At one point there's nothing stopping some members of the Squad from simply leaving, but they still stay for no other reason than to save the day. Their characterisation is similar to the crew from the Fast and Furious films. Sure they're criminals, but at the end of the day we're supposed to root for them since they're still going to do the right thing. They just complain more whilst they do it. Though the films saving grace is that it does have some great performances. Will Smith brings back the charm and quick wit that made him a star in films like Independence Day and Men in Black. Margot Robbie gives Harley Quinn a great live action cinematic debut with an unpredictable, chaotic nature that feels partly like the Joker and partly like the wife from the Honeymooners. Viola Davies brings a level of cold heartedness and brutality to Amanda Waller in a performance that is probably the most loyal to the comics of any character in the film. The film also boosts a charismatic and loud mouthed performance from Jai Courtney and a surprisingly heartfelt performance by Jay Harnandez, whose fire blasting antihero ends up getting the best story arc of the entire film. These performances are so good that most of the films best moments are when the film has the characters personalities bounce off one another, like Captain Boomerang teasing other members or Deadshot annoying El Diablo to get him to burn out a room full of enemies. The best scene in the film ends up just being when the squad stops to get some drinks in the bar and just start talking to each other. It's just a shame that Jared Leto, one of the films strongest cast members, doesn't even get an opportunity to interact with any members of the Suicide Squad other than Harley Quinn. In fact, in spite of Leto's prominent billing in marketing he hardly gets any screen time throughout the entire film. He was great in the short time he got, giving the Joker a young, brutal, mob boss style, so I'm looking forward to seeing him in future DC films. But his talents do not get the chance to shine here. Supposedly there was a lot cut from the film, including a lot more of the Joker and several cool trailer moments that don't end up appearing in the final film. So just like Dawn of Justice: Ultimate Edition there is probably a better version of the Suicide Squad sitting on a cutting room floor somewhere. But unless that gets released I'd advise just checking out the animated movie Batman: Assault on Arkham. It's does far better justice to the Suicide Squad characters and is everything that this film should have been.",4,1,3,12 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A great continuation of the Marvel Universe
","Once again Marvel's brilliant cinematic universe is continuing to expand with it's universe being shaken by it core by this great film. This somewhat surprised me seeing as the first Captain America was a fairly standard film offering nothing but character origins and exposition in the lead up to the avengers. Similarly this one has a lot of that too, the difference being that it had a good story and exciting actions sequences to go with it.The film follows a much more realistic plot than the previous Marvel films as Captain America becomes on the run from SHIELD with it being corrupted from the inside and starts to hunt him. At the same time as this he has to deal with the new threat of the Winter Soldier and the mystery of his identity.Despite the tense tone of the plot, the film still gets in a lot of good humour just like the rest of the Marvel films, one of the best being a glimpse at a list of all the things Captain America has to catch up on over the past 60 years, which I'm sure will have us all reaching to the pause button when the film comes to DVD.Also just like the rest of the Marvel Universe we have a strong sense of comradeship within the film as characters like Black Widow, Nick Fury and the Falcon all come together to face the threat and fight very closely as a team. This theme is particularly emphasised when they become uncertain of who they're able to trust from SHIELD leaving them more isolated and more reliant on one another as we really get to see within the fight scenes.Some of the fight scenes really are impressive with a good mixture of hand to hand combat, gun combat and a lot of shield based attacks. One fight scene stood out more than any other though which is Nick Fury's first full fight as we watch him fight off a small squadron after he is ambushed in his car. Not only is it the first time we see Fury in a full combat situation, but it's also an impressive scene with some great use of various weapons, incredible tension as he becomes quickly overwhelmed and some really good humour thrown in to boot possibly making it one of my favourite action sequences so far this year.The only problem I had with the film was that the Winter Soldier himself was not as well done as the trailer had led me to believe he would be. Obviously they explain the mystery of who he is and why he's doing this, but it comes late in the film and we don't really get to see much of the aftermath of how the Cap deals with it and instead chooses to focus more on the action. Saying that it does seem like they will be going in to it more in the sequel so hopefully we'll see more of him in the next one to improve upon it.In spite of this small flaw this remains a great addition to the Marvel Universe and really raises my expectations for both the Avengers and the rest of the Marvel universe that's yet to come. A huge improvement over it's predecessor this one is definitely worth a watch.",8,0,1,29 April 2014
Lost in Translation," A Journey I Never Want To End
","Lost in Translation is a very unique film. On the one time it can be incredibly funny, but at the same time is sidelined by a constant feeling of melancholy. We follow these characters throughout, but are constantly held at an arm's length from them. And Sofia Coppola plays with our expectations of what constitutes a typical Hollywood romance, bringing originality to the genre through the way she romanticises the atmosphere in Tokyo and creating a beautifully unusual relationship between two unlikely people. Firstly we have Bill Murray, who takes on his most dramatic and quite possibly his best role yet. His dry wit and subtle nuances are put to best use as he plays Bob Harris, a faded movie star who has taken a job filming a commercial for Suntory whisky. But whilst there he is thrown in a melancholy, dealing with a midlife crisis, questioning why he's doing an advert rather than taking more serious roles and a wife who seems to no longer need him. On top of this whilst working on his commercial he's the only American there, unable to have a conversation with anyone. Those who do speak English seem to say to him the bare minimum giving basic instructions like 'turn and look in camera'. Then there's Scarlett Johansson, in one of her earliest roles as a young bride of a photographer. She's there with her husband, but just like Murray's character she's trapped in the same state of isolation and melancholy. With nothing to do she spends most of the day alone lounging around at home not even needing to put on pants and when she does go out she's lost in an unfamiliar world with nobody to share such unusual sights with. The short time that her husband is there he seems to be more interested in talking to a blonde actress than he does in spending time with her, leaving her feeling even more alone when her husband is there.But after 30 minutes stuck in this melancholy, these two lonely souls finally cross paths and together they spark something of an unusual relationship. We finally begin to see the characters break from their state of melancholy as they (along with us) start to see the beauty of Tokyo along with having fun at last. Whether they bond from a genuine connection or for their need to find someone else in such a lonely place, they finally seems to have found joy with one another. One thing that makes this relationship stick out from the standard Hollywood romance is that Coppola shows much about are characters in unusual ways. Instead of just having a conversation about how alone they feel abroad, we get to see it through having them feel separated from all the people around them in every shot. Then there's their relationship which Coppola leaves deliberately ambiguous most of the time so we feel the same kind of distance that they feel in being in a foreign land.Another thing that really caught my eye in the film is how beautiful Coppola made the city of Tokyo.She does a great job at exploring it with different kinds of shots ranging from packed streets to the quiet surroundings of a monk, with Coppola romanticising the city and showing its true beauty. This beauty can be found in larger parts like the sight of the glowing city at night or through smaller touches like a Japanese couple in Kimono's walking about. Just like Woody Allen with Manhattan, it feels like Coppola has a real love of the feel of the city as she showcases it spectacularly throughout the film. This is a film that really seems to resonate with me the more I watch it. Every time I seem to leave with an even greater appreciation of the complex characters and gorgeous visuals. More than that I think there's still so much about the film I've yet to figure out. There's so much ambiguity between the pair that with each viewing I feel like I walk away learning a little more about this film and it's characters.",9,0,0,22 June 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Funny, Emotional and Thought Provoking
","After months without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents out three billboards (that are located outside Ebbing, Missouri) and puts up the message 'Raped while dying and still no arrests? How come, Chief Willoughby?' This causes mass outrage from an entire town of colourful characters who adore chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) including a 'fat dentist', a 'lady with the funny eye' and Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) a man who recently built a reputation for himself after beating up a black suspect. Or as Mildred colourfully puts it, Dixon has recently entered 'the n***er torturing business'. Is she in the right to put up the billboards? Is she helping draw attention on her daughter's murder case? Or is she just a rude woman who should stop fighting people she shouldn't consider her enemies? Who knows, but she's doing it anyway. And in a strange way when I watched her stand up against everyone in the entire town I was reminded a little of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. Just like Atticus she knows she's fighting a losing battle and that no matter what she does she will never be able to bring her daughter back. She also knows that it's unlikely that her daughter's killer will ever be found. But none of that matters because this is just something that she believes is the right thing to do. McDonagh's previous films (Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges) have always been strong at balancing dark humour with thought provoking drama. But unlike his other work, the comedy for the most part is much more nuanced, with more subtle performances and a stronger focus on character development. Though it does still have his distinct language which constantly strives to challenge Goodfellas and South Park for the most swear words per minute of screen time. Plus he's assembled an incredible ensemble cast, all of whom know just how to deliver McDonaghs dialogue and are all memorable in their own way.But the two standouts in the cast are definitely McDormand and Rockwell. It's kind of surprising seeing McDormand play a role whose personality is so polar opposite to Margo in Fargo. Whenever she's on screen she's such a dominating figure and has a brashness to say whatever she wants, no matter how reckless it is or how much harm it causes. She's also brilliant at delivering McDonagh's language. At the end of it I was pretty sure that I'd enjoy watching an entire film of McDormand just going around town and swearing at people (which to be fair is kind of what I saw). This film might also be Rockwell's greatest performance yet. He's the image of the cop that Americans fear to see. The kind who thinks that his badge is an excuse to do whatever he wants and not have to face any consequences for it. He does so many hateful and despicable things in the film, but somehow Rockwell never lets you lose all hope for him. You always feel like he's going to do the right thing in the end, even if he's going to do a lot of wrong things first. At times hilarious, at others sorrowful and constantly thought provoking, Three Billboards is easily McDonagh's greatest work. It's a film that has a certain level of humanity and moral ambiguity that will continue to resonate long after you've watched it.",9,2,4,6 January 2018
Ant-Man," Big Action On a Small Scale
","Whilst he had to wait for all the Super Soldiers and aggressive raccoons to have their movies, it's finally Ant-mans chance to make it to the big screen. And in spite of the unfortunate departure of Edgar Wright along with a short production time, Ant-man is still able to continue the style and quality of the Marvel cinematic universe. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is a con-man and master thief who has recently been released from prison. Impressed by his skills, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits him to become the next Ant-man. He needs him to pull off a heist to retrieve the Yellowjacket suit, a costume with the same abilities of the Ant-man costume, being developed by Daren Cross (Corey Stroll) who intends to sell it to villainous corporations such as Hydra. Motivated by his desire to see his daughter again, Scott accepts his second chance in life and sets out to carry out the heist. Whilst they try to raise the stakes at points (Pym reminds us every so often of how the Yellowjacket suit could change the world as we know it) the real charm of the film is in how low-key it is compared to the rest of the Marvel films. It's not some epic battle where the fate of humanity is at stake. Instead it's just a cool heist movie and a nice change of pace from the usual large scale tone used in most Marvel movies. This low key style leaves a lot more focus on the characters to keep the film entertaining and fortunately the actors were up to the task. Paul Rudd is a great addition to the Marvel Superhero roster by being cool, likable and grounding Scott as a human character through bringing the same comedic skill that we loved in films like the 40 Year Old Virgin (albeit with less 'You know how I know you're gay' jokes). Douglas is also memorable as his mentor and the original Ant Man, being an interesting take on a retired superhero. Instead of just being old and brooding, he still has the same courage and wit he had in his prime. Plus we get a few cool flashback scenes seeing a younger Michael Douglas (made with very convincing CGI) working as the original Ant- man in his prime, which looked so cool that it made me eager to see Pym get his own movie at some point.Whilst Yellowjacket did seem to follow all the weak Marvel tropes for villains (rushed back-story, lack of screen time etc.) he was still surprisingly entertaining in the film. Largely because of Corey Stoll who not only gives a great menacing presence, but also plays it so over the top that he brings charm to an otherwise charmless character. The only weak character was Bobby Cannavale as Scott's ex-wives new douchey boyfriend. Mostly because the douchey boyfriend character is one of the most worn out clichés in cinema and didn't seem to have any real purpose in the film other than weak comedy relief. Plus it seems a shame that the film spends so much time with him whilst we hardly get any scenes with his wife and daughter (Judy Greer and Abby Fortson respectively) who are far more important to the story and should have had more screen time. It's especially disappointing Fortson didn't get more screen time since the few scenes she was in were amongst the funniest moments in the film. However the centrepiece of this film is the action sequences, which contain the most creative fight scenes that Disney's Marvel have had in a while. The size shifting dynamic added a whole new element to the fight scenes visually, taking the usual destruction of a standard blockbuster and placing it inside a children's bedroom. Plus the scenes feel like they have Edgar Wright's fingerprints all over it having clever wordplay and great visual gags making the fights hilarious. Though that's not to say that the fight scenes are flawless. At times their decisions to have the battles be created entirely with CGI are fairly distracting as most of the backgrounds are blurred out in the miniature scenes. It never ruins the fights, but it can be distracting. And it would have looked a lot better if they had been more creative for some of the sequences and used actual sets for some of the miniature shots. But at the end of the film the lingering thought did remain, would Edgar White's Ant-man had been better? Maybe it would have been more visually creative. Or maybe it much of Wright was still in the film and it wouldn't be much different. But ignoring what it could have been, the films still great at what it does. It packs in the laughs, has likable characters and does a decent origin story. However other than the fight sequences, there's nothing substantially different here that we haven't already seen from other superhero films.",7,0,4,18 July 2015
Fargo," 'You're darn tootin'!'
","This is arguably the first film that really put the Coen brothers on the map and for good reason. Everything about Fargo is unique and original, from the beautiful setting to the incredible dialogue mixing together humour, drama and beauty so seamlessly the film is nothing short of a masterpiece.Fargo's story revolves around how several characters lives begin to collide with one another after a simple kidnapping scheme begins to go wrong and body counts begin to rise. But where the film really succeeds is because of the interesting range of characters ranging from McDormand's kind speaking Marge to Buscemi's rude and talkative Carl. All the leads of the film have original and interesting personalities that make them so interesting to watch. Part of the brilliance of this and every Coens Brothers film is that even the small characters feel very well developed. Someone like Norm (McDormand's husband) probably has somewhere around 5 minutes screen time, but in that short time it gives him a unique personality and demonstrates the close bond between him and Marge. It feels that everyone in the film matters or has some role to play, with every character having some impact on the chain of events. A single conversation can change a character's entire outlook of a situation which the Coens make believable through the great writing where we can see why they would be changed by the confrontation. On top of this the film has many moments of both natural and memorable dialogue. Some of it even packs great meaning such as 'There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day.' Lines like this demonstrate the Coen brothers skill in creating great meaning in their work whilst maintaining realism within the dialogue. Beyond this the film contains many beautiful and meaningful shots mixing a feeling of suspense into the endless roads and blank landscapes that fill the screen. Even the simplest shots of a car driving down the road feel all the more impressive as we see the sight of the headlights shine through the falling slow.The Coens constantly do what all filmmakers should, which is to take risks and try different things. Everything from the setting to the characters personalities is unique within the film. From start to end Fargo is a joy to watch and a true cinematic classic.",9,2,3,30 June 2014
Man of Steel," It will give the DC Universe an ideal to strive towards
","The first time I saw the trailer for Man of Steel I knew it was going to be something special. Maybe it was seeing Chris Nolans name (the master behind the Dark Knight trilogy). Or maybe it was seeing that Zack Snyder would direct (who already had success in both Watchmen and 300). Or far more likely it was seeing the beautiful tone of a trailer showing shots that demonstrated that the film was going to go to the heart of Superman's character. The film lives up to this in every sense demonstrating a truly real character emerge from the comic books on screen. I'll say now that those who may have heard in reviews that the fight scenes are no different to Transformers, these people are strongly mistaken. Whilst Transformers acts as nothing more than two cars bashing in to each other like rocks being put in a blender, with each hit thrown and each battle started we witness sheer emotion and deep reasoning for each fight. Be it Superman's contrast to his opposite fighters or the light speed fights that really emphasise the man of steels speed and strength better than ever before on screen, Snyder goes all out to make sure these fight scenes are what the man of steel deserves. Another fantastic part of the film is that whilst the film is centred on Superman, the film does not ignore any of the supporting roles that make the Superman. Be it through emotional heart breaking lines from both Superman's dads be it Crowes inspirational speeches like 'You will give the people an ideal to strive towards' or Costners heart breaking lines like 'You are my son' the writers go all out to give every character the sentiment they need. This film stands as a shining example of when everything just goes right in Hollywood. Where every element ranging from the beautiful music inspiring both hope and fear, beautiful dialogue that shall transcend our lifetimes and shots so moving they could bring a grown man to tears. (What me? No, I meant the guy next to me. I don't cry at films, I'm a man! A superman! Heh. Oh, sorry should get back to the review.) It's when these elements mix so beautifully that you can truly see in to the depths of such a complex character better than any film has before it, placing this bigger than earth character in to our world in a heroic and beautiful style. It is this beauty that ensures me that the DC Universe building up to the likes of the Justice League can be successfully started from this film.",9,9,18,28 June 2013
Collateral," 'Take Comfort In Knowing You Never Had a Choice'
","You're driving a car. There's a man sitting behind you. He intends to kill 5 people and wants you to drive him to them. What do you do? This concept is the focus of Collateral, putting a normal man in to an impossible situation and following his desperation as he tries to do whatever he can to make it through the night.Whilst this is the film's story, it begins as a movie with a far different tone. To begin with we follow cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) as he carries out his normal night of fares. He picks up a woman named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and they flirt and talk as he drives her on the journey. He talks of his dreams of making his own Limo company and she talks of her stressed life as a Lawyer. It ends with her thanking him and passing a number. This scene is great partly because it works so well on its own, almost like a separate short film. It's a romance that does not feel phoned in at all, but instead develops some genuine chemistry between the pair. More importantly, it's an essential scene in showing us the kind of man Max is in his normal life. He's just a regular guy, who may dream of his limo business but has never had the nerve to act. It's important we see this so we can understand the normal person he is before his life is very suddenly thrown into disarray. This happens when a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) pays Max $600 to drive him for the night and get him to the airport as he hates life in the city and wants to leave as soon as possible. However Max discovers that his passenger is a hit- man and is taken hostage to drive Vincent to 5 targets he needs to kills that night. After this we watch as Max reluctantly drives him wherever he's told, trying to get away from at every possible turn and reduce the death toll in Vincent's path. By all rights the plot is something that you would expect from a typical action movie. But the film is able to elevate it far above the standard action movie formula through the very realistic approach it uses to tackle the story. This is done by constantly grounding the story through Max. He's nothing like your usual John McClane action hero who spouts out one liners and makes light of the situation, but instead a very uncertain and terrorised victim. His attempts to get away from Vincent are often badly thought out and he reacts to murder just as any ordinary person would. Foxx's down to earth performance is definitely the anchor of the film as it ensures that the focus is not on the action, but rather a tense conversation between a sociopathic killer and a man in fear of his life and the lives of those around him. When it comes to who you might picture in the role of a murderer, it's unlikely that Cruise would be the first person to come to mind. However Cruise also does a great job at playing outside his usual roles. Instead of being the cocky likable hero, he's a very detached man who's able to blend into crowds and drift in and out without turning a single head. He's utterly ruthless with no regard for human life and will do anything he needs to get the job done. He doesn't even feel guilt for any of his actions and looks down on others like Max who do feeling it as redundant to feel empathy for people he never even knew. He even disdains the typical life of people in a city like Los Angeles, where people seem to just drift through their lives and never take any real risk in their lives. This story could have all too easily been a run of the mill action movie. But fortunately through both Mann's great direction, a screenplay that knows to put the focus on character over action and great casting, it becomes a truly great thriller.",9,2,4,5 August 2015
The Lego Movie," An incredible film for an incredible toy
","The LEGO movie is nothing short of a delight to watch from start to finish. It's an example of a great idea for a film executed extraordinarily with great animation, hilarious writing and cameo after cameo after cameo.The story follows as a random builder who is believed to be the special who is needed to take down Lord Business and bring freedom to the world once more. The story reflects how LEGO is always played. You'll have those who want to make everything their way and then you'll have those who just want to have fun and build in the world of LEGO. The story really goes to show this adding some really interesting drama alongside the comedy that you'll be able to relate to no matter how old you are.The animation is just the right style mixing both stop motion with a lot of computer animation giving the film not only a distinct look but also well suited for the Lego franchise reminding me a little of the old Lego Star Wars games and how they move so quickly and comedic. Besides that it also creates some great designs that will make you feel like a kid again with the beautiful worlds ranging from the wild west to an epic space adventure, something which Lego is all so perfect to do.Then there's the main thing that separates this film apart from just about every other film in that it gratifies our fantasies by having some of the greatest characters come together. We get to see Superman, Michaelangelo, Batman, Abe Lincoln and so many more random brilliant characters on screen together. There are so many great cameo characters in this film that it makes Wreck it Ralph seem like a generic reference. So many cameos within the film keep you entertained non stop, with each one more entertaining than the last. The only fault with them being that you love them so much that you want to see even more, but when the only fault is that you want more of what's there, that's no real fault.The best way to phrase it is that it's an incredible idea that has been executed brilliantly. The premise is a tough one to pull off right, but clearly it's been done right here creating one of the funniest, most heart warming and fantastic animated films with a style that stands out and separates it from all the other animation franchises. They've already announced a sequel and I am already looking forward to seeing it.",8,2,7,29 April 2014
Aliens," 'Game over man! Game over!'
","Aliens was in many ways a significant change in tone of the franchise. Whilst there was still an element of fear to the aliens the focus went from a horror to a full on action. It was a risky move and could have felt like they were ruining the franchise. Luckily it never felt like that. Instead it feels like a natural progression. It brings back what we loved about Alien without rehashing ideas, whilst significantly expanding on the universe and making it an even more lovable franchise than it previously was. After struggling to get over the fear of the Xenomorph attack in the last film, Ridley joins a crew of space marines who are going to the planet the Xenomorphs were found to investigate the lack of communication with the colony who have been placed there. Of course the Xenomorphs have attacked and it turns to a fight for survival as Ridley and the Marines begin a desperate fight to escape the planet. What makes this film extremely powerful is that it doesn't go straight to the action. A great deal of the films first half is devoted to the marines. It lets us know them. More than that it shows them as real bad-asses, like super soldiers. They have these massive plasma weapons and flamethrowers. Some have cocky attitudes treating the threat of the Xenomorph like it was nothing. But then the Xenomorphs strike. The moment when they strike the numbers quickly begin to dwindle and it happens so quickly there's even difficulty in tracking just how many have died. The super tough soldiers have been cut down into these victims, beginning to break down and panic that they're going to die. Through this Cameron maintains the legacy of Scott's Alien. He ensures that the Xenomorphs appear just as powerful and imposing as they've ever been. It gives us the immediate assurance that this is still a survival film. The Xenomorphs are still the hunters. And we are still the hunted. Surprisingly Sigourey Weavers portrayal of Ripley actually improves in this film from the already incredible character she played in the first. She goes from a hardened survivor to a fully fledged hero. The change isn't sudden, but as she begins to undertake the responsibility as the film goes on. On top of this side stories such as caring for a child named Newt (the last surviving colonist) keep the character extremely grounded and human. To this day she remains one of the most powerful female figures in film because of how kick ass she can be. Then there's James Cameron, who seems to truly be in his element with sci-fi. The studio even waited a while for him to finish his work on Terminator just so he could do the film, which was without a doubt a great choice. Watching films like Terminator and Aliens is like watching a piece of dynamite with a lit fuse. He makes us enjoy the tension of waiting for the action to happen. Then when it blows it's fast and keeps us gripped to the screen. He makes seeing a Xenomorph explode just about as exciting as you can and yet still maintains their presence as threatening figures. Aliens completely changes the original story of the previous film. In the first then it was based around a threat that was unknown. But now the threat is known and it's time to fight back. But at the same time it never loses sight on the fact that the marines are still the hunted here. It's a fight for survival and one that we want to keep watching.",9,1,2,8 August 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," 14 years in the making
","The X-Men film franchise was started in 2000 and was one of the first Superhero films of the modern Superhero renaissance. After that the franchise was running for 14 years creating sequels, prequels, one good spin off Wolverine film and one dreadful spin off Wolverine film. After watching Days of Future past, you really get the feeling that this is the film that the past 14 years have been leading up to, using all our favourite characters across the franchise and putting them against one of the greatest threats they could face in this masterpiece of a modern blockbuster. It chose probably one of the best stories from the comics and is ideal for the franchise as it allows the film to use characters from both the original X-men trilogy with those from First Class. The film starts in the future, where the sentinels have almost brought mutants to extinction by hunting them and killing on sight, immediately establishing the potential for the dark drama of the film. In a final resort, the last surviving members of the X-Men attempt to send Wolverine into the past so he can unite the young Xavier and Magneto to stop Mystique whose powers inadvertently caused the creation of the sentinels to begin with. One of the new characters in the film is Quicksilver who is a great character dominating most of the time he was on screen with his funny and fast paced nature creating some of the best laughs of the film, with one scene seeing him literally getting one of his enemies to punch himself in the face. Another impressive addition is Peter Dinklage as Trask who creates the sentinels and is arguably one of the lead villain of the plot. Just like Magneto, he honestly believes what he is doing is right. By doing what he believes is best for humanity and not recognising how sinister his actions can be he becomes a more interesting character.But the focus of the film does remain on the main characters of the franchise. For example the leading character of the film is Xavier. Just like First Class was an origin film for Magneto and why he created the Mutant Brotherhood, this film shows how Xavier got over his darkness and chose to follow a brighter path to form the X-men. We also see Magneto return and get to see two contrasting relationships between him and Xavier. Their past selves who hold great resentment to each other and their future selves who are close friends and regret the conflicts of their past. There's also Hugh Jackmans Wolverine where we see a different version of the characters to the previous films. He has some funny moments, but the overall performance is far darker being changed by the previous films and the bleak hopelessness of the future. But with so many great characters I can only mention so many. So I will just say that each of them have a distinct personality that drives their actions. It also feels like each character is there for a good purpose, having some impact on the plot. To top this off, many of the characters are being played by some of the best acting talent of recent times with the entire cast being real acting heavyweights and bringing their full talent to each role.The film is also very well made, with X-men veteran Bryan Singer returning for directing duty. He uses two significantly different styles for both the future and the past. All the future scenes are shot in a darker way with less colour as a reflection of how bleak the future has become, emphasised even further by the ruins that we see our characters survive in. The 70's on the other hand contrast to this with it's busy city streets and detail of recognisable traits from the decade with the likes of water-beds and the lack of more than 3 channels creating regular chuckles but also being a great setting for all the dramatic scenes too. Singer also does well as an action director for the film. Whilst some people did complain that the first 2 X-men films were at times too light on action, I doubt anyone will be saying the same of this film, as it contains some of the best fight sequences of the X-men franchise thus far. Not only are they well made, but also they vary greatly from Wolverines brutal fights to the more VFX heavy attacks of Magneto. But luckily these impressive fight scenes never draw any attention away from the story or characters within the film, with the plot leading to fight scenes instead of the fight scenes leading the plot.The only single thing that stops this film from getting a 10/10 for me is the fact that I don't think we saw enough of the future. It would have been interesting to have seen more of how these characters have been surviving with the Sentinels attacking or just how they met up with one another to form this plan. However I do hear that there were some future scenes filmed, such as an entire sub plot with Rose, but was cut for time purposes. So hopefully there will be more of the future seen in the DVD release. Besides, this is in itself mostly a minor nitpick for such an epic film. It is a masterpiece in every sense, with brilliantly directed fight sequences being amongst the best of the year and the franchise, genius writing which takes one of the best X-men stories and uses it to the full potential it can achieve and an incredible cast who juggle the difficult mixture of comedy, drama an action perfectly. Now we just have to wait another two years and hope that Apocalypse will match the brilliance that this film contained.",9,1,3,24 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Avengers Disassemble
","Now at the start of 'Phase 3' Marvel has decided to open it up with one of its biggest films yet, putting together almost its entire roster of heroes in to one movie and taking on one of the biggest game changing conflicts within the entire history of Marvel. Whilst the film is at times clustered, the Russo brothers successfully create a blockbuster driven by a very personal conflict whilst still delivering some of the greatest action sequences of the franchise so far. After a mission goes wrong and several civilians end up being killed, a proposal is put forward to place the Avengers and all its heroes under government control which divides the Avengers in to two factions. On the one side is Captain America (Chris Evans), who after the events of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is distrusting of government interference and believes the Avengers are most effective working independently. On the other side Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who after feeling responsible for destruction caused by Ultron believes that even the Avengers need to be kept in check. But during all this a villain named Zemo (Daneil BrÃ¼hl, playing another Marvel villain who could have been very interesting but unfortunately goes completely underdeveloped throughout the film) hatches a plan involving Cap's former friend Bucky (AKA Winter Soldier) to further this divide between the Avengers. This causes all the Marvel heroes to choose their respective sides, with each having their own personal motives and reasons for who they side with, all colliding against one another in an all-out brawl. To the films credit, the inclusion of all these superheroes never detracts from the core conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, with their emotional conflict always remaining the centrepiece of the film. But at the same time, every cast member gets their own moment in the spotlight. Whether you want to see scenes exploring the relationships between characters like Captain America and Black Widow further explored or just fun moments like seeing Ant-man being shot off one of Hawkeye's arrows, this film will have something for any fan of the Marvel Universe to enjoy. Although out of the films massive cast the biggest standout of the film is Tom Holland as Spiderman. Whilst he only has around 10-15 minutes screen time, Tom Holland has the potential to be the best Spiderman yet. He's able to pull off both the awkward but charming Peter Parker and the fun quick witted web swinger better than either Maguire or Garfield were ever able to. Plus Holland works incredibly well off all the other heroes, particularly with Robert Downey Jr. as he and Holland appear to share a very natural chemistry with one another. The only drawback of Spiderman in the film is that at times the CGI appears very unnatural, looking a lot more like a video game character than he does an actual person. Nonetheless it was a great re-introduction to the character, without relying on the already familiar origin story, to be another great addition to the MCU. However just like too many superhero movies lately, by having so many different characters to juggle the movie does feel clustered at times, with some plot lines not getting the attention that they deserved and being incredibly underdeveloped. Probably the worse effect of this is the Black Panther's origin story. It's an interesting story about honour and revenge which on its own would have been enough to fill an entire film, but doesn't get the time it needs here and thus his origin story ends up feeling wasted. It's a shame too since it's the first time the characters been introduced in any film and it could have been a great backstory if the film had the opportunity to properly develop it. Plus Chadwick Bosman gives a great performance in the short time that he's actually given a chance to. Hopefully his standalone film should give a better opportunity to give the character the attention he deserves. Whilst there are a few problems with some of the films action sequences, with some scenes suffering from the overuse of fast paced editing techniques, for the most part the fight scenes have the same exciting tone and focus on practical effects that the Russo brothers demonstrated in Captain America: Winter Soldier. However the one scene in the film is the airport sequence, which sees both sides of the conflict and all the heroes collide together in an all-out brawl. I won't say anything specific about what happens in the fight, since it does have a lot of great surprises that shouldn't be spoiled, but it does just about everything that you'd want to see from these characters fighting and is probably one of the crowning achievements of the MCU so far. The only downside is that this scene is so incredible that afterwards the rest of the film ends up feeling fairly underwhelming in comparison.Also the film does shy away from some of the darker aspects of the original Civil War storyline from the comics and the movie doesn't do anything that we haven't seen from other Marvel movies before. Whilst the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man is interesting, the snappy back and forth between both sides whilst fun and enjoyable leads the clear impression that neither side will be willing to take the fight too far, thus reducing the stakes of the film. Saying this, Captain America: Civil War does just about everything that audiences expect from and want from the MCU. It's funny, it's exciting and it continues to explore the characters that have remained at the core of the Marvel Universe since its inception. On top of this the Russo brothers have once again proved themselves ready for the task of taking on the next Avengers movie.",7,3,7,10 May 2016
Inside Out," Another Pixar Classic
","Do you ever look at someone and wonder, 'What is going on inside their head?' Well, the reality is the answers pretty dull. It's just a big brain sending messages across your body to determine your actions. But in the minds of the creators at Pixar the answer has no limits, with every persons head containing a fully functioning world, where small beings create and store every idea and memory we have in life. And at the centre of this world is a control panel, similar to something like the deck of the Enterprise, which is controlled by our emotions that lead us through every decision we make in our lives. Inside Out follows a girl named Riley (Katilyn Dias) and the five emotions that lead her every action- Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Riley's most important emotion that has shaped all of Riley's core memories that make her the person she is, Joy (Amy Pohler). They all care for Riley and one another like one big family, always looking to give Riley the best life she can have. This includes everything from remembering to avoid Broccoli to maintaining Riley's goofy attitude to remain her parents happy little girl. But Riley is entering a difficult period in her life of great change. She is moving to a new home in San Francisco, leaving her friends behind, and her father has become too busy with work to look after her the way he used to. This causes the emotions to conflict on the best way to deal with it, with the ensuing chaos causing Joy and Sadness to get lost in the furthest reaches of Riley's mind and forcing them to go on a journey to return to the control room, or Riley might never be happy again. In some ways the film is a nice reminder of how even after 20 years, Pixar has stuck to what made them so engaging to audiences to begin with. The journey that Joy and Sadness go on is a great buddy travel movie, that's in a similar vein to Buzz and Woody in 'Toy Story'. And just like 'Toy Story', Pixar has continued to remain focused on developing memorable characters that will help shape many childhoods, with the likes of Joy's energetic personality and simplistic but lovable design bound to stick in our heads the same way that Buzz Lightyear did when 'Toy Story' was first released. But in other ways the film is a reminder to show how far both Pixar and CGI animation has come, with the worlds Pixar's movies take place in going from the constraints of a child's bedroom to creating an entire world within the mind of a child. And the world that they create is something truly special. Other films have taken place in a person's mind in the past with their own distinct styles, from the epic mind bending action of 'Inception' to the fragmenting chaos in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. But no other film has ever approached the inner workings of a mind with the same creativity as Pixar has. The film includes as much as it could of developing how a mind works and what an 11 year old girl would be thinking about, incorporating it as either a great gag or as a way the world is designed to function. There's a literal train of thought that's able to carry memories across Riley's mind, a place called DÃ©jÃ  vu that keeps popping up, and even a dream centre that operates like a movie studio to give Riley something to watch at night. Even small sayings like getting a song stuck in your head are incorporated in to the film in some of Pixars funniest running gags to date. Plus I'm relatively certain that anyone who's seen the film will be humming Triple Dent Gum for the rest of their lives. As always, at the films heart remains the human drama that has kept Pixar movies so relatable over the years. In one of the most touching scenes, we watch as Joy turns on one of Riley's treasured childhood memories of her skating to pick up her spirits and slowly begins to skate with her in perfect synch. It's a beautiful moment where we're shown both the close bond that Riley and her emotions share, whilst reminding us all on the way we all hold on to out childhood in a way that only Pixar can.It's moments like this that can be universally related to, mixed with Pixar's stunning animation and their ability to create such original worlds that ensures Inside Out is another addition to Pixar's constantly growing collection of treasured classics.",9,20,55,15 September 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Fan Service: The Movie
","It sounds like a cliche, but the hype for Avengers Endgame was unprecedented. After 22 movies, a cliffhanger which saw half the universe destroyed and one of the best marketing campaigns of all time, which told us nothing about what to expect from the film (which made it impossible to write a review without spoilers), this really was a cinematic event.Picking up from the apocalyptic finale of Infinity War, it begins with the remaining Avengers still reeling from the loss of half their friends. Some like Natasha and Steve try are doing all they can to keep things afloat and maintain order in a world in disarray following the snap. Others like Stark try to build a new life from the ashes. But they are unable to escape their own feelings of failure and the film does not avoid showing how much their loss has weighed upon each of them. Especially in early scenes where we see Stark have a complete psychotic breakdown in some of the franchises most powerful scenes. Thus when Scott Lang returns with a plan to go back in time to bring everyone back, they are all willing to do whatever it takes to undo the snap.Whilst Infinity War was Thanos' movie, he doesn't get as much prominence this time around only appearing briefly in the first 20 minutes of the film and not really re-entering the film until the climax. Instead this time our focus is almost entirely on the remaining Avengers and their attempts to bring the other half of humanity back from annihilation by travelling back in time to past movies to retrieve the infinity stones and undo the snap.We get some truly satisfying conclusions to the stories of some of Marvel's biggest characters. Stark finally concludes his journey from being a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist to being the one to make the sacrifice play to protect those he cares about. Plus we finally get to see Rogers learn to live for himself in a bittersweet ending that sees him finally grow old with his true love. It's strange to see two of the most beloved heroes leaving the series, but at the same time with the massive roster of heroes this series has built there will be a lot of great potential in future films to fill their shoes.Although even with its three hour runtime, Endgame contains too many characters to do all of them justice. The main casualty of this being the Hulk. The previous films suggested that we would be seeing more of Banner's Jekyll and Hyde tale, but when we're reintroduced to him here, he's learned to come to terms with the Hulk whilst off-screen and now has the intellect of Banner whilst maintaining the power of the Hulk. Whilst the Banner/Hulk hybrid does have a lot of funny moments, its disappointing that we never see how Banner finally comes to terms with being the Hulk. Instead it seems like this iteration of the Hulk will never reach the full potential of the character.But having a few characters being underutilised is almost a certainty in a film where the main cast includes 54 names. And the film is still able to have a lot of satisfying cameos from fan favourites like Korg to moments with genuine emotional resonance like Stark being able to see his father again and tell him about the granddaughter he could never meet. Even characters that I didn't think I cared about seeing again like the Ancient One end up getting some scene stealing moments.With so many names in one film, we were all waiting in anticipation of the reveal following the second snap and the film did not disappoint. Just like that original shot in the battle of New York where we finally see the Avengers all together for the first time, the moment where all the Avengers assembled (we finally got the line!) to take down Thanos together is the kind of thing that will go down as one of those great cinematic moments. And it really shows just how far this cinematic universe has gone that something as ridiculous as an army of wizards, Asgardians, space bandits and tribal warriors wielding spears, can all arrive to battle a purple alien hell bent on destroying the universe somehow makes perfect sense.Though the actual climax itself felt somewhat mixed overall. There are some great moments like Captain America finally wielding Mljonir and Thanos completely wrecking every member of the Avengers he comes across. But a lot of the confrontations with Thanos' army are fairly underwhelming and there's nothing that lives up to the battle against Thanos on Titan. Plus there is one moment where the film seems to stop to have all its female heroes in one shot. This felt like an attempt to hit back criticisms of their lack of female heroes, when in reality it only highlights that the problem by reminding us of how only one of these characters got their own film. It's not as great as the seeing the time heists that came before it, but this final battle still provides satisfying conclusion.This is definitely a film that is truly made for the fans who have been following this universe grow over the past decade filled with call backs to some of the franchises best moments. At times Avengers Endgame feels like the entire MCU is doing it's own victory lap and after 22 films it's well earned. Now the only lingering question is what's next? Following Disney's acquisition of Fox perhaps we should expect the X-Men and the Fantastic Four joining the MCU in the near future. But whatever they do, it seems unlikely that Marvels dominance is going to come to an end anytime soon.",8,3,6,28 April 2019
Toy Story 4," To infinity...
","When Toy Story 4 was first announced many people online seemed very reluctant about the idea of another Toy Story movie. Not because people were bored of the franchise, but because they thought Toy Story 3 provided such an ideal ending that they were concerned any continuation couldn't live up to the ideal legacy the previous three films had created. But once again Pixar outdoes all expectations, making another fine addition to their greatest franchise.We start more or less where the last film left off, with Woody struggling to adapt to being Bonnie's toy. He's no longer the favourite and he's started to collect dust in a cupboard. But he finds a new meaning for his life when he decides to become a mentor to a new toy named Forky, a toy which Bonnie makes on her first day of school out of a spork. Now you may be wondering to yourself how a spork comes to life and what really makes a toy? I don't know. But whatever brought him to life has also caused him to have an existential crisis where he is forced to be a living toy when all he wants to be is trash.This crisis leads to Woody and Forky becoming separated from the rest of the gang whilst on a road trip, where they end up bumping into Woody's long lost love, Bo Peep. Whereas Woody lives trying to recapture that special connection he had with Andy, Bo has decided she doesn't want a new kid and lives her life as a lost toy. With Bo and Woody's relationship taking centre stage in the film, Toy Story 4 allows their personalities to lead the direction of the film all culminating in another heart wrenching conclusion to the Toy Story franchise.As with the other Toy Story films, we also get introduced to some new memorable toys. Beyond the lovably naive (albeit slightly suicidal) Forky, we also have Duke Caboom, a stunt-cyclist toy who suffers from PTSD due to not being able to leap through the air for his previous owner as his toy was originally marketed as. Key and Peele play a pair of carnival fluffies, who's surprisingly sadistic nature ends up being a comedic highlight of the film. And also an old doll named Gabby Gabby, who due to being defective sends her ventriloquist dummies to kidnap Woody to steal his voice box. And yes, her ventriloquist dummies are just as creepy as you're imagining they are.Another cornerstone of the franchise is that each film always showcases the best animation of the time and Toy Story 4 is no exception. These aren't the most ambitious visual concepts, most of it just takes place in an old antiques store and a moving carnival. But the attention to detail, the colour and the photorealistic lighting ensures that the film is consistently beautiful and that there's never a boring shot in the film. One moment which really stuck with me was an establishing shot of Woody and Bo Peep in the rain, which was so awe inspiring that it's a moment I found myself completely lost in.Though as entertaining as all of the new characters are, it would have been nice to see some more from the original gang like Hamm, Rex and Jessie. None of them become too involved in the main plot and some are never really given a moment to shine in the film. And with a brief runtime of 100 minutes it's not like they had to be cut out to condense screen time.Although when my biggest gripe with a film is that I would have liked more of it, the filmmakers have definitely been able to recapture that special Pixar magic. And I have no doubt that kids will remember characters like Forky as fondly as I held Buzz and Woody after growing up with the original Toy Story.",9,2,7,22 June 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Keep your hands off my lobby boy!
","Always entertaining and constantly funny 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' introduces us to another beautiful and imaginative world plucked from the mind of Wes Anderson.Its focus remains on Gustave the concierge and Zero the lobby boy. After a wealthy tenant dies and Gustave is named the heir of her fortune, he is also framed and sets out to clear his name and fortune. It's a story unlike Andersons previous films, but he tackled it in the same way he would with any film with unusual characters and a visual beauty leading the story.With a cast with as many big names as this has (Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Willem Dafoe to name a few) and many of them having less than 5 minutes screen time you would usually assume that the film would be selling out. Normally you'd be right and such a cast would just be an attempt at cashing in at the box office. But gladly that's not the case. No matter how small the role, every part of this film comes across as both lovable and memorable. Each characters personality is distinct and the actors ensure that no matter how short the screen time they make their presence in the film remembered. Every character feels as if they are vital to the film and every character just makes the film even more charming. Though as good as the entirety of the cast is, Ralph Fiennes still stands out with his memorable performance as the lead Gustave H, the hotel's concierge. Fiennes shows his great talent for comedy through his brilliant delivery. One moment he shall be a refined English gentleman, speaking with grace and modesty as one would expect from any fine concierge. Then the next he swears like a fu*king sailor. Take for example his reaction when he sees 'Boy With Apple' where he comes across a priceless work of art 'Blond, smooth skin as white as that milk, of impeccable provenance. One of the last in private hands, and unquestionably the best. It's a masterpiece. The rest of this sh*t is worthless junk.' Fiennes switches between the two so naturally, yet somehow remaining charismatic throughout to create a peculiar and unique character. These characters are mixed with Anderson's distinct visual style to create the beautiful world in which the Grand Budapest is set in. Short of 'Fantastic Mr Fox' this is probably where his directing style comes across strongest, with the film filled with his trademark centred shooting style and panning shots. Mixed with this is his usual charming dialogue and unusual storytelling style. This time Anderson experiments with a unusual narrative spanning 80 years in the first 10 minutes.In the modern day a young girl is reading a book. In this book the author recounts a time when his younger self met the mysterious millionaire Zero Moustafa. Moustafa tells tells of the inter war years when the hotel was at its prime and under the leadership of Gustave H and the adventures that they went on. Through his smooth style the intro feels as if it were plucked from a book through the authors descriptive tone to explain the narrative and Andersons smooth style passing through scenes as if one was turning pages in a book. This narrative also plays a significant role in Andersons visual style, most importantly that of the hotel. Due to the films narrative then there are two designs to the hotel. The first from the 30's where the bulk of the story is set. With this the hotel is a grand design, with stunning hallways constantly crowded with the wealthiest individuals, impeccable service and with brightly coloured cinematography to emphasise the beauty. It is nothing short of an ideal hotel, creating an illusion full of life and happiness.The second design is from the 60's where in contrast the hotel is aged after the war. The halls are no longer crowded. Service is lazy at best. The bright colours are less defined. And it is no longer full of life as it once was. Whether it is to demonstrate how the war has destroyed the beauty of the hotel or to serve as a reminder of how the heyday of the Grand Budapest will be remembered for generations to come, Anderson uses the visuals of the hotel to give greater meaning and weight to Gustaves story. It makes the life seem all the more beautiful then and makes us desire even more to experience it. And that's what makes the film truly special. Anderson not only creates his unique image of a world but makes us want to be a part of it. Whether it's the charm of Gustave and every other character or the Grand Budapest itself, Anderson hypnotises us to the screen through the films charm and beauty. It's certainly a film that I'll want to revisit time and time again.",9,2,4,12 September 2014
The Little Mermaid," One of the Best Disney Classics
","The Disney Renaissance is one of the best recognised periods of the Disney animation studios, where Disney released many of its most creative, successful and all round incredible films. Whilst the start of this renaissance could arguably have its roots in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the Little Mermaid is definitely the film that led Disney towards its focus on a Broadway musical style and brought Disney animation back to the high quality that it had been lacking in previous years. It brought to life an incredible fantasy world though a mixture of great characters, stunning animation and quite possibly the best soundtrack that Disney has ever had. We get to follow Ariel, the youngest daughter of king Triton, who has become enamoured with the creativity of the human world and set her eyes on the dashing prince Eric. Whilst she longs to be part of the human world she becomes forbidden by her father to ever make contact with them. However in defiance of her father, she turns to the evil sea witch Ursula who creates a spell where she may walk on land to find her true love, but on the condition that if she fails to get the kiss of true love will become a slave to Ursula. Ariel is well above any Disney Princess that had come before her, with a genuine desire for adventure and her willingness to defy her father making her a very endearing and lovable figure. Just watching her childlike innocence and wonder as she discovers more of the human world makes her a real delight to watch. Similarly, Ursula is also up there with some of the best Disney villains. She comes over as being such a sinister Machiavellian character who manipulates emotions exploiting Ariel's youthful recklessness and longing for love in Poor unfortunate Souls. There's also a lot of great supporting characters like Flounder and Sebastian that keep the laughs coming in fast and strong. All of the animation in the film is nothing short of Disney magic. Every painstaking detail that must have taken countless hours to draw the stunning underwater environments was truly worth it creating something superior to anything that had come before it. From the small details of bubbles floating up to the sight of the sunlight hitting the ocean floor, no expense was spared and a true thing of beauty was created because of it. Beyond this the way in which the characters move throughout is also something to behold. The lifelike movements of Ariel as she gracefully flows through the ocean is wonderfully detailed with incredible touches of how her body sways through the water to her hair floating as she moves. Then there's the soundtrack and from the jig score you hear when Ariel first sees Eric to the big song pieces, the entire film is packed with some of Disney's most memorable and enjoyable songs. One highlight is obviously Under the Sea, being one of the catchiest tunes for kids to sing and working as a lively upbeat reggae tune. Though as great as Under the Sea is, Part of Your World is quite possibly one of the most stunning musical sequences put to film. It is quite possibly my favourite Disney moment as every emotional beat of the song really hits its mark and is a great song to showcase the stunning animation the film has to offer with the image of Ariel reaching to the surface being given a special place in my memory.I loved this film as a child and I have only grown to appreciate it even more with age. It's music and imagery are worthy of all the acclaim it receives, being just as strong today as it ever was.",9,1,1,22 May 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's Love Letter to 60's Hollywood
","Tarantino is the best kind of filmmaker. He's the kind who has such an appreciation for everything that's come before him, but is always looking for something new. He infuses all of his characters with his own style of catchy dialogue, whilst still ensuring that they all have their own memorable personalities whilst assembling casts who know how to bring these characters to life. At a time when it feels far too many mainstream films have become predictable, you never really know exactly where a Tarantino film is going to take you. One moment you'll be watching a boxer on the run from a crime boss, before all of a sudden those same characters are tied up next to gimp as Comanche starts to play.It's this same unpredictability that underscores the entirety of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It's similar to Pulp Fiction in the sense that it doesn't really follow any traditional narrative and instead lets the characters drive the story as they go through their daily lives. First there's Leonardo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton. He's a TV actor who's always on the verge of his big break, but the biggest roles are always just out of reach as they always go to other contemporaries like Steve McQueen. He's still doing well in the industry with a recognisable name, a house in Hollywood and receiving offers to star in spaghetti westerns. But in spite of all his success, he feels as though his life stuck in westerns doesn't let him live up to his full potential as an actor, as just like a lot of people at the time he views the spaghetti westerns as a cheap form of entertainment. Similar to how the current age of Hollywood is coming to an end, he fears that he's no longer in his prime.He's supported by his best pal and close friend Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt. Without any stunts to do, he finds himself stuck doing chores for Rick, driving him around wherever he needs to go and picking him up when he gets down. In contrast to Rick who reaps the success of his life in Hollywood, Cliff is both the metaphorical and literal punching bag of the industry, but he's so easy going and care free that he doesn't give a damn. He's just happy to help out his buddy and is described as being 'more than a friend and less than a wife.'Finally there's Margot Robbie playing Sharon Tate. Whilst Rick and Cliff are both starting to fall out of the industry, Tate is very much on the rise as the talk of the town as her career is still on the rise and embraces it with a very unselfish sense of joy. One of her best moments is just seeing the genuine pleasure she gets from being in the audience and seeing how much the audience is enjoying her performance.In the background of all this, Manson and his followers keep popping up throughout the film. On the one hand, their presence creates a creepy atmosphere whenever they're on screen with the film becoming much quieter, especially when Cliff visits the Manson ranch and we see them thriving in the broken set of old western shows watching his every move in complete paranoia. But similar to Stuntman Mike in Death Proof, he shows the pathetic bumbling side of these killers with the script showing nothing but disdain for both their viewpoint and their actions.Though even with the underlined bleakness present within the setting of a dying age of Hollywood history, just like the fairy tale nature of the title suggests we do get drenched in the culture of late 60's Hollywood. Stars like Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee will randomly pop up. Whenever the characters are driving the background is always filled with billboards and fashion plucked from the era. There's even a series of both real and fake radio ads throughout the film, some of which are even included in the films soundtrack to create a real radio experience.But more than anything else, Taranino's love of cinema really shines through, with characters going into great detail on how an actor like Rick would operate in this time through guest spots on network shows and the filming techniques employed by spaghetti western filmmakers. It's a true snapshot of life in 60's Hollywood and Tarantino's love letter to the final moments of Hollywood's golden age. It's also filled with so much great comedy, memorable character moments and ends on such a high note that the films 2 hour 41 minute runtime just leaves you wanting more.",9,11,19,24 August 2019
Aladdin," A Whole New(ish) World
","A remake done right can be a great thing. Sometimes it can take an already great film like Infernal Affairs and expand on the concepts to make a classic like The Departed. Other times it will only take the base elements in a complete reimagining like John Carpenters The Thing. But any good remake relies on originality, otherwise you just end up with the Psycho remake, where nobody's really sure what point of making it is. But recently Disney has been attempting to copy some of their classics, using our nostalgia for the originals to make millions at the box office.This brings us to their most recent remake, Aladdin. Odds are you'll be familiar with the story: a thief falls in love with a princess, finds a genie and wishes to become a prince to win the princesses love. Just like the other recent Disney remakes, there's not much new here by way of stories or songs and the focus is more on reliving the highlights we loved from the original classic, whilst adding just enough to the film to keep it technically original.For the most part, the film is well made on a technical level. There's some great sweeping shots of Agrabah, including a great introductory shot which swoops over the city to provide an introduction to all the main characters in a single take. It's the kind of creative filmmaking that Ritchie has always excelled at, even if he can't always quite find the substance to support his style. And unlike the recent Beauty and the Beast remake the music sequences felt surprisingly lifeless, Aladdin has much more creative movement on screen. Through a mixture of creative camerawork and big dancing set pieces, we're provided with enough visual eye candy to live up to some of Aladdin's most memorable songs.As for the songs themselves, these are done with varying degrees of success. Will Smith's version of Friend Like Me is able to leave it's own mark with an energised sequence and is quite possibly the highlight of the film. Plus the Arabian Nights intro is redone with some incredible backing music in a way that even surpasses the original film. But other tracks like Prince Ali just lack that same energy and the new tracks feel out of place or completely forgettable.The rest of the new additions to the film work pretty well, with some extra scenes between Aladdin and Jasmine which helps to give them a more natural on screen chemistry and they give Naomi Scotts Jasmine a far more engaging personality, actually showing her going out of her way to do right for her kingdom and playing a much more active role in the story. Though the best addition ends up being Dalia, Jasmine's handmaiden, who ends up stealing some of the films funniest scenes.In contrast the rest of the supporting cast like Iago, Carpet and Abu are all entertaining, but never live up to their charming personalities from the original. But the only character who was done poorly was Jafar. The original Jafar is arguably one of the best Disney villains, striking the right balance between being goofy whilst still maintaining a creepy and intimidating presence. In contrast this version of Jafar has neither of these personality traits and is not given anything to replace them either. You know the filmmakers messed up when a rug has a more interesting personality than your main villain.But the most challenging part of an Aladdin remake was always going to be the Genie. So much of Robin Williams personality was infused into the role that it seemed like it would be impossible for anybody to recreate it. Even Dan Castellaneta, arguably one of the best voice actors working today, couldn't capture the unique spark of lightning Robin brought to the role. But they took the best approach they could have in readapting the character, building the character around Will Smith in the same way that the original film was built around Williams. And in his own rights Will Smith is able to deliver a fantastic performance. He brings the same level of charm he brings to all of his memorable roles and combines it with some solid comedic timing to become the highlight of the film. Smith is not able to live up to Robin, but given that Robin's Genie is an icon of cinema that's probably an impossible feat to pass.But that's ultimately the main failing point of most of these recent Disney remakes. They rely so much on the ideas created by the originals that they're never able to escape the shadow of the originals. Which is a shame, because with the effort that was clearly put into this film along with the small sparks of originality scattered throughout the film makes me think that if Guy Ritchie and this crew were to have been given more freedom without being restricted by the original Aladdin, we could have had a very memorable film. But instead the film is so restricted by copying the beats of the original that it fails to find its own voice.",6,0,2,28 May 2019
The Lion King," This new remake of Kimba the White Lion has some issues...
","With the success of Faverau's Jungle Book and the leaps forward in CGI technology, it was only going to be so long before a Disney exec thought of doing a remake of their most successful film during the Disney Renaissance. But they were so preoccupied with whether they could recreate the Lion King almost shot for shot that they never stopped to think whether they should. The end result will undoubtedly be a massive money maker for Disney by capitalizing on the success of one of their greatest films, but it's also quite possibly the most creatively bankrupt film to come out this year.We all know the plot of the first film and this remake follows the original almost verbatim. So much of the dialogue is just taken word for word out of the original and many shots are so identical that I'm convinced that they just used stills from the original as storyboards. Other than one extra scene showing how Nala set off on her journey where she finds Simba and some extended sequences following some random animals unrelated to the plot, including an adept metaphor for the film where we're forced to watch a beetle pushing around a large piece of dung, there's very little here which departs from the original story.So if this does follow the original so closely then how did it turn out so bad? To start off with, as impressive as some of these photo realistic animations are this style wasn't well suited for the Lion King. Instead of having the expressionistic and lively characters from the original, we get these lions who are unable to emote and deliver on the films emotional moments. It's very difficult to connect with these characters since they just can't convey as much visually as the original was capable of and characters like Mufasa just don't resonate in the same way.The original animated films more minimalistic style also works to its advantage so that shots flow together smoother and allows for quicker edits because we are capable of reading all the information in a shot in a shorter amount of time. The heightened realism of this remake just isn't capable of doing this as it needs to hold on its shots just so we can absorb all the information on screen. Plus on a more simplistic level, the original animation just looks better. The epic scale of some of the shots in that film feel permanently engraved in my mind, but whilst the remake has me appreciate the effort and time that animators must have put in to these shots it just doesn't deliver on the same sense of awe it attempts to recreate from the original.Then there's the new cast and in spite of having a lot of great names attached to the film, it ends up feeling as if the characters are going through the motions of the story with little emotional weight. Very few of the performances are able to bounce off one another effectively and feel completely disconnected from their surroundings. This is with the exception of some of the comedic support like Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and John Oliver who were all entertaining. Though this is partly because these seemed to be the only characters where the actors brought their personalities to the role and felt like they delivered on some funny lines.But my biggest gripe of this film is it's complete lack of originality. Most of these remakes of Disney animated classics have copied the originals they were based on, but they all added at least something to the story. Even for as much as I disliked the live action Beauty and the Beast, they still made some attempts to improve characters like LeFou and tried to add their own ideas to how the curse works. But here they don't try to add anything substantially different to the characters or story, instead only adding new shots of the surrounding nature to show off the photo-realistic animation and pad out the films run-time.They even skip over some of the small moments that made the original film so incredible to begin with. One example is how they take out Rafiki's lesson about how the past can hurt and instead just cut to Simba running off to catch up with Nala. This is replaced by a montage of the two Lions running across the wild to a new Beyonce song, which feels completely out of place and was likely just added to the film so they could sell an extra Beyonce song on the films soundtrack.Ultimately the film just feels like a carbon copy of the original. It's like listening to someone speak the lyrics to a great song, all the words are there but it lacks the same beat which made the song connect with you to begin with. Whilst it's not necessarily the worst film of the year, but it is definitely the most pointless.",4,12,17,20 July 2019
22 Jump Street," Doing Everything The Same. Only Better.
","Usually remakes aren't very good, with many bombing and being outshone by the original version. But to everyone's surprise 21 Jump Street was a hit, earning 200 million and giving the careers of both Hill and Tatum a big boost to two already big names. Then just like any action, the producers decided to throw more money at the same people hoping for the same result. Usually all this leads to is everything being the same but with more explosions and a bigger pay-check to get the same people back.. Well, that's exactly what 22 Jump Street also does, with as much as possible remaining just the same. The difference being that it's honest about it, with the entire film mocking the regular clichés.Even the outline of the plot mocks the regular concept of every sequel. Hill and Tatum are constantly reminded to do everything the exact same as last time at every chance they get to say it. The logic being since it worked last time, it'll work again. Only this time they'll throw more money at it to better ensure success. Because increasing the budget is certain to increase the profit. This is one of the many self aware jokes that the film keeps throwing at us. Usually staying fixed on joking that it's a sequel would get repetitive after a while, but the film just keeps handling it in different ways to keep the laughs coming. It works because of the clever writing which parodies every detail of an action sequel, keeping the jokes fresh and original. They'll make a joke out of everything from the fact that things getting destroyed in car chases costs a lot in the budget to even John Woo's doves being randomly thrown in. At times some of the jokes don't work quite as well, but there's enough hilarious moments packed in to make sure the laughs keep coming and mocks every possible detail of the action sequel. On top of this, the actors know how to make the jokes work with all the actors having the same charm as last time. Ice Cube gets his angry boss role down to the note, mastering the angry stare and yelling almost every line of dialogue he gets. The cameos from the villains be as over the top as you can get. And just like before, both Hill and Tatum bring their A game in their ultimate bromance together. It was one of the key elements of the first film and the actors chemistry remains just as funny and enjoyable here. If anything more so here, with their conversations growing more like a married couple and a lot more opportunities to be hilariously over the top. Which is the main reason that 22 Jump Street is one of the few sequels that's better than the original. It's everything that 21 Jump Street was, just bigger and better. With the likes of this, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and the Lego Movie it's clear that Lord and Miller are quickly becoming 2 of the biggest and best names in comedy using both slapstick and mocking clichés to keep the laughs coming strong. I don't know whether they intend to do any more sequels, but as long as they maintain the consistently funny films that they have so far I can only hope that they make as many jump streets as they can.",7,14,23,23 June 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," 'And From the Ashes of Their World, We'll Build A Better One!'
","As this is Singer's 4th addition to the X-men franchise, it's hard to watch it without making direct comparisons with his previous instalments and whether he's still able to add anything else to the franchise. Whilst Singer does cover familiar ideas in this film, it never feels stale with the themes of social acceptance resonating as strongly here as they always have before and Singer still succeeds at creating new exciting sequences in to the franchise. Taking place after the events of Days of Future Past and still using cast of First Class, a new enemy awakens after resting for thousands of years known as Apocalypse, played by a very intimidating Oscar Isaac whose presence constantly dominates the screen. He's a being who believes he's a god, as he has become seemingly omnipotent having gained many mysterious powers over his several lifetimes including the ability to increase the powers of other mutants. He uses these powers to attempt to bring together four followers and destroy the world in order to start a new empire where only the strongest survive. In many ways Apocalypse is the polar opposite to Xavier (James McAvoy). Whereas Xavier unlocked the potential of mutants like Magneto through helping them reach serenity, Apocalypse uses their pain and suffering to mould them in to warriors he can control to bring the earths destruction. It's Apocalypse's want for control and his power to destroy that unites the X-men to stop Apocalypse and once again save the world. The first 30-40 minutes of the film are quite clunky, with the film jumping all over the place to introduce all of the various characters in to the story. It has to catch us up with all the older heroes after a 10 year gap between films, whilst also introducing an entirely new young cast for some of the most iconic X-men like Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). Because of this the first act of the film does feel rather slow, but once the film gets going it never slows down until the end credits, being well paced whilst moving swiftly between action set pieces and combining multiple story lines. Fans of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) will be glad to know his role is much larger than it was in the previous film and once again he ends up delivering some of the biggest laughs in the entire film. There are also several great new additions to the franchise. Tye Sheridan re-establishes Cyclops in to the franchise at a point where he's far from the natural leader that we saw from the original X-men trilogy and adds some much needed charisma to the role. Whilst Sophie Turner doesn't have the same hypnotic element that Famke Janssen bought to the role, she does bring to life a far more timid and uncertain Jean than what we've seen before, with the film also setting up some groundwork to redo the phoenix saga in a future film.Also Fassenbender once again has another great outing as Magneto, whose own hatred further sets himself down the path to villainy that he's been forced down since his parents were first murdered. He goes on a very painful journey within the film, with Fassenbender adding a great deal of anguish and tragedy to his character once again. His story also has several great stand out moments, including one incredible sequence where he destroys the remains of Auchwitz, another reminder of how those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. However with such a large cast to use there are some characters who don't get the time that they needed. For example, whilst Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is funny and has a few good moments in the film, there's nothing near the scale of the Whitehouse sequence in the introduction of X-2. Also this is probably the weakest outing for Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Whilst her character arc was one of the strongest aspects for both First Class and Days of Future Past, here in spite of her prominent screen time her role seems so tagged on and unnecessary that she probably could have been removed from the film and it would have been none the weaker because of it. Similarly, new characters like Jubilee (Lana Condor) and Angel (Ben Hardy) feel entirely unnecessary and receive absolutely no character development.Once again there's another show stealing Quicksilver sequence (this time to the tune of Eurythmics - Sweet Dreams) which is just as funny and creative as the one in Days of Future Past, but also adds a dramatic element in to the mix. Singer also found a great way to visualise Xavier and Apocalypses battle of the minds, in one thrilling sequence that see's Apocalypse grow in to a giant to overpower Xavier.(POTENTIAL SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE 3rd TRAILER) However the biggest show stopper in the film is in the weapon X facility and Wolverines (Hugh Jackman) escape sequence. Whilst he's only in the film for a few minutes, this short time does better justice to the character than the entirety of Origins was ever able to, finally unleashing feral Wolverine in a brutal hallway fight that leaves a mass of dead bodies left in Logan's wake. Though one drawback of X-men Apocalypse is that it is a film for those familiar with the franchise only. Unlike Days of Future Past, which could appeal to both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike, Apocalypse relies a lot on its audience knowing about plot lines from past films, such as being already familiar with characters like Stryker and Mactaggert. But so long as you're familiar with the franchise, this film delivers with some great action pieces whilst following in the tracks of Days of Future Past by adding new life in to the franchise.",8,6,13,18 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Poor plotting and weak characters
","Once again Sony has tightened it's grip on the Spider-man franchise to stop the likes of Disney getting a hold of it and expanded on the amazing spider-man franchise. Unfortunately whilst they may have this power over the character they do not live up to their responsibility to make a decent franchise, instead creating a lack luster film with weak characters, poor designs and an overwhelming lack of a coherent plot structure. The weak structure largely comes from the fact that the film is stuffed with far too many sub plots with each villain and supporting character seeming to get one leaving little room to develop any of them. But the film's main focus though is on the relationship between Gwen and Peter as after the events of the first film Peter is uncertain about being with Gwen and putting her in danger. At times this relationship is extremely effective, largely due to the natural chemistry of Garfield and Stone which does help the romance work. Unfortunately the romance does suffer from some weaker elements such as when Peter tells Gwen that he's been following her around. This is thought of in the film as romantic, but it's not. It's creepy and makes spider-man a stalker! If someone were following you without your knowing, would you consider it romantic? Another problem with the love plot taking up the most time it also means we get more Parker than we do Spider-man. This is a problem because just like the first film it seems like Garfield does pretty well as Spider- man, being very funny spouting one liners in the most dire situations, but fails as being Peter Parker, being annoying and awkward on screen. Also the only relationship of meaning that's developed in the film is with Gwen, his interactions with the other characters don't really go anywhere. He doesn't even get that much screen time talking to any of the villains, making there relationships feel fairly genetic and lacking interest. One of these villains that the film introduces is Electro, who's design looks like a reject from the blue man group. At first the film tries to develop his character and show him as this innocent person who has an obsessive nature, but then in the midpoint of the film deteriorates to a bland 'I am evil now and must kill Spider-man' with little build up or reason for such a sudden character shift. Also, whilst in the adverts he was hyped to be the main villain, the reality is that he doesn't have much impact at all on the plot. You could have removed his character from the movie and it wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever other than removing some fight scenes. Then there's Harry Osborne and his alter ego, the Goblin. He has some good scenes early on, particularly one scene where he's talking with his dying father which is probably the best scene in the film, but then he becomes weaker as the film progresses with he film seemingly uncertain as to whether it wants us to sympathise with him due to being alienated by everyone or hate him for attacking evil. Also the relationship between him and Peter feels very unnatural and forced since we don't see them build any relationship to begin with with only one or two lines of dialogue giving any explanation as to why they could be close. Then to top it off you have rhino. If you thought Venom didn't get enough screen time in spider-man 3, wait till you get a load of this five minute cameo. He is only there for 2 scenes and becomes the Rhino off screen. Worse yet rather than trying to give him any character whatsoever, he's degraded to an angry, shouting hired gun who would seem more suited for a role as a side villain in a Schwarzenegger film from the 80's. His character serves as nothing but a cheap ploy to fill more cinema seats and to tease a sinister 6 movie. To top this off, the ending to just about every story in the film ends up feeling either unfinished in an attempt to lure in viewers to the next film or rushed in an attempt to create a forced conclusion. This film feels too focused on building a franchise and because of it the individual films feel less complete. For example the back story to what happened to Peter's father gets a big build up, but then after one small revelation the film just drops the plot, becoming more interested in getting some more mindless action in the film for the last few minutes. Though the film doesn't get everything wrong. Seeing Spider-man go to his best to save every citizen is cool and a nice call back to the likes of the original Superman film. This is helped even further when we see how kind he is to everyone he saves, at one point saving a kid from some bullies and then complimenting his arts and crafts project. These scenes are probably the best since they nail the character and make him extremely likable. Also at times the mixture of comedy and action feels just right, being a good reflection of the comic books. But these small positives do not stop Amazing Spider-man 2 being a great disappointment being a significant step down in comparison to the recent standard of Superhero movies. It has a few decent moments, but these are mixed in with far too many badly written characters and a plot that goes all over the place, lacking focus and not gauging an interest for these characters. The franchise has a lot more potential than this is given and I hope the potential is met by future instalments, but so far it is not looking good for this franchise.",4,10,20,6 May 2014
Patton," 'All real Americans love the sting of battle'
","Patton was a man who loved war. He saw it as a thing of honour to be able to fight for his country. More than that, he believed it to be his destiny and purpose to lead men throughout WW2. The war was a story to him that would be told throughout the ages and he wanted the leading role. We never see anything of Patton's life before the war. Instead the story begins in the midst of the second world war when he is promoted to Lieutenant General, almost as if that is where his destiny begins. It follows all of his military exploits from that point. We see everything of his joys of controlling the realms of battle to his frustration and misery at spending time waiting for his next assignment. We see both the highs and lows of his career and everything between.Through the diversity within all his exploits, the man is left open to a great deal of interpretation. One person can walk away from this film thinking about Pattons many victories. But another can watch this film and see a brutal man whose war methods put too much strain on his own men. The film never offers a definite opinion. It just shows us the facts and lets us assess the man ourselves. It allows for a far more diverse set of views and creates a more interesting look at what kind of man he truly was. Normally it would be difficult for an actor to keep open these various views about his character. But luckily they made a perfect casting choice for the role. Whilst the Scott himself felt his performance did not do the material justice (to the point that he declined his Oscar for best actor), he truly brings the man to life. From the moment he steps on screen and delivers the films opening speech in front of the American flag, Scotts performances is instantly hypnotic and maintains its strength from start to finish. He balances every part of Patton's life seamlessly. From his admiration of any mans courage in war to his sorrow at not leading D day, he juggles all of the different aspects of Patton's life. Always demonstrating Pattons love of the grandeur of war by constantly taking centre stage he ensures that he builds up Pattons own perspective of how his life was the centre of the war. He performs the role incredibly to keep us all hooked to the film from start to finish. The film delivers a powerful portrait of one of the most controversial figures of the American military. It captures the man's admiration of war showing us the beauty and honour that he saw in battle. It's a brilliant example of when a great actor is given a great script and cinematic history is born.",9,3,3,31 July 2014
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The Story of When Logic and Reason Was Used To Combat Fear Mongering and Madness
","During the 1950's there was a wave of communist paranoia where a mixture of government policy and propaganda made everyone afraid that anyone could be a communist. From the kid round the street to your own Gran, the communist could be anyone. Or at least anyone you said it was as the whole thing became a witch hunt, with word alone being enough to give a lifetime in jail as a means of protecting national secrets. But there were no better witch hunters than McCarthy, who would incarcerate people without trial for merely being suspected of Communism. In Good Night and Good Luck we focus on Edward R Murrow and his loyal team of news investigators who chose to take a stance against these policies. Murrow stood to expose McCarthy for the madman he was. Whilst McCarthy made blank accusations that Murrow was a Communist, Murrow destroyed his arguments through logic and reason. The focus of the film remains on behind the scenes of Murrow's campaign including the struggles that he faced to get out his truth and how he refused to step down from what he knew was right. Throughout the film, it incorporates archive footage to show all the government actions with figures like McCarthy only ever appearing through old footage. It does not use any actors to recreate any of the government actions within the film. Thus the overall focus of the film remains on Murrow and his team, whilst creating a greater sense of realism through seeing the events really unfold before us. But more importantly, just like Murrow when he was fighting McCarthy, the archive footage better enforces the idea that it is important to use the facts to back up its arguments. It's keeping clear of the McCarthyism belief of telling us what to think and instead tells us why we should think this way. Just like Murrow did with his audiences, the film treats us as thinking individuals who are allowed to have our own opinions, rather than a maniac such as McCarthy forcing their own beliefs down the public's throats. It is this journalistic style that leads the film throughout to ensure honesty. It tries to be as factual as it can be on every element, from the financing difficulties that the show faced to the need for honesty amongst the entire film crew from the very start. Whilst the film does side with Murrow, it does not go so far as to glorify him. Instead a balanced view is shown on this issue as it is stated that even Murrow censors the facts to work towards his own point of view. Through details like this, a far more realistic representation of the media is shown and that every person when representing a story will have their own agenda. On top of the brilliant scripting that remains as factual as possible to the real life events, it is also incredibly shot with a rich black and white style throughout. Partly it just makes it fit in with the archive footage and the standard black and white television sets of the 50's. But more importantly it gives the film a distinct look, with the focus remaining on the people rather than the backgrounds with their facial expressions coming across clearer in the black and white style. Also all the characters are smoking in near to every scene. Whilst a dreadful habit, the great visual of seeing the smoke fill the air better emphasises the office environment that they are working in. It's this cool style mixed with the films factual nature which puts this amongst my favourite films of 2005 and why I view it as a serious overlook for the 2006 Oscars. Good Night and Good Luck shows us the potential that technologies of television reporting can be capable of. Murrow proves how the technology allows for opinions to be heard and for people to be protected against government policies. This message that the film tells remains eternal, as great reporters like Murray remain as important now as they ever were to keep government powers in check and working for the people.",9,0,0,18 June 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," 'They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy'
","This was one of those films where nobody was sure how it would do. Many were unfamiliar with the characters and it was going to be a difficult task to introduce the characters to mainstream audiences. But then we got hooked on a trailer, with people loving the music and quickly opening up to this new band off a-holes. Whilst it's not the major overhaul of the standard marvel formula that some were hoping for, Guardians of the Galaxy is both enjoyable and successfully introduces audience to a different kind of superhero.Part of the appeal of the the characters is that they're not the usual heroes. There's Starlord (Chris Pratt), a space bandit who acts like a goof and was taken from earth at a young age. Gamora (Zoe Salanda), an assassin who was raised to be the perfect weapon. A revenge obsessed murderer named Drax (Dave Bautista). A talking tree whose vocabulary is limited to 'I am Groot' (Vin Diesel). And an aggressive genetically altered Racoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper). They're greedy, rule breaking rogues who usually act only for themselves. The only reason they're saving the universe is because they were put in a situation where they had to. They're different from the normal heroes because we're not all sure that they will do the right thing. Since many audiences weren't familiar with the characters the film did a good job of introducing them. The exposition never feels forced and we progressively learn more about the characters as the film goes on.By learning more about these characters, we actually begin to feel for them. Each characters seems to blend hilarious comedy with great tragedy. Take for example Rocket Raccoon. At first he makes us laugh with his aggressive personality and small demeanour. But then we learn about his insecurities about feeling judged for being different and alone in the universe. By the end of the film we begin to feel genuinely sorry for him. This is thanks to the great performances from each of the main cast who successfully combine comedic delivery with genuine sentiment in their performances. Just like other memorable team superhero films like X-Men or Avengers, Guardians does a great job at juggling its characters. With so many great actors getting roles in the film (John C Reilly, Karen Gillan and Benicio Del Toro to name a few) the script does a great job to give every character there own funny and memorable moment. Then there's the soundtrack. It is a 'best of' remix of some of the most memorable tracks of the 70's, with classics like 'Hooked on a Feeling' and 'I Want You back' certain to make this a high itunes seller. It performs many important roles in the film. Sometimes it sets the tone for a cool action sequence. Others it will create some funny completely out of the blue moments. It even plays an important role in the story, acting as Starlords only link to earth to create a touching back story to the character. Whilst it didn't link too much to the rest of the current marvel film universe, it did begin to further establish Thanos to audiences and establish potential future story lines. Fortunately unlike others like Iron Man 2 that became all about establishing future films, Guardians never lost focus on the humour and action that makes the film so great. And by doing so it leaves us wanting to see some more of this part of the universe.",8,1,5,4 August 2014
Jurassic World," It's a dumb movie, but enjoyable nonetheless.
","You'd think that after the first park went so badly that corporations would never try to mutate dinosaurs again. But we humans never seem to learn, as 22 years later and we've got a brand new park even bigger with new deadly attractions bound to cause more chaos. We spend the first 20 minutes of the film seeing the park itself. It's more modern than the tribal feel of the first park, instead going for something more like Universal Park being a fully fledged tourist attraction with modern high tech designs with things like holograms to boot. But despite the park being a success with 20,000 visitors daily, apparently it's still not enough and they need to make a new attraction to lure in new audiences. So they've had the scientists create a new dinosaur that's even bigger and more dangerous called the Indominus Rex. What could possibly go wrong? But then everything goes wrong. The Indominus Rex escapes and begins to hunt for sport, killing every dinosaur and person that it comes against. We see the new dinosaur hunt its prey in interesting ways blending into environments, clawing at thick skinned enemies or armour to find weak points and just charging dead on with brute force to chomp its enemies to bits. On top of the terror of this new dinosaur we also get plenty of cool scenes with trained velociraptors, who despite being trained like circus lions still always pose a threat to the human characters who risk being turned on at any moment. Their uncertain allegiance does lead to some pretty tense stare offs. Whilst the dinosaurs are great, the human characters are far less enjoyable. Most of the characters in the film are either idiots or just plain annoying. Just like the first Jurassic Park we get two new kids here that are visiting the park and who seem to do nothing but get in to trouble and become damsels in distress despite this being a family film and obviously never being in real peril. There's an underutilised Vincent D'Onfrio as a military type who wants to use the dinosaurs for hunting who doesn't seem to have much purpose in the film other than rubbing in the Jurassic Park message that corporations are bad. And Irrfan Khan as the park owner, who comes across as a more annoying, douchey version of Richard Branson. The only good characters are the leads Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). They're both the basic archetypes you'd expect in a blockbuster film playing the Pratt playing the typical quick witted action hero and Howard playing the park manager who goes from a busy bureaucrat to being a caring bad-ass. But they play the archetypes well by remaining likable and getting a fair number of laughs over the course of the film.At times the film does come off as being self contradictory in some of its messages. For example at one point in the film a character jokes about selling out to corporations and that they may as well just name one of the dinosaurs after them. But then the film sells itself out to corporations by naming several products they could name it and filling the film with many product placements from Starbucks to Mercedes. Then there's the way that they mock some blockbuster clichés like the woman ripping her dress up to become a bad-ass, but then indulges in others like the typical stereotypes. Other than one fight scene (which I won't spoil here) none of the fight scenes ever reach anything close to the likes of the iconic T- Rex scene in the first Jurassic Park. At times the action can even begin to feel a little dull or repetitive. And if you think about it too much then you'll be bound to find many plot holes. But there's still enough here to put it ahead of the previous Jurassic Park sequels and is still an enjoyable turn your brain off b-movie blockbuster.",6,3,10,20 June 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Bad Plot, But Some Great Action
","Just like the first 'Mission: Impossible' film was entirely different to the TV show it was based on, 'Mission: Impossible II' is nothing like it's 1996 predecessor. The slow, tension building pace Palma used in the first film, has been replaced by John Woo's love of fast paced action and insane shootouts. Woo draws from the auteurist action movies he made in the east like 'The Killer' in order to bring his own brand of high octane action to western filmmaking. If anyone doubted how different Woo's style would be, he immediately distances his style from the first film in the first 5 minutes. Whilst 'Mission: Impossible' had its agents receive missions in stylish way that resembled a Bond movie, with a cassette tape being delivered on a plane before detonating in a puff of smoke, that approach was apparently not extreme enough for the generation that made films like 'Bad Boys' a hit. So instead the mission is delivered to Hunt as he climbs a cliff, with a helicopter firing down the assignment in a missile containing a pair of sunglasses, which he listens to before they explode in a ball of flame. It's completely pointless and serves no purpose to the plot. But it's still an awesome introduction to the film, and sets the tone for the ludicrous and enjoyable action to come. To match ridiculous action sequences like this, the plot is similarly as ridiculous and over the top. This time Ethan's mission is to retrieve and destroy a genetically engineered disease called 'Chimera', before a group of terrorists led by formal IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) get a hold of it and release it to the public. To get close to him Ethan is told to recruit Sean's ex- girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) so she can seduce him. But of course as the typical American action hero, Hunt falls in love with her and thus must both stop the terrorists and save the girl.Coincidentally, just like the first film had a heavy Hitchcock influence through its visual style and slow pacing, this film has a plot that is heavily inspired by Hitchcock's 'Notorious'. However unlike Notorious where there was a genuine connection between the two leads, here Cruise and Newton share no such chemistry. They hardly even spend any time together, having only a short amount of screen time with a little flirting, a short car race, and a single night of passion. But for the action movie formula, this is apparently enough to justify them being madly in love.This wouldn't be a problem if this film did the same as the first 'Mission: Impossible' and spent minimal time on character and story. But here a great portion of the film hinges on Cruise worrying for her and it doesn't work since no real connection is established between the pair. There's also several plot holes and continuity errors, with characters just showing up in random places with no explanation whatsoever. Although in the films defence, supposedly the original cut was intended to be over 3 hours long, but had to be cut down for a cinematic release which would explain most of these problems. Regardless, it's easy to look past this weak plotting, because as always Woo's real strength relies on his action sequences. And as usual he's on top form. He transforms Cruise from the stealthy espionage spy he played in the first film, into an all American action hero similar to the likes of John Rambo. Hunt fights through seemingly unbeatable odds, gunning down terrorists and blowing up cars, all whilst hardly gaining a single scratch because he's just that deadly. And of course Woo throws all his usual trademarks into the mix, like Cruise constantly dual wielding pistols, the gratuitous but cool slow motion and of course random doves being thrown into the climax. But even for a director like Woo who made his name through over the top sequences like the one take hallway sequence in 'Hard Boiled', this still feels a little overdone. For example, at one point in the film when Cruise is breaking into a terrorist hideout, a door blows up and a dove literally flies through the flames. Moments like this are so ridiculous that they end up feeling less like a genuine action movie and more like a flat out parody. Even with these moments that go a little too far, it can't be denied that nobody does action quite the same as Woo does it. If his brand of insane violence didn't appeal in his previous work like 'Face Off' or 'A Better Tomorrow', it won't appeal here. But if you do enjoy his adrenaline fuelled style, then you'll likely enjoy it here. And whilst it may not be the strongest of the series, it's nonetheless another fun outing for the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise.",6,0,1,21 August 2015
Midsommar," The Worst Thing to Ever Happen to Swedish Tourism
","We're currently entering a new renaissance in horror, one which has largely been brought on by the many great filmmakers bringing their own unique voices to the genre. There's Jordan Peele who infused the genre with his own brand of social commentary in Get Out, Robert Egger's ability to explore the darker sides of human nature in The Witch and Ari Aster using the genre as a pretense to show us a dysfunctional family dynamic in Hereditary. And Aster continues to keep his horror anchored by his characters in his follow up film, Midsommar.From the start of the film we're instantly thrown into an uncomfortable situation with Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) clearly living in a broken relationship. Dani fears that she has become too emotional and overbearing to him regularly calling him in tears, whilst he is just trying to find a way to easily end the relationship and is becoming more distant to her. But when she experiences a tragedy he decides that he can't leave yet and at the objections of his friends invites her to come with them on their planned trip to a Sweedish village.When they arrive they're embraced by the locals who are about to begin a special festival celebrating life and rebirth and enjoy the scenery where there's always light which causes the days to blend in to one another. At first it seems pleasant, but very quickly this constant light switches from being beautiful to unsettling, to the point where we feel as if we're being drowned in light. It also becomes very clear that these pagan rituals are far more sinister and dangerous than they originally thought they would be and every person in the village is part of it. It's an environment similar to the Wicker Man, where there's a feeling that the threat is so encompassing that there's no way that anyone would be able to escape even if they realise they're in danger.Ari Aster's strong attention to detail is on display throughout the film with each shot constantly conveying information to us. Shots early on are filled with so many hints as to what is to come, including a mosaic at the start of the film which seems to subtly outline the entire plot of the film. He also shows us so much through just the body language of the characters, with Christian constantly looking to the door whenever he's in the room with Dani always looking for a time to escape.But one of my favourite touches was early on in the film during a strange drug trip a character mentions how he can feel the world around him breathing. Then throughout the rest of the film, there are moments where it feels the world around starts to move unnaturally like a lung inhaling oxygen. At times it was so subtle I wasn't sure whether it was really happening or if my eyes were just playing tricks on me.Considering the constant sense of horror which looms over the entire film, there's also a surprising amount of humour throughout. A lot of this humour is brought in by Will Poulter, who seems to be one of the actors with an ability to improve every film he's in. Though there's also a lot of moments during the festivities where I was unsure whether it was being unintentionally funny with the film walking across that thin line between awkward humour and abject horror.Though unlike Hereditary, which was well paced throughout with the story and character dynamics constantly evolving, the last third of this film does seem to stagnate. We already know exactly what's going to happen to these characters, but it's still stretched out by another 30 minutes of slowly going through the motions of these slow rituals. But even in the films slower moments it's still carried by Aster's distinct visual style and a fantastic lead performance from Florence Pugh, whose traumatic screams capture the same sense of complete anguish that Toni Collette did in Hereditary.Oddly enough the film does technically have very positive undertones being a story about coming to terms with loss, understanding the cycle of life and the importance of having a strong emotional support structure. It's just that these lessons are told to us through creepy rituals and horrific acts of violence. It's a strange and unsettling film which definitely won't be for everyone, but if you're a fan of Hereditary and want another film which leaves you with a sense of dread then you should give this film a chance.",8,14,31,6 July 2019
Mission: Impossible," Mission: Succeeded
","In a time where a lot of classic TV shows were being given weak cinematic remakes ('The Flintstones', 'The Beverly Hillbillies' etc.), Mission Impossible overcame this negative trend by bringing in Brian De Palma do his own take of the series. With the gadgets of a Bond movie, the pacing of a Hitchcockian thriller, and the stunt work of a great American action movie, De Palma was able to breath new life into a classic show and begun one of the most enduring film franchises in recent memory. It stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, a professional spy, who along with his team accept a mission to retrieve an important file and catch the enemy agent who is attempting to steal it. But things begin to go gravely wrong, with Ethan seemingly left as the lone survivor. After this Ethan is suspected of being a double agent and goes on the run from his own agency, setting out to find the real culprit using whatever methods necessary to clear his name.Rather than going the route of more recent spy flicks like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' that parodies the spy genre, 'Mission: Impossible' does the exact opposite. Instead it indulges in all the clichés, with elaborate disguises, high tech gadgets, high octane explosions, double crosses, and many surprise twists. Although one problem with these twists is it's quite easy to poke holes in them, since they're often done with no foreshadowing and there's little logic behind the characters plans. But this never really matters, for this is a film that lives in the moment. These twists mostly exist to draw us further into the nail biting tension and succeed at doing so.In spite of De Palma arguably being best known for his iconic shootouts, such as the ending of 'Scarface' or 'The Untouchables' stair sequence, here our lead never fires a single gun. Instead of using standard action shoot ups or fist brawls, the film delivers tension with 3 unique action sequences: the opening infiltration of the ball room; the vault heist dangling from a wire on the ceiling in the middle of the film; and the final chase involving a helicopter following a high speed train into a tunnel. The ballroom sequence works as a brilliant introduction to this world of spies. We see the cool gadgets, their detailed plans and how similar to other great spies like Bond they keep a sharp wit whilst they do it. At the same time the scene remains unpredictable, with so many things going wrong that it's really uncertain of who will get out alive. Then comes the iconic vault heist where Hunt dangles from wires to steal data from a heavily secured vault. This scene has to stand as one of Palma's greatest contributions to cinema. It may take influence from other great heists like Jules Dassin's 'Riffi', Palma still adds his own unique take on the concept. Largely by bringing so many great elements together in the scene with slow pacing, great stunt work from Cruise and the way that the scene juggles so many risks from the worker who could walk in at any moment to the sweat dripping from Hunt's head. Unfortunately the final sequence does not live up to the previous two. The basic concept is cool, with Cruise chasing the villains on top of a speeding train whilst a helicopter chases, but unfortunately it falls flat due to execution. Obviously with a scene like this CGI is a necessity, for actually having a helicopter following a train into a tunnel really would be impossible. But 90's effects just weren't ready to portray a sequence like this authentically. Also whilst the concept of a chase on a speeding train is great, adding in a helicopter just seems like overkill and draws attention to the scenes lack of realism in contrast to the previous tone of the film. Although even with this the chase is still entertaining on a basic level, but just fails to deliver the same tension of previous scenes. Besides this it's far from ruining the brilliance that preceded it, with Palma's brilliant execution mixed with the excitement of a great spy thriller allows 'Mission: Impossible' to overcome all the usual expectations of a typical action movie, and is a heck of a lot of fun because of it.",8,2,2,19 August 2015
The Fountain," Monty Pythons Meaning of Life Part 2- The Serious Version
","Aronofsky is one of the most innovative filmmakers in Hollywood today. With each passing film he tries different stories and styles that makes each distinct and memorable. His films won't always be for everyone, but like many great filmmakers he will constantly try new ideas for both his stories narrative and their visual style. Luckily in the case of The Fountain his style flourishes exploring themes of death and immortality. Whilst it did not originally get its money back on release I have no doubt that in time this will go on to be one of his best remembered films. Largely this is because the way the film is shot has a timeless feel. Just like you can watch something like 2001: A Space Odyssey and feel that it could have been made today, through this films practical effects and unique visuals it feels as though it is unlikely to become outdated over time. Each passing visual is a pleasure to look at with the films vivid use of colour and varying set pieces ensuring each passing shot has something new to interest us and no two shots feeling alike. This visual style is effective within the film as it follows 3 different narratives, which the shooting style separates through different styles and set pieces to better distinguish the stories that are set across a thousand years. The only thing that does link the stories are the themes of escaping death, the lead actors (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz) and the similar symbols such as trees symbolising life in all three stories. All of these stories are done in a similar style to something like Cloud Atlas, in that the plots are mixed with no real sense of narrative with events happening non linearly to better build upon the themes of the story. The first of the time lines sees Jackman travelling to a Mayan temple during the renaissance, attempting to become immortal through the tree of life spoke of within the bible. The second follows him as a doctor in the modern day attempting to find a way of curing his wives tumour using a tree that has been found to reverse the ageing progress. And the third is set in the future where he transcends to the stars as just like the Mayan gods intends to become a seed on which the planets may grow. In each of these stories Jackman searches for immortality in a different route. Whether he looks for it through journeying through the forest, through science or travelling the stars, Jackman demonstrates the ways in which a person may search for meaning in life. It's a difficult thing maintaining all 3 different roles, but luckily Jackman's perfect for it using an effective emotional and physical change for each story. It's these distinctions that ensure the story works because we can contrast the different pains that Jackman goes through in each story with each one seeming original rather than just a rehash each time. These different stories can be seen in many ways, with Aronofsky deliberately being vague of its meaning so just like any other great piece of art may be interpreted in many ways. Personally, whilst watching it, I realised that whilst he has been searching for a way of escaping death, he has barely had any time to be with his wife and thus by the end is left with only a few fleeting memories. Furthermore in various scenes we see his attempts at immortality backfire and cause him great pain and suffering, with the entire hour and a half seeing him experience little joy. It thus raises the question of why extend life if it cannot be enjoyed. But this is just my interpretation of the film.The way the film is done it is very open to interpretation, which is one of the main reasons it is so great. I've only just watched it but I know that I'll be wanting to watch it again soon to see what else I can learn from it, because the film seems to have that much to say that I feel I can gain even more from a second viewing. There's so much in the film that I couldn't possibly explain it all in this short review and would strongly recommend watching it to see what you can get from the film. As long as you're open to the depressing tone of the story, you should be able to enjoy the interesting themes and stunning visuals of this underrated masterpiece.",9,4,7,1 June 2014
Joker," The Clown Prince of Comedy
","When Warner Bros first tried to make their DCEU it got off to a rocky start with some of their films struggling to find their own voice. Mostly since a lot of what they were doing was just trying to copy Marvel, ranging from an attempt at their own Guardians of the Galaxy with Suicide Squad or hiring Avengers scribe Joss Whedon to finish filming of the Justice League. But finally it seems DC has found its footing by focusing less on an extended universe and more on just making good standalone movies with tones playing to the strengths of their characters. We saw it earlier this year with the wholesomely hilarious Shazam and we're definitely seeing it here with a film that completely upends all of our expectations for the comic book genre through Joker, a character drama which completely reinvents of DC's most iconic villains.Taking place in a 70s version of Gotham (albeit a version of Gotham which looks strikingly similar to a 70s New York) the film follows Arthur Flecks descent into becoming the Joker. When we first meet him he's already in a bad position. He's stuck in a dead end job as a part time clown, caring for his frail mother in a rundown apartment, he's taking seven different drugs to deal with his depression and keeps bursting into uncontrollable fits of laughter to the point where he's in physical pain. Basically he's just one bad day from complete lunacy and it seems that life is constantly beating him down to give him that one last push over the edge.Even the few lifelines that Arthur does have to his sanity seem to be brutally slashed over the course of the film, with many actions completely outside of Arthur's control such as cuts to social care further isolating him from society. Bus riders treat him with disdain, kids beat him down in the street and we even get an interesting portrayal of Thomas Wayne, who we're so used to seeing from Bruce's idolised perspective that it's a strange turnaround to see him as the snobby rich guy completely detached from the real problems faced by society. Though the way that almost every character in the city is completely unsympathetic is arguably done to a fault, as many characters in the film do end up being one dimensional characters with the sole goal of furthering Arthur's descent.Though in showing us Arthurs transformation in to the Joker, Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the greatest performances of the year so far. The Joker has so many great portrayals, ranging from the pure chaos of Heath Ledger to the comically homicidal showmanship of Mark Hamil, but Phoenix has still found his own way to leave a mark on the character by layering him with a sense of tragedy as we see the pain that goes towards creating a maniac. It's one of those incredible performances where the transformation is so fluid, but so monumental that we go from sympathising with a man beaten down by a cruel system to terrified at a madman capable of tearing a city down.There are so many small touches that really stood out to me like Joaquin's slow transformation from self hatred in to turning his anger on to those around him and that laugh which constantly sounds as if he's about to burst in to tears. Though the part of his performance that struck me the most was the extreme weight loss Joaquin underwent to portray the Joker. Beyond giving us an interesting insight in to his self-harming nature at the start of the film, there's a level of visual discomfort whenever he's on screen in a similar way to Chritian Bale in The Machinist.Beyond seeing his unnaturally frail boney structure, Joaquin said that the extreme weight loss gave him a sense of fluidity throughout the film which really showed throughout the film as Phoenix always appeared to move with such an unnatural liveliness. Some of the films most striking moments are some dancing sequences scattered throughout the film where the Jokers homicidal nature starts to peak out with as his rhythm begins to match up with the films haunting score.It's somewhat ironic that the film received so many criticisms for its sympathetic portrayal of a psychopath given that the same criticisms were previously thrown at the films like Fight Club and Taxi Driver that influenced it. It does seem that this film was placed on a higher pedestal due to its use of the Joker for mainstream appeal, especially when you consider how other recent films from Phoenix such as You Were Never Really Here which arguably portrays violence to killers in a far more disturbing light without receiving the same kinds of criticism. Regardless, it's important to realise that at no point does this film ever glorify violence. And the film does get us to empathise with the pain that Arthur goes through during the film, however it never condones his actions.A lot of credit needs to go to Warner Bros for being willing to provide such free roam to create such a chilling vision of one of their most valuable characters. And even more credit needs to go to Todd Phillips himself, who spent a year campaigning to get his r-rated character study off the ground at a time when action spectacles dominate the screens. Whilst he does cover similar ground to the Scorsese films that inspired him, this isn't just a carbon copy and he really brought a unique vision to the Joker. I just hope that following this films success, Warner Bros continues to experiment with the rest of DC's pantheon .",8,1,2,10 October 2019
A Hard Day's Night," Beatlemania At Its Best
","Originally A Hard Days Night was intended as nothing more than a way for United Artists to gain the rights for the Beatles next album. They didn't think that the film alone would be any good. But instead of becoming nothing but a marketing whore (like more recent music artist films such as the Spice Girls Movie) this film is a classic with clever scripting, a great shooting style and all the charisma of the Beatles making this in to a timeless feel good comedy that's up there with the best music comedies. It's story is simple enough, following the Beatles as they go on tour in London and all the shenanigans they get in to. Throughout it has clever writing similar to that of a Marx brothers comedy, with a mixture of witty dialogue and hilarious visual comedy. On top of this writer Alun Owen captures the Beatles personalities perfectly, making their dynamic that much more believable in the film and further fills us with a real sense of friendship between them all.There are some jokes which have become dated, such as a reference to Pauls uncle being in Steptoe and Son likely to be overlooked by more recent audiences. But most of the comedy in the film does have a timeless feel with most of it based on clever wordplay and silly visual comedy such as the various Benny Hill style chase scenes.Of course, just like the producers wanted, the soundtrack is incredible, coming from a high of Beatlemania, filled with classics like A Hard Days Night and She Loves You in the film. On top of this the music sequences are also very impressive and have gone on to influence many other music videos in the future with a mixture of on stage performances and using the music to accompany the beginning chase scene. This is probably one of the most influential music films and definitely one of the best. It shows the Beatles at the top of their game through great comedy mixed with some incredible music reminding us why the Beatles were so big.",8,0,0,27 June 2014
It Chapter Two," You'll Float Two
","Stephen King films can be difficult to get right. There are some aspects of his writing which are quite hard to put to film, especially when it's a 1,200 page novel that contains a lot of lore that's impossible to condense it to even two movies. But he also has some of the greatest horror movie scenarios ranging from the goofiness of killer cars, the terror of being trapped with your most psychotic fan and of course a killer clown from space taking the form of everyone's worst nightmares.Whilst chapter 1 of It wasn't able to include some of the more bizarre elements of the novel such as the ancient space turtle who created the universe, it instead focused on the battle for survival between a bunch of outcast kids known as the losers and an alien who wants nothing other than terrifying and eating them. Now chapter 2 takes place 27 years after the events of the first movie and the losers have all grown up and almost all have forgotten the horrors of their childhood. But when Pennywise reawakens, they are all called upon to make good of their promise to defeat the evil creature if It ever came back.Though the film seems less interested in focusing on any plot and instead plays out more like a horror anthology film. Similar to the last film, the losers are separated through most of the films run time with Pennywise cornering them all by turning in to their own personal nightmares. This ranges from anything between being trapped in a hall of mirrors to encountering an old granny, at times delivering on a level of brutality that most films usually shy away from.But in spite of the films increased budget, the scares aren't as effective this time around. There's nothing as visceral as the bloody bathroom or as frantic as Pennywise's monstrous form reaching out from a projector. Parly this is because of the absence of cinematographer Chung-hon Chung's who played a massive role in developing the nightmarish visuals of the first film. Also at 2 hours 45 minutes, there is a fair amount of repetition of the standard Pennywise formula. There's only so many times it's entertaining to see the same formula of one of the losers ending up alone, Pennywise jump scare and the loser running away unharmed before things start to get boring.As for the characters themselves, all the new cast are all individually very entertaining. James McAvoy delivers with both emotional intensity. Jessica Chastain carries all of her characters trauma from the first film. And Bill Hader is an absolute treasure who's able to make anything hilarious. However as a group they don't share the same chemistry as their childhood counterparts, mostly because similar to the original TV miniseries the dynamic of young childhood friends is just more fun to watch.And at the core of the movie once again is Bill Skarsgård's unhinged Pennywise. He's one of the few recent great movie monsters with an unsettling presence whenever he's onscreen, always moving in an unnatural twitchy way.It's just a shame that Skarsgård is often only limited to being part of brief jumpscares and isn't given enough time, with the film favouring some more generic CGI monsters instead of just giving Skarsgård more time to deliver on some psychological terror. Overall watching It kind of feels like walking through a haunted house at a carnival. You'll get a few good jump scares and you'll have some good laughs, but not offering anything which is likely to resonate in any meaningful way.",6,0,2,8 September 2019
Finding Dory," Dory Never Reaches the Same Depths As Nemo, But It's Still a Lot of Fun
","Whilst Pixar has a deserving reputation for being one of the greatest animation studios of all time, their sequels have tended to be a lot more hit and miss. The second and third Toy Story films are some of the studios best works, but its other sequels 'Cars 2' and 'Monsters University' are probably the studios biggest disappointments. As for finding Dory it's probably somewhere between these two extremes. It doesn't quite live up to Finding Nemo, but it's still a worthwhile sequel that still better than the mediocrity of 'Cars 2'.Taking place about a year after the first film, Dory (Elen DeGeneres) has started a happy new life with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence). But one day when helping out with a class trip at Nemo's school Dory see's something that remind her about her family and she realises she has to find them. Knowing what it's like to lose their family, Marlin and Nemo go with Dory on a journey across the ocean to find her family. Their search quickly leads them to an aquarium (wisely changed from being located at Seaworld after the Blackfish documentary) where Dory rediscovers her roots and remembers her life before she found Nemo. It's a good story and one that does feel like an organic development from the first film, but it does feel like a step down from Finding Nemo. Whilst the journey still allows for a lot of emotional moments, there's never the same feeling of urgency or danger as there was in the first film. Plus everything just feels like it's happening on a smaller scale this time. Instead of focusing on a vast adventure across the sea, it's much more scaled down from Finding Nemo taking place almost entirely within the aquarium. It's still a fun setting, but it fails to recapture either the epic scale of Marlins adventure across the ocean, or Nemo's hilariously confined setting of a dentist's fish bowl. Unlike Cars 2 where Mater never felt like he was a strong enough character to be the lead, it really felt natural to have Dory become the lead. Dory has such a likable personality and DeGeneres' incredible comedic timing makes it difficult not to love her. Plus she's still able to have a lot of powerful emotional moments, including one dramatic sequence that shows her before meeting Marlin and searching the sea for years slowly forgetting her family across her lifetime. It's also a lot of fun to see Albert Brooks return as Marlin and it's nice to see how he's become Dory's surrogate family. But Nemo's return was a little more disappointing. He's still the cute and kind clownfish that we knew from the first film, but he never really has much to do in the film other than just tag along. There's also a range of new aquatic creatures that the gang encounters when they're exploring the aquarium. There's Destiny (Katilyn Olson) a blind whale who Dory knew as a child who offers a friendly glimpse in to Dory's past. A pair of kind sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) who want to do nothing but nap on their rock. Though the best addition is a octopus with a missing leg named Hank (Ed O'Neil) the loner who is says he's helping Dory for his own gain, but is shown to be a creature with 3 hearts of gold. He's also a real scene stealer with a dry wit and some really creative and over the top sequences showing him getting around the aquarium. Seeing him blend in to environments and sling himself across the aquarium does lead to the most visually creative sequences of the film. Parts of the film does seem a little too over the top at times. Even for a film with talking fish, some moments where we see fish flying through the air or at one point even driving a truck seems a little too unbelievable. But it does always remain fun. Plus whilst the film shares several story ideas and characters to its predecessor, it's still able to remain wholly original by introducing its own ideas about family and has several scenes that will be able to resonate with audiences of all ages.",7,1,8,29 August 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Reminds us of the heights that cinema can soar to
","In Birdman's opening moments then we are introduced to Regan (Kearon) as he meditates in his underwear and levitating a few feet off the ground. It is a rare moment of tranquillity that he rarely gets throughout the film. But it is not long before the Skype alarm goes off and he is thrown back into a world that continuously mounts the pressures upon him as he tries to mount a stage show to revive his career and reclaim his former glory he had when he played the hero Birdman.It is this lurking shadow that appears to haunt the entire film with his conscience acting as a dark reminder of how far gone his heyday is. As he looks to the sky he imagines soaring once more to the heights he previously had above everyone else in the world. On top of which he constantly tackles the fears that this stage show is going to be a failure and he no longer has a true place with the fear that he just doesn't matter any more.The film makes some interesting statements on both the current nature of modern cinema (with his thoughts telling him that all people want now is explosions and monsters) with the desire to be respected and validated as an actor but fearing he will never get this recognition he deserves. As these pressures build with the constant drumming that follow us throughout the film, we are brought to boiling point as we witness the pressures that past fame can be and the dark daemons it can create. Iñárritu's vision of combining the entire film into what appears to be a single continuous shot is one of the most ambitious pieces of filmmaking in recent years. Just like any theatre production there is no chance for error with every actor, every prop and the camera movement having to work to be perfectly timed so as not to ruin these long takes. In spite of all this risk the film is carried out near flawlessly with all the comedic timing performed incredibly with not a single moment wasted in the film, constantly passing from scene to scene seamlessly. It's a mixture of technical mastery and cinematic genius that Iñárritu has used to create this masterpiece as through these shots he can switch from showing us Regan's reality before transitioning to beautiful and at times dark fantasies as the film blurs the line between the two and throws us in to the constantly shifting mental state of our protagonist as he longs to fly again to the heights he once flew. With the long continuous shots there are many times in the film where the film focuses on nothing but the actors performance to guide the scene. Fortunately the entire cast were up to the challenge with every member of the cast giving a standout performance. Though it must be said that Keaton particularly gives the performance of a life time. Obviously Keatons background as the caped crusader and the many parallels between Keaton's life and the character creates an additional element of relevance. But what really makes him perfect for the role is how he incredibly matches both the comedic tones and the emotional hardships that the script calls for. Throughout every scene Keaton nails everything in the script going from a silly clown one minute walking merrily down the street in nothing but his underwear to becoming an emotional wreck questioning his entire production in the very next scene. The film clearly hinged on getting a spectacular lead and without a doubt they got one in Keaton.Every actor assembled similarly gives a career high performance, with each deserving all the acclaim that can be given. They all handle the long takes in stride ensuring that every line delivers the comedic or emotional punch that the scene calls for. And the script is perfect at facilitating these masterful performances ensuring that each character gets a stand out moment ranging from Stone's emotional explosion as she tells her father that he doesn't matter to Norton fighting Regan in his underwear. Each character in the film is well fleshed out even taking the highlight off Keaton at points. Dark, emotional and constantly funny, Birdman is astonishing. It's flawless performances mixed with Iñárritu's visually stunning style to create what is nothing short of a masterpiece that reminds us the unbreakable limits that cinema can soar to.",10,7,16,11 January 2015
Prometheus," 'Sometimes to create, one must first destroy.'
","Why are we here? What put us here? How far will we be willing to go to find these answers? These are some of the questions that Prometheus raises. Whilst it may not always give us the answers to these questions, the journey to find them is exciting and visually stunning, blending these elements with a thrilling story. Just like Alien before it, this film sees a crew of a spaceship discovering far off alien life. The key difference being they set out to discover it to find their creators. It is because of this goal that each of their personalities begin to play a significant role. Raspace's character is religious, hoping to find her creator to answer her questions on life. Fassenbender's android who appears to desire the knowledge of what it means to be human. Then there's Theron whose motivations remain an enigma throughout the film, but works towards the gain of a corporation. This range of personalities allows the films themes to be explored more in depth with the conflicting views giving more perspectives on the issue.But whilst these perspectives help to raise more questions in the birth of life, at the same time offers very few answers. Much of the film is left either ambiguous or with little to no explanation. But I think I prefer it without the answers. It leaves more to the viewer to consider these meanings rather than spoon feeding the audience its own. Since there is a sequel planned, maybe some of these questions might be answered. But as a stand alone film, it's still an interesting theme detailing mankind's fascination with the journey to find the meaning of life rather than answering the question.Saying this there are areas of the story that do let the film down. For example Fassenbenders character is probably one of the films most interesting, but we don't receive enough information about his side of the story making his arc feel more incomplete. Also juggling so many different characters makes the whole narrative feel like a mess at points. So many plot lines are dropped such as a relationship between Idris and Theron that doesn't seem to have any reason for a presence in the film. But luckily the films stronger plot lines based around themes make up for it.The biggest selling point of this film was that it was Ridley Scott back in Sci Fi. And once again Scott shows us why he is one of the masters of the genre. He creates futuristic worlds like no other, stretching from vast landscapes of other worlds to the detailed insides of a spaceships that create a detailed image of a future lifestyle. Unlike most modern directors who use VFX too much, Scott doesn't let them take over the film. Whilst they are used we still get a lot of decent practical effects with both blending together to create both beautiful and original designs. Both the aliens and the landscape blend realistically together to create some incredible imagery that explores the films theme of life and the development of technology.On top of the interesting themes, Prometheus constantly remains exciting through many intense scenes taking place in a range of landscapes. There are some brilliant moments of both horror and action in a mixture of environments. Some in the futuristic environments of the space ships. Others in the dark caves that they are searching in. There are even a few moments in the more open and barren landscapes between the two locations. It's this range of locations that keeps these scenes interesting by keeping the action varied ranging from the dark, claustrophobic caves where anything can be hiding in the dark to the landscapes where you can't hide and may only run. Whilst it's not his greatest contribution to Sci Fi and has a few flaws with its narrative, Scott shows that he's still got the skill to create one of the most realistic portraits of the future put to film. He realistically simulates every detail of future life on the spaceship from methods of surgery to the androids. Prometheus is a flare of originality in a genre that has become stale and repetitive that will hopefully get a sequel some time soon.",8,2,3,16 July 2014
Shrek," 'For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.'
","Shrek is Dreamworks biggest and best film franchise with 3 sequels, various specials and 1 spin off. But whilst the sequels are good, none even compare to the original. This is a masterpiece in both animation and writing to make one of the earliest and best CGI animated films.This film keeps making me laugh no matter how many times I've watched it. Throughout it mocks just about every typical fairytale cliché, parodying every detail from the brave dashing knight being a big ogre to the helpless princess being a kick ass chick with attitude. Ironically in their parodying of the stereotypical fairytale romances, it also creates one of their best. Shrek and Fiona are such a perfect couple. Every moment they're together it just feels right. Whether they're bonding over being outcasts or just because of their love of weedrat stew the pair just feel perfect for each other. What puts it above the regular Cinderellas and Snow Whites is that they are both very real characters. Both characters have brilliant designs that have extremely detailed and realistic faces so we always see how the feel. Also they have unique personalities to ensure they stand up from the bland hero and princess formula. Then there's Donkey who makes most of the films funniest moments. Just like Williams with the Genie in Aladdin, Murphy makes this role his own with his fast talking voice suiting Donkey perfectly. Shrek remains one of my favourite films of my childhood. Everything from the soundtrack to the voice acting comes together to make this a great film for the entire family.",9,0,1,6 July 2014
The Wolverine," Some of Logan's scars never heal...
","The X-men franchise is back on top form as we finally get the film that we wanted X-Men Origins: Wolverine to be. Whilst Origins stood as a film that repressed key characters like Wolverine and Deadpool (he's called the merc with a mouth for a reason) The Wolverine takes us to the animal, scarred and adamantium core of an amazing character, taking him to new levels unseen on screen before. This success is in great part due to Jackman's incredible return to the role as he once again brings his A game to make the comic book character come to life on screen. Within it, Jackman brings just the right level emotion to the character with the events of Last Stand still haunting him and unable to live life the way he once did. The films plot allows great range to Wolverine as we get to see him both at his weakest, being inches from death and at his strongest where he holds back the least. While elements of the screenplay does have it's downfalls such as lack of character depth for the leading villains, this is more than made up for through the sheer depth finally given to Wolverine to allow for a more detailed version of the character than seen before. Also part of me would have liked to see more mutants within the plot with only around 4- 5 mutants appearing on screen. But after Origins that may not necessarily be a bad thing... Another great part of the film is we once again see James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line) take the directing wheel, which he does terrifically not holding back from the source material and showing Logan as the powerful beast that he can be through terrific fight scenes such as a funeral fight and a train scene. He demonstrates how he doesn't hold back after opening first scene where we witness Nagasaki and the sheer destruction of an atomic bomb showing to us the audience the films realistic tone and that they'll have a blast of a time! (Sorry, couldn't resist the pun.)This is definitely a different film from all other films in the X-men franchise, taking a darker turn to allow a better reflection to better display Wolverine. But despite differences, it serves as a strong addition to the franchise and despite some differences remains loyal to the original The Wolverine comics. Thus this is a must see for any Wolverine fans as it makes the best adaption of the character seen yet. But if you need any other I'll simply say after credits sequence, STAY FOR IT.",8,4,9,31 July 2013
Signs," What a Twist!
","There are different opinions of when was Shyamalan's turning point was in going from being called 'The Next Spielberg' to his name being associated with bad movies and ridiculous twists. Some think it begun with Unbreakable and others his later films like the Village or the Happening. Personally, I've always thought it begun with Signs. Whilst it was received OK at the time, I've always seen it as a mess of a film with dull characters, mostly bland visuals and quite possibly one of the worst twist endings ever put to film. Just like any Shyamalan film the cast seems to suffer from extreme boredom. I say this because from the very start of the film they all seem completely detached from everything that's going on. For example early on when the family dog attacks the children, Mel Gibson's character just seems mildly distracted when he senses something up. Then the kids themselves don't act like they've been attacked but instead like they've just been mildly irritated by something. Ultimately it's a big problem for any drama, because if the characters don't seem to care then why the hell should the audience? It's not the actors fault as for some reason Shyamalan has repeated the same dull monotone style for all his actors ever since the Sixth Sense. The problem being that whilst in the Sixth Sense it was something different to what we'd seen before and worked to create the off- putting atmosphere, here it's boring and makes little sense when it's used in casual conversations. One of the things that bug me the most about Shyamalan's films is that he does tend to put some good ideas and concepts into his films, only to then ruin them. For example there's the aliens themselves. At first they are quite well done with Shyamalan making us fear what we don't see as we are put in the protagonists perspectives seeing only brief glimpses of the invaders. But then he screws it up because when the aliens are revealed they are completely unintimidating and created using incredibly ugly and unrealistic CGI. On top of that the way he has people react at first is interesting with people being very sceptical of whether aliens have invaded. However whilst this could be an interesting background for the story to take place in, it's forced into the foreground and focused on for a significant portion of the film meaning it gets dull pretty quickly.Obviously just like any Shyamalan film this one has a twist. But this film has not just one, but two of the most laughably implausible twists ever put to film. Firstly it's revealed that the invading aliens are allergic to water. Really? These aliens travel all this way across the galaxy and can be defeated by water? I'm assuming that Shyamalan was trying to go for something like what was done in War of the Worlds where the germs are the downfall, but it worked for that because the Martians had no concept of germs and never would have thought of looking for them. Water on the other hand covers most of the earth! Did the aliens never notice this when they were scouting the planet? These aliens were as dumb as the ones from Plan 9 From Outer Space!But that's nothing compared to the twist that god killed Mel Gibson's wife so he would know to tell his brother to hit the alien with the baseball bat. There are so many things wrong with this.... Firstly these are the weakest alien invaders ever. A single baseball team on a rainy day and their invasion is over. Secondly, if god really wanted to send a message then why did he have to kill his wife? That sounds more like the way the devil would send a message! And finally did they really have to be told to use the baseball bat against the alien? Honestly I would have thought it would be obvious! For me this is quite possibly one of the worst twists put in a big box office film just for its complete lack of any logic or sense. It's actually laughable that this story made it into a 75 million dollar film. But that's just what this film is. Hilariously awful. Honestly it was worth watching because it is one of those films that is so bad it's good. I'm rating it low because it fails at the drama and horror that it was attempting. But looking at it in the same vein as a film like Plan 9 From Outer Space it is pretty enjoyable.",4,5,10,14 May 2015
Thor: The Dark World," Enjoyable, but flawed
","Thor Dark World starts two years after the events of 'The Avengers' as a great evil known as the darkness possesses Thors girlfriend Jane Foster (what a random coincidence!). Thus Thor must save her and the rest of the world from dark elves who seek to use the darkness to destroy the universe. The stakes are supposedly higher, but it never feels that way. Even in the final fight then it never feels like Thor is ever in any real peril. The dark elves just never appear as that much of a challenge in the film. Not only do they not pose a threat but they never appear as interesting characters either, even the leader of the Dark Elves Malketh doesn't get much attention. Whilst Ecclestons performance is impressive and the makeup design is interesting, the villain doesn't get any background. Malekth's sole motivation in the film is to destroy the universe. Why? Because he is evil! At least that's all we really get from him. Largely because the dark elves don't get that much screen time. More time seems to get put towards bringing back the fan favourite Loki to the film.This could be good if he were written in properly. But the problem is that he isn't. Loki was only written in after the success of the Avengers and doesn't really have any role to play. They try to justify his inclusion in the plot at times, but the truth is he is there for fan appeal alone. He's the kind of character who you could remove all of his scenes from the film and you'd still get a complete story regardless. Saying this, Loki does still have many enjoyable moments. He still has the same memorable wit people loved from the Avengers and Hiddelston does have quite a few scene stealing moments. Thor is still an enjoyable hero in this one. Though his story isn't as interesting. In the first we got to see his transition from a reckless soldier to a noble warrior to gain the worthiness of his hammer Monjir. But here he doesn't really progress at all. But for what he has to work with Hemsworth gives a good performance once again as the Norse god of thunder. His presence alone is one of great power and his delivery does make for some hilarious moments. On the downside many of the action scenes in the film are pretty forgettable. Largely because most of them don't feel particularly well choreographed. Most of the earlier fight scenes try to look like a big epic battle scene, but they never really feel that way. They'll always be in some interesting backdrops ranging from fantasy cities like Asgard to the populated city of London. But they will usually lack any real sense of excitement that we expect from the Marvel universe. Luckily the final fight does make up for this with a fight between Malketh and Thor stretching across several worlds. It makes little sense with the teleporting between worlds lacking any real sense of cohesive logic. But it still makes for both some cool visuals and funny moments.Out of the entirety of Marvel Phase 2, this is the weakest outing. It doesn't add anything original that we haven't already seen from the marvel franchise. In the end it's really nothing more than mindless action with a little bit of comedy thrown in. If that's all you want from a marvel film you might enjoy it. But if you're expecting the same charm and heroics of the rest of the marvel universe then you'll likely get let down.",5,0,0,22 August 2014
Godzilla," Impressive effects and a cool monster, but not enough of them
","Once again Godzilla roars his way on to our screens, with a big epic path of destruction lying in his wake. Obviously after the failure of the 90's Godzilla, then the director Gareth Edwards had a lot to make up for. Unlike the 90's Godzilla, the film is far more loyal to the original films. For example, it's the military's mistakes that awake an ancient monster who has been dormant for years. As they awaken, mankind's only hope lies in Godzilla to protect them. In one of several nice callbacks in the film, Godzilla and the other monsters are influenced by the use of nuclear warfare, demonstrating the film does have respect for it's roots. But obviously whilst the story remains like the original, the effects have improved vastly over the past 60 years. The monsters definitely look epic and just like the monkeys in Planet of the Apes, Godzilla has been brought to the modern age and gone from a guy in a suit to brilliant special effects. Obviously the effects go towards not only making the epic scale of monsters real, but also their vast destruction with the sight of entire buildings falling as we get to witness our monster pretty much obliterate entire cities. Though, it has to be said the special effects alone are not the only thing that make this film impressive. Whilst the effects are probably the main selling point of the film, the director is not afraid to build up the monster over time, for a large part of the film showing glimpses of the monsters before their ultimate reveal. This is far more effective at emphasising the scale of the beasts in the film and also building up anticipation to get a full view of the monster. He also often shows the camera at the perspective of the citizens looking up at these monsters, placing us in the position of the victim of these attacks.But unfortunately, just like Pacific Rim last year, a majority of the characters in the film feel either redundant or underdeveloped. For example, Brody's family are probably in the film for about 15 minutes and have little character and absolutely no impact on the plot other than being a reason for him to get home. They're an incredibly weak plot device and the film would have been much more successful had they simply been removed from the film to allow for more time towards stronger elements in the film. Similarly, Sally Hawkins character does nothing in the entire 2 hours of the film apart from possibly some exposition that could have easily been done by Ken Watanabe's character. Then there's the lead Brody, who is a very bland hero. This isn't due to the acting, but because we never learn anything about him as a character after the first 20 minutes of the film. It becomes harder to invest in the film because of this due to a lack of empathy towards the character and less tension when he is placed in danger. It's also strange because they were effective at creating a great character in Bryan Cranston who would've been far better as the lead for the film, but instead gets barely any screen time overall. His character actually gets a lot of emotional investment in the first act of the film, becoming obsessed with finding out what had been hidden from him and becoming a crazed conspiracy theorist. But then the focus of the film shifts to his son who was less built up than Cranston was and didn't get any development over the rest of the film. It was also Cranston's great acting as well, being that great mixture of emotional agony and sheer awesomeness, making it a real shame we couldn't see more of him in the film. There's also one other great character that the film has. Godzilla himself. Yes, finally instead of Hollywood treating him as some mindless monster, Godzilla has a personality! He's awesome with the best cheers in the cinema coming from his tail whips and atomic breath making him into one heck of a bad-ass. Along with this also comes his epic roar that remains as timeless now as it ever was. But Godzilla does have one disadvantage. Whilst the character of Godzilla dominates everything when he is on screen and has a very impressive build up, just like Cranston's character he doesn't get enough screen time with a feeling that there were some missed scenes of destruction in the film. This can be said to partly being focused to build up suspense of character, but it's also because the film spends far too much time focused on the other monsters called the MUTO's. This is a shame, seeing as they are not particularly impressive and are fairly generic monsters that you can never really get particularly interested in. What I don't get is why not just use one of the many already existing monsters for the film like Mothra or King Ghidorah who would have made more interesting enemies? Though I guess we can hope to see them in the sequels. Besides, Godzilla is still a good film. It's not as great as it could be, but still has some good elements such as the fights and the character of Godzilla. It's just a shame the film is let down by weaker elements such as spending too much time on characters who serve no purpose. But the film is certain to be a hit at the box office, largely due to the special effects and the name Godzilla which is something of an icon. Also I do feel that in some part the star power of Bryan Cranston will also play a role in it's box office glory due to his strong presence in the trailer and riding off his success from Breaking Bad.",6,1,2,19 May 2014
Minions," Good Family Fun
","Whilst these gooey lemons weren't the focus of Despicable Me, they were without a doubt the stars. As great as Gru was, not a single kid or adult left cinemas without at some point going 'Bannana!' So it makes sense that they should end up getting a movie all of their own, that still has the same great animation and visual gags that made the franchise enjoyable to begin with. It starts out giving a brief back-story for the history of the minions. Turns out the minions have been around since the dawn of time, always following the most evil bosses they can find. But their masters don't seem to last long as the minions end up accidentally causing the downfall of everyone of them, from Genghis Khan to Dracula. After hiding out for several years (leaving them oddly absent from having to work for the likes of Hitler or Stalin), 3 of the pint sized ducklings (Kevin, Stuart and Bob) go off to America in search of a new master in the 60's. Thus they go on an adventure, finding a new master called Scarlett Overkill, stealing a crown and accidentally taking over England. The plot never actually takes any form, never remaining focused for long with the small yellow blobs getting distracted by every passing thing. But with the slapstick and chaos of the minions you don't really need one. It's less of a story and more of a series of sketches for the minions to put them into different situations going from hanging out with a family of bank robbers to being stepped on by the Beatles in Abbey Road. An unexpected joy of this film ends up being the soundtrack. Not just because of the great Minion renditions (it starts off on a particular high note with the minions singing the 20th Century Fox theme), but also just a great selection of classic 60's tracks that should fill parents with nostalgia and introduce kids to some classic tracks. However the film does have one key problem, which is there's too much from the minions. Their slapstick is funny, but it's not enough to carry the film for an hour and a half on it's own and ends up feeling worn out towards the end. The Despicable Me films mixed in Gru's brand of humour where he played the victim, that stopped the minions slapstick from becoming repetitive. It's also lacking the same emotional core that a character like Gru brought to Despicable Me, with his bittersweet story of a man becoming a father being far more engaging than a crazed villain wanting to own a crown. But whilst the minions work much better as side characters, this spin off never feels like a misfire. It still has enough humour to be fun for the family, but just lacks the same level of rewatchability as previous films of the franchise.",6,0,2,14 August 2015
The Nice Guys," Shane Black Remains the Master of Buddy Cop Comedies
","On a basic level The Nice Guys works like any buddy cop movie. Great action, well developed characters and a decent story to hold it altogether. But just like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the real strength of The Nice Guys is how Shane Black is able to both mock the clichés in the action genre, many of which he helped to create in films like Lethal Weapon, whilst paying homage to all the action tropes that made the genre what it is today.Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer whose work mostly includes freelance work of beating up someone for whoever's willing to pay. He has considered becoming a licensed private investigator, as he wants to give real help to some clients, but he doesn't want to pay for the licence. He's a nice guy, but he's not that Nice. Then there's Ryan Gosling as Holland March, who is a licensed investigator and father to a thirteen year old girl. He spends most of his time accepting cases from old people with dementia paying him to find their recently deceased spouses, constantly screwing up and spending most of his time trying to drown himself in Bourbon. Even his daughter calls him a bad person. After one old lady with bad eyesight hires him to find her niece, who is a porn star who had recently died in a car crash. Thinking the job is easy money to just confirm the girl is dead, March takes the case. But he quickly discovers the girl could be alive. This causes him to cross paths with Healey, who is hired to burst in to March's home to threaten him and get him to drop the case. Before leaving he casually asks March a few questions about his life as a private investigator and how he's able to afford such a nice place on an investigators salary, before calmly breaking his wrist and leaving. It's a good tone setter for their relationship for the rest of the film. But Healey quickly realises the case was bigger than he thought it was and wanting to be a 'nice guy' decides to work with March and solve the case. Very quickly they fall in to a case filled with 70's pornography and government conspiracies. It's part Boogie Nights, part Chinatown and all tied together with Shane Blacks tongue and cheek charm. Similar to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, one of the films greatest strengths comes from the charismatic leads of Crowe and Gosling as the mismatched duo investigating the case. Crowe delivers all his lines in a great deadpan style, whilst Gosling goes out of his usual element, giving up his usual macho man image in order to play a Buster Keaton style slapstick performance. Sometimes they seem like the smartest guys in the room, chasing obscure leads and coming up with good results. Then at other's they seem like a pair of idiots getting by on pure luck alone, such as one scene where Gosling accidentally stumbles down a hill and ends up discovering a dead body. They are both screw ups, but they screw up in such charming ways that we can't help but to continue rooting for them. The film is also able to avoid the annoying cliché used in films like War of the Worlds or Commando where the child ends up serving no role in the film other than being a victim and a plot device. Instead March's daughter is written with the same charm and depth as both March and Healey. Angourie Rice also pulls of a great performance working very well with all the other actors in the film.Shane Black both wrote and directed the film and he definitely plays to all of his greatest strengths through the films mixture of great comedic timing and sharp dialogue. He also works in all the clichés that you'd expect from his work, even managing to fit in one scene at the end randomly set at Christmas (since it just wouldn't be a Shane Black film without a little festivity). Ultimately it's a film that keeps you laughing throughout and by the end it leaves you wanting more.",8,3,7,10 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a lovely film!
","It's been 30 years since George Miller last showed us the insanity of his post apocalyptic Australian wasteland, with the long gap partly being due to the film's production being almost as chaotic as the world the film is set in with the film is set. It had many difficulties including being stuck in development hell for years, filming being repeatedly delayed, and difficulties in securing locations to shoot the film. Miller had plans to do the film as far back as 2003 with Gibson intended to reprise his role but took a further 10 years before tuition. But fortunately Miller persevered through all this turmoil to once again to return to the driver's seat of the franchise and create this masterpiece that is his best film yet.At the start of the film we watch as Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by an army known as the War Boys ruled by a dictator known as Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Shortly after being captured one of Joe's soldiers called Furiosa (Theron) drives off in an armoured fuel truck with his wives so that they do not have to bare the children of a monstrous man and tries to drive to her childhood homeland. Because of this Joe sets out with an army to chase her down and Max is used as a blood bank attached to one of the chasing cars. Eventually after freeing himself he joins Furiosa and helps in fighting off the legions of War Boys sent by Joe in a non stop chase spanning the entirety of the film. And when I say non stop chase, I mean non stop chase. From the very opening of the film to the end they don't go 5 minutes without some exciting action sequence with almost the entire scene being part of some chase or fight scene. Whilst under a lesser filmmakers control such action could be repetitive, Miller keeps it original by varying the action sequences and the beautiful scenery making it a masterpiece to watch.Also the action is all so well made. In contrast to a lot of recent blockbusters like Fast and Furious, most of the film is done with practical effects and stunt work with CGI used very sparingly making for a much more high octane and realistic action sequences. They pull off everything in this film flipping cars, people dangling from or even jumping between speeding cars and even being engulfed flames. It's hard to tell who's more insane, the people coming up with these incredible stunts or those who take part in them. The scale of the stunts alone is impressive, but the consistent creativity and range of the stunts within the chase should keep any fan of action gripped to the screen. On top of the mayhem of the chase sequences, the entire world is absolutely insane. It's strange to think that the same mind to create the likes of Happy Feet and Babe: Pig in the City also creates a world like this with the likes of woman having their breasts milked as a resource, a legion of pale thrash metal dressed soldiers and vehicles ranging from a tank plated gas truck to a barge led by a guitarist who shoots a flamethrower out of his guitar. It's a compliment to Miller's imaginative style that he can create such a bizarre whilst progressing the story and having constant action. Beyond carrying out incredible stunts, the cast also give some impressive performances. Tom Hardy does a great job filling in the dusty leather jacket as Mad Max. We're quickly reintroduced to him at the beginning of the film so newcomers to the franchise are familiar with his back-story with Max explaining how he lost his family and blames himself, with their loss leaving him with nothing but the instinct to survive. Oddly this short explanation of his character is the most that Hardy speaks in the film. Instead of dialogue Hardy conveys most of his character through his look of exhaustion as a man who has been through far too much. Then there's Theron as the metal armed and strong Furiosa who is amongst the likes of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Michelle Yeoh in Supercop as one of the best female action heroes. She often steals the show in the film as a more human character than Max, although just as dangerous as he is at one point even brawling him and showing herself to be just as deadly and resourceful as he is. There's a great deal of mystery to her back-story, with most of her history just being hinted upon. Also similarly to Hardy, Theron communicates so much through her hardened look showing herself to be the product of the destroyed world in which they live.I just love everything in this movie. I love the detail in the way that all of the cars are adapted for the desert environment. I love the beautiful bright cinematography. I love that the chase lasting from start to end never for a second loses steam. Miller's imagination mixed with an incredible crew has created a glorious Symphony of madness and violence unlike any that had come before it. Apparently Hardy has already signed on for three more Mad Max films and with Miller's creative mind behind them they'll definitely be something to look forward to.",9,3,14,8 June 2015
The Godfather," 'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.'
","The Godfather is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for good reason. It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form. It revolutionised narrative as rather than telling the story of one character, Coopla built up a life style by showing these criminals in both their everyday life and when under threat. The story spans 5 years, showing us every detail of how the mafia operates. We see everything from their joy at a wedding to their shaded business meetings where death is talked about callously without guilt.When violence is used Coppola never holds back. He will show every gruesome detail with faces gasping for oxygen, the blood trickling down their skin and the intense screams of pain of the victims. It is this realism and details that make many of the most memorable scenes as it was one of the first times that a film used such realistic violence. The film probably has one of the greatest casts assembled to a film with so many memorable characters. Even with a 3 hour runtime, many of these characters don't even play that large a role in the story or even get too much screen time. But the actors get their roles down so incredibly that they build their own character through the way they speak or the hesitance of talking against a powerful figure like the godfather. Throughout the film doesn't have a single weak performance. But of course the stand out of the cast was Brando. I remains one of cinemas most memorable performances, with his introducing shot alone being one of the most recognisable images in cinema with his calm reaction to being asked to kill a man. He becomes the image of power inciting fear into even his own assassins who stutter when talking to him. Certainly Brando is the film's most iconic role, though sometimes overlooked is Pacino with one of the most memorable transformations in film going from a respected war veteran to violent crime lord. Far more emotional than his father he is hesitant about violence at first, but quickly becomes accustomed to the violence of his life of crime. By the end of the film he doesn't second think killing his own step brother as an act of vengeance. Pacino was perfect at emphasising this change with both the tone of his voice and rage in his eyes creating the real image of a man who has changed over the years. But it's not quality alone that has made this film so memorable. What makes The Godfather such an icon of cinema because it represents what all films should try to accomplish, by taking risks that no other film would make. Coppola was never afraid to show the detailed violence or take risks by experimenting with narrative, because he wanted to make his own unique vision on screen. It's for this reason that it has become timeless, representing a masterclass in filmmaking and reminding us all of the innovation that makes us love cinema.",10,1,2,4 July 2014
