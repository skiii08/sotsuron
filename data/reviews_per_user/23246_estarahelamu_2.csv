The Lobster," The F was that?
","I am sure the story has come from some really interesting conversation that the screenwriters had had once, (I imagine them as people complaining how the dating scene in the world sucks) but I don't think they had delivered it on the screen. What a waist of time. If you are not one of those people that pretend they are somehow deep, then do not see it, or at least lower down your expectation. The music was good though.",1,2,4,16 April 2017
Doctor Strange," Fun ride for Saturday night
","If you like Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock you will enjoy this adventure as well. If you are also in awe with the idea of Matrix, this movie is for you for sure. I loved the humor and appreciated the long set up for some jokes.The casting had been done amazingly. I only think that the movie was too condensed and the plot was rushed, series would be the right format for this story, in my opinion.",9,2,3,2 May 2017
