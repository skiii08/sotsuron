The Blair Witch Project," It's... okay
",It kept me entertained for 87 minutes. But maybe only 3 of those were kinda scary. And of those 3 maybe 10 second were really scary. I don't know what everyone was talking about saying this was such a scary movie. The whole Drew Barrymore phone call in Scream (until everything became a bloody mess) was more suspenseful and frightening. But 'Blair Witch' is okay and worth seeing as long as you don't mind not being scared.,Null,1,2,16 July 1999
