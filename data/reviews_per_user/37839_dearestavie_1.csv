Source Code," great movie
","This movie surprisingly amazed me. I didn't think much of it when i took my dad to see it with me for fathers day. I admit the beginning was kind of slow but it was all necessary. Its the kind of film that you can watch more then once and I hope that they will becoming out with a second source code movie. Jake gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan are very talented actors and played their roles extremely well. They were very believable and kept me off of my seat. This movie kind of reminded me of inception but it really wasn't at the same time. Its a great clean movie, no sexual scenes or people getting their heads chopped off. It did have a little bit of language though and one F bombs i think but this movie is defiantly worth seeing.",9,0,1,20 June 2011
