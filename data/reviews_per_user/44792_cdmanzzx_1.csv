The Avengers," Definitely Worth the Money on Opening Day
","I went to see this movie opening day with my uncle, brother, and father. I thought I was just going to leave with the expression 'It was just a movie.' Boy, I was wrong! I left the theater with the biggest smile on my face. The characters, the action, and the special effects are what made The Avengers put a smile on my face.I have to say my favorite characters were Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Captain America, and Thor came in second, and the Hulk, Iron Man, and Loki came in last.I'm not going to spoil it. Just see the movie. It'll be worth your time, and money10/10",10,7,14,28 June 2012
