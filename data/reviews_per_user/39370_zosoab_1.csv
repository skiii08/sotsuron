Skyfall," can I give it a zero?
","The only thing bond about this flick are the incidentals (his name is bond, he works for mi6 etc.) Everything else feels generic. Honestly, I tried to give Craig a shot, I really did but I shut this and casino royale off halfway through. There's just nothing there to hold your interest. The plot is near nonexistent, if it's in there,its so drawn out and disjointed you just stop caring. The characters are forgettable, if not down right despicable. The action is nothing you can't see in a thousand other flicks. I get that they wanted to humanize bond, make it more believable, but all they did is suck the life out of it. Go watch a Bourne flick if you want drama and grit. This has none.",1,9,17,6 May 2015
