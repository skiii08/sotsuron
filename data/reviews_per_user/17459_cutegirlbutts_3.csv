The Monuments Men," You can't make us care Clooney.
","George Clooney took (from what brief research I did on the events)an important story and something by the sounds of it is really worth telling and essentially just made OCEANS ELEVEN. It's a bunch of actors running about together having fun (though half the time it seems like some of the cast neither wants to be there or even cares slightly, yes we're looking at you Bill Murray). It's dull, thinks it has some sense of pedigree with it's all star cast and Clooney behind the camera and it's just full of boring stereotypes and clich√©s. I do not care about THE MONUMENTS MEN and someone could have made a film where I do. It came out at the start of the year when studios dump any old trash. This is passable trash.",4,0,0,14 November 2014
Gravity," A new cinema experience
","Alfonso Curon's film is just pure evidence for why we still need and should be going to the cinema. It demands to be seen on the biggest 3D IMAX screen you can be find, boasting an excellent sound system. I wish I avoided the trailers (which were essentially extended scenes) and went into this one blind. The spectacle of this film is wondrous and you find yourself deeply absorbed in the blackness of not only your massive multiplex but in the space the 3D screen provides a window towards. The film offers you some of the most incredible imagery you've ever seen upon the screen, intense survival action and great character work (Bullock's performance outside of a genre film would be heralded even more than it already is). If you didn't see this at IMAX when it came out or the biggest 3D screen you could get to I pity you, but then again you were probably told enough to do so. I won't be watching this again for a very long time, because without the beautiful technology to back it up you're not doing this masterpiece justice. I've never seen anything like this in my life",9,4,7,6 March 2014
American Hustle," Hilarious and Larger than Life
","All of the leads are outstanding in this film. Amy Adams as the soul- searching and sharp witted lover, Bradley Cooper's FBI agent jumping between violence and using his perfect timing for hilarious comedy, Jennifer Lawrence's absurd and over-bearing housewife and Jeremy Renner's big hearted good intentioned Mayor who balances out some of the more insane and unrealistic characters. Finally Christian Bale, who at this point I pray, pray, pray will continue to work with Russell to develop a relationship of continuing to bring us these over top, multi-layered characters like which we've seen here and earlier in THE FIGHTER. This is a wondrous film filled with over top characters which the film has plenty of time to really study and peel apart. One of the funniest of the year a dark comedy with excellent characters, Watch it.",9,2,6,6 March 2014
