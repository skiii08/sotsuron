Come and See," Emotional Roller-coaster
","This film depicts the historical significance of the Nazi German invasion of a small town in Russia. As we are invited to 'come and see' the horror and trauma a village encounters, we are only given a taste of the large scale disaster. With unforgettable scenes, Elem Klimov puts forth a great effort to capture the audience and take them through an emotionally exhaustive but equally important roller coaster ride. The cast includes a group of talented actors who are able to express the intensity of their emotions through limited dialog and powerful facial expressions. As difficult as it is to witness this terrible genocide, this film is one that deserves our undivided attention.",8,1,1,16 June 2009
