The Ring," Great story but.....
","Gonna keep this short. What the Japanese version Ringu (1998), the meaning of water for Japanese people, the way it was shot, symbolism and the over all plot development is, to this day, is phenomenal. Dated yes, but can stand up on its'own.Sadoko in the Japanes version is just freaking scary. Those who have seen it, know the well scene can scare the living daylights out of viewers. Nevertheless credit is due to the American version where the lead female character Rachel, played out by Naomi Watts is more fleshed out and modernized. This may be a cultural thing, but the Japanese Reiko Asakawa comes across as submissive to her male counterpart.The ring a a great movie and the pacing is well constructed, but if you have seen the Japanese film first, than you may end up not liking this film.",6,0,1,1 October 2017
The Danish Girl," Yawn...sorry did I miss something?
","Where do I start with this film? Over all the film had all the elements for truly memorable film: right cast, perfect script, fantastic costume, production design excellent, the locations were superb and lighting was perfection. The whole movie visually looked like a painting and it felt so wonderful. The Director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler (screenplay) at the helm of the movie production what could go possible go wrong?Well the trailer did what it was suppose to it-to draw you in and make you want to watch this film. It has sense of intelligence, of being a great movie based on a true story along the lines of The Kings Speech (2010). Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe played by Eddie Redmayne, was the first transgender to have a sex reassignment surgery. His story dealt with prejudice, acceptance, and biases in the 1930's. What the Hell happened? The pacing made me want to fall asleep, its as simple as that. This film was put me to sleep. I could not connect with any of the actors on film. Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe came across to me like a selfish douche bag and kept on crying and crying. My God how He/She cried and I get it he/she is insensitive but for God sakes grow a backbone! My pet cat is tougher than the Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe.Alicia Vikander plays Gerda Wegener, the wife and to me she was the only realistic person in the film and even then, she doesn't get enough credit. She is the most supportive film character throughout the entire movie and the wanna be transgender husband is so caught up in his own dramas that when she asked for a bit of emotional support he/she just doesn't care.So, I wonder if the film would be better if they actually cast a transgender actor in the lead rather than a Caucasian male playing a transgender, much like Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club (2013).",1,8,15,22 July 2016
Milk," Sorry, not for me
","I tried very hard to watch Milk, as Sean Penn is a very good actor and he deserves an Oscar or two. But I just could not get into this film. About 10 minutes into the film, found my mind wondering about I was going to have for dinner. About 20 minutes into it, I got bored and restless. Then I started to tapping my feet - I really need to go to the shop to get bread, coffee and something for my dog. And the story was very interesting truthful at first glance,which is why I purchased a ticket with my friends. I guess it lagged in some areas and slowed to a crawl in scenes. Not sure whether it was the screen writers fault or the director. Sadly, I lost interest in the movie, and prayed it would hurry up and end. Toilet break was a blessing, even visiting the food stall levitate the zombie like state I was in. (I could of escaped and ditched my pals but good friends are hard to find).Everything was excellent, the cast, the costume for the time this movie was set in, the lighting and even the acting. Still I'd rather watch paint dry than watch this movie.Wish I can give it more credit, but I honestly can't. This film was not for me.",1,16,34,20 January 2011
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Great story
","MlFantastic Beast and Where to find them is directed by David Yates, who directed Harry Potter and the order of the Pheonix (2007), Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince (2009) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 (2010) and part 2 (2011). Which goes a long way as David Yates is very familiar with Harry Potter. This movie has a stellar cast of talented people. Eddie Redmayne, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Colin Farrell and Dan Folger. The academy award for costume is well deserved. Look at how the costumes not only enhance the actors' performance in their gesture, moment, and posture. And the textures and colours of the 1920 costumes look at authentic and pleasing.Don't go to watch this film as you would a Harry Potter movie. I personally found this movie far more entertaining than Harry Potter movies. Go watch it. If you like it good but if you do not then..hey. it is okay.",10,0,1,18 September 2017
Ghost Rider," Great fun with no expectations
","If only Columbia Pictures and it's associated studios could have waited and made this film after Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017). This movie should of been rated 'R', with all the blood, gore, violence, sex and filled with every curse word under the sun and blessed with a solid storyline and exceptional director. Nevertheless, whilst it is cheesy, with poor dialogue, a God awful script and the plot is pretty basic, it is actually an enjoyable film.The Good: 
(1) The Special Effects for the Ghost Rider. Whenever he is on screen, blazing on his motor cycle with his flaming skull, the film picks 10 fold. The part where he jumps of the skyscraper or when Cage morphs to the ghost rider is fantastic. But those parts are far and few between in the film. 
(2) The A-grade actors in a (essentially) B-grade film. What this means is, there are a number of surprisingly good actors ( Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze and Eva Mendes as Roxanne, Sam Elliot as the Caretaker) which bring their all to a poor script. Yes the dialogue is laughable when it is delivered, but that is what makes it so enjoyable. Raquel Alessi could easily have been a Eva Mendes younger twin sister.
(3) The Western tones interwoven in the film is great. The Bad: 
(1) The villains are so weak. Peter Fonda as the Devil gets a pass. Only because it's really good to see him on screen. BUT Wes Bentley, as main nemesis Blackhearts should of walked when he read the script. He has some of the movies worst dialogue. Sadly, unlike Cage and Mendes, he simply does not have the 'knack' for delivery and his lines are dreadfully executed.
(2) People who put a lot of themselves in film usually indicate they love the source material, so it is very difficult to understand if Mark Steven Johnson was either a writer/director with no balls to stand up to the studios or it was simply a job to him, (3) The plot is a no brainer. Boy loves girl. Boy mets Devil. Boy makes a deal with the Devil. Boy loses Girl. Boy becomes a flaming skull. Boy meets girl again. Thankfully the Ghost Rider, is a marginally better written script, then most Hollywood blockbusters such as Star Wars:The Clone Wars.The Ugly: 
(1) The biggest problem is Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze. In a nutshell....he was cast wrong. Look a the actor Matt Long who played an 18 year old Johnny Blaze to then 42 year old Johnny Blaze played by Nicholas Cage. The film really is asking a lot for the audience to believe they are the same person.Don't over analyse the film too much, because it create lofty expectations. Films like the Ghost Rider is a guilty pleasure, with great action, a uncomplicated plot and exceptional special effects. Hopefully this franchise gets a robot in the future and upgraded to 'R' rating.
PS: was going to grade the film at 7 BUT that awesome soundtrack song at the end credits by Spiderbait reworking the song 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' pushed it to 8",8,1,1,31 March 2018
12 Years a Slave," 12 Minutes Of Bored To Death
","My God, how the Hell can any anyone give this movie anything above 1 star let alone Oscars. This has to be the most hyped up, BS, dribble drooling, crap I've ever seen. People and critics alike are stating it's the best thing that ever happened since sliced bread...really? 12 years as a Slave is over melodramatic, lacking historical context and quite simply boring as hell. This movie lacked soul and plays on the heart string of anyone who ever was a sucker for such BS dribble.It's not the actors fault this movie sucked. It had exceptional actors: Michael Fassbender,Benedict Cumberbatch , Paul Giamatti and Brad Pitt. A stellar line up expect for Lupita Nyong'o AND SHE WON THE Oscar FOR HER PERFORMANCE. She was the weakest of the cast and her acting was over dramatic to the point of nausea. Truly I dare you to compare the scene where she is being punished with the whip to Denzel Washington's performance in Glory (1989) and seriously think who truly deserved that golden midget statue?Chiwetel Ejiofor, as Solomon is mis-casted as the lead. His character really doesn't develop much, which is the reason the audience don't fully engage with him. Sure we follow his journey and feel sympathy but along the way you realise Solomon is a douchbag. He is suppose to be intelligent, articulate and..well...smart. Come on dude! where's the personality. Seriously, it that does not translate at all through the screen. I reckon the book is better on character development and empathy. The editing and pacing was choppy that it makes you want to pull your hair out. It was all over the place and it is very noticeable in the beginning of the movie. The first and second act were slow but the haste to put the main actor in the south was rushed, and so was the ending. And the costume, what the heck? 36 minutes into the film and you realise he's the only slave in the bayou wearing knee high boots? Say what???I'm not even gonna bother with Steve McQueen as a director...he is really not worth the effort. What is truly bothersome is scenes are left hanging and there is no follow up, or any explanation of what is going on and why. Where's the back story to the main characters & supporting characters? Where's the humour to add lightness and texture to the movie up after a heavy sombre screen (the beatings) like in The Color Purple (1985) or the interaction of the supporting characters. The script was the only thing that made sense but the execution of the story was poorly done. When you think about it you've seen the story line before with a sadistic boss and a slave:- put Lupita Nyong'o as a slave Jewish maid and Michael Fassbender's character in a Nazi uniform and in WWII. Wham!! same relationship scenario in Schindlers List with Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) and Helen (Embeth Davidtz) only better direction of their relationship and the dynamics of it.If anyone wants to see a film about the human spirit and triumph over evil view Schindler's List (1993). For those you are interested in a the plight of the slaves in America see Roots (1977). It might be dated but it's better that the sordid mess called 12 Years as a Slave.",1,10,21,1 May 2016
Centurion," An interesting tale to tell
","At first when you see the gore, the blood and hacked off limbs, you think this is going to be another rip off of Ridly Scott's 'Gladiator'. Then you see the blue paint on the warrior's skin and their axe wielding ways, and it's a rip off of 'Braveheart'. Well it's not. Centurion is about the legendary 9th legion, marched under orders, into the heart of the Picts and was never heard of again. 6 soldiers survive only to be hunted down by a vengeful Etain and her warriors. I have enjoyed this movie because firstly the one big thing I noticed was the cinematography and the use of the wide lens to capture the wilderness of the Scotish highland. Sam McCurdy vision is sublime. Not a soul to be seen for miles, the scenery looked beautiful yet at the same time dangerous as you can see the actual cold shivers of the actors and the breath coming from their mouths. (That's were most of my 6 of my star votes going to).Secondly, costume and set design, looked all authentic, even down to the shoes. I found the Picts garment to be well suited to the climate, while the Roman's wore a much more sturdier clothing. Not overly powering elaborately designed as in Gladiator, but that's the difference between a Hollywood budget and the British Film industry. The props were cleverly done as was the set for Roman garrison and the village of the Picts. Thirdly, the actors: Olga Kurylenko as Etain was a much more realistic character then the skinny, barely covered Kiera Knightly in 'King Arthur' (2004). She's tough, resilient and vengeful, not one part of her is soft, vulnerable and feminine. Being mute made the actor rely on other methods to convey her feelings; she stand her own ground when it comes to fighting with the men. Centurion Quintus Dias played by Michael Fassbender,certainly looks the part of a Roman soldier. Strong, dependable, loyal and sturdy. His acting was very good and I can only put it down to the harsh conditions the actors were in on location shooting. The supporting cast are good, wonderful to see Liam Cunningham as the veteran fighter, full of wisdom. The man is a GOD!!!Lastly, although this production is flawed (i.e. actors riding saddles) and too much blood and gore, this is overall a very entertaining film. This is not an Hollywood epic nor a history lesson, it has a simple plot and action...don't take it too seriously.There is one thing that I disliked about the film is the ending; not one of it's strong points. It was cheesy, clique and pointless...I won't put a spoiler comment, only you have to see it yourself.",8,1,3,27 February 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Just an OK movie
","Where do I begin? Lets start with the good stuff... Firstly there is the music score by Danny Elfman gets a big stamp of approval.(barely). Secondly, Cimentogrphy by Seamus McGarvey was fantastic and beautiful. And lastly, the over all Style of the film with production design was sleek. So what was the issue. It is in my opinion:CONTROL: the author E.L. James massive ego killed it for me. It is very difficult to translate a book to film successfully but it can be done. Schindler's List, Gorilla's in the Mist, The Great Gatsby, Silence of the Lambs and Atonement to name a few. But with this film it's did not come across. And this is a prime example of the author, E.L. James having too much control on the source material. Whenever the film tries to be a movie because somethings in novels cannot be translated into a visual medium, E.L.James practically chokes it back to a novel format. Slap my forehead, Fifty Shades has the full symptoms of The Phantom Menace. We've seen this happen with George Lucas controlling influences and his team of 'yes' peopleCASTING: the two main leads Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornam; two good looking people who 'should' have and can act. But in Fifty Shades of Grey they both look like this is their first acting job. There was no soul or believable in the characters of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. So it comes down to casting. If the leads are right..like Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone With The Wind..the film can be good. And sometimes exception, for example, Lord Of the Ring trilogy.WRITING (SCRIPT). The story is very simplistic. Boy meets girl. Fall in love and they go through the tribulations of a relationship. But likes kinky stuff, girl doesn't like it but she has hit the jackpot. She has successfully nabbed a billionaire. So she goes along with it. Script is so bad that a 5 year old could of written it better. And it has E.L. James in the writing credits. A middle age woman with no previous experience as a film writer. There are parts where you get the feeling something is right, or important information for the audience are glossed over. Scenes that need further exploration are abruptly ended. Dialogue is stiff and goes into the territory of...oh God help us...yep...Daytime television. CHARACTERS:. Ana is poorly develops, weak and needs a man to rescue her. She has no ambitions a of a modern woman, no driving force that motivates her to follow her destiny. NOTHING!!! No interest, no hobbies, no backbone. Christian JUST is dull and boring. A handsome man with absolutely no real character arc. Is he arrogant? NO Is he an interesting person? NO Does he go through life changing events in the movie which affect him and Ana, he grows and become a different person. But do we get this on screen. NOPE the audience has been ripped off. Christain is the same person as he is in the beginning. Think about, what truly changed him as a character, what event categorically changed the fundamentally of this character. And there it is again, what were all the characters motivations in this movie? Sadly all the characters lacked connectivity with the audience and came across as fake.I don't want to trash Fifty Shades of Grey like many critics and reviewers, because honestly, we've seen worst. I will say this is an OK movie not a masterpiece.",5,0,1,1 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," OMG it's mediocre Star Wars: The Mary Sue Awakens!
","I waited for it come out on home rental markets; for that I am grateful I had the foresight to do so. I WAS BORED OUT OF MY FRIGGIN' MIND!!!.Here's the good points: good action sequences, sound and noise crew did a fantastic job and set design. A thumbs up for the special effects and Kylo Ren stopping a blaster shot in mid air. Now for the bad points:
 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY: Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) they never together in a single scene. What the HELL!!! It has been rumoured that director JJ Abrams and his team of writers wanted to audience to focus on the new character. And they had absolutely no idea what to do with Luke Skywalker that they his appearance at the end with no dialogue? Because they feared audiences would focus on Luke and not the new character. An iconic character and legendary Jedi Master is reduced to a cameo because they lacked the balls and imagination to let Mark Hamill be Luke? Shame on you Disney.SCRIPT: lazy writing of the dialogue and plot. The lack lustre plot is a direct plagiarism of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. There is no original thought of a new story- it's wasted opportunity to individualise The Force Awakens. Nothing is explained about the First Order, no exposition to the audience on how the Star Destroyer was built without anyone knowing about it. But hey, read about it in the novels, comics etc. Sadly, it is ,obviously, a Disney production of a movie that has $$$ for merchandise, capitalising on the nostalgia of the Star Wars movies- A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.ORIGINALITY: forget originality for interesting aliens creatures. Costumes (Han is wearing the same clothes as in SW4. Ray is dressed like in flowing feminine clothes in the desert planet Arrakis, sorry I mean Tatooine,er sorry Jakku. It's amazing she has not been overpowered and/or stunned by raiders and sexually violated and/or sold as a sex slave. Her costume should be a practical and hide her curses, like Arya Stark in Game of Throne . AND can we please have a strong female lead character like Ahsoka Tano in The Clone Wars?. Bare bones of any character are and many question leaving you with blue balls. Ship designs are ok but nothing special. CHARACTERS: no development or likability in the leads and supporting character (both real and CGI). Look at the 4 main ones-(1) MARY SUE: It took Luke Skywalker time as an apprentice to learn all about the force, how to use it, how to use a lightsaber and to be a jedi master. In The Empire Strikes Back Yoda warned Luke not to go to save his friend because his training is incomplete - Luke goes and gets beaten by Darth Vader. Rey learns the force, wield a lightsaber like a pro in 2 minutes, fight and overpowers an experience Forced user(Kylo Ren), is an expert with the Jedi mind tricks, can fly the Millinium Falcon better than Han, knows everything without being trained AND understands droids and Chewie! What is unbelievable is there is no subtle hints that, Rey is Force user let alone seen anyone use it. She a desert scavenger with limited knowledge BUT can do everything. Thing are handed to her for plot convenience. Rey is a Mary Sue - a character who is perfect at everything which makes it very hard to like. By the way Daisy Ridley acting is mediocre. IF I WANTED TO WATCH A KNOW-IT-ALL person, I would go to work because there are dozens wannabes there. Also Daisy Ridley needs to learn to close her mouth when acting, cause it's distracting.(2) THE PROTAGONIST: actor Adam Driver is good actor (better than Daisy Ridley) but Kylo Ren is poorly written character. He has a mask on for no apparent reason, whinges all the time, damaged property, kills/harms his own men and has anger management issues. Kylo Ren has no menacing presence compared to Vader. AND how did he get Darth Vader's mask? Was it not burnt on the funeral prye in Return of the Jedi. Kylo Ren real named Ben Solo. WHY? Obi-Wan Kenobie (Ben) never had a connection with Leia. Han never actually, spent time with Obi-Wan in a New Hope. So it would make more sense if Luke had children to name of of them after his first mentor. However this movie should be about Kylo Ren's and not Rey. How he got seduced to the dark side, why he is conflicted, show why the the Knight of Ren faithfully follow him. He is by far the most interesting character in the film, despite his EMO ways.(3) TOKEN: Finn,played by John Boyega, bad casting, is just a token black person in the movie. Did you ever wonder if this movie would of been different if the character was Asian looking or a female from another planet? Finn is a low level sanitation worker who just happens to knows plans on how to defeat the Star Destroyer? He whines all the time, a coward and is immediately friend zoned by Rey. This sweaty character should of died in the desert from lack of water and heat exhaustion. (4) WASTE: Poe is a soulless character. Lets forget him. TONE: the movies Tone changes way too fast. JJ Abrams doesn't know who to capture somber moment For example in beginning a village is destroyed, Max Von Sydow is killed, Poe is captured and brought before Kylo Ren. Poe makes a joke - villagers are murdered and there is humour? Finn and Poe are best pals at the end but Poe killed Finns friend in the beginning? INJUSTICE: Leia needs a map to find him? WHY...they are connected. Leia is Force sensitive and Luke's twin. It would make sense for Leia to learn about the Force and it's powers, thus be MORE connected to her twin brother. Unfortunately the kick- arse, flawed, headstrong, no nonsense princess is a delegated to be a side lined cheerleader boring General. Why are Leia and Han portrayed as poor parents? Sadly Han Solo killed by his EMO son, surrounded by strangers, but there is no small emotional scene with Chewbacca. Leia immediately hugs Rey after Han dies but no moment with BFF Chewie. Bad ass Chewie is treated worse than any other OT characters, he is just a walking carpet for Disney to wipe their feet. PLOT ARMOUR: all the character, with the exception of Han Solo and expendable extras, have an iron cast plot armour. Not once did it feel like the actors were in serious trouble or could die at any given moment....oh yeah let's not forget Rey is on the sidelines to save the day...again.MUSIC: THE MOST ICONIC SCORE IN FILM HISTORY IS REDUCED TO WHITE NOISE. There is no emotional connection to melodies except Reys theme. Disney made an error not to allow John Williams do his magic within the time he were given. Remembers, in SW4, Luke looking at the suns on Tattoine and the music swelling up or the Imperial March. The Forces Awakens score is just OK. It isn't great, memorable and uplifting, it is just OK.HOPEFUL: Disney to do a SW movie based on the online game The Old Republic. Look on Youtube and search for The Old Republic clips 'Betrayed' 'Return', 'Hope' and 'Knight of the fallen empire'. But it is dubious Disney will do justice to the 'Old Republic', based on the crap by JJ Abrams...I could go on and on about this, but I am so tired of this movie that I'm gonna watch something else. Maybe Spongebob Square pants or something along those lines",1,19,22,3 July 2016
