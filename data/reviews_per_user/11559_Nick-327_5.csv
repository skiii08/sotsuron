Akira," One of best anime films
",Akira is one of the best anime films It's quite boring to start of with but it gets better. Nobody can beat the great Ghost In The Shell but this film gives ago at it. I liked the the dark bike gangs that was a very good inclusion of the film. When the film ends it will leave you very confused as it did me so i recommend to watch it once or twice more. 7 out of 10,Null,0,1,14 September 2002
Predator," Arnold's best film!
","Predator is a wicked film. It's a film that keeps getting better and better and better and when it ends it leaves you wanting more. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives he's best performance to date.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Great Great Great!
","This film is great! Everything about this film from start to finish is good. The acting was good from ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER,ROBERT PATRICK,LINDA HAMILTON and EDWARD FURLONG. The music is also very good,i a big lover of film music and classical(the music was done by BRAD FRIEDEL) I strongly recommend the DVD of T2..it's brilliant it's got over 6hours of content, it also has over 40 special features including never seen before footage and it has the digitally remastered special edition,director's cut. 10 out of 10",Null,1,1,14 September 2002
The Truman Show," Very Well Done
","Jim Carrey dropped his trademark mugging and played it straight in this superb satire. When strange things start to happen, Truman Burbank(Carrey) begins to suspect that he's perfect life in the perfect American town is not what it seems. In fact, he is the unwitting star of a world-famous TV show and his entire life has been manipulated. What will he do when he eventually discovers that he's every move has been filmed by hidden cameras and watched by people all over the world? Touching, Thoughtfull and funny, this is a very special film that works on lots of different levels and was nominated for 3 oscar's. also starring Ed Harris",Null,0,1,16 February 2003
