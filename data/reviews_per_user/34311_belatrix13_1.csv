Marie Antoinette," Why was it rejected?
","I just don't understand why most critics didn't like that movie and they were so negative towards it.And the fact that it was so laughed at in Cannes is really weird.Personally i thought it was an excellent portrayal of Marie Antoinette because Coppola tried to support her in a way.Also,I think it's great because it's so different from the other costume dramas.Coppola managed to combine the past with the present by using for instance this wonderful music by bow-wow-wow,the strokes etc...What's more,Dunst in the role of Marie Antoinette accomplished her mission and finally showed that she is an actress worth to watch.And let's not forget of course the fabulous Jamie Dornan...He alone would be a very good reason to watch the movie...",9,0,1,13 July 2007
