United 93," Intense ... and not conflicted
","I'm 45 years old. I served 8 years in the military. I've seen lots of things I don't want to see again. This was the most intense movie I have ever seen. It took me about an hour to fully disconnect from it.The lack of big-name actors makes a very realistic movie even more real. The use of the pseudo-hand-held style of filming (it has a name that escapes me for the moment) is a bit distracting at first and something I've never liked. But I got used to it after a while, and it actually works to its best advantage inside the plane.We don't know everything that really happened on that flight. But we know enough to piece things together. We know the passengers did fight back.The terrorists were not conflicted about their actions. And the passengers were not conflicted about who their enemy was.Remember 9/11. And remember United 93.",10,2,4,4 May 2006
