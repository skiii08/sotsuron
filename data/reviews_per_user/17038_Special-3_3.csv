Ghost," A Great Romantic thriller!
","Ghost is a very entertaining film on many different levels.  It has something for everyone.  Humor, romance, action, mystery, the supernatural and even a few scares.",8,4,5,4 February 1999
Chinatown," It's a real classic
",This is a real classic film that takes you back in time as you watch it. After 25 years this film still packs a lot of punch. Everytime I watch it I discover something new.,8,0,1,31 January 1999
Dumb and Dumber," Classic Dumbfest
","Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels experiment in all forms of stupidity in this laugh-a-minute comedy.  There are too many side-splitting scenes to name but Daniel's toilet scene and Carrey and Holly's race up the stairs are just a couple of in your face howlers.  If you're looking for intelligent comedy, read the title; if you want to just flat out laugh till it hurts, rent it today!  My rating: 8",8,0,0,26 January 1999
