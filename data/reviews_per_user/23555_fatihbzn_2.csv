The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Worth Watching
","The movie is worth watching. Although it seems a teenage movie, it can also be watched from more variety of people. The soundtracks are really qualified. Also, the movie gives great stories from lives of the characters with bunch of many different emotions; sadness, happiness, craziness. These emotions can be easily followed from the characters behaviour and sayings. The movie is converted from a book. I did not read but there are also positive comments about the book. -spoiler- - We accept the love we think we deserve - Can we make them know they deserve more? - We can try. -spoiler- 'you can't be yourself until you be yourself with someone else together.'",8,0,0,2 March 2014
Room," Outstanding Performance ; Sad Story
","Really worth watching the movie. Outstanding performances from not only Brie Larson ( which already brings Oscar) but also Jacob Tremblay. We can all be surprise how big imagination of the children's can be. ~spoiler~ Grandma referring the room: Wasn't it awfully small? Child replies: It went every direction,all the way to the end. It never finished. I love the story and the movie. Yes we all love happy endings. However, the story reminds us that such stories can be real and we are not lucky to always have happy endings. Hope, that this story will not be only for having a great 2 hours and we show our sensitiveness for such realities.",8,0,4,31 January 2016
