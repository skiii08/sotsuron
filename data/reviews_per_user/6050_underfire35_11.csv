Minority Report," An Uneven, Though Creative Film.
","In MINORITY REPORT, the 'PreCrime' division of crime prevention has come to pass. Through a group of 'floating' clairvoyants, a murder can be seen before it happens. John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the top dog over at PreCrime, has found himself in the center of one of these 'visions'. He now has thirty-six hours not to commit the crime he is being hunted for; this he does, and at the same time, trying to figure out who framed him and solve another murder. All the while unsure whether this predetermined fate can be altered or not. Sound confusing? It's not really and the film-makers handle the material well.However, the one thing this movie is is uneven. Spielberg here tries to capture the same tone he did in the INDIANA JONES films, but does not quite manage it. What we end up with is over-the-top humorous moments: the chase in the factory (which is essentially a high-tech update of Charlie Chaplin going through the gears of that large machine); the whole sequence with the 'eye doctor' (Peter Stormare) is all one-liners and physical comedy. Juxtaposed against these scenes are ones of uninspired drama: the rest of the movie. Spielberg fails to find that fine-line that he has walked in so many past projects (though I'm not sure what he was trying to do in his other recent sci-fi film, A.I.). This is not helped along by John William's score (film music fans will accuse me of blasphemy here), which is oppressive and terse.All that said, MINORITY REPORT is still a very entertaining, well made film.The story of MINORITY REPORT is based on a short work by Philp K. Dick. Dick has sown fertile ground in Hollywood (TOTAL RECALL, BLADE RUNNER), and some not so fertile (SCREAMERS, IMPOSTER). He is a writer of great wit, humor and vision. Dick has published dozens of books and volumes of short stories, which will make him attractive to sci-fi film-makers for years to come. I think Spielberg has come closer to capturing the tongue-in-cheek feel of Dick's work than any other film adaptation. It still remains to be seen if someone can make an epic and silly science fiction masterpiece in his name. 7/10",7,0,0,18 March 2003
Se7en," A Dark and Brilliant Film.
","My first introduction to the work of David Fincher was the oft panned ALIEN 3. While I hated this film less than most people, I was impressed by the overall look and the visual style. Several years later Fincher hit movie audiences in the face with SEVEN, which is a masterpiece of dark creeping atmosphere.SEVEN follows the exploits of Detectives Sommerset and Mills, while on the trail of a killer who is violently acting upon the seven deadly sins (greed, sloth, pride, etc.). When broken down to that simple sentence, the film has the potential to collapse under its' own concept. The way the material is handled, however, shows inspiration and commitment by the film-makers. The movie is brutal and realistic; the murder scenes are unpleasant and not for the squeamish. The make-up effects by Rob Bottin are quite grotesque, especially the killer's 'prisoner' who is found chained to a bed.Morgan Freeman in the lead role finds the right balance between professionalism and frustration as the killer continues to elude him. Brad Pitt as Det. Mills, the new kid in town, is layered, with just the right amount of maniacal fervor. This is especially important considering Mills' actions during the conclusion of the story. If the character had not been established, the ending could have seemed forced or contrived. The way Pitt portrays this smart, but angry man, gives the film the push it needs to pull off the final act. Kevin Spacey, a third-act inclusion, covers much developmental ground in a short period of time.Behind the scenes there dwells much talent: the photography by Darius Khondj is so good you can almost smell certain scenes, Arthur Max's prod. design is decaying Gothic in nature, and the pounding percussive score by Howard Shore rattles your nerves (Shore later went on to score The Lord of the Rings films). Andrew Kevin Walker's story is sharp and has an explosive resolution. David Fincher's direction cemented him as a film-maker with a distinct style and he has proved this in subsequent projects (although I am in the minority for hating FIGHT CLUB, yet this is mainly because of the story, not Fincher's direction).It is true that not every single element of the film works, but I admire SEVEN simply for the scene where Sommerset goes to the library(!) to help solve the case, which is something you don't often see in your run-of-the-mill thriller. 10/10 Quick Trivia: in the published screenplay the ending takes place in a swamp; this actually makes sense considering that the characters are still in close proximity to a city where it rains on a constant basis. It also contains the opening scene that was cut from the film (it was later restored via the special edition DVD). The screenplay, itself, is also a good read, and of interest to fans and film-buffs.",10,0,0,8 March 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Disney Theme Ride Come TO The Big Sreen...Oh Boy...
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is an expensive film.  It looks expensive, and was more than likely expensive to make.  It is a film about cursed pirates.  It has lots o' CGI effects (my favorite), but fails at using them in any new or interesting way.  Geoffory Rush and Johnny Depp (as a high seas Keith Richards) seem to be having a blast, but then again they are being payed a whole lot of money (see note above on film's expense).The musical score, by Klaus Badelt, is carbon copy Media Ventures crap (and to think he replaced Alan Silvestri...), and probably cost a good penny in and of itself.  Let's just say that if I didn't have a girlfriend, I would have never seen this film.Okay, the bad points:  On a general level I find this film disturbing. It opens the gates of hell and, upon its success, will prompt Disney to churn out colorful products that do nothing more than promote the corporate giant's theme parks (did anyone catch the trailer for THE HAUNTED MANSION, looks good...sigh...).  One can almost feel the hairy mouse-like tendrils closing on the jugular of American film.  Mark my words: there will be a 'It's a Small World' movie and when that day comes may God help us all.  5/10.",5,1,2,23 July 2003
Hotel Rwanda," An Important Film About An Often Ignored Subject.......
","When it became apparent, in 1994, that genocide was impending in the African nation of Rwanda, much of the west deemed the people of that impoverished country 'unworthy' of aid or resources. On the part of the United States, Rwanda was low on the list of priorities; fresh from the Bosnia conflict, and interventions in Haiti and Somalia, the US did not want to risk involvement there. A small unit of UN peacekeepers were deployed, but suffered under heavy restrictions. They were given little money and outdated equipment. When Rwandan president Habyarimana's plane was shot down in April, the dam broke and Hutu flooded the streets out for blood. The minority Tutsi were considered the enemy and were targeted by roadblocks and constant radio broadcasts calling for their extermination. Moderate Hutu also came under the blade of the machete (the preferred weapon of the masses). What started as essentially a social conflict, or what most thought a prelude to civil war, erupted into chaotic slaughter amongst a poor and uneducated populous. Bodies lay strewn in the streets, in the houses and rivers. Even before the violence reached its apex, and the term genocide became unavoidable, the world powers seemed to have forgotten Rwanda and left the country to burn.It is in the city of Kigali, during this period, that the film HOTEL RWANDA takes place. It focuses on the real life story of the manager of a five-star resort named Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who has found himself integrated into the 'style' of the west. He procures fine cigars and expensive whiskey for his foreign visitors and for the military elite who frequent the hotel. He is a Hutu married to a Tutsi woman, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), their children being of mixed blood. When the violence of April 1994 reaches his doorstep, he does everything he can to save his family, but finds himself a part of something larger. As the situation worsens, and the UN forces diminish, Paul uses his money, limited resources, and social contacts to protect the hundreds of people who sought the hotel as a refuge. He quickly realizes that there will be no intervention; the scenes involving Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the frustrated UN peacekeeper, are pointed as he explains to Paul that the world does not care about him or his country. It is hard to deny that elements of racism played a part in the decisions of world powers and Paul feels betrayed by the false prophet of the west. In one of the most poignant scenes, Paul watches as foreign nationals are evacuated from the hotel. A busload of white faces pulls away, and with them the security forces, leaving the defenseless group of Africans to meet their fate. But events leave little time for self reflection, as there are almost hourly threats against the hotel and the people inside. Eventually the payoffs and bribes no longer work and Paul is left only with words, which he uses to play on the fears of men like General Bizimungu (Fana Mokoena), creating a sense of power he does not really have. After words fail, only hope remains.Don Cheadle, who plays Paul Rusesabagina, is truly memorable. It is an important performance, and rare, where the actor ceases and only the character remains. Observe the scene when, having returned with supplies, Paul is overcome by what he has viewed on the roads. Cheadle is mesmerizing here, but he is just as nuanced in the smaller moments which makes his breakdown all the more effective and real. He does not falter for a moment. Sophie Okonedo is just as good; she is strong and avoids the 'woman in peril' clichés so prevalent in film. It is Nick Nolte who reminds us here that he can be an actor of great depth when given the opportunity, and the entire supporting cast helps immensely. HOTEL RWANDA marks a departure for director Terry George, who is from Northern Ireland, and has worked almost exclusively with Jim Sheridan on stories about that region. Here he creates tension without gimmicks and allows the characters to develop. He puts a human face to the abstract bloodshed of Rwanda during the massacres, but avoids preaching or over sentimentalizing the harrowing subject matter. The cinematography, production design and music help George in recreating the time and place. HOTEL RWANDA seems effortless in its portrayal of the events, but these are, in fact, the hardest films to make.It was difficult for me to imagine a film about the genocide in Rwanda as having a PG-13 rating. In a way it is good because the film will reach a wider audience and shed light upon a recent atrocity which was ignored at the time and has been largely forgotten since. Having seen various documentaries on the subject, read participant's accounts and seen chilling photographs of rivers choked with corpses, the true scale of violence was staggering. HOTEL RWANDA does not quite capture the brutality and horror of the events where mobs of people used sharpened car parts and bicycle handles to kill Tutsi as well as Hutu 'traitors.' It instead chooses to focus on the personal story of Paul and his efforts. He is a brave man who saved the lives of many through his efforts, although chance seems to have played a large part. The film should also help us look ahead to the events in the Darfur region of the Sudan where many of the same things are happening today and which has been obscured by other world events. The message of HOTEL RWANDA seems to be that something like this can happen at anytime, in anyplace, and that each instance is as worthy of our attention as the next. I hope this film will continue to have an impact but in the long term it is people, not films, that will make a difference. 10/10",10,0,0,22 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Awful, Simply Awful....
","Let me preface my comments here by saying that I am a fan of Science Fiction (I even capitalized the term!), and admired the original three films...however what the hell happened?  THE PHANTOM MENACE was simply forgotten, but ATTACK OF THE CLONES is simply an embarrassment of screencraft.Short list of problems:1.) Some of the worst performances in recent memory.  Did that kid in the lead win a cereal box-top contest or something?  It doesn't matter though, he'll have to live with himself for (almost on his own) sinking a film with the STAR WARS name, he should be bagging my groceries.  Portman, who has more costume changes than screen time, is hardly there at all.  And I am supposed to swallow that those two are in love, I wasn't convinced that they were in the same room.  [A brief aside:  I did enjoy the speech about how the queen was the opposite of 'irritating sand' and was so 'smooth and soft'...I've used that line and have been met with mouthfuls of pepper spray once the laughter had died down...]2.) Are any of the effects anything other than CGI guys working on their portfolios?  There are so many computers at work in this film that it loses any kind of organic reality.  I still contend that light hitting real cloth cannot be duplicated by a computer.  And what is with the blue/green screen work, it hurts my eyes...a little advice to Mr. Lucas: build a set!  I demand to know who thought that the CGI Yoda was a good idea, the fight scene near the end made me cringe.  I felt bad for everyone who was involved with that debacle.3.) Lucas betrays and besmirches the original characters created in the first three episodes.  I have lost respect for the following: Yoda, Boba Fett, Ben Kenobi (what's-his-name is no Alec Guiness), the Emperor, Darth Vader, the Sand People, The Force, George Lucas, John Williams, droids, American cinema, the Death Star, etc...4.) Some of the worst dialogue around.  You would think if Lucas could not handle the screenwriting, he would of handed it off to someone else, but no...What the audience is left with is insipid drivel (see the 'Sand Speech').In short if ATTACK OF THE CLONES had spent even a quarter of the running time on the actual development of the characters and narrative, instead of expensive bloated set pieces, it could have been at most watchable.  I will not see the third film...how will 20th Century Fox ever recover having lost my nine dollars? That ought to show em'. 1/10.",1,1,3,21 May 2003
Batman Begins," A Better Beginning...............
","I did not want to want to see BATMAN BEGINS. Viewing it in the theater required the temporary lifting of my boycott of mainstream American films. I've been dragged to far too many 'blockbusters' in my day and have dished out ten hard-earned dollars for disappointment in return. Hollywood does not make films that very much interest me, but when I saw the credits block for BATMAN BEGINS (the cast, the director, the crew) I was intrigued. I eventually broke down and went to a matinée showing of BATMAN BEGINS and was greatly impressed. This however does not make me wrong about Hollywood. It simply shows that if you have a strong creative force behind a film, not even the devil himself can suppress it completely.BATMAN BEGINS begins at the beginning of the Batman saga. As the film opens we meet a younger, more troubled, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) who, while imprisoned in Asia, is approached by the mysterious figure of Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard represents the League of Shadows, a cultish organization of men who have extreme views on what is right and what is wrong. Wayne trains with them, but ultimately cannot accept their philosophy and returns to Gotham City where, as a small boy, his parents were murdered. We discover that it was a failed attempt at revenge for the death of his parents, as well as a fateful confrontation with a powerful crime lord (Tom Wilkinson), that drove him east to live the life of a criminal. In Gotham he reunites with his family's trusty servant Alfred (Michael Caine) and his childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). He also reunites with his family's vast fortune and resources. Troubled by his demons and the moral decay of Gotham City, he begins to fashion the alter ego of Batman. Under this guise Bruce Wayne starts to take back the the streets of Gotham and purge his own feelings of remorse over his parent's demise. He makes a connection with 'one good cop' Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and builds up his armory under the watchful eye of Alfred and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who is head of the Wayne Enterprises warfare technology department (which answers the question 'Where does he get those wonderful toys?' from 1989's BATMAN). When Batman disrupts a routine drug sale, he discovers that there is a deeper conspiracy that threatens the whole of Gotham City. I'll stop there, although the plot should be pretty familiar to those who followed the comic book/graphic novel series.BATMAN BEGINS adapts a much darker tone than the previous films. The psychological profile of Bruce Wayne, as well as the other characters in the film, are explored with much more depth and care than one would expect. Director Christopher Nolan (MEMENTO, INSOMNIA) who, along with writer David S. Goyer, has fashioned an exciting, yet observant , story in which to place their well executed set pieces. Nolan is a young filmmaker who seems to have a firm grasp of technique. He treats the characters not as pawns in a video game, but conflicted people who do things for a reason. In a field that is dominated by CGI effects that make the impossible seem implausible, the action sequences in BATMAN BEGINS have a certain gravity to them. The fight scenes are murky and tight; the chase sequences are ruled by the laws of physics and not by the laws of the cheap thrill. This film also moves away from the comic book bad guy as such. The characters set against Bruce Wayne are not 'bad' in any clear sense, but fragmented individuals who have adopted misguided ideals. They have no quirky deformities, brightly colored hair, or freeze rays and it is because of this fact that the foils of BATMAN BEGINS are all the more frightening because we can identify with them on a certain level.I don't think that I've ever made specific mention of any casting agents before, but they deserve special mention for BATMAN BEGINS. John Papsidera and Lucinda Syson have assembled an amazing group of actors. Christian Bale seemed an unlikely choice to play the lead role; the chance pays off, as Bale plays on Bruce Wayne's inner conflict and creates a character that is more than just a rugged jaw line under a mask. Liam Neeson is perfect for the role of Ducard, as a man who is more comfortable issuing sage advice, but can still fight masterly if provoked. Michael Caine does wonders with his limited screen time, as does Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, and Cillian Murphy. It is great to have an actor like Rutger Hauer in a film like this and even better to see Gary Oldman in an important supporting role. It would be interesting to see the whole Batman saga restaged with this same cast and crew, but it seems unlikely that another film would be made, seeing that BATMAN BEGINS leads directly into Tim Burton's BATMAN. As a stand alone work BATMAN BEGINS is a strong film, and it is easily the best of the series. 9/10",9,6,9,17 July 2005
Moulin Rouge!," A Nauseating Film........
","MOULIN ROUGE is quite simply a physical assault on the senses.  The viewer is attacked with pop-culture sensibilities and a highly marketable soundtrack. This is not helped by the director, Baz Luhrmann, who will not let you forget that you are watching a film directed by Baz Luhrmann.  Enough, we get it, you have a distinct visual style, that's great...now make a watchable film.  I made it about half-way through his ROMEO + JULIET before I had to take half a white valium. This 'resurgence of the musical' simply sweeps an arm across Billboard Music's top twenty list and arranges such classics as 'Like a Virgin' and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' as over-directed large-scale musical numbers...wow.  This film vomits garish style and dated cinematic techniques to the point where it becomes unbearable.I understand that Nicole Kidman's character was supposed to be vampish, but c'mon, Elvira had more nuance than this.  Ewan McGregor is the only one who narrowly escapes this mess (although he should not sacrifice his film career for one in music).  There are more characters doing jerky, sped-up backflips than any one person should have to tolerate in a single production.  The story...huh, was there a story?  If there was, Baz Luhrmann did not handle it very well. A trendy, self indulgent waste of time.   1/10Quick Story: While viewing this film in the theater, I was so overwhelmed with desperation, that I unlaced my boot and crafted a make-shift noose.  I proceeded to wear this about my neck all through the movie and continued to do so following the film.  I got some strange looks from my fellow movie-goers, who seemed to have enjoyed MOULIN ROUGE.",1,3,6,8 March 2003
Saw," At Least I Didn't Pay To See It...........
","Since when did the prerequisite for being a serial killer require a BA in graphic design and an extensive knowledge of spot welding? The murderer in SAW seems to have a flare for the dramatic and time on his hands, never a good combination. As the film opens we find two men caught in the thinly constructed web of said psychopath. They are Adam (Leigh Whannell, who co-wrote the script) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes, THE PRINCESS BRIDE), and they are chained to the walls of an abandoned bathroom. There is a dead man in the middle of the floor and a clock on the wall, it's a pretty nice clock. Anyway, they each listen to a micro-cassette on which the voice of the killer explains his wicked hedge maze of deceit and horror. They are given clues and begin to piece together what little they know about the situation they find themselves in. Oh, and there are pointless flashbacks to the killer's previous crimes and of two cops (Danny Glover[?] and Ken Leung) who hang around because a movie like this needs cops who do that. We learn more and more about the two men as the clock runs down towards the hour of our killer's ultimate evil crescendo.........I blame several previous modern films for the the likes of SAW and its ilk. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for creating the hyper-intelligent icon of killer as genius; THE USUAL SUSPECTS which launched the 'twist ending' that doesn't have to make sense as long as the movie is stylish; and SEVEN, which spawned the serial killer as moralist avenger. SAW uses all these conventions and mixes them all together and adds some irritating MATRIXesque CGI set-ups for, seemingly, no reason because they undercut the tension by speeding up scenes which, if played straight, would have been grueling and dramatic.Truth is is that SAW is just another film entry in a group that includes such films as MINDHUNTERS and THE CELL, where whatever loosely constructed plot gets buried in a wash of the screen writer's own prescient cleverness and some production designer's fetishistic vision of the 'mind of a killer'. SAW isn't as bad as either of the two films mentioned above (a movie has to have ambition for that, which SAW doesn't), but I can't help thinking that Hollywood dragged the fetid lake of quickie psych-horror flicks so they could make a few bucks on the Halloween crowds marching through the theaters over the weekend looking for knee-jerk thrills and high volume musical stings. And if SAW is sold out there is always THE GRUDGE. 3/10.",3,0,0,1 November 2004
Army of Darkness," An Army Of Entertainment.......
","MILD SPOILERS!!!!The question is often posed: 'Why is a film of such dubious merit so beloved by so many people?'  The simple answer is is that ARMY OF DARKNESS is just so much fun to watch.  It remains director Sam Raimi's campy throw back, a film that preserves the traditions of B-grade cult classics and Ray Harryhausen's stop motion special effects.  It exudes such delight at the act of making a movie, of telling a story, it is hard to resist.  It is not a great film but it is an entertaining tale complete with an army of skeletons, knights on horseback, foul demons, a beautiful female lead and a Delta 88 Oldsmobile.ARMY OF DARKNESS opens with the ending of EVIL DEAD II, which sees Ash (Bruce Cambell) deposited in the middle ages via some kind of magic portal (the actual physics on this are a little sketchy), only to be enslaved. He is eventually released to seek the infamous book of the dead, which has the power to purge evil from the kingdom forever.  This journey is perhaps the highlight of the movie.  As Ash wanders through haunted grave yards and battles miniature duplicates of himself, the full scope of the film's comedic intentions are developed.  All this leads to the climactic battle sequence with the forces of the undead (although some of the magic is lost when so many of the spring boards used by the stuntmen are plainly obvious). Will evil rule the day, or will good etc, etc.The charm of ARMY OF DARKNESS falls mainly on the shoulders of the main character, Ash.  As portrayed by Bruce Campbell, he is a square jawed dolt, who as Raimi says '...would looks up to an imbecile.'  It is this quality that makes him instantly likable.  He is arrogant, loud, angry, and dumb. Ash is supplied with puerile one liners ('groovy', 'come get some', 'gimme some sugar baby'), that you can almost imagine this guy practicing in front of a mirror on a Friday night.  He's a jerk but we like him all the same. In the end he proves to be a hero, which considering the complete lack of character development, is oddly satisfying.ARMY OF DARKNESS will also live on as a film that was not given a chance to live up to its full potential.  Due to a situation over the rights to the sequel of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, on which producer Dino De Laurentiis and Universal Pictures clashed, Raimi was left with little money to complete the film.  So little in fact, that they could not afford main titles, instead using the rather lame animated opening sequence.  The lack of funds also resulted in composer Danny Elfman writing the 'March of the Dead' theme (that was meant to be used under the main titles; see above) for one dollar. That, as well as massive studio interference which saw entire scenes cut and the ending reshot completely.  However, the situation has been corrected with seemingly dozens of DVD releases, each more comprehensive than the last, which allows ARMY OF DARKNESS to live on beyond the truncated theatrical version.  ARMY OF DARKNESS has all the makings of a cult classic, so give into the silliness and check it out. 8/10.",8,1,1,14 March 2004
True Romance," Top Notch Pulp....
","True Romance is a celebration of film.  It wallows in every possible seedy contrivance of American crime/action cinema.  It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, over-acting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it.  Quentin Tarantino, as I'm sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast:  The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light.  The supporting roles are the gas.  The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect, and this is, arguably, true.  Just watch this scene and then watch it again.  Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders.  OK, you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled pot-smoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre-Sopranos) as a reflective hitman, and you've even got Bronson Pinchot (from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS) for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (they're not all good films, but...).  Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why?  He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down.  As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice.  Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant over-the-top insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to over-direct a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run.  The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, balls-to-the-wall, popcorn throwing, cult classic.  In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10",9,258,298,5 March 2003
Donnie Darko," Well crafted, thoughtful film.
","I'm not going to talk much about the plot of DONNIE DARKO, I think many of the scenes and revelations work much better without aforethought. I will say that the ending, though debated, is best left open to personal interpretation. I have not seen the DVD, or heard the director's commentary, which may reveal the true meaning of the film's conclusion...I don't know. The ending evokes David Lynch, with its' ambiguity, and allows the viewer to complete the story in their own way. DONNIE DARKO does not labor to explain away the finale, it simply concludes leaving the viewer with resonance and echoes.What really surprised me was that this is a film about teenage life that actually has ideas. The lead role (superbly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled young man, but not in that cinematic 'troubled young man' way. His character builds and transmogrifies, subtly, throughout the narrative. Donnie is nuanced and vulnerable, defiant and submissive. He has a abstracted and unhealthy view on sex (at that age who really has a healthy one?); he stands up for people, but is not a hero. Upon arriving at the conclusion, this kid has been dragged through inner conflict and doubt, pressure and confusion, final release.The film nurtures its' sci-fi roots with references to Minkowski's space-time theory, Einstein's worm-holes, along with other allusions to physics and science. The film draws a sense of time travel via Philip K. Dick and throws in a little Bradbury here, a little Vonnegut there.The prophetic rabbit is equal parts Harvey and Alice in Wonderland, and the time period is wonderfully supported by the 88' presidential debates. Donnie Darko backstops the material in a way that many films are simply too lazy to do. These qualities add greatly to the mystery and nuance of the on-screen action. DONNIE DARKO gives the audience credit and does not pander. In an early scene at the bus stop, notice the way the characters' comments can go from jovial humor, to cold racism in a single breath. Also, the scene in which Donnie calls his mother a 'bitch' is extremely well executed.The supporting cast creates a realistic family dynamic; the father, played by Holmes Osborne, is torn between stolid parenting and breaking out into rowdy laughter. In a time of stereotyped teenage images (TV's SAVED BY THE BELL, etc., or the film American PIE and other such pubescent sex-romps), it is refreshing to find such strong and layered characters as the ones portrayed in this film. DONNIE DARKO walks a fine line, but finds the right balance and rarely falters. 9/10",9,0,0,7 March 2003
