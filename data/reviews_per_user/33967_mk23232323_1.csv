Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely one of the most overrated films of all time
","You know, the problem with this flick is that the director is really good, the actors are really good, but the plot is just too stinking far fetched. I mean, come on, a little girl on girl sex is NOT something to get really upset about. I mean, working in an office for a living is a LOT worse than that. There are literally thousands of women who do that sorta thing for a living.And then there's the problem with the guy and his arm. First problem with that is that no junkie, NO JUNKIE, would keep shooting into a vein that is that messed up. Junkies are not that stupid. They have their own lore and protocols, that they pass to each other, and that includes using different veins. Aronofsky obviously has never met a real life junkie. And that crap about getting arrested out of a doctors office. ANYWHERE in this country, if a doctor refused him medical treatment, dang, even if a doctor called the cops on the guy, that doctor would get his ass sued from here to eternity. There's something called doctor patient privilege, they're not ALLOWED to call the cops, ever, under any circumstances, barring a direct threat to someone else's life. AND if the was imprisoned, denied treatment, and then lost his arm, attorney's would be lining up to sue not only the doctor, but the state where he was imprisoned.SO, even if the the incredibly unlikely event that the junkie let his arm go that bad, then the astronomically unlikely event that a doctor would risk being sued and losing his license to practice medicine by calling the cops, and THEN the cosmically ludicrous event that the guy would be denied medical treatment by the prison, he would STILL have lawyers lining up for the fat 50% fee they'd get from suing all those people.The movie is about as tragic as if they'd all somehow won the lottery and then been struck by lightening the following day.Requim for a Dream is not depressing, it's laughable.",1,34,64,10 October 2006
