The Ring," Whopper
","This is seriously good. It's one of the only films that I've ever watched that not only sent shivers down my spine, but petrified me. It's brilliantly put together, and considering it's made in America, keeps the Japanese feel of the original. The concept may seem silly - a video cassette that kills you. But when all is explained, it actually makes it plausible to even the most critical critic. Well, most critical critics anyway. Some people are never happy.*This paragraph has some spoilers* Look out for the moment where the boy says - 'You helped her? ... Why did you do that? ... You weren't supposed to help her.' Granted, the fact that I've just told you about it spoils the whole moment. But the concept is brilliant! And the idea that you can be frightened to death is also excellent. When she climbs out of the TV the first time, with that spooky Japanese camera flickery thing, its scary. More so than any other film I've ever watched. For horror fans, miss this at your own peril.",8,1,1,27 June 2009
Once," Watch this with your bird
","I like this film. I want to cuddle it like it's a kitten or a bunny rabbit. That's not to say the film is like a fluffy animal, more than it just makes me feel good. The story is really human, and it hits the mark perfectly when it comes to romance. But not in the Debbie does Dalas sense of romance. This is poetry in movie form. If the film was a man, it would be Wordsworth. The music takes over this film like a cancer. It's just one song! Effing hell people, how many times can you play it in one film?! It's a lovely song, it's a bit Damien Rice but not as good. The makers obviously thought it was great though. That aside, the music does give depth to the relationship between the guy and the girl. They're literally making sweet music together. It's witty, beautifully shot (Dublin is a grand town), well acted and made with real love. One of the best independent pictures I've seen.",7,1,2,27 June 2009
The Dark Knight," What more do you want?!
","This is it. This is as good as a film can be. It's funny, it's beautiful, it's clever. It's complex but in a way that's easy to follow. It's simply amazing how much they've managed to fit into this movie. The most captivating part, I think, is the creation of Two-Face. The contrast of his two personalities is simply brilliant. The recreation of the joker is blinding too. Ledger aside, just look at the role. Any old actor could have done this job and made it good! The dialogue is impeccable. The magic trick scene is funny, and his conversation with Two-Face is expressive. 'You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it!' Ledger did an amazing job, but I feel that his death made this The Heath Ledger Show. Which is a shame because it distracts from all of the many other brilliant elements.I've said it ever since he made Memento, Nolan is as good a film maker as you can ever get. He wrote this movie too, don't forget. The burden, and therefore the credit, goes to him. This is simply one of the best films ever made.",10,1,4,27 June 2009
Man on Fire," The best revenge film of all time
","Not that I've seen every revenge film of all time, I don't think. But this film is SO good, I still feel that this sweeping statement is true. It's an amazing film - Tony Scott knows how to make good looking stylish beautifully shot cinema. Washington, has many a time, really annoyed me in his movies. He seems to do the same thing every time, he doesn't have much range. This script had his name written all over it, though, and no one could have portrayed the damaged, depressed alcoholic as well as he did in this film. His calm persona is brilliant, the dead behind the eyes look that he had in all of those awful dramas he's done in the past now make sense. It seems to me, he was destined to play this part - it is him, he is it. He's brilliant. I doubt he'll ever match this performance.The story is excellent. Predictable and a bit disappointing when they reveal the twist, but to mark this film down for that would be a shame. It's not about twists and turns and all that over complicated rubbish, this is a story of sacrifice, revenge and love. It's awesome - watch it and enjoy.",10,0,1,29 June 2009
The Matrix," The best of the best
","Everything about this film is perfect. Reeves is perfect (for the first time since Bill and Ted) in the role of Neo. In fact, the casting overall is perfect. Every single actor and actress does their job brilliantly - credit where credit's due to the brothers, it's their baby, they did it.The action redefined every film I can think of from this point on. The CGI, the brutal expendable nature of all of the people inside the matrix. It's simply fantastic. I think we'll all be waiting a long long time before we ever see a film so rich in story, visual effects, action and overall quality. This film was also brilliant in the music department. The music makes the action better. The background music makes the atmosphere more atmospheric. Think about it, Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Mayalin Manson, Rage Against the Machine, Deftones, Rob D and most surprisingly, the fantastic cheesy metal of Rammstein. A soundtrack like that could have made Little House on the Prarie awesome. I can't imagine that there is anyone on God's green earth who hasn't seen this film. But if you've not seen it, then your life is emptier because of it.",10,0,1,27 June 2009
