First Man," Decent but slow
","Acting was pretty good by Claire For but a little dry by Gosling. While the story was very cool, the pace and hard to follow plot made it difficult to enjoy. PSA: IF YOU HAVE MOTION SICKNESS, THIS MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD FILM FOR YOU. LOTS OF SHAKEY CAMERA WORK.",6,5,14,13 October 2018
Creed II," Better than advertised
","Of all the 'rocky' movies that have ever been released, this by far stands alone as the best in my opinion. The backstory to the main fight never leaves you bored and manipulates the audiences emotions so well. The chemistry between Jordan and Thompson is truly amazing and Stallone continues to evolve the Rocky we all thought we knew. The fight at the end of the movie was so gripping that the audience cheered out loud with every punch, blow, and knock down. This movie was not only good, it was great. GO SEE IT!!!!!",9,31,61,21 November 2018
