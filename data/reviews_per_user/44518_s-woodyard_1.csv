Black Swan," Expected Nothing, Blew me away!
","What can I say about this movie. Well, I certainly wasn't expecting to be remotely entertained. Badgered by my other half to go and see what I thought was going to be a gash chick flick with B' List actors, the idea of watching Natalie Portman after her performances in the Star Wars films, just filled me with dread. and every time I hear Mila Kunis voice, I expect Peter Griffin to crash on to the screen fighting a chicken. Not in my opinion, a good start. But boy, how wrong one mans pre-conceived ideas could be, just cant be measured. Portman was amazing. From start to finish, her performance was exceptional. To go from a wooden faced futuristic princess to turn in an emotional, believable, intensive and graphic portrayal of an artiste' descent into madness was just incredible. Kunis was steady as was Hershey and Cassel. The latter played a blinder with the will he/wont he (be a sexually manipulative sadistic moron)saga. However, enough praise cannot be given to the Director Aronofsky. Without his stewardship, one feels that Portman, Kunis et al, may have struggled with the task in hand. Be prepared, Black Swan will dominate The Oscars",10,1,3,22 January 2011
