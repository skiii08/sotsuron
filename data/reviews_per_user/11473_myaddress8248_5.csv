The Ring," Great, but stupid at the same time
","~*Spoilers*~I'm a BIG fan of horror films, and i've seen my share that i don't really get freaked out.The Ring is pretty decent. The story could have been ALOT better. There were plot holes the size of elephants. What did that kid Aiden mean 'She doesn't sleep'? or What the hell was that woman doing at Noah's apartment after he died? Is she the ghost or something?This is only one of the 2 movies i've walked out on saying 'God d*mnit, why? you KNOW theres gonna be a sequal' ( The other being Spider-man )This movie is a little overhyped. I wasn't scared at all. If you want a real scare, go see Signs or The Others.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," i'm soo sorry, veterans of WWII
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Really. Truly. I AM sorry( *SPOILER AHEAD!!* )Why, oh why, does hollywood intend on re-writing history?? I'll never know. But what i do know is that this movie really did suck. I'll go with tomaustin. it makes you root for the Japanese 'IN THE HANGER!'I'll put it like my friend does. its just a really stupid love triangle with blood, bombs, and Josh Hartnett.Me being a teenager, i find it stupid that in a 3 hour movie, only about an hour, probably not even, dedicated to the actual event. Thats where this movie fails. If you are going to make a movie about Pearl Harbor, make the movie about Pearl Harbor, not a love triangle that didn't even happen! I do not even want to go into detail about Joshie's little death scene. I mean, how many people, after being in a plane crash, gets a piece of shrapnel in their necks, then gets shot, actually have 5 minutes to spare talking to people?? That sounds WAY to painful to even be talking. And then Ben Affleck hardly can act. When he was crying, oh god, i cringed!!After watching this piece of crap, i rented Tora! Tora! Tora!. boy, was i surprised. That movie actually did a really good job!! Pearl Harbor made Tora! Tora! Tora! Look like gold.So in short, if you want to watch a movie about Pearl Harbor, i highly recommend Tora! Tora! Tora!* out of 10",Null,1,2,8 July 2002
Black Hawk Down," good war movie
","I have been a big fan of Josh Hartnett, and my parents took me to see it because it was rated R and i could not go alone. My parents aren't really interested in seeing movies at the movie theater, but they enjoyed it. This movie is a really good war movie.SPOILER ALERT!!! Black Hawk Down is about a true event that took place in Somalia. It takes place in Mogadishu where a warlord is starving his citizens. With 300,000 dead and counting, the US decides to go in and remove the Somalian warlord. The first injured is an 18 year old kid named Blackburn, who falls out of the helicopter. Thats where things start going wrong. The somalians manage to shoot down 2 Black Hawk helicopters and kill about 18 Americans. [ end spoiler alert ]The good thing about Black Hawk Down, is that they don't put a love story in it. Many movies such as Titanic and Pearl Harbor really would've turned out to be great movies if they didn't center the movie around a love story. Black Hawk Down is one of those movies where they manage to put a lot of the details that actually happen into the movie. I highly recommend renting this movie ***** out of 5 stars",Null,0,0,8 July 2002
Titanic," okay??
","Titanic was one of those movies, that get you thinking 'i wasted 3 hours of my life watching this?!?!' Of course, there are going to be those people that tell you to relaxing and just watch the movie. How can i? It gets so irritating the first HOUR that it makes me wanna fall asleep. Then there's the inevitable love story that does not make sense. It reminded me of Pearl Harbor. Both movies put way to much emphasis on the love story, that it makes the actual event just look like a subplot. I highly recommend something actually watch-worthy. Something like the Shawshank Redemption, or Black Hawk Down. Not this massive failure.",Null,3,5,10 July 2002
Final Destination," Good movie all around
","For most teen horror flicks, most focus on a tangible killer. This doesn't.
Alex, played by Devon Sawa, and his French class are going to take a flight to Paris. While the plane is boarding, Alex doses off and has a premonition of the plane exploding. He wakes up to find that most of the premonition is true. So he causes a fuss and gets him, and about 6 other people kicked off the plane. Thus begining the killer, death itself, to claim the lives of the people who cheated him once. Now Alex has to figure out the pattern which Death is following and cheat it once again.Cast: Devon Sawa= Alex, Chad E. Donella= Todd, Ali Larter= Clear, Kerr Smith>Carter, and others.Good Points: Drifts away from most horror flicks where there is a human killer. People die different. The love story, if implied, does not take up much of the screen time ( original ending ). Good acting.Bad Points: The only real bad points i found were the alternate ending. What was that?!?! It was predictable, i'm glad they re-shot the ending. And the part where Alex is in Clear's cabin, that part confused me. what was up with eating what ever he was eating with the gloves?",Null,0,2,30 June 2002
