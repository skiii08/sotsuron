The Avengers," Best superhero team movie....so far
","I appluade joss whedon for by achieving what seemed the impossible.There is many moments in this film that I couldn't believe was going on like Bruce banner and tony stark collaborating fan-boy things like that.What surprised was this film doesn't loose it's pace at all,the introduction of the characters into the avengers felt smooth and natural.The two big actors were mark ruffalo who is the new guy and has to fill in some big shoes and tom hiddleston who I thought was a wonderfully charismatic Loki.I'm not discounting that the two chrises,Scarlett Johanson,Robert Downey JR,Jeremy renner and Samuel L. Jackson didn't do a great job.The action in this movie is filled with summer movie galore.But joss whedon knows how to develop and create characters you can actually care for(Michael bay!) which I really appreciated.I believe this film is a great start to the summer movie season.",9,3,8,14 May 2012
The Hunger Games," The American battle royale,I think not
","The hunger games is a wonderful film that is angaging from start to finish.I really enjoyed this film and what it had to offer.The action was done well even though the camera was shaky it still had that emotional grip during the action sequences.This film has the basic plot of battle royale young adults killing each other and thats it.The hunger games is sent up in a world were people watch all this violence in amusement and shock.The actiing from jennifer lawrence is to die for she gives a eye opening performance.Also josh hutcherson who was stuck in child actor nirvana for a while shines in this well.Woody harrelson and lenny kravitz did a fine job as well.Donald sutherland does a in the shadows performance.For a PG-13 film it is quite dark and grim especially when the action kicks in and when characters talk about the whole idea of the hunger games.If you want a brutal,sometimes jaw dropping but emotional experience watch the hunger games.",8,72,108,1 April 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," America f#!$ yeah!
",The fantastic four films weren't that good.But Chris Evans did a superb job as Steve rogers AKA captain America.The whole supporting cast actually did a good job.The whole movie was great B movie fun.Hugo weaving as the infamous red skull really just nails it.Also this movie is an origin story for the winter soldier as well.Captain America really expanded the marvel universe well movie wise fantastically.The storyline I actually dug and really got into.The action is explosive fun rehash of WWII movies.Joe Johnston direction really gives this film extra flare and excitement to it.Captain America really surprised and actually got me excited for the avengers movie.,8,0,2,19 February 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Best action movie of 2011
","Mission impossible:ghost protocol is a great action film which I think is the best action film of 2011.What I loved about mission impossible four the action made sense and it wasn't all about tom cruise.Also this movie proves that tom cruise is an action star.This film is a clear example of how an action film should be made not in 3-d but in IMAX.The sound in this film is so pitch perfect I really got into this movie because of that.Mission impossible 4 is a movie theater movie unless you have movie theater at your house which is a big exception.The cast includes Jeremy renner who I really liked from hurt locker and the town.Simno pegg who plays the goofy tech guy which made me more engaged in the movie.The action in this film is mesmerizing and intense.Some of the scenes in this film are actually suspenseful.Brad bird who directed animation classics incredibles,ratatouille and the iron giant adds this sense of b-movie excitement to the mix.Mission impossible 4 returned tom cruise's career back to form and revived the action film genre.",10,2,6,19 February 2012
Drive," (warning!)This film is not for everyone
","I remember after finally see this film after hearing about all the rave reviews and talk about 'drive' a film from danish director Nicolas winding refn who is a newcomer to American cinema.After seeing the film for the first time I didn't know what to think of it a part of me hated the film a part of me absolutey loved the film which by the way is a awkward feeling.Once I had a second go round I completely loved this film.The story is stunt driver gets caught in some deep trouble because many things fell in to place.Also this film is a romance film as much as an action crime drama.For a romantic film this film is very very violent like Quentin Tarantino violent.The car chase scenes are very engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat.Ryan gosling who is becoming a big star for sure,does a fantastic job as the strong quiet guy.the cast also includes Ron perlman who is always great,Albert brooks who plays the main villain surprisly,Bryan Cranston who plays the mentor to Ryan gosling's character and Carey mulligan who plays the driver's love interest.This film blends noir,Quentin Tarantino,transporter and art-house films which to me is genius.",10,1,3,4 April 2012
Thor," Really?
",I love marvel comics and there movies and I also enjoy the Thor comics as well.But what the hell is this.I wasn't expecting Thor to be good when I saw the trailer but I was hoping to be surprised.Chris hemsworth was the right chose he was one of the few Good things about this film.Anthony Hopkins I thought was okay with his role.But tom hiddleston I thought did A great job as Loki.some of the dialogue in this film is laughable.The action was actually shot well the special effects look great.The whole movie felt like they just made it for the avengers movie that coming out pretty soon.The storyline didn't need a love story but of the course there is one.This movie is like a roller-coaster not in a good way there is some bad scenes then there's good scenes.This movie kind of felt rushed and slapped together.Thor was an okay marvel movie if you ask me.,4,0,1,19 February 2012
Prometheus," Calm before the storm
",I think the main problem people had with Prometheus was they thought of the film too much as a direct prequel to alien even before they saw the finished film.Promotheus is a very indirect sequel film concerning it has different tone and theme(s) than the all the other alien installments.This film is the most scifi out of the franchise.Like most other people who saw promotheus michael fassbender 's performance is well done.But for the whole cast was good the way they played there characters all brought there ideas and themes just from the characters which I really liked.Noomi rapace does a great leading lady in her role by someone who is driven by her work and as the story unfolds her work begins to test her limits.Idris elba plays the typical space ship captain who has a simple of request of just getting payed.This film does get intense it does have great both practical and cgi effects.Ridley scotts best film since American gangster.,10,16,33,29 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," DC for life!
","After this film I have to hand to Christopher Nolan for coming back into the DC territory after making another masterpiece inception.This apparently is the last of the dark knight trilogy but it isn't the weakest.Bane played by Tom Hardy was so amazing he had a screen presence more daring and interesting than the dark knight's joker performance by Heath Ledger.That's not it there's catwoman played by the lovely Ann Hathaway.Out of all the batman films this one has more of a story to tell.Christian bale is tied with being the best batman of all time with Michael Keaton in my book.The running time didn't change a damn thing for me it was so fast paced even at the 'slow parts' it was still epic.I've have also noticed that each batman movie made by Christopher Nolan moves closer to the comic books and the dark knight rises gets the closest to the comic books.This movie for me is pure perfection by being a comic book movie and opening up the batman mythos for future installments.And also story has some very well put twists and turns and also great character development. Alright spoiling time,when john Blake is turned out be nightwing/robin/Batman (I prefer Nightwing) I was so infectiously happy.The ending was so had that whole feeling like inception where it felt so serial.But when Alfred see's Bruce Wayne at a caf√© you see a glimpse of saline kyle turning her face so in my theory the batman series will continue with nightwing as his apprentice.Also Lucius fox hints twenty minutes into the movie that the bat-plane or hovercraft needs it remote control fixed so batman lives okay the way I see it he lives.Also the whole way they incorporated tali was brilliant and well throughout.Marion cotillard played her role so low key I was tricked.The mysterious man in the hole prison I thought was Ra's al ghul protecting the child bane but bane was the mysterious masked man.And for all those people that had a problem with bane's voice that's pretty much Christopher Nolan telling you to go see dark knight rises in IMAX.Whne there was a small but a pivotal role in how the story plays out Scarecrow returned I was in nirvana.Then there's another thing when Bruce Wayne and Miranda tat/Talia ghul Are sitting by the fire pretty much after sex there's another batman installment(s)on the way for sure.Everyone get prepared for robin/Damian Wayne.",10,3,7,25 July 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," love/hate letter
","I really liked the first two scream movies two films that pushed how far the horror genre can go by making fun of it by pointing out its flaws.Cabin in the woods bring a total different approach to the horror genre by answering all those horror movie questions that were left unanswered in this very ingenious and fun way.Joss whedon and drew Goddard have balls by doing this film now I feel I won't see or perceive horror movies the same because this film just set another bar line for future horror films to achieve.This film is funny,edgy,scary and a little mystical.I loved the whole 'A tale of two cities' concept there is chaos occurring here then there's calm just relaxed just doing my job tone.the acting from franz kranz,richard jenkins,bradley whitfordand anna hutchinson make that conecpt come to life.The last 15 minutes of this film are jaw dropping every horror movie you can image put in one all at the same time I found myself howling with laughter.I think everyone who knows about horror movies should put cabin in the woods on there bucket list",9,1,5,14 May 2012
