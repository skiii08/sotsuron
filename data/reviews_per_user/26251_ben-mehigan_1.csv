The Avengers," I only have one problem with this film...
","Why did they float around in the sky for hours, waste of f*#!!?g fuel!! What was wrong with the boat in the first place? What did that hot b!*#h and that guy with the bow and arrow even do? Peppaz wasn't even in it!!!! The special effects were bulls#*t and there weren't enough explosions, why did that guy turn green what happened to Edward Norton??? Wasn't that green guy in Mexico how did he get to new York in under 2 hours. Why did the aliens only send 1 alien b#*h at a time?? They clearly had 3 to deploy????? This film was f****n w**k I would rather circumcise myself than watch it again. It's stupid iron man died xx",2,11,40,10 May 2012
