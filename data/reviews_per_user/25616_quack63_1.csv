Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 9 out of 10; in this case 1>2
","I found the last part of the film with Bill and Little Kiddo to be weak and somewhat trite, not up to Tarantino standards. Otherwise it was almost measured up to the superlative level of excellence set in Vol. 1. If anything could be added, I would like to have seen a flashback on the story of Brother Budd, a most interesting piece of human debris. Kudos on the fitting end of Ms Driver and her one remaining eye thus avenging the murder of Pei Mei. Tarantino is master artist without peer in the use of blood and gore as the media of choice. Hmmmmmm, gore!That's all I really have to say, but teacher requires at least 10 lines. This harkens back to high school and freshman year of college where one criterion for the measurement of the quality of work was quantity. So now I have 10 lines.",9,1,2,16 May 2004
