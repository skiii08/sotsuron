Ford v Ferrari," Wonderful, and I don't know a thing about cars.
","The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The story, which obviously is a true tell was emotional and I recommend not looking into anything before seeing the film if you don't know already. Though I'm sure if you know the story you'll still enjoy it.Shot well too. Highly recommend this film.",9,149,204,4 November 2019
