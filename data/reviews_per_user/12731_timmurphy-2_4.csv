First Man," Definitely worth the hype
","The reality that the space program, as well as the men who went to space, were eternally 'on edge' is very clearly presented in this film. For a film abouace travel and the quest for the moon, its surprisingly intimate. The film focuses on the Armstrong family, the small and isolated group of astronauts living and working together, and the closeness within the spacecrafts that took these flights. The highlights include the moon landing, which happens as fuel is being burned, and the Gemini 8 flight, which almost ended in disaster. Some say that Gosling as Armstrong comes across as too restrained. I disagree. At times, a subtle humor is shown. His pain at the deaths of his daughter and his colleagues is obvious. His almost total focus on his mission also comes across as selfish-to the point of rudeness toward friends and disengagement with his wife. Claire Foy is worthy, again, of award consideration for a pitch perfect portrayal of a strong minded partner. Jason Clarke also stands out. In short, this is an outstanding tribute to an era when commitment, sacrifice, intelligence, optimism and daring do characterized one of America and mandkind's greatest achievements.",8,3,12,13 October 2018
Fight Club," Over Rated
","Don't get me wrong...Fight Club is entertaining. The acting is solid-especially the three leads and its 'message' about violence, feeling trapped and masculine frustration is humorously presented. But it's not the greatest film ever...it's at times rambling, silly and disjointed. Especially toward the end.",7,0,2,25 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Entertaining but....zzzzzzzz
","Solid movie. The banter between the characters that most know so well is often hysterical. The problem with this movie is that its stuffed with unnecessary scenes that serve to make it too long, and more of a 'greatest hits' than a coherent plot. The time travel theory kind of makes sense, until Cap shows up as a too young World War Two ninety eight year old man at the end...an impossibility given the logic used in the movie. Other scenes dealing with Hawkeye and even the final battle should've been shortened or eliminated...like Cap as some sort of self help counselor. I wonder about the future of Avenger 'group' movies given the death of Ironman and sidelining of Captain America. Seems Marvel has basically killed off the golden goose. I guess time will tell.",8,2,5,5 May 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Bored
","The only thing that keeps me from rating this lower is that, occasionally there is humor. All in all this movie is one big bore. Scattered plot, too many subplots, stupid fight scene. The entire movie would've been better if it had centered on the Ego-Star Lord dynamics instead of bouncing around from subplot to subplot. Yawn.",4,1,2,3 September 2018
