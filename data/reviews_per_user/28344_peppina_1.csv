The Ring," the scariest movie ever...
","i didnt sleep very well last night after watching The Ring. I havent had nightmares about a movie since i was 9 and watched nightmare on elmstreet. 10 out of 10 for haunting imagery.This film is rated pg13. i think it should be R - restricted. The story line is simple enough: a mystery videotape comprising weird and haunting images, once watched the viewer recieves a phone call telling them they have 7 days to live.the last victims young auntie racheal, a journalist tries to solve the mystery of her nieces untimely death. she died after her heart stopped. she tracks down the videotape, obviously watches it and then the fun starts....no spoilers here but dont watch it before you sleep.",10,1,2,12 June 2003
