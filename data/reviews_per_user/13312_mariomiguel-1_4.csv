The New World," Slow . slow . slow. slow. drama .slow. drama.
","Yes, it is very slow, i saw it yesterday. i was the all time waiting for something, some change that could get some living to this movie but unforntunaly that didn't happen, i know this is a drama but i have seen dramas and the real drama is to see without sleeping trough, waiting for something... as a drama i would give a 4 in 10. yes picture is good but everything else is slow, very very slow , i have never seen anything like this. Maybe this movie plays according to the timing of is creator 'Terrence Malick'! And yes I'm a little upset cause i don't have much time and i love movies and want to enjoy the few time i have free and i thought this movie was a lot different and better. Its not a movie for everyone, its for a specific audience maybe 3% of human population ! Acting was good .. rhythm slow slow slow slow slow slow slow ! If its raining and you have nothing else better to do or to read, and if you don't have anymore movies to see then see this ! hope this is helps anyone ! Have a great day !",1,1,6,15 November 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Yes you will laugh... its as good and original scenes
","Yes you will laugh... its as good and original scenes.. its this enough to make so many noise about a movie with so less quality, values ? for me besides some good scenes of comedy i found it ridiculous.. First of all as in most of the movies you need to have some empathy with the character , in this case 'Borat' not all people will do it easy... this movie is all like candid camera.. lots of real scenes, people caught and build together with 'Borat' journey across the country... Yes you will laugh but were is the rest ? Exaggerated humor with religions, ethnic, races and some other values.. it gets a little bit ridiculous... Not worth see it on theatre.. unless you are a teenager that loves the most ridiculous, meaningless jokes.. I was very disappointed ! don't understand this high classification of this movie ! to be honest i will give 3/10 ! hope this can help anyone.. well have a good weekend ! see you soon.

Lucky Number Slevin," Just GO ON and SEE IT !!
","I'm a movie/cinema lover.... I'm not going to tell you how is the movie, or whats about, I'm just gonna tell the feeling i had when i left the movie theathre, let me start by the usual feeling after seeing most of the latest movies : OK, that wasn't so bad, not bad, good movie. But, after seeing Lucky Number Slevin i thought .. it had pass some many time since the last time i saw a movie that good. it was a really good feeling. i know that this kind of comments can be very subjective, but its my contribute to those who haven't got the change to see it yet.. just some other thing, i found that this movie it wasn't not just another movie, it really makes some the difference, and you will understand why ! Maybe some words are missing, sorry, I'm Portuguese and my English is a little bit rusty.. Some important message can be acquired/absorbed trough interesting/humorous/intelligent/rich/healthy dialogues. and i could write more and more but the only intelligent thing to do is GO ON and SEE IT !! to ps : obviously i have commission ! lol",10,0,5,22 August 2006
The Departed," Excellent ! Excellent IS THE BEST WORD TO DESCRIBE IT !
","Yes indeed 'Excellent' its the best word to describe this movie. Today i want to comment according to quality of this movie. Therefore my comment is that Everything is Excellent ! hope this comment is helpful, have a great day ! OK, to submit the comment i need to write something more (10 lines of text minimum) so : Acting - Jack Nicholson (espectacular acting, everyone knows him, he is great and keeps better and better). You cant miss this movie, and it shows a reality that most of us don't know but unfortunaly exists. I guess thats all! Great movie ! Im sorry but i don't agree with this 10 minimum text lines, what is i want to make a specific comment that only needs 3 lines ? Thats OK anyway, i tried to comment this movie my best and its Excellent !",10,1,3,15 November 2006
