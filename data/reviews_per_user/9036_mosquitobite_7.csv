First Man," Evocative poignant
",Saw lots of complaints about claustrophobia and close ups...that is why the film is great it conveys the claustrophobic nature of everything in society at that time the nature of grief and duty and resolve that is as suffocating and inescapable as being locked into a rocket ship launched. Incredible to think this happened half a century ago liked being taken back in time to this truly extraordinary achievement on a day i see tweets coming from the Mars probe just landed...space travel gonna be a long haul... if only we had the Spice!! RG beautifully controlled as usual with the emotional goods delivered in spades when required. And I will seriously never complain about an MRI again.,9,1,3,28 November 2018
The Irishman," Absolutely Masterful
","I can barely believe these men are not actually Frank Jimmy and Russ. Never once for a microsecond do they step ourside their characters into their own skins, the humility and measured control of de Niro's performance is utterly awe inspiring. Pacino, what can I say, no words and the steady rudder throughout commanding and powerful Joe Pesci's character Russ. Great supports (Jesse Plemens underused again but a minor quibble). Better be plenty of Oscars here, I wasn't that interested in Jimmy Hoffa but wasn't bored for a second and that is totally down to the performances and Scorese' s wonderful eye and pacing every detail perfect. Masterpiece.",10,9,18,4 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Awesome
","Thanks QT for this loveable fantasy piece from your heart, such a stupid stupid question about Robbie s lines, no wonder it ticked you off your representation of ST was perfectly in tune with the spirit of the film which ive seen 3 times now and just love it.",10,15,20,24 September 2019
Call Me by Your Name," HATED THIS FILM
","So contrived from outset WHY did they SHARE A BATHROOM in that sprawling mansion... it was as if papa said to mama ' ok Elio gets laid this summer, put them in same room, this guy Oliver is tall and very handsome i reckon he.is.our.man!! Did you see his pic?'
Oliver comes across as having *zero integrity* in this, from when he first puts hands on the boy, yes the boy, in a very aggressive controlling belittling way...he teases him knowing he s totally ravenous for him it's just a heartbreaking thing, literally, and actually stuffs up Elio s life.(in the book Elio is apparently a total nutter which might MIGHT have put a different spin on things but he isn't a nutter in the film...so) And so we re all supposed to sigh over it as this beautiful touching love story ? Nuh no thanks not a romance in my book, a predator who knew exactly what he was doing and the lame brained parents....the languid libertines lol don't get me started on them wanted to slap the pair of them. But the main thing that let it down for me was it did nothing to convince me of Oliver s sincerity of feeling for Elio. Yeah ill shag the kid put him out of his misery, do him a favour, wasnt a good vibe and it's the vibe i got. AH was miscast ...too big, too old, too beautiful, too arrogant, that scene on river bank this kid had JUST declared himself at the monument, and Oliver is all no we can't talk about those things then he s tracing his fingers into the kids mouth pro voking him then gets all precious when his crotch gets grabbed. Then ghosts Elio until he is limp for it, then its ' grow up see you at midnight ' HORRIBLE . A younger more innocent lover yes, but not this big self assured adult man, no, felt all so so wrong...I couldn't warm to anything else after the first three quarters it was a total embarrassment of manipulative cliche. ....later.",1,5,24,23 October 2019
War Machine," Hits the subject matter in the guts
",Loved Brad ....i wanna run like that!! he s like those guys in the Take On Me video so funny he does an awesome job in this movie and made me smile. Movie gets the absurdity message across really well loved support cast scoot will poulter etc well done all,8,0,1,18 December 2019
The King," Silly men's business
","Without the gravitas, language or drama to disguise that it's ....all just silly men's business. The cast and script is a disaster. Why was this made?",4,28,84,1 November 2019
Joker," Narrative issues...not a masterpiece!! but a master performance from Phoenix
","Effective imagining of the forces that shape a malcontent, but its been done to death, the abused disenfranchised being who is forced through pain into psychotic breakout, lashing out against injustice, his tormentors and society. This was such a cliche rationale for the advent of Joker in the world of Gotham, it was at its heart way too mainstream in narrative, going into details of child abuse ?? Like a Daily Mail headline, a really really bad idea and a very ordinary device. And did I really hear CREAM ? Omg could not believe my ears coz of the White Room madhouse scene looming ??? AAGH ..that was a very poor choice and ripped me out of Gotham city post haste and into London's Troubadour club. This film could have been way more imaginatively written and executed, and seriously if not for JP it might have fallen very flat indeed. Yes he contortioned himself in extra ordinary ways to bring Arthur to life and he deserves the Oscar. But lets not forget he is NOT the Joker as was Heath, he is Arthur pre-Joker.... so can people please stop comparing. AND it is NOT a masterpiece, so can people think before they declare it thus...its a film with an absolute tour deforce performance that elevates it above the mediocre, that's what it is. And may i add that this individual Arthur and his characterization as presented here could NOT become clever wily Joker, he s a sad loser who s been brutalized and is now kill crazy. Not too bright. Not ever gonna actually be DC JOKER, so there s a disconnect and one so fundamental that it kind of makes this film redundant as part of the Batman Gotham diaspora....so in summary its an arresting characterization of a mentally ill person sure, but i felt no connection at all between Arthur and Joker, i think they forgot about context and cohesion and veered off into some place between Falling Down and Cuckoos Nest",7,3,6,7 October 2019
