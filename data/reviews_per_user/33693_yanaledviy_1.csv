First Man," Terrific
","We all know the story of Neil Amstrong, but this film made me doubt whether he would really make it or not. It was like reviving those moments all over again. Although I knew the real Neil made it, here, with Ryan, I had no idea. Only a perfectly filmed movie and a terrific performance can achieve something like that.",10,2,9,13 October 2018
