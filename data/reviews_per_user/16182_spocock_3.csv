The Blair Witch Project," If you're not too picky&have big imagination,you'll love it
","This film is a little like 'Arachnophobia' in that with this film, it was only really scary if you hated spiders as your phobia fuelled your imagination.  If you aren't scared of spiders, it was a fairly routine 'B' movie.For those of you who like to question films and constantly find yourself being more of a cynic than a member of an audience, this film is not for you.To truly get into TBWP you have to let your imagination run absolute riot. The moment you hold it in check is the moment you will begin to dislike the film.
**** POTENTIAL SPOILER *****Stay with it until this part:The defining moment as to when this film is for you or not is when the three characters get out of their tent to find three piles of rocks with sticks poking out at the top.If you think: 'It's just a few piles o'rocks for *&^%$ sake'.  Turn it off and put something else on as the film is wasting your time.If you go: 'Whoa! '  This film is for you and you'll think it is one of the scariest things you've ever seen.
**** Spolier over ****
As long as your imagination does the special effects for you, you will be gripped by this film from beginning until the very disturbing end.If it fails to spark your thoughts, go watch something else.  That's not a criticism of you for having no imagination but this film relies on it's audience 'gelling' with the concept.On another night, my brain acidentally filled with hype, I may have fallen into the latter camp too.",Null,0,1,9 September 2002
LÃ©on: The Professional," One of the best
","I walked into the cinema but the film I wanted to see (Interview with the Vampire) was booked out.  The only one that was within the right time frame was one I'd never heard of called 'Leon'.From the outset, I was amazed the film wasn't publicised any more than it was.This film is absolutely fantastic.  If you haven't seen it, forget anything else until you have.  And try to make sure you see the directors cut with the extra 24 minutes of footage.In the UK, you will need to get the film imported to get hold of this but it is so worth the effort.I have never seen such a complete film. Acting, plot, action.  This film has it all.  Subtle and explosive at once.Nathalie Portman shines with the promise that would seem to have since been fulfilled.  Gary Oldman is chilling.  Jean Reno is outstanding.  Just as you start to believe the character is actually quite 'slow' he goes off on a job and works with such ruthless efficiency it becomes a lesson in the value of never underestimating any individual you ever meet.The plot is engrossing and yet manages to set off one or two uncomfortable alarm bells within you as you watch Leon trying to come to terms with exactly how he feels for Mathilda.  It always manages to stay very firmly on the correct side of the line though due to some superb scripting and subtle direction.The cut version is still a great movie but try to hold out for the full version.  It contains some very solid scenes that enrich the two central characters and their relationship.I never tire of watching this film.  Neither will you.",10,0,1,16 August 2002
The Thin Red Line," The film by which I judge ALL others
","In all my life, I have never sat in a cinema and seen so many people leave before the end of the film.  The only reason I stayed is because the friends I was with looked interested in it and they thought the same of me. Had we actually spoken we all would have left with the rest of the discerning customers.At the end of this most unpleasant marathon, the entire audience breathed out a huge sigh and one guy behind summed it all up about how glad we were that it was finally over with the wise words 'Praise Jesus!'This is the most pompous misleading pile of rubbish I have ever had the misfortune to see in my entire life.  Practically an art house movie, the only decent character, played by Woody Harelson, dies early on leaving us with nothing but bad poetry and no real plot.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy any film that stirs emotions and gets you thinking but the only thing I was thinking with this was 'please finish'.One tiny plus point is that there is one scene that more than any other goes further to capture the absolute terror of the troops as their leader has a conversation with the general about whether or not he should send them all to certain death.This however lasts about two or three minutes and really isn't worth the effort of watching the rest of this self-indulgent drivel.I thank this film for one thing - I now judge all films by what I call the Thin Red Line (TRL) factor.  How many times would I rather watch the film I have just seen than watch the Thin Red Line even once.For example - Leon: The Professional scores around a 10.  I would rather watch Leon 10 times back to back than watch the TRL once.No film I have ever seen since (or before for that matter) has ever scored lower than a 2.  Even Rambo 3.Avoid.  Avoid.  Avoid.",1,2,5,16 August 2002
