Frost_Nixon," Langella Superb !
","I just saw Frost/Nixon last night and it was a great treat ! I wasn't familiar with this story prior to seeing the film , but did know something of the story .Of course I knew about Nixon and Watergate but only knew Frost as rather a buffoon type talk show host, this film documents the story in gripping fashion .The way Frost suddenly pulls it together at the final moment is rather unbelievable , but Langella's performance seems to override all .He captures Nixon's frailty , his humor , his insecurity and his demons in a simply great performance .The actor who plays Frost does well but the film doesn't really go to deeply into the Frost character , but clearly this is the moment of Frost's life .He risked all on this , money, career and reputation .The result in the end was a history making event .See it Langella is unforgettable .",8,3,5,5 March 2009
Public Enemies," Too Bad !
","Too bad this film attempted to go for all style and almost no substance as Michael Mann misses the boat badly . I must agree with other viewers that I just did not care about anyone on the screen , mostly because I did not know them . Mann seems to be racing thru this and neglects little details like why you should care , here's what people were going thru during the depression and it drove some people to bank robbery .No none of that is in there , two people can fall in love under any circumstances .If those circumstances are interesting people want to watch , Mann had all the ingredients but still botches the recipe .Making a inaccurate , uninteresting , unfullfilling film that one would think it would be difficult to mess up , but not impossible evidently .I'm sorry it happened this way , I was looking forward to this film .The actors try hard but there just isn't much there , why did Dillinger do what he did ? We are left to guess that . There was no feeling of the suffering depression era people and families endured , this was a great chance to inform this generation about their grandparents experiences , Mann you blew it my friend .",5,1,3,24 July 2009
Gran Torino," Just watch Walker Texas Ranger instead !
","Wow Clint must have a very large family to get all these great reviews from a film that is so predictable and so lame in its presentation , or maybe its pity .Using the well known ''Walker technique '' where bad guys are badder than bad , and victims are pure as the driven snow Eastwood churns out yet another no surprise gem more entertaining as a good/bad film than anything else .These are not so different than his hey/day films except that back in the day he was cool enough to pull it off .As the man with no name or Dirty Harry you knew what was going to happen but it was fun to watch because he is so right type wise for those roles .This Charles Bronson vigilante routine just doesn't work for him , add to that the horrible acting by the rest of the cast and your below even Walker .And thats saying something , it has a chance as a cult film but thats it . At 3 am maybe , for 12 bucks ? No way .All you family members may vote and disagree now , an indication of what I've saying .But everybody should state their own opinion .",2,8,19,8 January 2009
Clash of the Titans," Not Bad
","Not bad , but not great either and the best part of course was the computer graphics .Sam Worthington in my opinion did not have the look or charisma to play Persius , kind of just a gut , not a half-god saviour .He looked like a marine recruit with his crew cut , while everyone around him looked fantastic , from their hair , costumes and presentation on .He was exceedingly ordinary and out of place.This was mikkelson film , start to finish co-starring the cg . I enjoyed it but it could've been much better .They didn't show much about the gods or the creatures , Calibus was just a disfigured human , the race that rode the scorpions was cool but that was few and far between .",6,1,2,9 April 2010
The Dark Knight," Best so far , now about a movie about Batman
","First and foremost , look past the bandwagon reviews made by cast and crew relatives and take a deeper look . This was the best of the new series of batman films so far , even if it was mostly about the joker .Two-face made a very brief appearance and with 2 and 1 half hours of film he could have had more play . The actress they choose as the love interest for a billionaire playboy and a D.A. looked like and old maid school teacher , totally miscast for the role .There are many attractive actresses who could have convincingly played this role and been believable , but not her .Heath Ledger was in fact excellent as the joker , this was his movie for sure , he was convincing and scary as the psychotic and does legitimately rate an Oscar nomination for this effort .",6,1,7,20 July 2008
A Clockwork Orange," Not good , and hasn't aged well either .
","Thie film is a mystery in my opinion , although the concept of a futuristic society trying to repair their violent youth through therapy of a kind had the potential to be interesting , the blatant nature of the decadence isn't impressive in my opinion .Malcolm McDowell is a excellent actor and does all he can and the film does hold your attention .However you don't care about anyone on the screen and that really says it all , there is some entertainment here but not the big deal thats made of this film. Kubrick must have laughed all the way to the bank . Full Metal Jacket is a quality film , but the maturity of Kubrick by that time is evident . Still worth seeing , but don't expect too much .",2,9,19,16 July 2009
Halloween," Excellent !
","Probably the best horror film of the 70s and 80s ,brought back the fear of the nameless , faceless stranger who kills at random in a way that was rare before all the Freddie,Jason etc imitator's flooded the scene .This film is truly scary and has a film noir feel to it , it isn't gory but suspenseful , not obvious but more subtle .Donald Pleasance was superb as the doctor and John Carpenter's direction was masterful .Debra Hill's screenplay was right on as well (What a tragedy that Debra left us all too soon )The young actors and actresses were all OK in their roles , but the fact that a director who knew what he wanted was present was evident .One final aspect , the music was sensational .Eerie , driving and relentless it added a dimension that made this film , without it this film goes nowhere .A classic in every sense , unlike the remake .",8,0,2,10 September 2009
300," Entertaining if nor accurate .
","This is a entertaining film for sure and follows the'' graphic novel'' (comic book )very closely , that is there are liberal doses of creativity and dramatic license . The actors are all adequate in their roles particularly Dominic West , the monsters were great as were the animals and for the most part , the story itself . Where it does lack is in its liberal imagination in the story-telling , the real story was more than gripping enough to stand on its own . There was room for dramatic license within the framework of the true story .Anyway I guess they can't resist . Wests character carrying Persian gold into the council chamber ? Gaffs like this could easily have been avoided , but I guess nothing is perfect .",7,3,4,3 March 2008
