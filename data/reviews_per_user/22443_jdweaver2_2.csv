The Ring," Truly Frightening
","Not in a long time have I actually covered my eyes from the screen, until seeing The Ring.  Some people were unhappy about the ending, and the movie has been accused of copy-catting FearDotCom.  Okay, but this one was actually GOOD.  The climax scene was eerie and intense, and had me muttering expletives to myself in fear for the victim.  If you want scary with a different kind of story, see this movie.",8,1,1,9 October 2003
The Italian Job," Entertaining; but perhaps a bit stagnant
","Great acting, a brilliant cast, a good story.  However, it seemed as though too much time was spent building toward the climax instead of getting to the point.  I'm sure the director was shooting for tension and suspense, but the ball never really got rolling at full speed.  Still, it's a good one-timer.",7,0,0,9 October 2003
