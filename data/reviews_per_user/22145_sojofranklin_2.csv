It," An excellent film that combines comedy with terror in a very effective way.
","A movie full of creativity on the part of its director as part of the cast, very good scenes, the scene of the house where Pennywise comes out of the fridge in front of Eddie is one of the best for me. very poignant moments, this film never distances itself from the drama that reaches you right in the heart, something that I liked very much in this film. The bad reviews they make towards the movie really do not understand them. If any doubt the movie exceeded my expectations.",10,2,3,26 September 2017
