Despicable Me 2," Really Bad.....(which made us sad)
","Okay, I have children so we ran out anxiously to see Gru and co.,after watching previews for a year. I have to say that we are huge fans of the first movie so it pains me to give the following review.The movie was a bore. Sadly, the previews that we watched for a long time that made us want to see the movie ironically turned out to be the movie! There was such a lack of story that it amazed even my children. Gru was not a kindhearted villain anymore and his character lacked any depth. Even the villain was not characterized well. The first half- hour(at least) was exactly the previews(in order). The rest of the movie failed to develop and left us wishing that we had saved money and saw this sequel on DVD. Very disappointing! Save your money and wait for this one to come out on DVD!",3,27,50,10 July 2013
