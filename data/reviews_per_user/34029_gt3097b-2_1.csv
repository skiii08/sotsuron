Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't Believe the Hype
","For years, all people talked about was this movie, and what it was going to be.What it was, was a vast dissapointment.  The special effects were nice, but overdone in many places.  Computerized graphics have come a long way, but they still don't look as real as the characters in costumes in the original trilogy.  I would much rather see Chewbacca, of Bobba Fett than Jar Jar Biggs.All of this could have been overlooked if there had been a plot. Basically, nothing happened in this movie.  There was a war, but I don't really know why.  There was no character development at all.  When Obi-wan dies in the original, it's upsetting, when Liam Neeson dies here, no one feels any emotion, because there is no chance to get to know him.My suggestion for the second episode, ditch Jar Jar, and focus more on character development, and plot as opposed to fancy computer animations, and overlong speeder racing scenes.",6,0,1,25 January 2000
