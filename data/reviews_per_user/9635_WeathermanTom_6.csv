The Lobster," Shock for shock's sake
","I like symbolism. I get symbolism. However, the art of symbolism or the portrayal thereof should, in my humble opinion, be handled discreetly. I prefer searching for references on my own rather than have them thrown at me. This is a film which is directing my thoughts to a certain direction, with strict directions by the director. It leaves little space for reflection upon what is being portrayed. Greek directors such as Lanthimos, a Von-Trier wannabe of sorts, use extremities and shocking images to project their 'philosophie du comptoir' perceptions of reality upon their audience. In all honesty, I have almost never left a film halfway in, but in the case of The Lobster I have. Some might actually indulge in what the film is about, but taste is subjective in any case. In a nutshell, I do not appreciate shock for shock's sake, nor art for art's sake for that matter. If you do, then by all means watch this film. If you do not, opt for something way more through provoking, like The Life of Brian.",4,6,11,23 December 2015
Mr. Nobody," This drags forever
","OK, I really liked the concept of this film. Jared does portray a very good picture of a man lost in time/thought/memory and I really loved the game of coincidence. This is a must for those of you that are into that kind of ideas, butterfly effect and the like. Mr Nobody captured me for the first hour, it got me lost in thought, it had me wondering about life at some points, but when I started to get fidgety in my armchair, and noticed that it still had 1h30 to go, I started finding it somewhat unbearable. Overall, great concept, nice acting, thought provoking film, but really drags, man. The only reason why I continued watching it was because I wanted to finish what I had started. I am sorry to say that the film did not make it in my player. I stopped it about 20 minutes before the end. Why? Because it drags for so long that it manages to turn from a great film into something that makes you lose interest.",6,2,6,9 November 2013
Prisoners," A very good kidnapping movie
","If there is one thing someone could say about this film, that would be 'woah... has it been 2h30m already?'. I must say, I heard a lot about this film before watching it, I even read the reviews. Everything about it lived up to my expectations. What I was expecting to see was a film that would keep me at the edge of my seat, which it literally did, a film that would have me guessing all the way through, which I tried really hard not to do but did anyway, and finally a film that -as a friend had told me- would have a predictable 'twist', which it sort of did. This is a very good action/thriller/drama kind of film that really manages to capture you from the very beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. It's not that we have not seen stuff like this before; kidnapping movies tend to be ubiquitous, but there is something about this one that stands out. Jackman gives an outstanding performance, easily said about the rest of the cast as well. I highly recommend this film for everyone.",8,1,1,16 November 2013
Elysium," Slightly let down
","Although I had been waiting to watch this movie ever since a friend showed me the trailer, after we had watched District 9, I felt that it was not exactly what I had hoped it to be. There are some plot holes, and the whole 'leaving Earth and arriving in space within a matter of minutes' was -to my eyes- tackled a bit naively. All this is not disturbing in watching the film, the effects are great throughout, but the characters are somewhat poorly developed. Seemingly bad guys turning into likable characters within seconds of an unconvincing dialogue. Jodie Foster gives a good performance, albeit not her best, Matt Damon is who he is, the bad guys are very bad, and the good are too good. In a nutshell, I would recommend watching this film, because it is a good idea, but do not expect stuff you have not seen before. If I had to compare it to District 9, well... I just can't.",7,1,2,18 November 2013
Thor," Thor? Thorough crap more like it
","The only reason why I would give this the extra point is the effort that went into making the effects for this movie. In my view this is one of the worst marvel films; no, one of the worst super-hero films ever made. The plot is so shallow - I know it is based on the comic, I know... - the hairdos are awful, the roles are as clich√©-ed as it gets, I could go on. And I will. On what basis does Portman fall for Thor? And on what basis does Thor fall for Portman? Also, the only reason that Thor and Loki engage in battle is that the latter threatened to kill the mortal woman that Thor is so in love with for no apparent reason? Don't people usually hold screenings for movies? How did this one make it to the theaters? Did anyone actually went and saw it? This is an insult to Scandinavian mythology; so much so that I believe it should be banned from theaters worldwide. I mean, come on... really? Really?!",2,11,22,16 November 2013
The Wolverine," the most disappointing wolverine movie I have seen
","Unfortunately the very -considerably- good X-men series are culminating in a series of rather disappointing and uninspired wolverine tribute wannabes. This movie leaves so much to be desired, that at some point you cannot help but wonder: 'where are they going with this?'. The answer only reveals itself in the last 3 minutes of the movie, following the first end-credits. I wouldn't want to spoil it for everyone who has not seen the movie yet, so I have this to share: this is a watchable movie, entertaining as far as effects go, filled with plot-holes, leaving you with a taste of 'we-had-to-make-this-movie-as-stipulated-in-our-contract' in the mouth. I would not recommend it, but I would not deter anyone from watching it.",5,3,7,9 November 2013
