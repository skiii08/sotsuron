Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I will always love the story-line, the director, the science fiction, but...
","Let me start out by saying I admire Samuel L. Jackson's body of work as an actor. I respect that he is one of the top 50 actors in the world...Okay now, here's my problem... and believe me it's my problem because I'm sitting out their in Po-dunk watching your movie that I paid a ticket for...
Why did they cast Samuel L. Jackson as one of the Jedi Buddha's? What the bloody $#@*%&/ where they thinking. Sorry but you should of put a alien face on him and now it's too late. He is too recognizable and you didn't suspend belief for one microsecond ... you fired it out of a laser cannon.
What happened to the magic of using unknowns? Sometimes we like to get to learn to know people (strangers) without their box office draw figures being part of the criteria in casting. But then again... to counter that thought>>>What about little Darth's Mom? Why her? Who was she related too? How did you pry her picture off the box of Metamucil and get her to move around. I know what they were looking for. I can practically read the casting specs. 'Down to earth Mom type. Strong but quiet and a co-dependent quality about her so we can somehow make sense of how little Darthy went bad in the years before the Jedi could detect his mita-chloride particles that had run amuck.
Sure it's hard to top a movie as great and legendary as this one. But for God's sake. Please be dutiful with the casting from now on!!!   I'm sure we'd like to see more aliens that don't have legs and arms as well. How about a few telekinetic amoeba that use flatulence as a weapon and a greeting?",Null,0,1,26 December 2001
The Mummy," Why why why Brendan Fraser?
","Okay... this may sound harsh... And I'm sure BF is a real stand up guy and all when he's off screen and I really wouldn't blame him all to much for being in this film (maybe his manager via a nice working paycheck) plus the sequel... but what in blazes was casting thinking when they green-lighted his role in these two films.I would equate it to casting Tatoo from Fantasy island as Dr. Zhivago.Come on give me a flipping break... I immediately stopped believing in his character and every actor coming into contact with him within a one mile radius. I've never quite seen an actor 'glaze' through a role like this one. Plus with his 'acting' played opposite super cool special effects it just made his 'performance' seem even more contrived. Sure it's not easy working around special effects when you can't see what's there. But the same goes for performances... cause I kept waiting for his to show up! I think what we got was his chit chat around the craft service table...I felt like I got to meet Indiana Jones' 3rd cousin who dropped one to many hits of vitamin A in high school. And still didn't get to hang out with the cool guys...There's really something wrong with wanting the Mummy to win. I sure did.I wanted the mummy to wrap him up and deliver him to the front porch of Uda H. in a bassinet with a note pinned on him, 'Don't ever let me make this much money again until I really really deserve it'  PS. 'What's a subtext?'
I'd say more about the other actors but It's hard to comment when you can't see straight from the blinding light of ignorant casting.What's next for Mummy III, IV and V. Let me guess... a gigantic casting agent chases after him and his friends and forces them to be in other block-busters... but don't worry our hero will win the day... ... he'll be consistent.  :(  YIKES!!!",Null,0,0,26 December 2001
Ed Wood," Love it! Don't sweat-er the small stuff
","I don't know what it was about J.D. that annoyed me many years ago. Maybe it was the way he got hyped by promoters early in his career. But it was Gilbert Grape, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands that gave me a lot of respect for this guys character range.  He is an excellent actor. Ed Wood is one of those films I could see many times. I've never understood why it didn't do better, though I heard some scuttlebutt over the black and white issue. What a load a Cr*P! Color is completely over-rated in my opinion.
For me a profound spoiler moment in this film:  was B.L. the aging/forgotten star actor trying to make a comeback. We're all going to face a moment sometime in our lives (where symbolically speaking) we find ourselves shooting up heroin in the car right before we go out to overexert ourselves and shoot the wrestling with the giant octopus scene. Is there going to be a hero Director out there trying to squeeze the last bit of star dust out of your faded career?  That makes Ed Wood the hero for me. There is the real truth. It's not about the movie it's about the people making the movie.  I also love the truth of the low budget cinema. Who in that world doesn't want their ounce of blood from you? I truly believe that if you could screw yourself over to get something you needed for your film you'd do it. Oh right, that goes without saying. That's usually the first thing you do. 
I think Eddies biggest mistake was taking that sweater out of the closet. Who knows what kind of award winning films he could have made if he'd just had a teddybear to give him confidence.",Null,0,0,14 January 2002
The Matrix," Great Science Fiction just a couple of drawbacks
","Drawback #1     K.R. I'm sure he is a nice guy, but almost every performance I've seen of his... I don't quite know how to describe it without sounding cruel. The words monotone and deadpan come to mind. Just about every movie I've seen this guy in comes across that way, with the exception of Bill and Ted's... but I think that was a good example of excellent type casting. K.R. continues to land leading man roles and I hope that something happens to free up the multitude of his unused, lazy, facial muscles and maybe some vocal training could help to vary some tone. Respectively, they sure come in handy during close ups and it might make the sound guy work a little harder. Drawback #2     The martial arts scenes...(if you could call it that) Let's just say karate...  What cool special effects... to me a poor substitute for sloppy martial arts... nothing I hate more than watching slow martial artists(karate trainees) being made to look good. But not everyone can be a Jackie Chan. Anyone who really knows what martial arts is about... knows it takes many years to really get that good and to be really effective. 
Other than those two drawbacks I thought this film was very entertaining.  I give it an 8... and a 0 Poke*. *Poke score = the number of times my wife had to jab me in the ribs to wake me up to continue watching a film.",Null,0,0,9 January 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Well here's one I've seen more than 50 times
","You English (Caaa-nigg-itts) says the taunting French knight from the castle. I had to watch this film at least 7 times before I realized he was mis-pronouncing the word 'Knights'God this is a funny movie. There is something magical about a group effort. You can tell... plus I've always noticed that the less money you have the more creative you have to be. I'm sure many a studio executive has been stumped at the secret to making a cult classic. I think poor, driven, crazy and brilliant are some of the ingredients in that cake.
I could go on and on about this movie. There isn't a scene I couldn't recall or a line I couldn't parrot.(pardon the pun) But suffice to say that the day this movie was born a new genre in comedy was delivered to the world.
Killer rabbits... who'd of thought. I wonder who ended up with that fluffy, bloody piece of memorabilia.It cracks me up when I hear kids these days amusing themselves by going over the dialogue with one another. Something very familiar to my pals and I back in the 80's. An amazing timeless classic. So simple yet so profound yet so absolutely whacky. Now the question is: How fast is the air speed velocity of a Producer pitching a remake offer of Monty Python and the Holy Grail to his studio heads? Answer: As fast as he can fly after getting his As* kicked out of the bungalow.Say is that an eastern European producer or Western?What? I don't know.  Ahhhhhhhh!!!!",Null,0,0,9 January 2002
