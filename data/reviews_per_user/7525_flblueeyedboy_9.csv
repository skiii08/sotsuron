The Avengers," Greatest superhero movie in history
","Saw the preview at the end of Thor back in 2011... had to wait almost a year to experience the global phenomenon first-hand. The theater experience wasn't something to forget.All in all, the title of this review says it all. 'Marvel's The Avengers' is quite possibly the greatest superhero movie in history. The combination of hardcore assassins Widow and Hawkeye, reclusive Banner, arrogant Iron Man, leader Cap and the Norse brothers Thor and Loki mixes itself together into a concoction of personalities and superpowers which guarantees to impress.Marvel has set the bar high for themselves. Since its release, only a select few superhero movies have compared to it. And all of them have been Marvel!",10,39,60,21 January 2015
The Maze Runner," One of the most unique book franchises out there
","Only seen this movie once, but the execution and plot are brilliant! The land itself is spectacular. The perfect example of Louisiana backwoods bayou country.Any fans of book franchises like The Hunger Games and The Hobbit would most likely enjoy this feature. The story sucks you in until every detail is revealed, and until you know the truth, you regret having to pause the movie and come out of the trance.The grouping of characters of different accents, races and nationalities gives a sense of equality to the movie. There is a star and hero of every kind of race. Overall 'The Maze Runner' is a very impressive piece of work, worthy of a book movie trilogy. I would have given it a 10 if the end wasn't such a cliffhanger.",9,2,4,20 January 2015
Pacific Rim," A much-needed monster flick!
","First off, the colors are quite impressive. The fight scenes are exciting and energetic, and the whole movie itself is quite believable. The idea of monstrous 400-foot tall creatures living underneath the world's oceans comes as unique and different, but in a good way.The Kaijus, as they're called, wage a war with the humans, who in turn drop their political and military differences to create an army of larger than life combat robots, referred to as 'jaegers'. The end result is a world war waged between two different armies to determine who gains control of Earth. Overall it's an amazing monster movie for a change, instead of those unbelievable low-budget flicks.",10,1,2,21 January 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," A color-coordinated and sugary masterpiece!
","I never saw Wreck-It Ralph when it came out, and after seeing 'Frozen' and 'Big Hero 6', I thought 'there's no way that this guy measures up to the likes of Elsa and Baymax!' Boy, was I wrong! The overall film itself is made to tell the story of the video games we take for granted every day. Ralph is a bad guy trying to get along with the good guys, but every bad guy has his challenges. The power this film carries with it is amazing, about friendship, proving yourself, and accepting yourself for who you are.The part at the end when he helps Vanellope finish the race sprouts the friendship in these two, who live only one trip through Game Central Station from each other. This film highlights the bond of two unlikely friends. One from a world where he's always the bad guy, and one from a world in which she's treated like a freak.This film lives up to the immortal and nearly incomprehensible standards that Disney Animation Studios sets for itself, raising the bar every year with yet another animated, colorful, and sugary spectacle that will leave you with a warm heart and a craving for cake!",10,5,7,20 January 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," An animated spectacle for the ages
","I have been a fan of the How to Train Your Dragon franchise since the first movie, and when I saw this movie for the first time... it was nothing I had ever seen before! Every component of the first movie was expanded and branched out upon. Their world has gotten bigger in every way possible. The colors, the characters, the conflict, the dragons... even the score has been expanded and improved to bring about a whole other dimension of their world! How to Train Your Dragon 2 is truly an animated juggernaut, and is something that nobody else will be able to upstage. It is possibly the most unique storyline of any animated film out there, and is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, from ages 8 to 98. Here's to you, Hiccup and Toothless!",10,2,3,6 January 2015
Frozen," Perfect
","Over the past sixteen months the world has developed literal 'Frozen Fever', as evident in the billions of dollars of DVD, Blu-ray, toy and clothing sales. Everything is amazing about this film, it's hard to put it all into one review.The attitudes of the characters contrast each other perfectly with the chilling outlying of the plot. Care free Anna and Olaf balance with hard-toned Kristoff and paranoid Elsa.But the best parts of the movie are definitely the 'Let It Go' sequence and the revival of Anna from her frozen heart. Not from Elsa's love, as everybody else at first thought, but from the sacrifice of herself in order to save her sister.The computer animation is also astonishing, giving the movie that feel of early 1800's Norway. With the close-knit kingdom of Arendelle virtually coupled to the sea and nestled in the snow-covered mountains, it gives a feel of reality.Overall this movie is by far the highest-grossing and highest-selling animated feature of all time, but it's still not considered the best, compared to the original wave of Disney features, including 'The Lion King', 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast'. That's why I didn't give it the extra star.",9,8,15,14 March 2015
Big Hero 6," A unique trend setter for animated movies to come
","Disney Animation Studios, back in November 2014, bought us a story of 14-year-old robotics genius Hiro Hamada and robot nurse Baymax, who together band together a team of heroes in speed demon Go Go, chemistry master Honey Lemon, organized Wasabi and school mascot wannabe Fred, whose mission is to help the citizens of San Fransokyo.This film is like nothing else on Earth. A unique animated movie, it combines aspects of the Marvel Comics line of the same name, while still keeping the magic of Disney animation.Combined with the valiant, electro-rock anthem 'Immortals', created originally by the immortal Fall Out Boy just for the movie, Big Hero 6 oozes heartfelt sentiments, safety tips, and the strength of family and friendship. The Academy recognizes it too, as the film has been nominated for dozens of awards, including nominations for both the Golden Globes and Oscar.",10,53,78,21 January 2015
The Conjuring," Enough to keep you up all night!
","'The Conjuring' is virtually an autobiographical tale of Ed and Lorraine Warren's most terrifying and memorable case. This film is definitely worth an R-rating, but for nothing too out of context. It's not a bloodbath, no one has sex, there's not even severe language. But the jump scenes by themselves are enough to give it R, and scare grown men out of their skin and back into it! This film is definitely worth its rating, but it's one of the best horror movies in the past 20 years. The power behind the story is one that will never be forgotten. But be warned; upon your first viewing, do not eat or drink AT ALL! Otherwise you'll have a popcorn rain and a manual soda fountain!",10,0,0,20 January 2015
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Rainbow-afro zebras? Count me in!
","DreamWorks is still nothing compared to Disney, but they are working their way up the animated ladder, producing effective and fun movie series such as this, along with the 'Shrek' and 'How to Train Your Dragon' movie series.The plot of this movie is still centered around Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melvin, four domestic African animals who are shipped to the island of Madagascar after a breakout from the zoo. However, this story is now further developed as a colorful cross-continent escape from Captain Chantel DuBois (voice of Frances McDormand).Coupled with new, color-filled characters in Gia (Jessica Chastain), Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), and Stefano (Martin Short), this movie is filled with excitement, laughter, and fun for the whole family. A perfect addition to a hilarious movie trilogy.",10,2,3,13 March 2015
