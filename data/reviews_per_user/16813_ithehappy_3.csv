The Equalizer," Just an average action movie, but with Denzel Washington in it!
","Well I more or less knew what was going to watch, I mean a movie with action packed up and all, but the main reason for me to watch the movie was, well like a lot of other people, Denzel Washington.I mean he's a brilliant actor and just because of that I could watch this movie without getting annoyed. I mean this is just an average action movie, doesn't matter how many people say how many different things, but that's just the simple truth. You have seen this type before, so many times, sometimes with Neeson in it, some time with Bruce Willis etc., but the difference was the villain in this movie, Mr. Csokas, whom I find another brilliant actor as well, but the problem is, I believe, his character is extremely underwhelmed, regardless of some fancy show off Fuqua tried to pull. Just like 'Flight', Washington drives the movie, and this movie means Washington, which is sad, because we have seen how much great of a role a villain can play a lot of times, some exclusive examples would be Dark Knight Rises, Skyfall etc. in latest times.There is no denying that Denzel was great as usual, but as I said, I expected a lot from Csokas' role too, but I left extremely disappointed. Another negative of the movie is how it ended, I mean I don't really remember an abrupt ending like this on a movie for a long time. It just finished, and in an awful fashion (you can't stop the inevitable but really they could have at least made it a lot tastier), just like someone was running out of time.At the end of the day, it was another propaganda type movie, but I knew that, it was very entertaining nevertheless, with usual brilliance of Washington, and Csokas too, I mean to whatever extent he was given the chance to show off his. You will certainly enjoy this, like I did, but if you wanted a complete package, well you will miss it.Thanks for reading, Regards, Saurav.",6,8,10,20 January 2015
12 Years a Slave," Great movie, but not as great as I thought / heard it would be!
","Well I saw this flick with a tremendously high expectations, cause everyone, my friends, colleagues, relatives, all said this is a mind blowing movie. All I can say is that this is a really nice movie. Some fantastic acting by Mr. Ejiofor, great camera work and all that, but I won't go on and call this a masterpiece, nor I can say this was epic. Oscar deservedly went to the right movie, but it depends on the competition too. You will be glued all the way through the movie, you will feel angry and emotional at the same time, it will keep you in your seat for sure. Other than Mr. Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender did a fantastic job in my honest opinion, playing the role of Mr. Epps. That's about it. You see what happened in the land of the 'free', and you will remember it. It clearly says the world was confined by some petty nonsense, and what a disgrace of human being some of us are, and still is. It gives a clear message to that we all are equal, regardless of our differentiation in colours, religion and place. I enjoyed it thoroughly, some parts were definitely disheartening and touchy, some fine acting and direction, strong story telling, but that's about it. If you expect a masterpiece or some epic show, I can't really say you will be game. It deserves a 7.5 out of 10 from me, nothing more, nothing less.Thanks for reading, Saurav.",8,0,1,26 March 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," Literally Breathtaking Bloodbath for Two Hours!
","Normally I don't do reviews, but this one I felt I should. After seeing the first version I knew what to expect but I didn't realise to what extent. The first one was full of action too, obviously, but this one took it to a whole different level. Keanu Reeves's acting was fitting the role as usual, he spoke almost nothing but no limitation in killing (ALL GUNS mostly) enemies. There will be a point where you will crave for an intermission just so you can take a breath after seeing the continuous bloodbath, almost never ending to a point.Just to sum it up, perfect for viewers who want a no-nonsense action movie, you can relish this without using your brain parts. As a previous Counter Strike player myself, I was rather jealous about them precise headshots ;)Thanks for reading, Saurav",8,0,1,3 July 2017
