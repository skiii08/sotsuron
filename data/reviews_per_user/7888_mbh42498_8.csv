Men in Black 3," Dayum...THE MIIIB...Dayum
","I did not see Men in Black 3 on the day of the premier. Actually just saw on HBO recently. The lively Will 'oooo' Smith and the old prune K, TML, present a fine ending to the MIB story line.In the beginning, I remembered why the MIB movies are amusing to watch. K, J, alien hunting! Alien hunting! However, I am not impressed with the excessive amount of swearing this time. I can understand a man like Smith saying Dayum quite often, but the S word is unnecessary. I was not impressed when I saw Little Fockers for it had ruined my point of view. The amount of inappropriate language and sexual references was a turn off. I thought this when watching MIB, but it became less apparent as the story progressed. Not very pleased with the language, but story made up for it. Something else I must point out is how friggin awesome these two are. These two killed more than multiple aliens in one scene, and are able to kill an alien similar to a mutant in X men Last Stand. The final fight scene is pretty cool.I was a little confused when watching this movie because of time travel. if there is one thing I have trouble understanding, it is time travel. How one little cause changes the course of history or when you go into the past, it could be the past when you went back in time. So the past you are in predicts your arrival. Anyways, it is a little awkward that an alien agency has a time machine. Giant Proton blasters and jet cars? Maybe. Just my idea.The story is what probably made us all attracted. Don't we all just love watching movies of the protagonist changing history and ending up making it the way it was originally? I love this because I just say to myself, 'Tell them the full truth you idiot! Tell him you are apart of a top secret alien agency and that you are from the future trying to prevent an alien from altering history and you are here to stop him!' Maybe not that for every movie, but I always want them to be dead honest. J and K back together again-but younger-horay! The story is actually engaging to watch as we see what life was like decades ago.What made the last third of the movie an eye-popper was that it is mentioned that someone must die. To anyone who thinks single handedly, your jaw drops to the floor. Either time can remain the same, or J must die to ensure the peace of the galaxy. When I heard this, just, wow. Very powerful thought, but the near ending was much, more sad.Comedy and action are moderate this time. A fight scene in the beginning as mentioned, and the final battle are really the one action this time, plus also a vehicle chase and a few other chase scenes on foot. The humor is just at eh. The little hobbit wearing a hat can be funny in his first appearance and watching the 1-and a half duo back together brings some laughs, but not as many as the first movie.The acting is great this time. There is no hot villainess to subtract from evil (sorry Mr. PP, maybe next time) which makes the few fights that much better and you really get the idea of how the past K and J's relationship is as a stranger is trying to trust another stranger. The hotshot Kyle Reese-like-hero, the older teacher, the dangerous alien, and the oracle hobbit make the movie the way it is. Not a bad thing though, for I did enjoy the movie.The ending is probably the most grand of the movie though. It starts off somewhat sad, but then another twist in the story appears as a familiar face is introduced. Won't say who cuz someone probably has and the scene is on you-tube.I would watch again. While there is no talking pug and the worms have little part, MIB still has the exciting agent bounty hunters as before and do not reduce the experience with the edition of a new actor. I am waiting for the next time the Men in Black will appear again on HBO.",8,0,1,24 May 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Why all the hate? Never payed attention during History class?
","I actually thought this movie was an exciting backstory of President Lincoln. It is a very original concept making a president centuries ago a superhero. Important parts are also highlighted from Civil War textbooks also which is very educational for 2nd graders to see.The story is similar to that of Blade. What I do like about Lincoln though is that all he has is an axe of silver and his friend firing silver bullets. Lincoln is also not enabled with special abilities as he is 'only human' and the vampires here can disappear. Blade was made by Marvel to be the action packed Buffy with a guy shooting guns without even looking at his targets and has super endurance and strength. Our hero is first introduced by the teacher and becomes pro after his first few battles. He then avenges his mother and goes for the real villain. Lincoln finds out about his mentor's past, gets a friend's help in his battles and is taught of isolation. What makes this interesting is that the creators of this movie made it as realistic to this time period as possible. It makes the Civil War Era more fascinating to watch.I do love the historical references. The Underground Railroad, the death of his child, and the ride to the theater at the end.The vampire cannot kill vampires thing is a bit of a joke for me since Blade is so accomplished. Then again it makes it that much more of a challenge knowing that an ordinary human must be trained diligently to defeat even one vampire with something like an axe.The fight scenes are pretty appealing for me. The constant slow-mo and twirling of an axe just makes you want to do the same.If you go on Watch32.com, you can watch the movie for free without downloading. I saw Lincoln on here since I was too lazy to pay 10 bucks for a ticket. I'm not lying. No viruses and has decent quality. Be sure to check out because I'll go and watch Lincoln again",9,1,2,24 May 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Not as bad as you people think.
","I almost laugh at commenters who give this movie 1 Star. One person referred to people as 'morons', one said that having a seemingly dead character dead wasn't original, and another didn't even see 3,4,5. Went to go see the movie last night and it seemed to be much better than 5 in my opinion.Similar to Fast 5, The Team(Diesel, Walker, Luda, Gibson, Kang, Gadot, and Rock) is back, excluding the other two guys. While amnesia is not the most clever and original idea out there, it is not something seen in most films and gives writers a reason for Diesel to take the job. If it were any other criminal, Diesel would probably refuse. The amount of destruction, the customized drag racing cars, the fights, it just goes to show how much The Fast series has evolved.Fast 5 did have the rest of the cast helping out in the mission, but it was just some small stuff. Undercover work, opening safe, helping during the chase. Really, the everyone else wasn't that significant to the mission. This time, EVERYONE has a major part in this. You have Gadot with gun, Kang and Gibson get their ***es whooped and help more during the tank chase, Rocky is seen beside Diesel, and then there's Ludicrous standing on the sidelines. The members of the team seem more important this time around.What some people do complain about, and I understand, is that this movie is less about Fast Driving and more about fighting. I get it; its easy to feel this way. While very slightly sad about that, 6 seems to have much more comedy and humoric jokes. They might mostly revolve around Tyrese Gibson, but nonetheless the jokes are still funny. Taking snacks out of the vending machine, foul mouth during the tank scene, the grappling hook, BIG FOREHEAD. So while less about the fast street racing like in the original, it has added a few more jokes and fighting which isn't that much worse.What does impress me most is the progression of the Fast Movies. First the main ant was an Asian gang with Uzi's and motorcycles. 2 was a white guy with 2 Spanish henchmen, 3 was a Japanese teenager, 4 was(I actually never fully saw 4. lol), 5 was a corrupt Spanish police force, and this time involved guys from the same breed. As mentioned, these are not cops, these are the best criminals in Europe; they are fast and deadly. They have their own set of custom cars that are faster to begin with and have ramps on their hood. They have advanced and modified weapons like the chips. Last importantly, 'They Got a Tank'. The series went from something as small and minor as guys on motorcycles to extreme drivers with a tank and drag cars.I do honestly enjoy this movie much more than 5, though watching this in a theater did hurt my eyes from all of the explosions and bright lights. The engagement of supporting characters is a good feature for the first time also, along with the twist near end. Can't wait until this comes out on DVD",8,7,11,15 June 2013
Pacific Rim," MUCH better than Power Rangers and Transformers
","How many of you remember, 'WE NEED DINOSAUR POWER NOW'? Ah, that and the recent Transformer movies. Rather than just A lot of explosions and teenagers running like chicken ......, you get more of the idea that these are manmade military megazords.First, I think I can speak for most people when I say that the fight scenes are 'booking dot' great. The amount of detail in the movements and in the scenery is a sight to see. I mean honestly, there isn't a clear use of military guns and tanks that we've all seen before; its all replaced with giant robot fighting that is pretty much new to us.The story? Like all in your face, big bang movies, I do feel it is a little lacking. But...I didn't really need much of a story because I was so glued to the screen.The idea of the whole movie is where I must applaud. Parts of this movie are so well thought out and original its not seen very often. The idea of using 2 pilots to command a robot, now that I think isn't that original...But the idea of neurology, the design of the whole movie, using weaponry different than some grenades and just some bullets....and the way everything looks in the end.I can say that this is going to be a movie I will be eagerly looking for online and on HBO, as this is literally the best giant robot, giant monster, military, fighting movie EVER MADE",9,10,17,22 July 2013
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fun movie
","If you think you are going to get a lot of explosions like in some kind of Michael Bay movie then you are wrong. Nobody goes Rambo either. While the summary of the movie might not sound that great, the movie gets better. It is similar to the life of a regular couple, but just much more...engaging. They have a nice dinner with wine and bread (Coinsidence?), while being more than careless with the knives. They eat breakfast, but with shattered glasses and whatever wasn't destroyed from gunfire. They have their fair share of fights, that just involves guns and more knives and fists and nut-shots.I'm one who likes a good fire fight and fancy smancy words that 'Secret...Agent Man' uses, but I honestly watch this movie to watch the movie because of humor. At times they do act lovingly to each other, when one isn't trying to shoot the other. You can just feel the fun that these two are having. And then there are some scenes with vince Vaughn that do create a smile.Would recommend if in need of a decent laugh.",8,2,6,7 July 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Could've been better. A lot better
","The movie. eh, not the best. I heard on a secret youtube vid from Bay himself that this was supposed to climb. Well I think it went downhill by a lot.There was this writers strike that caused many parts of the movie to be removed. Autobots, Decepticons, more fights, they were taken out because of it. It might of been better. without that strike, but maybe it wouldn't have been. Im only hoping for the best since Bay took out fox for the last of the trilogy. Especially since they will have Sam's girlfriend removed and have him meet someone else is disappointing. She has been there with him from the start and I think they should finish it together. Wishin the next to be A lot better.",3,0,8,24 February 2011
Godzilla," Must've been before the events of Pacific Rim...
","In my head I was CONSTANTLY thinking of Jaegers and Kaijus from Pacific Rim... Cmon, where's Gypsy Danger at? BLOW THIS .... UPTo anyone who at least knows the previous Godzilla, it was just that one berserk lizard roaming around, and the government has to killer her, similar to Cloverfield, without the amateur recording with a shoe. Godzilla is more than just 'blowing up a rampant, giant monster', but I will not explain why that is, as that would ruin your excitement firsthand if not already spoiled. There is a small plot twist that makes the movie more clear for people trying to understand what has happened.This movie actually has a main character, who is a Lieutenant... He doesn't have a giant megazord or robot to battle Godzilla, he doesn't heat-ray vision or super-strength. His father has just studied Godzilla and any related events after her first appearance, and that is the only reason why this soldier is important. Otherwise, he is just any other soldier who must survive to get back to his family. Then again, I don't really know how well you can focus on an average person with a plot like this if he isn't really important to begin after the story unravels anyway.If you're into giant monsters and Michael Bay Bewms, then watch this modern version of Godzilla",7,1,3,2 September 2014
50_50," Notable efforts from a cast (and Seth Rogen)
","What I enjoy about 50/50 is that it isn't too far fetched from regular life under these circumstances. A 27 y/o gets a rare cancer that is not commonly diagnosed or beaten, meets with a young and attractive therapist (which is convenient for us and plot development), has a protective mother, and a Seth Rogen-type friend. Everything that Adam does in this movie is based upon these characters,who all act very stereotypically towards a guy with cancer. His mother gets regresses to when she was a primary caretaker. After the breakup with his girl friend, Kyle takes Adam under his wing through marijuana and sex. He tries to push Adam even farther away from his now- ex by convincing him to be carefree about her, and even disrespecting her a little bit. Bros before hoes.Something my teacher brought up is that therapists are not allowed to touch a client without permission. Anna Kendrick at this time does not abide by this, being she's only 24 and still inexperienced. Although it's valid to say that this is unrealistic of a therapist to stray from this ethic, it's also valid to remember she is still kinda new. With only 3 patients and still in training, she's a rookie. It's just that humanly error and convenient characteristic for plot development that makes this movie more heartfelt. Adam is pretty likable as the main character of this movie. The guy gets a threatening cancer diagnosis at a young age where it's very likely he'll die. What happens to him are plausible events, minus going out to get laid. I understand that people tend to pity someone who suffers, but would a girl really have a stand with a cancer patient? I just don't see that happening. His whole conflict with his girlfriend, plausible to display of character. You can't expect a loved one to not feel struck with so much stress during the time. It takes a strong woman like his mother to take care of someone with such a physical or mental disease.With all that said, I've become a much bigger fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anna Kendrick. The first time I really watched anything of Levitt in depth was 10 things I hate about you. What I learned is that he was a child actor as well. He has really come such a long way since then, as he actually turned out to be a respectable actor. And now I can't stop obsessing over Anna Kendrick. She has the confidence of Tina Fey without being over the top and obnoxious like some other characters, plus charm and beauty. I love the ending as well; the interaction that we've seen from them, you just want to smile every scene. I know I did, how they were always so awkward with one another until they call.The music chosen and played for this movie is pretty good too as it helps define the mood. I don't think any songs were produced a few years within this movie, and if there are then they certainly aren't mainstream songs that are used like they are today. There also are some songs not included in the soundtrack that are subtle and delicate, but add to then moment when no one is talking. The use of guitar solos in some scenes is very original compared to rap.I could easily watch this movie repeatedly because of everything about it. The real, yet fun, scenarios make this one of the cast's finer works. Often I find myself searching for certain clips of this movie, because it was so enjoyable to watch. Another Kendrick or Levitt movie is next on my list, considering how great this one was.",9,0,0,27 March 2016
