Lucky Number Slevin," The buildup was too slow and painful for the payoff
","Reading the reviews on the back of the movie at the video rental store I thought this movie would be incredible. The cast is full of stars, and the premise sounded good. That's why I found it so disappointing when the movie opened so slowly. After just over an hour if watching I paused it and looked to see how much was left, and considered turning it off. I kept waiting for something to happen, other than endless discussions that seemed to go nowhere. The scenes that finally made the movie enjoyable came almost too late for me to care. The ending was good, and I came away not as negative as I had been earlier, but overall I thought the movie developed too slowly, and at times seemed to be going nowhere.",5,0,2,11 March 2007
The Dark Knight Rises," Life-alteringly good
","I wish it were possible to retire a franchise in the way that sports teams retire the jersey numbers of their all-time best players. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy should be enshrined in a hall of fame and no one need ever re-make a Batman movie. I thought 'The Dark Knight Rises' was as close to perfect as I could ask for. The story was far, far better than my expectations, and the ending was amazing.Ironic that Spider Man just got rebooted, and there was a trailer for YET ANOTHER Superman movie shown before I saw Dark Knight Rises. I hope that when someone in the future inevitably starts re-making Batman they give it the same care and level of excellence as we have seen here.",10,4,10,5 August 2012
