Deja Vu," A excellent action film with bits of sci-fi and murder investigation included. A thoroughly enjoyable film.
","Denzel Washington is not a first to action/thriller films. So with the role of a detective investigating a brutal murder and a terrorist attack he is more than familiar in his role.The film opens showing a huge ship boarding military navel soldiers that have just came back from there duty work, and at there delight meeting their beloved family members. These romantic/intimate scene's soon end with a bomb going off on the ship, which results in no survivors. This is when Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is called into action to investigate the incident. Upon investigating the bomb a murdered women drifts upon shore, who after a autopsy appears to have been murdered.When investigating he is introduced to a new technological innovation which appears to be able to view the past 4 days prior to the 'now' time. But with the concept of Einstein's parallel universe coming into play he asks the question 'can he still save her'.A film with a good story-line plot and excellent acting contributes to make this a really enjoyable film, which keeps you guessing. Would Definitely recommend this film.",9,0,1,7 July 2007
