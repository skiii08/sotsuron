Captain Phillips," Fine acting performance from Tom Hanks and a near perfect acting debut for Barkhad Abdi.
","When this film came out, the plot, the setting, the choice of actors all seemed to tick the boxes for me. A tense nerve-wracking thriller based on a true story and the best bit of all, featuring Tom Hanks, one of the most talented and influential actors of all time. This seemed like a perfect opportunity for Hanks to shine and deliver another one of his near perfect portrayals and I can now safely say that this film exceeded my expectations because of his performance and his co-star Barkhad Abdi's, who single-handedly each provided two near perfect depictions of the hero and the villain.Captain Phillips is a tense, nail-biting thriller that tells the story of Richard Phillips and his run-in with Somali pirates whilst delivering cargo on his ship. This film revolves around two key settings, SPOILERS AHEAD....On his ship and on a lifeboat that the pirates commandeered from Phillips' cargo vessel. Not going into too much detail surrounding the story at each point, I'll only say that the scenes on the ship aren't as tense as the scenes on the lifeboat but are extremely nail-biting nonetheless. Near the end of the film, again, SPOILERS AHEAD....When Hanks' escapes the lifeboat with the help of the US Navy, he gives a performance that can only be described as being worthy of an Oscar. Also a particularly chilling scene that involves the demise of the pirates shows Hanks portray Phillips' emotions at that point perfectly.On the other hand, his co-star, Barkhad Abdi delivers a blood-curdling interpretation in his role as the main Somalian pirate, 'Muse'. Despite Abdi having no experience in acting, his portrayal of the titular villain ultimately earned him an Oscar nomination despite constantly being overshadowed by Hanks. Don't get me wrong, he delivers an extremely powerful performance but when you put an Oscar winning actor like Tom Hanks in with an actor with little to no acting experience, it's quite obvious who'll be the better of the two.Overall this film provided a tense cinematic experience that combined the outstanding acting of the two main stars with the horrifying real-life ordeal of Captain Richard Phillips. The film itself was a rarity in that it featured an Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks and was good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. However this film had one minor flaw that people might find extremely irritating, which is that despite the story being completely true to life, all the little details in the film weren't all correct. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and I consider it to be one of Hanks' finest pieces of work and is definitely a potentially Oscar worthy film.",9,0,2,8 March 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," Honestly, one of the best films I've ever seen, and quite possibly my favourite of all time.
","Often said to be one of the best films of all time, I can't help but agree. No matter how many times I watch this over, I feel like it never bores me and I am always captivated in a way that I've never felt with any other film before.The Shawshank Redemption is a tale of hope, courage and betrayal, seen through the eyes of prison inmates 'Andy' played by Tim Robbins, and older convict 'Red', portrayed by Morgan Freeman in an Oscar nominated performance. The film is set over 19 years in Shawshank prison, and depicts the life of Andy Dufresne, a hotshot banker and his struggle with keeping his mind and his sanity, whilst serving time for a crime he didn't commit. As Andy has to put up with harassment, distress and affliction throughout the duration of his time at the prison, the film illustrates a tale of eternal hope. As time slowly passes in the prison, he's assisted by an older inmate by the name of 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), a black marketer who is 'known to locate certain things from time to time'. As the years pass by, Andy's friendship with Red grows and so do the hardships they have to overcome.The film itself has touched me in many ways, it shows me just what people can do when they have a little faith and keep incessant hope no matter what. Obviously, Stephen King's greatest and most memorable big screen interpretation, one of which he is almost certainly proud of. The movie is a timeless classic that speaks to me and probably a lot of others on so many levels, providing a near perfect film with a great plot line and representing a storyline with an even better message.Tim Robbins delivers an enthralling performance as the titular character, one that certainly stands out throughout the film whereas Morgan Freeman's interpretation of fellow convict Red is just as captivating, earning him recognition from the academy but not his fellow co-star Robbins, obviously yet another Oscar snub.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption speaks out to its audience, as it shows a tale of perseverance and perpetual hope when in the midst of the struggles in life. The film itself is possibly my favourite of all time and manages to keep my attention on the 10th time of watching it. A must-see for anyone who has a good taste in films and is looking for a movie that will change their perspective on life and give them the hope to pull through in the darkest of times.",10,1,1,11 March 2015
