Captain Phillips," 'Captain Phillips' movie (now on screens in Russia)
","Just returned from 'Captain Phillips' movie (now on screens in Russia). A dramatic event. And, a certain truth of life; quite different as viewed from main character's side and from that of his antagonists. During last scenes barely sustained a blocked throat and tears that were ready to leak out... Although, the event in itself is of a usual kind, for certain geographic locations - and that's the truth of life. It just goes ordinarily like this - and even a good portion of US fleet is not a 'remedy' - it settles a single event, but does not change the overall trend. So, the general issue is still to overcome... Would recommend for watching, a great emotional experience.",10,0,2,5 December 2013
In Bruges," A one-time see.
","Well, everybody fuss about the new star... My stepdaughter, getting her baccalaureate in theater critics couple of days ago, was appraising the author, and convinced me to watch this. In 2008, when the film was released, I've heard the name, but it passed me; so I thought, this time I'll definitely watch it. To be true, I've could well be done without. Recalling Guy Ritchie,s films, I've at least laughed watching them. This one left me absolutely idle. I am becoming old, perhaps. But tiny surface emotions don't touch, even with great dose of Irishness, brilliant actors and a lot of senseless shooting, 'strong bloody violence, pervasive language and some drug use'... Rated this with a '2' just because of some compassion, though could put a rightful '1' mark.",2,0,6,23 February 2017
The Death of Stalin," reminds me of 'Khrustalev, get the car' by Alexey German
","'The Death of Stalin,' was like the 'Khrustalev, get the car' by Alexey German. It's shot in the same manner. Comic-book, by the way, depicts the events tougher, but in general, the authors of the film managed to save more or less the same graphics and dynamics. It is clear why the official film is not up to the official authority - behind any showy greatness there are always small selfish intrigues, stupidity and fear - and, it does not rhyme with building the same showy greatness today, moreover, it hints at the same shameful outcome.",7,6,13,3 February 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," OMG
","The 1979 TV series were truly great.
Not this one, however. What forces are pushing Mr Oldman up, I wonder... 
I thought he's absolute bottom is in Churchill; but no, Smiley in the 2011 movie
is even more down. Who's great in a 2011 thing, is certainly John Hurt.
That's a role, that's an acing! Others, I'd rather get dismissed, and replaced by
ordinary street folks - still would be better.
So, viewing not recommended, unless you're a primitive stupid yourself (pardon me!
couldn't help). A one big NO-NO. Go and watch a 1979 product - it's better, professional, 
non-boring, good acting... and there's no Mr Oldman there.",3,0,2,31 May 2018
Dunkirk," A brilliant story about the moral.
","Asphalt paved street. Modern windows. Modern housing on embankment. (Mostly) modern naval ships. Erghh... I told to myself on the first 15 minutes of the movie. With such a budget Mr.Nolan could do better - my thought continued. And then... it all came to me. 1st. It ain't your another war re-acting movie. It's not about that. It's not about armies moved like chess on the boards. No. 2nd. Read some history, give some thought. What d'you see at this spot of time? A change of an epoch. Fallen France, who's major ally, British Empire sends expedition troops to (conquer? stop?) a perfect German modern war machine. It's only Britain now. Nobody else. USSR is still busy dividing Poland and Baltic with Germany. US still have to live through Pearl Harbor disaster to get them into a major war. And UK is aching. Once grand Empire faces now a clear potential Channel dash - and a fight on the Isles themselves. 3rd. A demoralized army group. Yes, they're keeping perfect rows on the beach (very handy for bombing...). But, when it comes to man-to-man, it comes to 'you go, I survive (or I go, you survive, no other alternative). They are moved out, their evacuation ships are sunk, they are moved in again. It's fate. The feeling of fatality runs through 80 pct of the movie. 4th. The army has to be saved. Compulsory. Necessarily. Absolutely. Otherwise, who'll fight when it comes on the English shores?... And here, the 'British' idea unravels to its fullness. You don't save the Army only (though, saving such a number of man is an exceptional retreat operation). It's the Spirit. Spirit, being shown by the people, when the time is at 'if not me (us), than who else?!'. Those chaps on the beach HAVE to be saved. Even shattered and battered - but in the oncoming years of war to go, they will be a core - as we say in Russia, 'a one beaten man costs as two unbeaten'. ... And that was brilliantly shown by the movie creators. Through each individual eyes. Through simultaneous events - at sea, on shore, and in the air. The history is about survival. Or extinction. An historic achievement, on the way. When nothing else is viable - you have a moral to keep you going. VERDICT: a brilliant story about the moral. Dramatic. Personal. Painful. And true. ... PS. I praise all acting by all actors in this movie. It's pointless to discuss, who's 'britishness' is more here... But, Mark Rylance, in telling the essence of 'There's no hiding from this, son,... We've got a job to do' - that goes deep into your mind. So damn well played!",9,1,8,22 July 2017
Parasite," Have you got a plan?
","No plan is the (best) plan. No position is final. Every life is there to improvise, when the chance is. No fixed values, don't fool yourself. No fixed position (though, society place their limits - or gives opportunities) - it all can change unexpectedly at any given moment. No main roles - each life is a role in itself. So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a 'social comedy' though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the 'golden palm' and a lot of 'oscars' (despite critics' grumble - what so many 'oscars' given for...). That one surely goes into a world cinematic library - to be a modern classic.",10,9,15,12 February 2020
