The Blair Witch Project," Wretched!
","Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Now, if only 'The Blair Witch Project' could have been half as fascinating. With easily the most unappealing cast ever assembled, this film is a shaky, schlocky, shambles.  Nothing happens, except that the characters (especially the girl) get more annoying, with every word they utter.  There isn't a single scare in the entire movie.  Some films are so bad, that they end up being good (as in fun to watch). This film is beyond that kind of bad.  A masterpiece of marketing, this film is horribly made, with simply nothing to see.  NOTHING!  Lousy on every level.  NOT recommended!",1,8,14,30 October 2000
The Sound of Music," Film musicals don't come better than this!
","This film is so perfectly made, that most of its critics point to its 'sweet' story, as a problem. That, of course, is a matter of taste. The film itself, is flawless. Every aspect of the Broadway show has been improved upon for the film version. Julie Andrews, who was was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, and should have won, is more than the foundation for the film's perfection. She is simply without peer. There isn't anyone who could have played the role better. Her performance is so overwhelming, that during its initial theatrical run, she became an international obsession. Of course, the film doesn't end with Julie. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, orchestrations, scenic design and the entire cast, are excellent. This film was meant to be seen in a theater, on a super wide screen (that most cities don't even have anymore). As it is, on home video, you must see it in its widescreen (letterbox) version. The current DVD edition is about as good as you can hope to see it. A 40th Anniversary Edition DVD is soon to be released. Avoid the sing-a-long theatrical version, at all costs! When it's said that 'they don't make 'em like that anymore', they're talking about 'The Sound of Music'. It is perhaps the best film ever made!",10,1,7,5 October 2000
The Ring," Silly
","Not silly in a real laughable, unintentionally funny way (except maybe once or twice); but, what could have been original (and, at times, is), ultimately comes off as a rip-off of every other horror film that came before it.  It's never really scary (long sequences where you are fooled into thinking something scary is about to occur; but it doesn't), and, it suffers from characters that aren't particularly likeable.  You never find yourself caring about what happens to them, mainly because the plot is so murky and the characters under-developed.  There is a kid whose characterization is blatantly stolen from 'The Sixth Sense', and, his presence adds nothing to the proceedings.  Goofy in plot, and in desperate need of better editing, this movie is just plain silly.  Not recommended",Null,0,0,4 November 2002
Unbreakable," An Engrossing Film
","M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up film to 'The Sixth Sense', is a real winner. Like 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' is a relatively quiet picture, which moves slowly and deliberately, to its climax.  The film is about people and the words they speak, not special effects (thank God!)I found some of the panning and scanning and tilting and circling of the camera to be somewhat distracting; but overall, 'Unbreakable' is a mesmerizing tale of an everyman, who comes to grips with his place in the world.  It has solid performances from its cast, a wonderfully appropriate score by James Newton Howard, and first rate direction from Shyamalan.  See only the widescreen version.  Recommended.",10,0,0,12 July 2001
The Rookie," Wonderful Film
","Wonder of wonders, a G Rated adult entertainment.  'The Rookie', is a real baseball film, besting most others, in the genre, while presenting real characters, without resorting to foul language and crude gestures, that plague almost every motion picture, today.  What we get with 'The Rookie', is adult entertainment, in the truest sense.  An intelligent screenplay, with quiet, careful direction, and a thoughtful, almost mesmerizing performance, by Dennis Quaid. This movie is like a wonderful gift, that is slowly unwrapped before our eyes.  While it is rated G, the film's real, quiet tone, would probably not appeal to today's kids audience.  Sad, really, since this is the type of film, that I saw often, as a kid.  Highly recommended!",10,0,0,22 April 2002
The Mummy," The Best Time I Had At The Movies In Years!
","This dynamite re-telling of the mummified tale, is about the best film to come out of Hollywood in more than a decade. Everything about its approach to telling the story, is first rate. The cast has great fun; and, so do we, watching them go about their adventures. Everyone is superb in their roles, and the special effects are brilliantly used, throughout. As if that isn't enough, it contains a beautiful score, too. This is a top-notch evening's entertainment; and is the adventure film to end all adventure films. Few films in recent years have been so well cast and excellently executed. It out-adventures 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', with a leading man and lady who surpass that great adventure classic. I love this film. See it, and have a great time!",10,0,1,10 October 2000
Grease," This was a hit?
","The dumbness of this film, and its mediocre production values, make its hit status an utter mystery.  Like the television show, 'Happy Days', 'Grease' is a 70's version of the 50's.  Not for a second are you lost in the decade in which the film is set.  It is far too 1970's in its feel, for that. The film's only appeal comes from its two stars, the only cast members who look young enough to be in high school.  The rest of the over-the-hill gang mugs and overacts, shamelessly.  It is horribly directed and the musical numbers look like rejects from a much better show.  The film of course isn't entirely to blame.  The stage production of 'Grease', is just as bad. Perhaps worse.  It's all a matter of taster. So if 'Grease' is the word for you, then by all means, enjoy.  I didn't.",1,40,80,5 October 2000
U-571," Hollywood Action/Suspense At Its Best!
","U-571 takes many events involving the capture of German U-Boats, during World War II, and spins an engrossing, suspenseful tale, that will have you on the edge of your seat.  Those looking for historical accuracy, should look elsewhere.  Those wanting an involving, gripping, thrill-ride of a film, need look no further.  Highly recommended!",10,1,9,3 January 2002
Spider-Man," Excellent Comic Book To Film Adaptation
","This is the film that proves it CAN be done!  'Spider-Man' gets it right, on all counts.  Where 'Superman' was too camp, and 'Batman' was too dark, 'Spider-Man' plays it right down the middle, and is a delight to behold. It's success is due, in no small part, to the wonderful performances from its cast.  Most notably, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, who really know how to act; and, more importantly, react.  Their performances are perfection.  Wonderful direction, cast, screenplay and score make this a must see.  Highly recommended!",Null,0,0,4 November 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Immensely Overrated
","So many people loved this film, that I actually rented the DVD to re-watch it. I had originally seen it in a movie theater, during its initial release, and I hated it. The second time was certainly not a charm. Possessing the knowledge of what was to come, made for an even more boring movie experience. This film's much talked about opening, lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film. The movie meanders about, aimlessly, for what seems an eternity, and almost nothing happens. When something does happen, it isn't anything that you haven't seen, done by the same old characters that you've seen before, in countless other (and better) WWII films. Even the dialog is old Hollywood corny. Then, after being about virtually nothing for hours, it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old Vet is. Meant to tug at our heartstrings (nothing wrong with that); but only elicited a groan and a roll of the eyes from me. Tedious, with virtually no character development. Not Recommended.",1,69,153,31 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful, but...
","This film is stunning to look at, and the star quality screen presence of Michelle Yeoh, set this film apart from others in its category.  However, ultimately it is yet another in an endless line of Kung-fu films.  It is all a matter of how into these fight sequences you are.  After the second one, I had my fill.  Certainly a mountain above the others, but basically the same old thing.  Recommended for the Kung-fu crowd, only.",4,0,0,19 June 2001
JFK," Muddled
","At times visually stunning, 'JFK', is more often than not, a muddled mess. Characters are so broad and cartoon-like, that you will often laugh out loud.  The plot is so preposterous, with everyone from the White House to the Louisiana gay underground involved in the conspiracy.  People really can't keep their mouths shut for 10 minutes; but we are to believe that all these people were involved, and all of them kept quiet, all these years. Kevin Costner turns in one of his dull as watching paint dry performances. Sissy Spacek gives the only believable performance, and her character is totally useless.  The whole film is so over-the-top, that whatever point Oliver Stone was trying to make, gets lost in the clutter.  Not recommended!",Null,1,12,16 October 2000
The Mummy Returns," Too Much Of A Good Thing?
","Unlike its predecessor, this hugely successful sequel to 1999's superior 'The Mummy', is light on character and heavy on spectacle.  Too much spectacle perhaps.  The charm of the original, which came from the relationship of its characters, and was its strongpoint, is gone, in favor of overwrought computer generated special effects.  The film is almost exclusively action sequences; one after the other. The original's cast is back, and that helps defray the onslaught of action; but this sequel is about half as good as the original.  'The Mummy' is the greatest adventure film ever made, so half as good is still entertaining.  If you're a sucker for heavy-handed CGI-created action scenes, then you simply cannot go wrong with 'The Mummy Returns'; and while I would have preferred the character interplay of the original, as a fun piece of fluff, it is recommended.",Null,0,0,28 September 2001
Mission: Impossible," Great!
","For Tom Cruise fans and non-fans alike.  This wonderful thriller, is so well crafted, that it took my breath away.  Many people (even profession film critics!) didn't understand it.  Perhaps it is too well written.  Yes, it is complex.  Yes, it is written for people with an attention span greater than a 3 year old's - you MUST pay attention; but it DOES make sense.  Every single second of the film is important.  Director Brian De Palma gives us the unexpected, at every turn.  His visuals, as always, are exciting.  The entire cast is fine; but it is De Palma's movie, all the way.  One of the best film's of the 90's.",10,1,2,6 October 2000
Carrie," Transcends Horror
","As directed by Brian De Palma, 'Carrie' (based on the novel by Stephen King), both caters to and transcends the typical horror genre.  Academy Award nominated performances from Sissy Spacek (who should have won) and Piper Laurie (who should have won), De Palma's visuals (the Prom Sequence is a standout!), Pino Donaggio's gorgeous score and wonderful performances from the entire cast, make 'Carrie' a unique film experience. Recommended!",9,0,0,20 October 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," Silly Thriller
","Plot-holes abound, in another in an endless stream of silly thrillers, that started in the 80's.  This one actually won an Academy Award for Best Picture, over a cinematic masterpiece like Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast'. The plot has been done before, and with much better results, in Michael Mann's taut, chiller, 'Manhunter'.  This film spends a lot of time pretending to be chilling, but it really is a poorly written piece of fluff. It get so preposterous, that it ends up being not unlike those old movies, where the heroine goes toward the danger with a candle.   Jodie Foster's character is so dumb in this film, that she doesn't even HAVE a candle. After an entire film of telling us how smart and with it she is, she does the stupidest things, in the climax of the film.  Foster and Hopkins deserved their Oscars, for basically rising above the inane script.  They give fine performances.  Otherwise, this is an overrated turkey.  I never have and never will get what all the fuss was about.  See 'Manhunter', instead.",Null,1,1,13 October 2000
Speed," Too Much Action?
","If a film can suffer from too much action, then 'Speed' is guilty of that. Otherwise, it is an almost flawlessly crafted action film, arguably without peer.  Reeves makes an excellent hero, and Bullock just about steals the film with her fun and gutsy character.  It starts off with a bang, and never lets up. Action films don't get better than this.",10,0,0,13 October 2000
Jurassic Park," Dinosaurs come to life, in lifeless film.
","The eye-popping visual effects, are the highlight of this tale of a theme park gone mad.  The public's endless fascination with dinosaurs made this a top money-maker; but aside from it's visual effects, the film is a seemingly endless yawn-fest.  Character development is so basic, that, except for their ages, you'd have a hard time telling the kids from the adults. Everyone, except the dinosaurs are void of personality.  When the creatures aren't on the screen, you're subjected to a screenplay that features dull, one-dimensional characters spouting boring dialog.  Steven Spielberg seems to have lost his ability to direct a film, that grips an audience with its storytelling (Duel, Jaws, Close Encounters).  If you want to see a film with a good story, great characters and interesting dialog, stay away from 'Jurassic Park'.  If special effects are your thing, then by all means, watch and enjoy.",1,65,193,10 October 2000
