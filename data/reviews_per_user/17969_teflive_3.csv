Skyfall," What can I say, it's the same old bang bang, kiss kiss and hero wins stuff
","The lead man Daniel Craig as 007 does not seem to take the audience inside the movie and establish a strong emotional connection. What takes you in is the long chase and fight sequences, great cinematography, beautiful locations, but in my book a movie is not about the above elements rather it's about the truthful experiences of the characters and the human life involved in those given situations. I didn't get these from the lead man, disappointing. This movie basically takes off the ground when 'Silva' (Javier Bardem) steps in. His first scene which is longer than any other scenes is a great hook, played well, convincing and entertaining. Though he is the antagonist, you'd actually want more of him. In overall assessment this is an average movie.",5,4,12,4 November 2012
Django Unchained," A movie I'm fully confident to say...
","go out, buy your tickets and watch it, trust me. I can explain why, because I understand you value your time and money. Because I do too. 1. This movie can fit from the young aged group up to the old ones. 2. Hilariously funny. 3. Touches a strong subject. 4. Great acting and story flow.Personally, if I had to rank the performances of the actors Christoph Waltz would go first then LeonardoDicaprio and Jamie Foxx would take the second and third places. Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson also gave memorable performances.This movie is a definite block buster.",10,1,10,30 December 2012
Hotel Transylvania," Welcome to Hotel Transylvania!! On the menu tonight:
","Hors d'oeuvres – you will be enchanted by one the most magnificent father-daughter-relationship that ever existed!Main dish – the story of freedom and love all wrapped up in tons fun will light up your heart!Deserts – our greatest characters teamed up with mind blowing animation artists to take you in a wild journey!OK let's cut the funny crap and get down to business.I want to give credit to the creators on trying to keep this predictable and probably to some extent a well known story structure as fast paced, fun and fresh as possible. I personally incline to rude humors, so I think they did a pretty good job.What interested me most (probably something new) is the way the contemporary human society is depicted as a 'Monster loving' people. I find this exceedingly true. I mean look at Lady GAGA and her influence on main stream pop culture. The majority of modern day youth is properly explained directly and/or on metaphor as 'Jonathan' and 'Mavis'. You could draw a couple of disturbing metaphors if you want to see this a bit more than just an 'entertainment' and consider it as a 'message', but I'll leave that to you (the adults). The soundtrack sums it all up which I personally found it as 'catchy'. My recommendation go watch it and have fun.",10,2,2,30 October 2012
