Saturday Night Fever," Keep On Dancin'
","John Travolta is excellent in his first main role.  He stars as a shop assistant in a paint shop who dreams of dancing at the local disco and winning a dance contest.  The film is set to the famous soundtrack, which is mostly written by the Bee Gees and includes the songs 'More than a woman', Stayin' alive' and the excellent ballad 'How deep is your love'.  It is excellent in the cinema but great fun to see on video also.",5,1,1,5 February 1999
Gremlins," Really good
","Quite original comedy horror film that is just as much fun no matter how many times you watch it. I really think the special effects were good and there were a lot of really funny scenes, especially the one in the movie theater!",Null,0,1,12 May 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!
","This is my most favourite film of all time.  I remember when I first saw it in December 1982, when I was seven.  We had the whole family there and they all loved it too.  I remember the scene when Henry Thomas kisses Erika Eleniak in the classroom right after him and E.T. get drunk, and I always hoped that that would happen to me.  Needless to say it didn't.  The special effects are (like all Steven Spielberg films) amazing.  The music and performances are a real tear jerker for anyone.  I love this movie.",Null,0,0,5 February 1999
Home Alone," Alone at Christmas
","A young boy is left at home alone during the Christmas holidays when his parents leave for their vacation in a hurry.  Burglars threaten his house which he must defend.  Totally unbelievable but has all the usual amount of fun that you'd expect to see in one of John Hugh's movies.  It also has a good music score, and is fun to watch at any time of year and not just during the Christmas period.",Null,0,0,13 February 1999
Notting Hill," Good Film
",This is a real feel good film. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are great together and the supporting cast is brilliant. The ending is superb and could only happen in a film like this. 10 out of 10. I think it might even be slightly better than 'four weddings and a funeral' and 'mickey blue eyes',Null,0,0,15 May 2002
Grease," Grease is the word that you heard!
","I've seen this movie probably over 200 times by now.  I used to watch it every week when I was at school and even now it's as much fun as it always was.  John Travolta and Olivia Newton John are perfectly cast and the excellent songs like 'Grease', 'Hopelessly Devoted to you' and 'Summer Nights' are extremely well staged and performed.  It's also fun to see again in the cinema since its 1998 re-issue.",10,2,3,5 February 1999
Flashdance," An exciting movie
",Story of a girl who dreams of becoming a professional dancer seems to have been inspired by Saturday Night Fever.  It is enjoyable as these kind of movies go and it has a great pop/ rock syle soundtrack which includes the hit Irene Cara song What A Feeling.,Null,0,1,13 February 1999
Back to the Future Part III," Still as much fun as the other two!
",This movie has a western setting.  Marty has to get a train up to 88 miles per hour after the time machine runs out of petrol. Many people I have spoken to thought that this was the best in the series.  I however think it is just as good as the other two.  It is the concluding part of the trilogy.,Null,0,0,6 February 1999
Titanic," A moving film!
","Big budget version of the famous story has become the most successful film of all time, and jointly the biggest Accademy Award winner, 11 in total. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in their roles.  It is long but beautifully filmed and will probably leave most of the audience quite red eyed.  This movie is a classic!",Null,1,2,6 February 1999
Jaws," Look out for the grey fin
","It's so terifying that when I first saw it  I wouldn't go near the beach for what seemed like years after.  The scenes, (especially the opening one) are outstanding and the music score by John Williams helps to build the suspense well.  The finale is one of the most memorable in film history.",10,1,2,5 February 1999
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," A true classic
",The classic of all classics!  This film is as visually stunning now as when it was first released in the thirties.  The story is heartwarming and it has some truly charming songs in it.  The dwarfs are good and it does have the most wonderful Disney ending.,Null,3,4,13 February 1999
Halloween," The Greatest Horror Film Of All Time!
","Maniac locked up for the murder of his sister in the early sixties escapes from a metal institution in 1978 intent on returning to his home town to wreak havoc.  This movie has some excellent suspense scenes and some great shocks.  It was followed by six sequels, none of which were anywhere near as good as the original.",Null,0,0,5 February 1999
Back to the Future Part II," A Good Sequel
","Enjoyable sequel with a darker setting, this time in the year 2015.  The time machine is stolen and the future is re-written and must be prepared in the past where there are now two marty's.  Not as difficult to follow as it may sound but you do have to have seen the original to understand this one.",Null,1,2,6 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Classic!
","The original and the best! I find it a bit pointless to review films like this, because I really have never met anyone who hasn't seen it, however, considering I've seen it over 57 times, it's worth a mention, yes I know that's not much compared to some people(someone I know saw it 377 times!!! This film hasn't aged at all and is still so much fun. It has everything a fantasy/sci-fi/ adventure should have, and if you haven't seen it yet, then where have you been!! The sequels The empire strikes back, and return of the jedi are almost as good. But not the phantom menace!",Null,2,3,12 May 2002
Back to the Future," A Classic!
",Michael J Fox accidently travels into the past in a time machine and gets into situations that threaten his own existence.  This Sci-fi comedy has everything you could wish for.  It is a lot of fun from beginning to end and I would also say it is one of my all time favourite movies.,Null,1,2,6 February 1999
