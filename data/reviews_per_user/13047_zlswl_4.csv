Captain Phillips," Excellent acting and story. It is worth watching
","As usual, Tom Hanks perfect for this role and excellent acting.A real life drama that was well shown in this movie. I don't care about what people are saying in regards the message the movie is trying to give or portraying certain cultures this or that.Unfortunately this is the reality of Somalia. Some people there decided to become pirates and attack merchant ships saying they have the rights to charge them fee (ransom) for using their waters.Completely illegal on international law but totally right on the eyes of the people there who tends to blame the western world for all their problems.",9,1,4,7 June 2014
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," One of the most confusing movies I ever watched.
","An interesting topic indeed as I enjoy cold war movies. However..this one got an Oscar...Oscar of one of the most confusing, weird, makes no sense, strange movies I ever watched. The entire plot is too fast, changing from back to future and back again in a split of second and nobody knows who is doing what and why they are doing it. Terrible...sorry but I have to say if you watch this movie you will certainly feel as lost as I did. A complete waste of time. I feel sorry for Colin Firth, a great actor, and he acted pretty OK on this movie but it was not his fault. I am surprised though that this was an European made movie that usually are much better than the crap American made.",2,1,2,3 October 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Definitely the worse movie I have ever watched.
","This was the first movie I ever walked away before it ended, actually just an hour after it started.I am sorry but I could not cope with so much silliness, stupidity, bad acting and confusion. I think that even some of those American teenage movies are more fun than this one.In fact the photography of the movie is very nice, I liked the buildings, the style, as I admire heritage buildings but this was the only thing this movie could offer really.I had high expectations of this movie but it ended up being the worst disappointment I ever had.Terrible !",1,11,28,7 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Other for DiCaprio....not good at all.
","Leonardo DiCaprio was the only thing that saved this movie. Brilliant acting as usual but the rest....unbelievable.Were the producers trying the cut on expenses or something like that and hired some amateurs to be on this movie ? terrible acting of some of the characters.Another thing that drives me crazy is that it seems American film makers still don't know how to make sex scenes. Most boring sex scenes I have seen.The story is indeed interesting, funny in some ways but it could have been done in a much better way.",4,1,3,7 June 2014
