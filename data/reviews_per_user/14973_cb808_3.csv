Alien 3," A brilliant film that is sadly overlooked
","First, I must say that I consider myself a 'hardcore Alien fan.' I have seen the four movies in the Alien series more than any other. Too often, Alien 3 is criticized very harshly simply because it didn't turn out to be 'Aliens 2.' This is not an action film, and isn't particularly Sci-fi either. There are no guns, no marines and no exploding ships. This is, however, a masterful drama. Ripley finally has a chance to come to terms with the emotions that have been building up ever since she first encountered the alien. She is isolated, alone and in despair--and that is what this movie centers on. Anyone that went to see this expecting a 'feel-good' action movie, went away with a churning stomach. The acting is superb, particularly by Weaver (Ripley), Charles Dutton (Dillon), and Ralph Brown (Aaron). David Fincher creates a beautifully sick setting with the Fiorina 161, and each set is a testament to the wonderful [utilitarian] imagination of the art directors. This movie WILL depress you, but understand this is not a bad thing. The final sacrifice, where Ripley dies to keep a queen alien away from the *true* enemy, the Weylad-Yutani company, is sheer heroism. It inspired the satisfaction in me that Ripley has died for a greater cause--one that she fought for all along: not to destroy one alien, but rather end the inhumanity that Weyland-Yutani has inflicted on hundreds of innocent people. Her death is truly sad, but this kind of raw emotion is what Alien 3 excels at and propels it much further than just sci-fi action. Don't see this movie if you want guns and explosions. Watch it only if you want a truly moving cinematic experience.",Null,2,3,17 October 1998
Alien: Resurrection," A worthy sequel--flawed but satisfying
","First things first: I *like* this movie. I love the Alien saga as a whole, and I was definitely not disappointed by Resurrection. In fact, I strongly defended it when it came out, against every criticism thrown at it. Now that I've seen it on video a few times, my enthusiasm has partially faded. Its major flaw is its script. The dialgoue often comes off as sound-bytes, as the actors seem to speak to the camera instead of each other. And, because this movie if so short, we have very little time to get to know the characters, although their personas are very cool--especially Elgyn (Michael Wincott) and Vriess (Dominique Pinon). There are a few plot-holes and inconsistencies, although Jeunet is famous for creating intended situational absurdity. The production design is FANTASTIC as well as Jeunet's directorial work. The action fast-paced and original, though short-lived. The dreaded Newborn does indeed look awful, but the idea behind it is respectable. Overall, I will probably enjoy watching this film over and over again, just like the other films in the Alien Saga.",Null,0,0,17 October 1998
Full Metal Jacket," A very unique film about Vietnam
","This movie may be remembered more for the hilarious insults of the drill instructor than any message about war it offers. Its attempts at sarcasm and humor up until the climax are appreciated, and that is what separates this from most other war movies. But the power of the climatic scene is lost because of this and any clear message about Vietnam remains vague. This may or may not be a good thing. Not to say that FMJ doesn't have its share of powerful drama. The outcome of the rivalry between Private Pyle and Drill Instructor Hartmann is a scene I will never forget.  I can certainly say this movie is entertaining and worth more than a few viewings.",Null,0,0,17 October 1998
