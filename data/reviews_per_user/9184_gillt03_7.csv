50 First Dates," good for what it is
",Being completely honest this isn't my type of film however I decided to give it a chance as I have previously seen many of Adam Sanders films. I was shocked really that I did watch a rom com but I am glad I did as I kind of enjoyed it taking into consideration the genre isn't my preferable. So if you do enjoy rom coms I do recommend this.,5,1,1,28 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," dissapointing
",As I have said before I'm not keen with Harry Potter films but I thought I should watch them all and in my honest opinion the first two were better as they had clear optical story lines as in this one it kind of gets a bit confusing as the director has attempted to mix the past present and future ineffectively.,4,1,1,2 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," not for me
",The acting and order of events led up to a very good conclusion and I can see why people enjoy the harry potter films but unfortunately this film didn't spark for me leading to me not wanting to watch it again.,5,1,2,2 December 2018
Wonder Woman," different in a good way
","This movie was different(much better) then I expected. Dawn of Justice was good, and watching right after that movie, I have a new found appreciation for DC universe movies(being a Marvel Universe fan). The bonds between characters were conveyed well, and the character development was done quite well for a single movie. However overall a very good watch in general.",8,1,1,28 November 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," amazing
",This is a thrilling and spine chilling crime drama with multiple times you think you can predict what is going to happen whereas it does the completely opposite thing. Highly recommend this movie whether you are into the crime or thriller genre.,8,0,1,27 November 2018
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," best one so far
","At first I thought that nothing could be done to improve from the first hunger games since it was a cleaver story and one of a kind, especially as the games took place. However I was pleasantly surprised after watching this since it was full of surprises and action from start to end.",7,2,2,2 December 2018
