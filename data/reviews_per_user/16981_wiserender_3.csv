Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is better than Iron Man 2
","On May 3ed Iron Man 3 rocketed into theaters fueled by the smash hit The Avengers, which came out one year earlier on May 4th 2012. From the beginning I had doubts about this third installment because it was not written or directed by Jon Favreau as with Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Iron Man 3 was directed and co-written by Shane Black, famed screenwriter of Lethal Weapon.Given that, this movie exceeded my expectations. The action and effects were spectacular. The plot was cohesive and they definitely added some new and interesting elements to the Iron Man franchise. Without spoiling anything I will say that Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts gets to be more involved in this third film, she is not relegated to the sidelines. And lets face it guys, we like to see a woman of action. Ever since Alien made it a mainstream archetype, we have been drawn to attractive, strong, independent woman that is not just a girl to be saved. I kept this in mind when I wrote the character of Gessica, the female lead in my movie Cam-Girl (AKA Web-Cam).Iron Man 3 also had a few surprises along the way, how the characters developed and what the villains weapon really turns out to be. These moments of the movie were refreshing, spontaneous and realistic for the given situations.The one minor complaint I had was that a few parts of the story were written in a contrived way to reach an end result. This was done to force Tony Stark into his low point and it was also present during the big finale of the film. It turns out a lot went into making that final scene. In a Entertainment Weekly interview Robert Downey Jr. laments that he injured an ankle performing a stunt which caused a six week shut down during production.This third Iron Man film provided great closure for the character and the storyline. As of now this is the last time Robert Downey Jr. is obligated to suit up as Iron Man. Part of me wishes this is the last Iron Man movie they make because it ended strongly. I'm sure they will make more Iron Man films because of there success. The question remains if it will be Downey Jr. as the character, it would be hard for me to imagine any other actor filling those iron shoes. I recommend Iron Man 3.",7,0,2,12 May 2013
Evil Dead," Delivers hyper realistic horror but no comedy.
","No Spoilers are in this review, just honest opinions. Like most people who first heard about this remake I immediately checked out the IMDb to see if Sam Raimi was the Director (He is not) and if Bruce Campbell was going to give new life to the hero 'Ash' we all know and love (No Again).The Director is Fede Alvarez, a first time feature filmmaker from Uruguay who's short film Panic Attack! went viral and caught the attention of Raimi and the other producers. The hero of this version was played by Shiloh Fernandez. This actor is best known from Little Red Riding Hood and Deadgirl, the latter being a very original twist on horror.In this climate of desperate cash grabs with all these remakes, reboots and spin offs I had every reason to hate this movie going into it but I was surprised. The reason for the group to go to the cabin was totally different from the original and the strongest element of the writing. If you are hoping to see an Evil Dead with the same tone as the original I'm sorry to say it is not there. The over the top gore, the creative camera work and comedic elements are absent on this trip to the cabin. What the remake does deliver on is amazingly strong cinematography and a hyper-realistic take on this story filled with practical gore effects.According to IMDb Diablo Cody did a pass on the screenplay but it seems like everything from her draft was dismembered from the shooting script. This movie could have used some smart lines and more defined characters. Instead within the first 20 seconds as all the characters meet at the cabin they announce each of their jobs. What someone does for a living is a great incite into character but this was forced into the scene in an unnatural way. Diablo Cody did not get screen credit in the film so there you go.Fans of the original will be happy to know that the score, the props, the camera blocking and editing will bring you back to the fond memories of Evil Dead 1 and 2. The tree attack scene was great and used reverse motion. Scenes like this and others take place at roughly the same running time as they did in the original film. For the modern horror film goers this new Evil Dead will be artfully shot and top of the line. I recommend this movie but not to people who want the fun independent over the top style of the original. Stay for the clip at the end of the credits, you'll be glad you did.",8,13,59,6 April 2013
The Purge," strong concept that delivers thrills.
","The Purge is one of those rare movies that did not resemble a big budget studio film in any way, yet it received a wide release in theaters. This movie shows what you can do with an original high concept and a modest budget. It helped that it stars Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. The Purge is about a family of four who are living in the near future during one day. This just happens to be the one day of the year when any form of crime is made legal and no police or emergency response is available. There are some rules; certain weapons are not allowed and of course government personnel of a high rank cannot be killed or attacked without consequence.The reason for this annual day of carnage is for the best interest of the nation because it has brought unemployment down to one percent and crime on any other day of the year to record setting lows. This is all a type of therapy, an outlet to vent deep seeded primal urges for those who choose to participate.So the family shelters themselves in their house with the help of an armored security system that covers all of the doors and windows. Around 20 minutes into the film a B-story kicks in then all hell breaks loose. A clan of young private school students have reason to break into the house. The leader of this group played by Rhys Wakefield is exceptional and is such a believable sociopath you cannot help but be entertained while he was on screen. Everything in this movie is made to feel hyper realistic which makes the situation even more terrifying.The Purge holds up against any other movie playing in the theaters and was produced for 3 Million and it grossed 76 Million to date. I hope the studios take note of this. It should come as no surprise that The Purge 2 is in development. There is countless places you can go with a strong premise like this. For example, what does the white house do during this day of anarchy? It would be interesting to see The Purge from the point of view from someone who hunts. Maybe they have a valid reason for choosing their prey and the audience could be routing for the hunters. This movie causes us to ask tough questions of ourselves and that is why it is so great in my opinion.I have to say that in the theater seated one row behind me were two fat women who talked throughout the whole movie. I wanted to stand up and yell at these self centered ignorant people to vent my anger. Instead I moved away from them. But as I did that I thought if the purge existed I might have followed those two out to their car, to find out where they live.",8,3,6,15 July 2013
