The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 continues to deliver..
","It's always a worry when producing movies from a book series, but the Hunger Games Mockingjay does a great job. In fact, after reading the books first, I have actually enjoyed the movies more. If you haven't read the books, don't expect another battle in the usual Games arena, as this is a different battle again, and what the fight is really all about. Love Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss in this role, but found she lacked a little of her character's strength as shown in the first two movies. I also feel we don't get a true sense of the annihilation that the Capitol or nasty President Snow deliver as portrayed in the book, nonetheless, I still feel the movie does what it needs to. The love triangle between Gale, Katniss and Peeta is covered and is an important aspect of the story. Overall, it's a solid movie although fractionally long, which leaves you looking forward to the final and hopefully thrilling final Part two.",7,9,26,23 November 2014
Fury," Time Passes Quickly
","I often judge a movie by how time passed while watching it and this movie at nearly 2.5hrs, passed very quickly. A very exciting edge of your seat war movie. While you may not always agree with decisions made by the main character Brad Pitt the movie is still slick while difficult to watch at times. Watching 'Normans' character also proves difficult as he struggles with his morals and the stark reality of war itself. The final scene may not be a totally realistic one, but does add to the high drama that this movie contains. This movie can be tough to watch, but is compelling none the less. Great entertainment -a definite go see!",8,2,5,17 November 2014
American Sniper," Sad But True!
","Love Clint Eastwood as a director as he doesn't do much wrong. This is an interesting movie depicting the true story of Chris Kyle. I didn't know the story and so didn't see the end coming. I think the movie is very well done as it does show the ugliness of the war in Iraq and the impact particularly on families and the soldiers themselves. You truly can't be trained to kill people then expect it to have no impact on you! I think Clint has directed a very realistic movie without going over the top with the action sequences. He just shows things as they probably were/are. Bradley Cooper does an outstanding job capturing Chris Kyle without adopting a action man status which would have made the movie too 'American corny'. Sienna Miller is also great as his wife. This movie isn't overcomplicated and tells a story of a man who does his job extremely efficiently but still suffers as a lot as people did and still do coming out of an intense fighting/killing situation. An expressive movie again by Clint, and definitely worth your time.",7,12,26,26 January 2015
Nightcrawler," Dark but Fascinating
","A really great movie - though quite dark. Jake's character Lou Bloom character is a the true definition of a psychopath in that he will stop at nothing and tread on anyone to achieve what he wants. You are never really given his background which would have been interesting. Lou is desperate for work, and stumbles on a job he feels he can be great at - it's a low job involving taking footage of tragic accidents/scenes just after they have happened. From there things spiral, although I don't think Lou sees this. This is a truly fascinating movie, and unusual. It certainly plays havoc with your morals as well. Jake does a wonderful job in the role. Highly recommended.",8,2,3,1 December 2014
Foxcatcher," A Little Short!
","I really wanted to like this movie, and didn't exact not like it, but it fell a little short for me. I think it came own to the length and the drawn out way the movie was delivered. Learning a little bit about the real du Pont, he seems a little unhinged suffering some psychological issues. This was really only shown on a small scale in this movie as you get that du Pont is a little odd and not quite normal, but not quite like the guy was in real life. I was looking forward to Steve Carell's performance, which is really good, but doesn't quite catch this. Channing Tatum as Mark Schulz is great, and Mark Ruffalo as David Schulz is even better. Really like the relationship between these two brothers. I knew nothing about this story and thought it was really interesting, despite some of the slowness. All in all, the movie is certainly watchable, but you could easily wait for it to go to DVD. It's gonna come down to personal opinion!",7,0,4,8 February 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Love Tarantino
","And that's it with this movie. It's Tarantino and you either love him or hate him. I thought it was an interesting character study. Almost a deconstructed Tarantino made up of snapshot type scenes which when all put together told a story. You need to always go into his movies with an open mind and a 'what am I gonna get this time'. Pitt and Di Caprio are always incredible to watch and draw you in. I thought Margot Robbie was lovely but didn't have to do too much but be the Hollywood star. In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed it and found the end and interesting 'alternative'. So if you are open to typical quirky Tarantino you should enjoy this.",9,23,37,25 August 2019
Aladdin," Very Enjoyable!
","I know everyone wants to compare this to the Animated version, but don't. Take it as it comes and you will thoroughly enjoy it. It does stay pretty faithful to the animated version I think. Will Smith as the genie could never be the Robyn Williams genie, but I don't think he tries to. He does fantastically well in his own right. Absolutely loved the Prince Ali song where Aladdin enters the city as the prince. Brilliantly colorful spectacle captured really well. Jafar missed a little for me as had lost the smarmy-ness of the animated version. The songs were great and the Aladdin and Jasmine characterization was pretty spot on. I think kids would love this and I would definitely recommend it.",8,577,1033,24 May 2019
Hotel Mumbai," Leaves you feeling hugely affected!
",Had just arrived back from NZ when Christchurch happened. We had booked this movie a couple of days before and were concerned going to see it. It was hugely impactful because of those events. It does leave you feeling somewhat traumatized as you are given a lot of the story from the view of the terrorists themselves. And the cold unfeeling methodical way they go about their vile work is what really grabs you. Beware going in as this movie could easily distress some.,9,27,83,2 April 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Not What Expected!
","I had no idea what to expect from this movie - I thought it may actually be a little arty farty but this was not the case. Such an interesting story of an actor who once upon a time played a super hero in the form of Birdman. Come forward many years and this same actor is trying to show he still has It, but as a true theatric actor by backing and acting in theatre on the stage. Most of the movie seems to have been filmed in one continuous sequence or scene, which can be difficult to pull off, but this works well within the context of the story. Michael Keaton is exceptional as the main character, who is spiraling towards losing it altogether. Loved Naomi Watts who has been wonderful in the last couple of movies she has been in. Edward Norton is also outstanding and his character is obnoxious and fascinating to watch. All in all, this movie fully deserves its best movie nom at the Oscars and time flies while watching the two and a bit hours it runs for. Go for it, it's different, but you wont be disappointed!",9,4,13,21 January 2015
The Water Diviner," My Favourite this Summer but a Real Tear Jerker!
","This movie is superb. I love watching Russell Crowe at the best of times, but this is one of his best. His directing was spot on, the script very clean and uncomplicated. Starting in Rainbow Australia, the first part of the movie with Russell's character and his wife is heart wrenching in itself and sets the scene for the same as the movie progresses. I liked the important message depicting the effects of war on all involved not just our own country. An interesting insight into a Turkey itself during that troubled time. I find Russell very watchable and was gripped by the story from beginning to end. I am not ashamed to say I shed a tear or two at a couple of points during the movie, and the scene with the three sons is gut-wrenching to watch to say the least. It never ceases to amaze me how this type of movie gets missed at Oscar time (or would it be included in next years round). Anyway, this is just fantastic, I definitely recommend it to see, but take some tissues!",9,8,20,18 January 2015
Life," Interesting Outcome!
","I'm a huge fan of Sci-Fi but my hubby isn't. I dragged him along and he really enjoyed this. It's the typical storyline of humans on a spaceship picking up an alien creature who in turn attacks. Nothing really different there. But somehow I liked the quietness and cleanness of this movie. A little slow to begin but picked up well. I think the ending really made the movie and it became more of something to think about. Visually it's really good, nothing outstanding about the acting, but I still enjoyed it!",7,4,9,9 April 2017
