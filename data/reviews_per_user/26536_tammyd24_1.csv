Requiem for a Dream," Wow
","This movie was recommended to me by my sister who described it as a rape of the senses. Being a survivor of Rx medication addiction, she thought I would find meaning in this movie. And she was absolutely correct. The thought of taking the same road as any of the characters makes me shiver. The acting is outstanding and definitely warranted an Oscar nomination for Ellen Burstyn.I was totally blown away at the accuracy of this movie and the realism it presented. For anyone thinking of walking down that path of addiction, in whatever form it may take, please see this movie and then decide if that is how you want to live your life.The soundtrack of this film is haunting and moving at the same time. Every note is so precise to match the mood of the scene you are viewing, that when you hear it outside of the movie, it brings you right back to the image. Definitely a soundtrack to own.I really think that this should be on the viewing for high school students as a tough life lesson without the physical. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",10,1,2,20 May 2006
