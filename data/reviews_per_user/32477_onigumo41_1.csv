The Expendables 2," a big homage to fans
","I'm not going to go into a big complicated review; but i'll just say this: This movie kick EVERYBODY'S ASS IN THE WORLD! it's not for super intelligent over-analytic thinkers. its made for people who love blood guts and action. from start to finish kick ass. everyone was good and there honestly isn't any part of this movie i didn't like. Van Damme made a great villain and everybody really brought it. also of note was Dolph Lungren, who was used better and had some good moments on the film. go see it if your into old school action, this is where movies need to be.I love how they camped it up a bit, the tongue in cheek and cheesiness made the film shine.a big homage to fans, you could tell they really did it us.",9,0,0,15 November 2013
