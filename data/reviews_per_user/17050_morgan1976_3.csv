The Blair Witch Project," I was never so scared in the theatre!
","I won't go on and rehash the plot. But I will say that this movie is NOT for everyone. To see this film, you need an open mind and a pretty good imagination. If you need to see blood, gore, and things popping out at people to be scared--please see something else. The Blair Witch Project is a movie that scares without showing...it's up to you to create the horrors, the unknown, the monster that you're scared of, and take the movie in as real. Suspend your disbelief, and you won't be let down. Knowing it isn't actually based on true events, for me, didn't make it any less scary. On DVD, I think the movie loses quite a bit of the effect it had on the viewer. But even on home video, it remains effectively creepy.",10,2,3,18 October 2002
Titanic," An accurate history lesson...yeah, right!
","Rent it if you have a dollar or two and 3 hours to give up.I've seen this movie roughly 4 times, and that's all the chances I'm giving it.  To me, this movie is pure eye-candy.  It's beautiful, simply amazing to look at, and if you're deaf--it might be a good film.  Everyone in the cast is a fantastic actor/actress.  But Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet turn in the WORST performances of their careers.  I watched them in embarassment. A bad car accident on film (actually a boat disaster).That's not to say the film lacks any emotion.  I felt for everyone on the ship except Jack and Rose.  What really makes my stomach turn is the entire cast and crew not minding that this is a fictional story set in historic facts.  It's rearranging history and I do hope future generations don't see it this way.  If you liked Disney's Pocahontas or any other film playing off historic events, then you might enjoy this.  I'm not saying this couldn't have happened, but I would have preferred that they would have said up front, on the cover or box or poster that this movie is 95% fiction: Yes there was a boat named Titanic, and it did in fact sink.I wonder if the survivors thought the movie was good or accurate (or if any of  them saw it at all).  Were their feelings hurt that such a horrific event was made into a blockbuster love-story film and capitalized on relentlessly?  I honestly cringe thinking about the future real-life disaster films--will 9/11 be turned into a love story?  Maybe...only when we're dead or too old to even see it.Hollywood, start writing original material.  No remakes, no copying, no historical 'what if' scenarios, and no predictable endings.  Be creative, be bold, be fresh.",2,3,5,18 October 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Excellent!
","When I first saw the trailer to this in the theaters, I was instantly interested in it, so I read the book before it's release.  Although movies seldom live up to the respective novels in which their based, this one equals it, but in different ways.  I have to hand it to Ted Tally for his script adaptation; his script keeps the core of the story while stripping away the more complex and unnecessary aspects of the novel and still makes it suspenseful and interesting.  The acting is magnificent, Foster plays Clarice with what looks like such ease, and yet keeps the character complex, smart, strong, and comfortably flawed, and aware of those flaws.  Hopkins is equally brilliant as Lecter: he is everything Clarice is but more charming and unaware he possesses any flaws at all.  One of the things I love about the film is it's simplicity.  The sets and clothes look normal, unimportant, everyday, cheap.  Nothing's flashy or overly ornate looking.  It still holds up very well after 13 years.  Won Oscars for Best Actor, Actress, Adapted Screenplay, Director, and Picture.  Highly recommended.",10,2,3,20 August 2004
