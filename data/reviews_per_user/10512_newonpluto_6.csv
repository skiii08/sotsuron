The Blair Witch Project," One of the scariest films ever made, dragged down by its hype.
","'The Blair Witch Project' plays like an experimental film and thereby transcends the horror/suspense genre by being so different.  Alas it was ruined by the extreme hype it received.  Not all reviews were very favorable in the first place, but the overhype was generated from the belief early on in the film's limited release that what we were watching was real footage shot by three people who were actually missing.It's too bad.  Think about all you have heard after its major release.  'It wasn't THAT scary' and 'I got motion-sickness' were the two most common remarks I heard, next to 'It was the stupidest movie I have ever seen.' Why?  The first remark is in response to the people who saw it early on and believed it to be the scariest film they had ever seen, causing higher expectations.  The second comes from people who sat too close, and the third from people who expected a LOT more than psychological trauma as the true subject of a horror film.  Did they want gut-spilling?  Explosions?  The supernatural depicted through cheesy special effects, as seen in a movie like 'The Haunting?' Please. 'The Blair Witch Project' was an exercise in realism, using psychological terror (not what you see, but what you don't see) as its weapon, and it IS one of the scariest films ever made.  I saw it in the theatre, still believing that what was onscreen was possibly real.  Throughout the film, I was afraid and emotionally horrified, and by the end I was curled up on my seat into a ball, shivering and teary-eyed.  That's how powerful it was.Ignore the hype.  Of course, by now it has died down, so folks may not even remember what a big deal the movie was at the time of its release.  I only wish the sequel was handled differently.  While it was spooky at certain points, its lack of realism (and real acting) had nowhere near the impact of the first.  Speaking of the acting...the performances of the three stars of this film truly added to us believing it was real, and therefore are worth the price of a rental alone.",Null,0,1,13 June 2002
Meet Joe Black," a wonderful reminder of the gifts of life.
","I watched this film at home, on TV, after i heard from all my friends of how it was too long and boring.  i disagree with them all.  Meet Joe Black is a celebration of the wonderful gifts life has to offer.  sounds corny?  not so at all.Anthony Hopkins is great as William Parrish, a very successful businessman, who is nearing the end of his life. he is visited by Death, in the form of a very charming Brad Pitt, who tells him he has a few days to 'show him around' the real world. soon Bill realizes all the things in his life that he took for granted.  especially the love of his daughters, Susan and Allison.On the other hand, Susan (Claire Forlani in a worthy breakthrough) falls for Death, known to them all as Joe Black. as Joe experiences love for the first time with Susan, this upsets Bill and the three main characters all journey through epiphanies of love and life that will change them forever.The film may drag on at times but it is beautifully shot, and filled with some unforgettably touching scenes of dialogue between all the characters. and with one of the most haunting love themes in recent films Thomas Newman confirms himself as one of the best film score composers of the 90s.  i suggest this film for anyone who wants to set aside 3 hours to explore the importance of life, love, and family.",Null,1,1,6 January 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," 'not a day goes by that my heart doesn't find them...'
","the conclusion of this film ends with the line above, and once it is said a lifetime of memories can flash before you upon hearing it. this film is one of those rare movie-going experiences that makes a member of the audience leave with the characters and their actions still in mind. the film is, in a word, unforgettable and reminds its audience of the people that have touched their lives.  it doesn't do so perfectly, but well enough.there have been mixed feelings about this film, and many have complained about the cliche's. i've even heard someone say that at some points the film seems like it plays as a parody of itself. some things were unclear, and the script could have used work. and yes, i don't what the deal was with those chickens. but the direction (awesome montage scene) and the acting just make it work, it's that simple.winona ryder is just amazing as susanna. you could see it in her face. she's in so much pain, but all the while she's just a spoiled little girl with not enough in life. it was an understated performance. angelina jolie has won the oscar, which conflicts me because it's a clear case of scene stealing. her competition (catherine keener, chloe sevigny) were amazing, probably better, but not as flashy. still, she captures every side of lisa, from villainous and strong to every bit as vulnerable as susanna, and makes her a sexy character still worthy of our sympathy. her emotional scenes are breathtaking. and what about clea duvall? her character had a lot more to do with the plot in the book, which i can't wait to read. she does excellent with what she's got, but an actress of her caliber should have been given a lot more. moss, murphy, and whoopi are also excellent.these performances are the main reason this film works. because of them the situations are handled so realistically, enough for the audience's response to be the same as it would if these were real mental patients. look at the anorexic girl. watching her would make you want to almost bite your cheek for wanting to laugh when she acts funny, because you know she's in an extremely sad situation.this film has several scenes that burn in the memory, and it is because of the girls. two scenes that were incredible: when lisa first attacks susanna, and when lisa is locked up and her silent friend is breaking down outside. unbelievably affecting scenes. the emotional score also gets a few extra points. emotional, not mushy. this movie may sometimes stray from being great, but its raw power and humanity make it definitely worth a look.",Null,4,5,4 June 2000
Am√©lie," pleasant, hilarious, and ALMOST perfect, but not quite.
","Everyone who has seen 'Amelie' has told me that they have left the theatre with a big smile.  So tonight, I took a friend who is going through a breakup, to watch it, maybe to cheer him up. I'll begin by saying that the film is hilarious.  HILARIOUS.  I laughed a lot during this film, at both the slapstick comedy and the more quirky comedy, and there was a lot of that.  Some people may not like it, but it worked like a charm for me.Moving right along, I think it's quite a thing that most comments explain how this is a 'non-existent Paris.' Who cares? It was a joy to see Paris looking the way it did in this film.  If it looked any different, the dynamic of the film would have been completely warped.  The use of colors is incredible, and yes, the cinematography was really something.  I think it surpasses 'Vanilla Sky' for the most innovative cinematography of the year.Jean-Pierre Jeunet made 'Alien: Resurrection,' and I really can't imagine how that is possible.  Even that film had something intriguing about it, but his work in this film is so superior, on every level.  His direction is just so correctly done; every punchline, every weird image, the delivery of it all was like...he really went in for the kill, you know? It was done just right.My ONE PROBLEM: the last 5-10 minutes.  I didn't really walk out of their feeling light and airy as I was hoping to.  Actually, the end was a bit disappointing. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** Why did they even bother introducing that waitress as someone who had an interest in Nino? It just made us wonder, it had no function in the telling of the story.  I would have walked out of the theatre MUCH happier if the film had just ended in the coffee shop, with a shot of Amelie and Nino smiling at each other, or holding each other, or something sweet like that.  The possibility of losing him was annoying and unnecessary.  The high that the rest of the film gave me was too good to be brought down like that.  I guess, now that I think about it, that ending really upset me.  The rest of the movie is SO wonderful, and they went and did that nonsense. (Funny I call it nonsense, considering it was the only truly realistic part of the film.  But watching a film with so much fantasy, I begin to believe it. Reality is NOT something I want to be bothered with.)Still, the film is such a pleasure.  Watch it.  I'd even see it again, but I would consider walking out right before the last 5 minutes. Enjoy.",Null,0,1,11 January 2002
The Thin Red Line," every man fights his own war...
","what many people do not know is that this film, directed by terence malick, is without question the reason that Shakespeare in Love won the best picture oscar over the much favored Saving Private Ryan.  why am i saying this? first let's deal with the movie.  long? yes.  too much?  sometimes.  but is it good?  i can not begin to describe the beauty of this film.about the oscars, i only watched the film after its surprise nomination for best picture.  i had seen the competition already, and it was time to check out the fifth nominee.  i went to the theatre myself, and came out three hours later, went home, and i cried.  not only because i was disturbed, but i loved every single character in the film.  i wanted to be there for them, cry with them, fight their battle.  many people who have watched the film have said the same thing to me.the Thin Red Line is sometimes painful to watch, but only because of its realistic juxtaposition of humanity, philosophy, and the terror of war. the film does not delve into any historical fact about Guadalcanal, except that the battle itself was terrifying (as is any battle).  the characters introduce themselves through voice-over narration, which accompanies much of the action.  and speaking of action, there is not much in the film.  more images. images of war and the lives these soldiers left behind.  this was Terence Malick's intent, of course, and many people were insulted and thought it was his own pretentious self getting the best of him.  'boy he's a genius.. must he show it??'  sometimes it is a little pretentious, but the film would've been 'just another WWII film' if it was out of Malick's hands.i can not understand why Sean Penn is billed as the top actor or the main character of this film.  he was there a lot, but the film is carried by Jim Caviezel as the beautiful and ethereal private Witt.  words can not describe this performance.  with as few lines as he had, Caviezel portrays the symbolic soul of Witt, and by the end of the film he will break your heart. also excellent performances from Nick Nolte and the understated Elias Koteas, who can stretch creepy (Crash) to sympathetic in the blink of an eye.now.. let's consider hollywood.  sure they love Spielberg, and sure Private Ryan was a masterpiece (and it really was), but nobody even expected the Thin Red Line to get seven oscar nods, especially for best picture.  but Shakespeare in Love was the crowd pleaser, and the other two were epic war films.  most hollywood 'artsy' people are anti-war.. kind of like the Thin Red Line.  Private Ryan seemed to be MUCH more patriotic 'pro-america' than the other.  so if we've got anti-war on one side, and patriotism on the other... open and shut.  the votes were split between the two, and Shakespeare emerged victorious.  too bad.anyway... the Thin Red Line was definitely better than Shakespeare, and definitely a completely different film from Spielberg's.  John Toll's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score work together to convey the tone of Malick's lyrical and poetic direction, and both should have won oscars. this film is nothing short of breath-taking, though understandably not for the average american moviegoer.",Null,325,408,17 May 2000
Gladiator," can i get a wide-angle shot please
","this movie was definitely entertaining.  it was engaging, it had my full attention, and it was a visual feast...well, sometimes.  but what is going on here?  why does everyone love it exactly?  i saw the film at one of the most beautiful theatres, the Cinerama Dome on Sunset Blvd., which added to it a lot. but if i sat up front, i would have ran out of their screaming. people complain about the Blair Witch project?  i didn't know what was going on half the time.  this was me at about 5 points during the film: 'what? he got hit? yeah he did.. but.. he who? WHERE?!'the recreation of Rome is fantastic, and those shots are excellent, as are the effects and art direction.  the fights are fun in all their gore, with the exception of the chaotic camera movements. and certain shots, for example of the fields when Maximus's hands are brushing against the tall grass.  beautiful. but not enough to get the praise it's been receiving.and character development?  hello? 'Lucilla, you should have been a son.' oh really? 'Lucilla is a strong woman this, and a forceful soul that.' how so? i couldn't tell.  and bratty Commodus, played by an excellent Joaquin Phoenix, just was not fully explained in his insanity. Russell Crowe is great (as always) as the vengeful Maximus, but even with his character something seemed lacking. and way to go with the subtle ending. (no, that was not sarcasm).overall the movie entertained me, but i walked out confused (as to whether i liked it or not). and when i walk out of movies confused i wait for the next day.. and the next day i was not satisfied. some great shots and color, cool costumes, Crowe finally confirming himself as a star, Phoenix confirming himself as an actor, and Nielsen confirming herself as a hottie who can act. it'll do. but it would have been better off had it been done by someone other than ridley scott. (gosh.. he better not butcher Hannibal). it deserves no spot on the IMDb's top 250 much less the top 100.",Null,0,0,19 May 2000
