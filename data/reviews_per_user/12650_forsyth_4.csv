50 First Dates," silly but sweet
","I'm not your typical Adam Sandler fan--in fact, I've only seen two of his films, this one and The Wedding Singer--and they were both SWEET. Call me a sucker for romance, but I teared up at the end of both these films. Sandler imbues his character with real human emotion, and as always he and Drew Barrymore have undeniable chemistry. They both have wonderful comic timing and watching them together is pure pleasure. I also enjoy seeing a lead actress who isn't stick-thin--long live Drew Barrymore and her voluptuous beauty! If you can ignore the obligatory toilet humor, this is a bit of highly enjoyable, pure romantic fluff. Rent The Wedding Singer and have a double-feature!",Null,0,0,21 June 2004
Dead Poets Society," It IS the greatest movie in the whole wide world!
","I have seen a LOT of movies in my life and nothing, nowhere, ever ever ever has compared to the effect that Dead Poets Society had on me. At the end, when the theatre lights came up, I looked at my companion and she looked at me and we were both literally speechless with emotion. That's never happened before or since. Everything just fell into place perfectly in this film and I'll go down with my last breath defending it! So there!",Null,0,1,14 February 2004
Pitch Black," it's a HUMAN story
","(May contain spoilers) OK, it's a sci-fi/monster movie, and a pretty good one--but beyond that, it's a HUMAN story. The characters, specifically Fry and Riddick, are what this is all about! It's a story of growth and redemption, of courage and faith, and it DEMANDS a sequel. We must know what Riddick's going to do now that he's rejoined the human race.And if nothing else--Vin Diesel!!! Come on, girls, ANY excuse to look at him! Right?",Null,0,1,6 May 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The funniest movie I've ever seen!
","This is literally the funniest movie I've ever seen. All the actors were superb in their roles, especially George Clooney, whom I never imagined could play such goofy comedy. From the moment he opened his mouth (the boxcar scene) I fell over laughing and didn't stop until the closing credits. Besides humour there was sweetness, pathos and drama, plus the best music in a movie in years. I cannot recommend this highly enough! A WINNER!",10,0,0,24 August 2001
