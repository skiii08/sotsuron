The Devil's Advocate," Dark but well resolved
","Keanu Reeves plays a lawyer offered a hot job in the city after winning a case in his home, Florida. On moving there his life quickly descends into anarchy. It soon emerges that Al Pacino the main partner in the law firm is the devil and whats more, Keanu Reeves is his son.This film is all about Al Pacino. Those dark eyes, the husky voice, the slow tone. He was made for this part. By the end of this film I was convinced that the Lord must have created Pacino in the image of the Dark Prince. Devil's Advocate could so easily have been more than just this however if it were not for the unnecessary complication of Al Pacino being Keanu Reeves's father. Without this the atmosphere is dark, hot and basically hellish. The shots of the ghoulish faces are truly jumpy and you are constantly on the edge of your seat waiting for the next one to pop out of somebody's head. Connie Nielson is excellent as the devil's daughter and is another truly disturbing character.Overall the story does seem to work even if it is a little far-fetched. Remember it is only a vehicle to showcase the spectacular atmosphere and sets on this film - Pacino's rooftop office balcony looks awesome. In this it succeeds.  Its a little disappointing that the film ends the way it does rather than the really dark way it could and probably should have ended but apart from this it was a job well done by Pacino.",Null,0,1,23 August 2002
