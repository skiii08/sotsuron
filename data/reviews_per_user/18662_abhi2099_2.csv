Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirate life it is,Savvy ?
","All the fans out there just keep your expectations in check,this is sort of like a building up part for the next trilogy i guess.Its more like a pleasant distraction than anything else,a separate entity from the rest of the series,as if the last 2 parts dint happen.And I cant disagree more with some of the reviews here,that the pace slackens as the movie progresses.In fact the pace tightens as the movie moves ahead.Just don't expect *slight spoiler* a big fight in the end from jack*end spoiler* and you shud be all good.And as the critics have been saying that Jack has also lost a little interest,he definitely has not,its just that he doesn't have that good a lines as he had b4 but mind u from the little things here and there,he delivers the most memorable scenes of the movie..POTC fans will not be disappointed. Saw it in 3D,wasnt tat poor as the critics have been claiming,i guess i dint notice the difference n neways u wont b missing anything if u watch in 2D.Rest of the cast is decent with Rush bein a notch above the likes of cruz n ian mcshane.",8,3,8,17 May 2011
Terminator Salvation," Terminator Salvation: A honest opinion
","Saw the movie today.i went to it with low expectations but even then was disappointed with the movie...except for the last half hr...it was a pretty bad movie..i don't know what Christian bale was doing in the movie...he just carries on from batman.......but Sam Worthingtom is really good in the movie. u can watch it only for him,and last half hr of the movie or else don't even bother..effects were OK but i thought star trek was better in terms of graphics when compared to this.. i think the story is OK but its the screenplay thats really bad in the movie and also Christian bale ( i know many of u are going to hate me for this but its true). On the whole i am pretty disappointed with the movie..its just another B grade action movie tats it..",6,3,6,21 May 2009
