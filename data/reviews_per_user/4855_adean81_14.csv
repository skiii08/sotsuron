Blade Runner 2049," Review for Blade Runner: 2049
","Blade Runner: 2049Even though I haven't seen the first Blade Runner, I was able to enjoy this film and learn the world as it went on. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie, which takes place 30 years after the first film. The main character 'K' played by Ryan Gosling, uncovers a mystery that could change the game for androids (aka replicants) in this universe. Speaking of Ryan Gosling, he does a great job acting in this movie despite playing a serious character.At around 2 hours and 45 minutes, this movie sounds long but is actually well paced. The first 2/3rds of the movie move along well, while also having several scenes that hold on a shot. It's the mystery plot that really moves the story along and unfolds in an interesting way. The last third of the movie feels a bit rushed to wrap up the story and I found the ending to be a bit anti-climatic.A big reason why I enjoyed this movie, not only do I like a good mystery, is the cinematography. The visuals, the sets, the landscapes, this movie looks gorgeous! All of the sets look real and gives a great sense of what life is like in this future world. The sound is also well done, with a few moments that I found out of place. The soft notes in the background worked really well and contrasted the moments of booming synthesizers. The music really compliments the noir setting of this world.Without spoiling too much of the movie, there is one story line that I thought was intriguing and emotional. There is a love story between a replicant and a hologram. I find it fascinating that two forms of artificial intelligence seek companionship with other, one without a physical form. It raises this question: of do these replicants to have feeling and emotions? Can they be programmed to simulate feelings? While these questions, and several others, are not answered, it is still thought-provoking.There are a lot of things this movie nails, and a few that don't hit, such as the ending, and the unanswered questions. Overall this is a movie that looks great on the big screen with an engaging plot that will have you questioning what is actually going on. It is a dense story with a lot of callbacks to the first movie. Eventually I might watch the original Blade Runner, but for now, I'd rather watch 2049 a second time.",7,2,4,11 October 2017
The Finest Hours," Review for The Finest Hours
","The movie The Finest Hours is based on the true event of the wreck of an oil tanker ship in the North East Atlantic ocean. The crew of the S.S. Pendleton lose communication and have no way of notifying anyone that they are sinking. Due to the heavy storm, most of the Coast Guard has been dispatched on other rescue missions and no one is looking for the Pendleton. It's by chance that the Coast Guard is made aware of the ship and only a four men set out on a small boat, in extreme weather and current conditions, to rescue the survivors.While there is a love story set up in the beginning, the best parts of the movie take place out at sea. There is some character development in Chris Pine's character, Boatswain Mate 1st Class Bernie Webber. Throughout the whole, movie they set up Webber to be a shy guy that always follows the rules and doesn't question his orders. There is little bits of information here and there about his past. In the end, Webber acts against his character in order to save over 20 lives and become a real hero. There is some solid acting in this movie from all of the performers. The accents from Pine and Eric Bana were not great but not distracting either. Ben Foster was practically unrecognizable, and Casey Affleck, who plays the Chief Engineer of the Pendleton, shows a lot of the strength and confliction within his character. Actress Holliday Grainger plays Pine's love interest and does a great job playing a strong 50's lady, who is not the typical housewife type of that time. Other supporting actors also bring strong performances and you often forget the period the movie takes place in.The visual effects in this movie are great. The shots of the boats out in the water going up against giant waves looked amazing. There were a few moments in the small boat that seemed unrealistic, but for the most part, everything on the water was done well. The grand scale of the oil tanker was a magnificent reveal. There is very good cinematography in this movie, even the snow storm on land had a great feel to it.There is not a lot of bad in this movie. The opening scenes could have been done a little bit quicker while still establishing the characters properly. There are a few edit choices where it cuts back from the action in the water to land, that feels a bit off. Perhaps that was on purpose to undercut the suspension, but it's not that bothersome. For the most part, the movie sets everything up well and explains to the audience what is really at stake between the two ships and the characters on them. It is amazing to think that this event ever took place, and it is nice to get a good solid Coast Guard based movie. It is like the last half of the Titanic meets The Perfect Storm, some might say it's probably not as good as those movies, but it is one of the better ship disaster movies and it being based on a true story gives it more credibility. Overall The Finest Hours is a very good movie, mostly family friendly. It has great action, suspense, and a decent love story. If you are looking for a well paced, entertaining film to enjoy, then this is a good recommendation.",8,2,6,25 February 2016
It," IT review
","Even you are not a fan of Stephen King or horror, you should still watch the movie IT. As a suspense/horror film, the movie does a good job building the intrigue and mystery of the town of Derry as well as Pennywise the Clown. Pennywise looks very creepy and is an interesting and engaging villain. It uses impressive special effects for the demon clown and shows what IT is capable of becoming in order to scare the kids. Using their fears to attack them. There are some good jump scares but the movie does not overly rely on those.One thing that the movie does overly rely on is the music cues to build up the suspense. The overuse of it made the scare beats become a bit predictable in the film. There were also weird times when random songs would pop up and then be cut off abruptly. There were some cool camera tricks like rotating and zooming that I thought were impressive. Overall the film looks great and has an aesthetic similar to The Goonies or Stranger Things. What this movie succeeds at is telling the story of the children. This very much feels like a young adult coming of age story. The child actors all do a great job, and the characters are really engaging which allows the audience to become sympathetic to them. The story is focused on the kids and their fears. Each kid has a fear or obstacle in their life that they need to overcome in order to help defeat Pennywise. They are all very distinct characters but still feel like a group of friends. The movie was at its best when exploring the lives of the children.The movie touches on some of the mythology about Pennywise and the town of Derry, but it's important to remember that this is the first part of the story. There is going to be a sequel movie that can delve deeper into some of the material from the book. While there are some minor problems with the movie, it is still a very well made and engaging film that I recommend people checking out. Even though it's cast is a group of kids, I would not recommend anyone under the age of 13 due to some very adult themes and imagery. This movie succeeds at being a suspense drama with elements of horror that keeps the audience entertained throughout.",8,3,5,14 September 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Review for Thor: Ragnarok
","One word for this movie. Awesome! Going into seeing the movie, I was super excited. When the movie was over I still had a huge smile on my face, both times I've seen it. Right from the beginning, the movie starts off with a bang. From the great comedic lines to the Led Zepplin music blasting as Thor wields his mighty hammer in battle. Which provided a great use of the hammer, considering it is destroyed early on.It might sound weird to say that the best part of a Thor movie is the comedy, but it's true. Ragnarok is hilarious and at times simply delightful. You can't help but smile and laugh when watching this film. Chirs Hemsworth as Thor is great with the comedic elements. Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster also adds a lot of fun to the movie. My surprise favorite character is the rock creature Korg. He's a great side character that provides brief moments of laughter. He's played by the film's director, Taika Watiti. From the trailers, we all knew that the Incredible Hulk was in the movie. The fight in the arena between Hulk and Thor was spectacular. Hulk is hilarious and does a great job smashing things. His alter ego Bruce Banner has some great moments in the movie, part of which is him struggling with his identity as Hulk. It's also great to see Loki back. He's still at his same old tricks, but a great moment is when he first sees the Hulk and immediately says that he needs to leave. Which is a great call back to their encounter in the first Avenger's movie. Two great additions to the Thor and Marvel movies are the two female leads. Hela played by Cate Blanchet and Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson. The villain of the movie, Hela, was a powerful and commanding threat against Thor. Valkyrie interacted so well with Hulk and Thor, and got her own character arc, fighting like a true warrior in the end.Benedict Cumberbatch's reprises his role as Doctor Strange in a short scene. Which is a continuation of the end credit scene he had with Thor at the end of the movie Doctor Strange. A couple of surprise cameos on Thor's home world of Asgard involve the people performing a play reenacting Loi's death scene from Thor: The Dark World. Unlike Captain America: Civil War, which felt more like an Avenger's movie, Thor: Ragnarok is very much a Thor film. The whole story revolves around Thor, characters from the Thor movies, and the realm of Asgard. This is the best Thor movie, and one of the most fun and delightful of any Marvel movies to date. The action is great, the comedy is hilarious and pacing keeps moving. There's not a boring part in the movie, and only increases my anticipation and excitement for the next Avenger's movie.",8,12,21,8 November 2017
Suicide Squad," Review for Suicide Squad
","Supervillains? The characters in the movie Suicide Squad don't really feel like true villains but rather plain criminals. That could be due to the plot of the movie that uses these villains to save the day like heroes. As a consequence they can't be too villainy otherwise the audience would not relate to them. In the movie, they just refer to themselves as 'the bad guys' so I guess even they don't really see themselves as villains. The actual villain of the story is disappointing and weak.Before the movie was released there was a lot of hype about the characters Harley Quinn and the Joker. For the most part Harley was oversexualized, but she did have some great moments, especially Will Smith's, Deadshot. The Joker and Harley I really didn't care about. Apparently, there were a lot of cut scenes of the Joker. Jared Leto gave us a different version of the Joker, which could be cool, but he was basically only used as Harley's boyfriend in this movie. Harley herself walks the line between really crazy and really caring.No member of the Suicide Squad received as much attention and insight as Harley did, but Deadshot and Diablo have a good amount that shows the audience a different side to these 'bad guys'. Will Smith does a really good job playing Deadshot. He has good character motivation, as well as some good comedic moments. Which are there to lighten up a pretty depressing movie otherwise. The reveal of Diablo's true power at the end of the movie was very impressive and he turns out to be a more complicated character than I thought.The rest of the Suicide Squad are not properly developed. Crazy Captain Boomerang, is nothing more than a petty thief with a boomerang and some knives as his weapons. Katana has an awesome sword, and we're told second hand about what her sword is and the death of her husband, but that is all we get. The character Slipknot is only brought into the gang to demonstrate that the kill-switch devices in everyone's neck will indeed kill them. That's it! Killer Croc looks really cool, but also doesn't really do anything and we get zero back story on him. The lack of character development is a problem when dealing with an ensemble cast.The worst part of the movie is the villain who is *spoilers* Enchantress. At first, the spooky, girl for the Ring looking, version of Enchantress was really cool. Once she regains her heart and becomes this Mayan goddess version, the character becomes less creepy and intimidating. For some reason, Enchantress is constantly wiggling around as she is talking. It looks really silly and there is no reason for her to be dancing around as she talks. She needs to stand still and have a better-executed plan. Wanting to destroy the world to create a new one just because you can, is not a good enough reason for being the movie's antagonist.Overall there were a lot of very cool moments in the movie. For instance, the Batman and Flash cameos. And even Viola Davis did a great job in the movie. The problem is that the movie is a series of scenes with no real build up and little character development. It could be in part because of the large cast but the villain is still a problem. There is some fun to be had, but ultimately it failed in being a cohesive story.",4,2,4,16 November 2016
Doctor Strange," Review of Doctor Strange
","When I first heard about Benedict Cumberbatch being cast as Doctor Strange I had my reservations. The guy from the Sherlock show is going to be a mystical superhero? My doubts lessened my anticipation for the movie. However, all of that negativity went out the window when he first appeared on the screen. Cumberbatch did a great job in the titular role, especially with the comedic moments. In fact, this movie had a great cast all around.The movie picks up running with the plot and goes right into an awesome action scene. This forces the audience to accept the alternate realities and magic that are displayed in this movie. The visual effects are simply spectacular. From the mystic energy, that is produced from the hands to the bending of the buildings. There are some trippy scenes like looking through a kaleidoscope. Despite all of that the movie is still fairly grounded. Visually this movie looks stunning. Another amazing aspect of this movie was the fighting choreography. The martial arts used were outstanding and looked authentic. Tilda Swinton's character The Ancient One and Chiwitel Ejofor's character Mordo had some great fight sequences against the movie's villain. Played by Madds Mikelson, Kaecilius is one of the better villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He had a good motive and felt he was justified in his reasoning. The final conflict was a little bit out of this world, but for the most part, it works. While the tone of the movie was more dark and serious than most of the Marvel movies, there were still great elements of comedy that provided some levity to the film. There are a few jokes that don't land and feel a bit forced but for the most part, the comedy is great. One thing that I did appreciate about this movie, is that unlike other Marvel movies, there was no forced romance. The love interest angle is there, but never really focused on and does not draw attention away from the rest of the plot.Doctor Strange provides a great origin story for an unusual superhero. One of the movie's strengths is the character evolution of Dr. Stephen Strange. There is some parallel to Tony Stark in the first Iron Man movie. However, the difference is that Strange is more reluctant to fight until the end of the movie when he realizes a crucial part about possessing power. This movie offers a look at a different and unique superhero with a supernatural power-set. Strange doesn't just rely on his powers but his mind to defeat his enemies. It may be the weirdest of the Marvel movies but there is a really great story behind the wonderful special effects.",Null,3,8,9 November 2016
Justice League," Review for Justice League
","Review of Justice LeagueKnowing some of the controversies that went on while making this movie and having heard some negative reactions, I went into this movie with lower expectations. Perhaps maybe that's the reason I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. There are some good action and funny moments that make this movie for the most part, enjoyable.Having loved the Wonder Woman movie I was very excited to see her in action here. Wonder Woman is awesome! There's a great scene in the beginning that shows her powers and reminds you that she is a powerful fighter. Aquaman, while fun, was a bit underutilized. He seems powerful, but this movie doesn't explain what his powers are. With the exception of a joke about him talking to fish. A character that I was surprised by how much I ended up liking him was Victor Stone, aka Cyborg. He gets some really good moments with Wonder Woman and has to deal with his internal struggles about being more machine than human. Very good, but like Aquaman, I needed more backstory about his character. One character not in the trailers was Superman. Wow, he's powerful. I don't want to give too much away, but this movie really utilizes Superman's power set and it's awesome. Now being a big fan of The Flash television show, I was going to be biased no matter what about this new Flash character. He's a bit uneven to me. He's good in some scenes, too comedic in others, and ultimately has the least to do, in terms of power, among the group. Batman has some great actions scenes and gets to be the strategist of the group, and I just like it when he gets to use his cool gadgets. While this movie does have a quick pace, that is ultimately a detriment to the overall story quality. The plot and villain don't make much sense, and some of the character developments have either been rushed or dropped entirely. Adding a few extra scenes could have fleshed out and fixed some of these problems. Another flaw is the CGI (computer generated graphics) in the movie. The villain should have been done using practical effects makeup. The actor that plays Superman had to have his mustache digitally removed in most of his scenes which is why his mouth looks a little weird.The strong point of this movie is the team. It's fun to see this group of characters interact with each other and have to work together. This is not Marvel's Avengers, but it's not a bad movie. There's a lot of fun to be had, and some really cool action scenes. If you don't focus too much on the plot then you should have a good time watching this movie. Only makes me more excited to see Wonder Woman 2, if they make it.",6,0,3,22 November 2017
Dunkirk," Dunkirk
","Dunkirk ReviewWhile this is a really good movie, Dunkirk is not your typical war film. It's not about heroes and winning battles but rather a movie about survival. The end message is that surviving a war is simple enough, you don't have to have won. The movie is about the British evacuation of Dunkirk, and the German's bombing them before they can do so. Like other films that director Christopher Nolan has done (ex. Memento), the movie is not told in a linear or chronological order. There are three stories going, that don't intersect until the end of the movie.There are the characters on the beach that are trying to leave on ships that keep getting bombed. Then there are the civilians from London that sail to Dunkirk to try and help rescue men. The third story is the shortest and that's the Airman shooting down the German planes, to prevent them from bombing more ships. It's not a complicated story line but it helps to know that each story is not taking place at the same time until the end.The movie is not driven by dialogue, in fact, there is little dialogue. Instead, the sound and spectacular visuals are what drive the story. The sound of the guns and bombing contrasted with silence are there to give a sense of experience to the situation the characters are facing. Because the movie is not about winning a war, it has no real political agenda or alliance. In fact, we never even see any German soldiers up close. The details of the war are not what Nolan focuses on which is what makes it a very different war film. As far as the story goes it's very compelling and sad to see the characters trying to do their best to merely survive and get back home to London. Overall this is a good movie, but you should go into it knowing what to expect. It's a movie that slowly builds tension and has little dialogue between the characters. It's a drama, not an action movie that is meant to engage the audience in the experience of the events that take place.",7,1,4,4 August 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast Review
","It's a tale as old as time and a song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast. The original Disney animated movie was the first animated movie to ever be nominated for the Best Picture category at the Academy Awards, back in 1991. So it's no wonder that there was a lot of pressure to get the live-action version just right. It's easy to compare it to the animated movie, but the live-action version brings a lot of new elements to the story. It provides backstory for several characters as well as better romantic development between Belle and the Beast. That's all accompanied by some great and often delightful acting performances as well as the musical songs.While the movie is basically a remake of the animated version it also changes a few things and adds in scenes in order to tell the story better. One new element the movies adds comes from the original fairy tale story, and that's Belle asking for a rose every year from her father Maurice. The movie also adds in new scenes between Belle and the beast that creates a better romantic connection between the two. Emma Watson does a great job playing Belle, she brings a lot the character beyond being warm and kind. Dan Stevens also does a good job at making the beast sympathetic as well as caring. As for the songs. While Emma Watson does not sound like Paige O'Hara (the voice of Belle in the cartoon) she does a wonderful job singing the songs. Surprisingly Dan Stevens has a great singing voice and gets an original song that is actually really good. Even though Ewan McGregor's French accent was not great, his version of Be Our Guest was fantastic and different from the original. Emma Thompson does a wonderful job as Mrs. Potts. While not copying Angela Lansbury, she still brings warmth and care to the character. Not everything in the movie was perfect. Luke Evans is a great actor but his version of Gaston is not as fun as he was in the cartoon. This is evident in the song 'Gaston'. Josh Gad does a great job as LaFou, who is not quite the fool he was in the animated movie, but Gad has a great singing voice. The other thing that was quite as well done is the ballroom scene with the title song. The visuals didn't feel as grand and magical despite the setting. Some of the directing were off in a few scenes, where the focus wasn't clear and the angles weren't perfect. Some of the designs for the object characters were odd looking, but after a while, you get used to it. However, if we stop comparing this to the animated version, this movie is a great adaptation that has a lot to add to the story. The opening musical 'Belle' draws the audience right into the character and the town. It sets up the story perfectly and does a great job establishing why Belle doesn't fit in with the town. The ending had some small changes that were surprising and interesting. Overall this movie was beautiful, sweet and magical, everything you want in a Disney fairy tale movie.",Null,1,5,30 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Review
","Welcome to the guardians of the frickin' galaxy, and enter dancing baby Groot. The opening scene during the credits was super fun, and baby Groot is just so adorable. While not every character gets a great character arc there are several great moments for each character. Drax played by Dave Bautista provides most of the comic relief, when Groot and Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) are not on screen. Some of the humor takes things a bit too far, but for the most part, the comedy has been up'd in this sequel. All of the Marvel movies have great visual effects and this one is no different. The opening scene with a young Kurt Russell looks very believable. The movie knows how to use color to great effect. The setting for the gold people, known as the Sovergn, looks spectacular, with the bright gold and bold blue and white backdrop. Considering the movie has lots of characters of all different colors, each of them seemed to stand out beautifully.Now, even though I like Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's characters, Peter Quill and Gamora, the standout characters by far were Michael Rooker's, Yondu and Karen Gillan's, Nebula. Two characters I thought were 'okay' in the first movie, get more backstory and character motivation in this movie. It humanizes them to make them sympathetic characters that can be redeemed. One thing that wasn't as good as the first movie is the use of music. The opening song with baby Groot dancing around was great, but some of the other songs seemed just there in the background and didn't add anything to the scene. Unlike the first movie where the songs would enhance the scenes, only a few moments in Vol.2 do that well. Without spoiling who the villain is, I will just say, this is one of the better villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and vastly better than the first movie's villain, Ronan. I understand the villain's plan and completely believe that they believe in what they are doing. There were a couple of very well done and horrifying moments that are unsettling to make the audience hate the villain. The best thing is that the villain provides more than a physical threat but an emotional one as well. Also providing insight into the relationships between several of the other characters. Overall, I would say that I enjoy Vol.2 more than the first movie, but that does not mean that it is perfect or better. While the movie has enhanced certain characters, it also adds more to the plot and takes a too much time trying to bring the Guardians back together for the final battle. However, I really liked Kurt Russell's character, Ego, I love baby Groot and the best line of the movie is Yondu's, 'I'm Mary Poppins, ya'll!' Truly awesome.",8,7,10,16 May 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Review for The Secret Life of Pets
","Hot off the heels of Zootopia and Finding Dory comes The Secret Life of Pets. While I went into this movie not really expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed. The movie is about two dogs, Max and Duke, that get lost in New York City and need to find their way back home before they get sent to the pound. While that doesn't sound like much, there are two other parties of animals that are also trying to find them. One is their friends from their home apartment building and the other is a group of abandon animals from the sewers. All of the voice talents did a great job with their characters. Louis C.K. is the voice of the dog, Max. Not being a big fan of Louis C.K. I did not really recognize his voice, but he really brought some charm to his character. The female dog and love interest, Gidget, is voiced by Jenny Slate. She does a great job balancing sweet, cute and crazy. The standout voice performance is from Kevin Hart. He voices the bunny, Snowball, who leads the group of abandoned animals called the Flushed Animals. While he may be crazy and slightly evil, he is hilarious and even has a bit of a soft side at the end.While there is an ongoing plot, that's not really the driving force. The comedy is what keeps the audience watching. The short 87-minute run-time means the movie doesn't drag on in any spots. For the most part, the jokes are nonstop throughout the movie. A lot of the laughs are from visual cues. Mostly making fun of the way that pets think and act. Anyone who owns a pet knows how dogs act around balls and how cat loves the laser pointers. The movie shows all the little habits that pets have and how it can appear to be silly. Perhaps people that don't have pets, might not get the jokes and enjoy the movie as much.As far as cartoon animal movies go, The Secret Life of Pets is good, fun entertainment for children and adults. If you are looking for something more emotional and dramatic then this is not your movie. However, if you just want to laugh and have a good time, I highly recommend seeing this movie.",8,3,7,19 July 2016
Straight Outta Compton," Review for Straight Outta Compton
","Anyone that has listened to rap music in the last few decades has heard of the group N.W.A, but not every one knows their story and the impact they have had in the music industry. The film Straight Outta Compton shows the rise and fall of the infamous rap group. The movie starts out introducing us to each of the five members one by one, and shows us how they came to form the rap group, N.W.A. The first person introduced is one of the three main central figures, Eric Wright, a.k.a. 'Eazy E'. Wright is portrayed by actor Jason Mitchell who gives a great performance. O'Shea Jackson, jr. the real life son of 'Ice Cube' plays his father in the movie. He does a good job not only looking like him, but also with his voice and mannerisms. The third main member is 'Dr. Dre' played by Corey Hawkins. While he bares a similar resemblance to the real Dr. Dre, he managed to play him with a lot of compassion and drive as a person. All of these actors do a great job interacting with each other and brings a realistic feel to the movie. The other two members of the group, MC Ren and DJ Yella are given little screen time and character development, probably because they are the least known members of the group. Some other notable performances are from the actor that portrays Suge Knight. Known as a threatening person, the way Knight is written in the movie comes off very looming and menacing, captured well by the actor that plays him. The audience really feels like this guy will kill anyone for anything and is ruthless. Small cameos are made by actors playing Snoop Dogg and Tupac, both of which did well with what they were given. The last main character is the manager of N.W.A, Jerry Heller, played by the talented Paul Giamatti, who gives a solid performance. Playing the caring yet manipulative manager, who claims that every thing he did was 'just a part of the business'. The character runs a fine line of being a caring person towards Eric and a sleazy business man. The first half of the movie plays out like a straight drama narrative building to the formation of the group, depicting their life struggles as well as run ins with gangsters and the police. As the movie progresses it becomes more about showing the major events that occurred starting with the concert riot in Detroit. From there most of the events shown were basic media covered incidents, that is publicly known. Such as Ice Cude and Dr. Dre leaving the group and starting their solo careers. The ending of course comes with the death of rapper Eazy-E, which played out well and was very emotional. This is one of the better music biopics made, while some liberties were taken, not everything is 100% accurate and many smaller details left out, it is still a solid story narrative. For the most part the pace of the film is good. The first act moves along well, while there is a bit of a stumble later in the movie but it never drags along. At a length of 147 minutes, the movie is so engaging that the time flies and next thing you know the movie ends. By the time the movie is over, you are left wanting to know more of what happened next with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. Not only is the pacing well, but the movie is shot well and has very nice cinematography, that draws you into the world that these characters live in. There are several good comedic moments that help lighten the movie and allows the audience to be entertain in more than just the dramatic scenes. The movie also does not down play the way African Americans were treated by the police, and how that inspired the graphic lyrics to some of the groups most popular songs. This is a well directed, well shot and well acted biopic that deserves the recognition and acclaim it has earned. The original running time was over three hours long and could have easily been made into television miniseries. Hopefully when it is released, it will include the extra footage. Overall this is a very good movie and character study based, on true events that left a mark in popular American culture.",8,1,23,8 March 2016
Spectre," Review of Spectre 007
","Spectre Movie Review The 24th Bond movie in the film franchise had big aspirations when they decided to bring back the classic Bond enemy organization, known as Spectre. The opening scene, for the first 2 minutes, looked like one consecutive shot, and the visuals in Mexico City looked great. It really brings you into the movie and gives you a great set up. However, it doesn't reflect the tone of the rest of the movie. On that note, neither does the famous Bond credits sequence. No offense to Sam Smith but the song that was chosen just doesn't work for me. It's hard to compete with Adele, but Smith's song feels a bit too similar to Skyfall, only not as great. There are a few good musical cues but overall it just a bit lack luster and doesn't really reflect the movie. The visual sequence that accompanies the song is not really any better. It hits you over the head with the octopus theme by showing multiple visuals involving an octopus figure. We get it, Spectre's logo is the octopus, we could tell from the silver ring that Bond takes at the end of the opening scene. It just feels silly and unnecessary.When Christophe Waltz was announced to play the villain in Spectre, I thought that it was a great decision because he's played the bad guy role so well before. The problem is not with the actor but rather the character. He becomes a generic Bond villain, less engaging than Javier Bardem's Mr. Silva from Skyfall. There is no mystery with the character, even though the movie tries to make it a mystery of who he is; but it's very predictable. Speaking of villains, another under utilized villain was Dave Bautista's, Mr. Hinx, whose name is never mentioned in the movie. Mr. Hinx is a silent henchman reminiscent of Oddjob from Goldfinger. The difference is again what they gave the villain to do or in this case not do. At least Oddjob had the hat that could slice things off, Mr. Hinx seems replaceable. Another thing the movie failed at was hiring actor Andrew Scott, known for playing the villain Moriaty on BBC's Sherlock. They mine as well put a sign on his characters head. They're fooling nobody with this casting choice. Even though there is a lot of 'bad' in the movie, that doesn't mean that I thought every thing was bad. I really enjoyed Q's role in this movie, being the classic gadget giving Q as well as taking a more active role in Bond's mission. The actor Ben Wishaw, who plays Q, is great in the role, playing the nerdy scientist but bringing a new refreshing take on the character and how he interacts with Bond. Similarly I also enjoyed the new incarnation of Moneypenny, who also becomes more involved with the mission. While I will miss Judy Dench as M, I did think Ralph Fiennes did a good job in the role.The action scenes in the movie are hit and miss, there's a few good throwbacks to some classic Bond tropes and scenes. While I do like Daniel Craig's Bond, he seems to be a bit out of it for most of this movie and it shows. The last problem I had with the movie was the main 'Bond girl', I felt the two had no chemistry and it didn't make sense why she would be on the mission with him. This movie is trying to set up that Bond has moved on from his love in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynn, and that maybe he can leave his spy life behind. The message is clear; however I don't think that it was executed very well.While I may not think that this is the best Bond movie every, and I've noted the many problems that I had with it, there is also enough good for me to enjoy it overall. Being the longest of the Bond movies probably doesn't help with the pacing, but this is not the worst Bond movie ever. I believe there is enough good in this movie that it should be seen at least once.",6,8,15,30 December 2015
The Martian," The Martian Review
","Set on Mars, The Martian is a unique science fiction movie that follows astronaut and botanist Mark Watney, as he tries to survive on the desolate planet. After being injured and separated from his crew, they leave him and return to the space station 'Hermes', presuming Watney to be dead. He then wakes up in the desert only to find that his crew has left him behind. Trying to survive off of left over meal rations, Watney has to figure out a way to make water, grow potatoes and communicate with NASA, in order to plan a rescue mission back home to Earth. One of the things that I really enjoyed about this film is the humor. While there is a lot of suspense in the movie, it is inter- cut with a lot of humor, mostly from Mark Watney and his video journals. I think that the video journals work well to show us how Watney is dealing with being alone and also gives a different way to show him on Mars, without the camera just following him around all the time. It gives the movie a cinematic feel, like it is is based on a true events, rather than a book. At 141 minutes the movie never drags because the action, suspense and humor are all well paced throughout the film. The cut backs between Mars and Earth also help to keep the story moving forward without feeling the length of the movie. Director Ridley Scott is known for his visually stunning movies and this one is no exception. The sets on Mars and in the space station are spectacular and it feels like the movie was really shot on Mars. There are some great anti-gravity scenes inside the Hermes station that are as good as the scenes from the movie Gravity and made me believe this crew is really in space.Not only is this a great story telling movie with amazing visuals but it also has an all star cast. Matt Damon does a great job playing Mark Watney, with the majority of his scenes being alone on Mars. The supporting cast of Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor are just as great and add a more grounding and realistic element to the rescue mission plot of the movie. A character that I really enjoyed was the young NASA analyst Mindy Park played by Mackenzie Davis. Her character is just some nobody NASA employee that discovered Watney was alive and got caught up in the mission and put in charge of monitoring Watney's movements on Mars. While it's a minor role, a few scenes here and there, it brings in a character that the audience can relate to. The movie does have a couple of minor problems, none of which really distracts from the story, but rather would have enhanced it. There is almost no mention of Mark Watney's family or life back home. Adding something small like that would give more weight to Watneys motivations for returning to Earth. Another small part that was a bit overlooked was the integration of working with the Chinese government. There was scene discussing working together but then it just happens. I'm guessing this could be due to time constraints but an extra scene negotiating between the two governments trying to solve this problem would have added more realism to the movie. Again these are just minor issues, the majority of the movie is fantastic.After seeing other movies, like Gravity and Interstellar, The Martian is probably my favorite. For me the pacing and use of humor are what made it more enjoyable and kept me invested. Overall this is a fun movie with some suspense and action that I highly recommend every one seeing. This is one that I will for sure end up buying on Blu-Ray when it comes out.",9,2,6,17 October 2015
