Miracle," Better than usual
","If someone said to me that I was going to see a Disney film about hockey, I would have expected 'The Mighty Ducks.' If they said I was about to see a Disney movie with Kurt Russell, I would have expected comedy and music.'Miracle' is above all of that. No, there are no tunes, or comedy. This tells the true story of the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team. Kurt Russell acts, and he is fantastic. I totally accepted him as a hockey coach.I was surprised with the attention to detail in this picture. They had everything exactly right. It didn't take long to forget that I was seeing a Disney film with Kurt Russell. This one deserves a lot of credit, and Russell's acting has never been better.",Null,0,0,3 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," OK, I will say it was OK
","I have to admit to not thinking this movie was much when I saw it in the theater last summer. I thought the characters were weak and uninteresting, and the one I seemed to like the most was Jar-Jar Binks. I remember thinking that I was more impressed with a computer-generated character than the ones played by live actors.Seeing the movie now on video, I liked it more. Sure, I still think it is the lowest of the Star Wars films, but it has plenty of segments that make it worth watching (and buying). 'Phantom Menace' is not up to the same level of the original trilogy. I thought the politics in the story are laid on too heavily and are very confusing. That made it impossible for me to care about that. To see Queen Amidala speak to a committee about people dying is emotionally unconvincing.Also, in a battle scene, I thought it was a little ridiculous that an entire droid army could not shoot through a shield, BUT THEY COULD WALK THROUGH IT!!!! How??? Then, they are defeated SIMPLY BY BLOWING UP THE CONTROL SHIP IN SPACE!!!!!!!These are not the kind of plot errors I noticed after repeated viewings of the picture. I had these thoughts the first time, as I was sitting in the theater. My kids are young and did not care about these things. They were thoroughly entertained.I was entertained as well, but hoped for more. I just hope that George Lucas did not 'dumb-down' all of the rest of this new trilogy.",7,0,0,23 April 2000
Spider-Man 2," I can say I've seen it
","Okay, I can now say that I have seen 'Spiderman 2.' But let me give you my multi-faceted review of the film.Of course, I really enjoyed 'Spiderman 1.' Willam Dafoe was a great villain as the Green Goblin. On a four-star rating system, I would give that film ***.With that said, let me state that, for the record, I liked 'Spiderman 2.' But I must admit that there had to be a lot to that movie I simply did not see. I will address that this way:1. Did you think it was better than the first one? Answer: No. Just the opposite, I found more enjoyment in the first film.2. Did you like the villain of Doc Ock? Answer: He was okay, but not overly menacing.3. Will this movie have a place in your DVD collection? Answer: Certainly. The wife and kids had plenty of fun with it.I thought the movie was too long. The running time was around 2:15, but a half-hour could have easily been cut. A lot of screen time was spent on the relationship of Peter Parker with MJ. There were long periods where I said to myself, 'Okay, I have had enough of this lovey-dovey stuff. Where is Doc Ock?One super-hero movie sequel I liked a lot was 'Superman II.' Now, see if this sounds familiar: In that movie, Superman gives up his powers for the love of Lois Lane.In 'Spiderman 2,' Peter Parker comes to the realization that he can have his powers if he truly wants them. Does he need to lose his powers for the love of Mary Jane?Don't get me wrong. I am not saying 'Spiderman 2' is a bad film. But I just need to be careful when I read reviewers who think it was the greatest super-hero film they have ever seen. I thought this movie was miles from that.",Null,0,0,3 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Visual Headache
","There are a couple lessons to be learned from watching 'Attack of the Clones.' Lesson #1: George Lucas used a new digital system, instead of film, and the results were satisfactory.Lesson #2: The imagination of George Lucas works well, but when he has the technology to create the things he truly wants, he sacrifices in other areas like interesting characters and situations.When I went to this film, I took my three young kids. My 7-year-old son really summed up the picture as we were exiting the theater: When asked what he thought of the movie, his reply was, 'I really liked the ships in it!'You know what? He was right. The characters were bland, and the action sequences are very quickly becoming a Star Wars clich√©.Visually, Lucas has overloaded the movie. There are so many things going on in the frame that they are very distracting. It is difficult to pay attention to dialogue when there are hundreds of ships flying through the air, or thousands of droids and clones shooting at each other.The digitally created Yoda is fun, but there were times when I was even under-whelmed by it. He flips, he fights, and moves like a true action hero, but when it is over, he picks up his little walking stick and starts to limp away. Is this just an act on his part for bogus sympathy?With the younger Obi-Wan Kenobi as one of the leads, he doesn't quite carry the movie enough. The young actor (Hayden Christensen) playing Anakin makes a nice attempt, but there is almost no chemistry between him and Amadala.Yes, George Lucas pulls out all of the stops to make something interesting to look at, but it fails in the end. Practically every frame of this picture has some computer-generated portion added, but too much is still too much. The grotesque aliens, who grunt, click, or waddle their way along, and the goofy robots and ships that populate a lot of the screen, are more than just distractions. They can be categorized in one word:ABSURD.It is always my preferred method to rate a film using a four-star system. Well, 'Clones' gets only '**'. It is sad to say that Lucas had created his worst 'Star Wars'.Recently, it was announced that another 'Indiana Jones' film will be coming our way. I honestly hope that Lucas does not try to load it up with all visuals like he has in these last two 'Star Wars' films. If he does, he is bound to disappoint many.",5,0,0,8 June 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Good, but it is no 'Toy Story'
","Seeing this film with my kids, I noticed something that was quite different than the experiences of the 'Toy Story' films and 'A Bug's Life': The kids were having a better time than I was. That was really too bad, because I wanted to have the fun too, but I could not find it.Maybe I am not as dazzled as I was with 'Story'. Computer animation is fantastic, but movies still come down to one thing: story. I just did not feel that the 'Monsters, Inc.' tale was as good as the previous efforts of Disney/Pixar.Before I go into a long talk of the failings of this film, let me first state that kids do enjoy it. From their standpoint, taking in an average of the 3 of my children, I would rate it ***1/2 out of ****. I know they will go to school, tell all their friends to see it, and there will be 'Monsters, Inc.' toys under the Christmas tree this year.So much for the kid review. From my viewpoint, this film tried to appeal utilizing many of the same methods of the 'Toy Story' movies. Unfortunately, those films were better. 'TS' gave us the idea of lives existing somewhere that we can't see. And, instead of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, replace them with Sulley and Mike. In 'TS2,' Woody gets the girl and Buzz is the one driven to fulfill the mission. In 'Monsters,' Mike gets the multi-legged girl and Sulley focuses on the job. There is even that moment between Sulley and Mike where they have an argument and go their separate ways. Seems very familiar.I guess I hoped for something funnier. This one has funny moments, but it seems to be going more for the 'Cute' factor. The little girl, Boo, has a very cute face that can evoke many emotions. Sulley and Mike, voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal, are quite good too. Walking out of the theater, I had the disappointing feeling that I wished the movie could have had more. While the kids rate it ***1/2, my rating is either ** or **1/2.",6,0,1,11 November 2001
Schindler's List," 'Greatest' is not enough
","What I am about to say may seem absurd, yet it is the truth from my heart. There are movies that everyone should see, yet one viewing would suffice. There are films that have such powerful messages, with images that are beyond words. They are burned into your consciousness forever.'Schindler's List' is such a film. It remains Steven Spielberg's finest achievement. In fact, it is the greatest accomplishment in cinema. Eleven years after seeing the film, portions still linger in my mind's eye.Obviously, a film like this can never be matched. Spielberg never tried to. He let it speak for itself.These days, with the advent of DVDs and high-definition screens, I have never felt totally compelled to buy 'Schindler's List' on disc. Perhaps I should, and maybe I will. It's not that I do not want to see the movie again, and it is certainly not that I think it is a bad film.The truth is that it so conveys its message so powerfully, it succeeds at what it is trying to do in ways that words cannot describe.Out of four stars, I rate this one *****. That's right, even four stars are not adequate.George",10,9,13,1 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Enjoyable work of an old story
","When I first heard that they were making a new 'Chocolate Factory,' I couldn't see any reason. The original is a classic, and was the first movie I went to as a kid.A refreshing take on the new film is that it is not simply a remake of the 1971 movie. This one tells you much more about Willy Wonka and the operation of the factory. There are a few updates to the story: Mike Teevee is a video game nut! There are some very hilarious moments in the movie. I won't spoil them and tell you what to look for, but be prepared to laugh. Also, this film shows more of Johnny Depp's talent. His Willy Wonka is completely different from the great Jack Sparrow he played in 'Pirates Of The Caribbean.' Everyone in my family had a good time with it, so it comes with our recommendation. I did not feel compelled to compare it to the 1971 movie. That one will always have a special place in my heart, but this new version of the story is wonderful!Since it is made my Tim Burton, you will see his style everywhere. One small aspect of it that I did not care for was that it takes place in the winter. Everything seemed so cold and dark at first. In the 1971 film, it is a beautifully sunny day when the children arrive at Wonka's factory, giving the feeling that everyone is about to enter a fantasy land.Still, this new one will not disappoint. Fun and funny stuff!",7,1,1,27 July 2005
Vanilla Sky," So - so
","Many people seem to be in love with this movie. I am very hard-pressed to know why. I found it to be a confusing, overrated, over-acted mess of a film.When I saw the words, 'Intellectual' in some ratings, I was prepared to be challenged in an interesting way. Unfortunately, I wasn't. I thought the movie needed some serious editing.Certainly, the opening sequence, in an unpopulated New York Times Square is fascinating to look at, but the movie never lives up to that for the remainder of the running time. (Which was easily 45 minutes too long.)Maybe they thought that things could be wrapped up in a surprise ending. (Don't worry, I won't expose it here.) I love surprise endings. But, once they get to that portion, Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, and another actor simply sit and talk about it for minutes on end. I kept thinking, 'GET ON WITH IT, ANYWAY!!'I know that a movie is not working when I find myself looking at my watch and estimating how much is left. I should not have the experience of sitting in a theater and thinking, 'Well, let's see. I'll be out of here in an hour!'A superior film, with an unforgettable surprise ending, was 'Angel Heart' from 1987 and starred Mickey Roarke and Robert DeNiro. Get that one and blow off 'Vanilla Sky'.My personal rating of 'Vanilla Sky': *.5 out of ****.",4,0,0,20 January 2002
The Emperor's New Groove," Fun Fun Fun!
","If you have not seen 'Emperor's New Groove', I have to recommend it. But, before you watch it, let me give you some advice... 1) Do not look for any profound, groundbreaking animation. 2) Do not expect a complicated story with plenty of plot twists. 3) Prepare yourself for a lot of laughs.This is a funny movie. From beginning to end, I just kept enjoying it. My kids loved it too. It was very refreshing to see Disney move away from some of its old establishments in film. Here, the lead character is a jerk. His plans are cruel, and his transformation into a llama seems justified.David Spade, John Goodman, and Eartha Kitt provided excellent voice performances. (Please forgive me for thinking that Eartha Kitt died years ago!)The price of Disney videos is not that bad. Go ahead and buy this one. You will want to see it again.",Null,0,1,18 June 2001
Tarzan," Another great Disney movie
","If you are looking for a movie that will entertain the entire family, 'Tarzan' will not disappoint. The animation is incredible, as dazzling as any other Disney feature. The sequences in which Tarzan and Jane swing and surf through the trees are marvelous. Surely, portions were computer-generated, adding even more realism to the jungle.Some parts felt like 'The Jungle Book' and others reminded me of 'The Lion King', but that was okay: those were great films too. Tarzan the boy is constantly looking for the acceptance of his ape step-father, Kerchak, who never seems satisfied with the human. There is a great relationship there.
Of course, every Disney film needs a villain and 'Tarzan' has one in Clayton. He was reminiscent of Gaston from 'Beauty And The Beast'. For me, the familiarity of the story and the usual Disney bag of tricks in this movie made for a great combination. I loved it.Were there better Disney films? Of course. 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and 'Beauty and the Beast' were better, but they were masterpieces. Still, 'Tarzan' is a terrific movie.Phil Collins' music is great here too. I really recommend this film.",Null,1,1,6 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the bunch (sorry Phantom Menace!)
","'The Empire Strikes Back' is one of my favorite films of all time, and was the best of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. The relationships between the characters is better than 'Star Wars': I had great fun watching the love develop between Princess Leia and Han Solo. When he was about to be frozen in carbonite, you could feel her pain as she watched him helplessly being lowered into the pit.Of course, the only way to see this film is to watch the 1997 Special Edition. The Cloud City scenes are greatly improved.I made the horrible mistake of re-watching this film just before seeing 'The Phantom Menace'. It made me realize what 'Menace' lacked: interesting characters. A film is sometimes only as interesting as its villain, and in 'Empire Strikes Back', Darth Vader is the ultimate. He will stop at nothing to find Luke Skywalker. Disappointing him will result in your death.Luke with Yoda was fun as well. Who would have thought that such a diminutive being would be the Jedi Master of the Force? The one line of dialogue in this movie that I never forget was when Yoda told Luke: 'You must un-learn what you have learned!'As we move into the next millenium, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is one of the best films of the 20th century.",Null,0,0,5 September 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The bottom line is fun
","When I think of the Indiana Jones movies, 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' was the best, but its sequels were great fun. In 1989, when 'Last Crusade' was released, I had some sadness because I knew it was going to be the last of the trilogy.I accepted it, just as I had accepted the ending of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. There always comes a time for things to end.Still, I thought 'Last Crusade' was the weakest of the films. I enjoyed 'Temple Of Doom' more, with its edge of your seats excitement.It is fun, but almost requires seeing the other Jones movies first. It has some of the same silliness as the others. I am a Sean Connery fan, but having him as Indiana Jones' dad was almost too much. Still, it brings plenty of smiles. It figures that Indiana Jones' father would be James Bond!Go ahead; have fun with it.",7,0,1,15 February 2005
