The Avengers," Sound and fury, signifying nothing...
","Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki 'was adopted' was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clich√©d and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called 'first-person shooter' games but are nowadays referred to as 'first-person action' games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their 'big get-togethers' when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...? I think John Carpenter (THEY LIVE) and George Romero (LAND OF THE DEAD) had it right: we have seen The Enemy, and He is Us. Give me RODNEY CECIL, PSYCHO HERO any day.",3,14,29,1 October 2012
Angels & Demons," Tom Hanks worth watching...
","More often than not, Tom Hanks can make even a middle of the road movie watchable. (Sure, there have been a couple that make you cringe- anything wherein he attempts an accent of any sort, for instance-, but he's one of the few performers whose mere presence can make a good movie a Great movie.) As a supporting star, he even made a soccer ball look good (I wept with him when the stalwart Wilson got lost at sea). Hanks can, by virtue of a look alone- no expression, just a blank look, using only the Eyes and a tightening of the Lips- bring one to the verge of an emotional chasm that must perforce be crossed if one is to continue on. I **** you not. He does it in ANGELS AND DEMONS, wherein he plays a cross between Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. Ron Howard does an excellent job as Director (as is his wont) and the cinematography has to be seen to be appreciated, but it's the last 20 minutes or so of the movie that's troubling. Had the movie ended when it clearly SHOULD have (with a noble sacrifice), I would've been obliged to rate it a ten. As it stands, it's a sometimes thrilling thriller and rates a solid seven. See it.",7,1,2,24 May 2009
Changeling," Haunting...
","This one caught me completely by surprise. I can vouch for the fact that for a woman to lose a child, even in the course of as natural an act as childbirth (it happened to my mother), can be devastating (and the kind of thing that can haunt her for the rest of her natural life). To lose a child the way the real Ms. Collins did is even worse. Ask John Walsh. I'd never heard of 'the chicken coop murders' before. It's amazing to think that something of such magnitude might've been consigned to the fires of forgetfulness if not for a writer happening across a pile of discarded paperwork... Even more amazing was the way Ms. Collins, so ably played by Angelina Jolie, soldiered on. Women are often capable of a kind of strength men can't match. (Just today, I saw my wife stand in line FOR SIX HOURS, in triple-digit heat, at a local church in the hopes of getting some dental work done... only to be turned away at literally the last moment. How she didn't break down is beyond me. Literally.) CHANGELING is a left hook to the chin that you just don't see coming: it undoes dental work, and it's the kind of movie you don't forget easily.",10,6,8,2 May 2009
Come and See," Watch and learn...
","COME AND SEE, with its documentary approach to storytelling, puts the viewer right in the middle of unrelenting horror; drags us, kicking and screaming, from one nightmare scenario to another. When our young hero gets shellshocked, we voyeurs are likewise shellshocked- and the depiction of shellshock has never, as far as I know, been so realistically conveyed. (We've seen it to a lesser degree SINCE, in movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but never, to my knowledge, has it been handled so believably nor so uncompromisingly: the use of drifting, almost dreamlike, camera-work and uncomfortably muffled sound effects and music, combine to give us the impression WE have been shellshocked. One of the great strengths of this part of the film is its DURATION: it's not just done for a few minutes to get the idea across and then dumped: it drags on the way it would in Real Life, for fully a third of the movie.) If you have the stomach for some in-your-face Real World horror, I suggest you COME AND SEE.",10,2,2,12 April 2012
Frost_Nixon," Langella/Howard...
","The last thing in the world I wanted to see was yet another whitewashed version of history extolling the dubious virtues of one of the most contemptuous war criminals to ever govern this nation. (The mere thought that there's a plaque on the Moon bearing this man's name is all the reason I need to hope and pray that some other country makes it there soon and brings that piece of junk back here where it belongs.) But this isn't propaganda: it's Cinema, and the Actor's Art at its highest level. Langella and director Ron Howard rise above the man and give him what in Life he most lacked: a Heart, and a Soul. Langella's performance is unforgettably moving and Howard's direction is at its sharpest ever (well, close: I still think that Cinderella MAN is one of the greatest movies ever lensed; even better, overall, than this one- and that's saying a lot). See this one because Langella and Howard are actually able to make one of the 20th century's vilest political leaders sympathetic through consummate cinematic sleight of hand.",10,3,6,2 May 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Beast of Yucca Flats redux...
","Far be it from me to point these things out (my own RATMAN is a cross between The Shadow, Zorro, and Batman), but this latest version of THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS isn't much better than the previous one. In Coleman Francis's original (which quite clearly inspired Stan Lee and Jack Kirby), Tor Johnson ('a prehistoric beast in the Nuclear Age,' according to Francis himself) limps arthritically through the desert ('a hundred and ten in the shade- and no shade,' Francis the narrator intones- no doubt remembering those long, hot days in the desert getting it all on film) after having been transformed by a nuclear explosion into a lumbering Hulk. Time had clearly taken its toll on Johnson, but there he was, lurching around in his ragged shirt, making inarticulate growling noises. At one point, vice-presidential wannabe (and real life Stepford Wife) Sarah 'Six Pack' Palin puts in an appearance. It didn't save the movie (nor will it save the Republican Party), but at least THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS was an honest attempt at telling the story of THE INCREDIBLE HULK OF YUCCA FLATS.",4,1,4,9 October 2008
The Equalizer," Small Screen action on the Big Screen
","We all make mistakes. One of my greatest failings (if you ask ME, that is) is that I often rent or pay to see a movie without double-checking the credits. I sat through THE EQUALIZER because I think Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of his generation and because I'd often enjoyed the teleseries upon which this movie was based. It gets off to a slow start, with scenes as predictable (and just about as compelling) as, say, the opening scenes of an episode of an old television series... and it doesn't really make any Forward Progress. It's been quite some time since I saw an episode of the old teleshow, so I'm not going to say one's better than the other, but I WILL say that I expected a lot more from this movie than it delivers. Washington is wasted here. THE EQUALIZER is standard 'action fare' of the televariety- nothing more.",5,1,1,12 January 2015
Ali," Some memorable moments...
","The odds were a million to one (or thereabouts) when challenger Cassius Clay climbed into the ring against heavyweight champion of the world Sonny Liston in 1964. Liston had wrested the title from Floyd Patterson in 60 seconds flat; the rematch lasted only moments longer. Clay had been floored by the Brit, Henry Cooper, en route to a tko win. (There's an old joke in boxing: If you wanted to take all of the British heavyweights in the world and lay them end to end from here to the moon... you probably could.) The oddsmakers had already measured Clay for a pine box by the night of the fight. So what does he do? He beats the daylights out of one of the most fearsome heavyweight champions of all time, using lateral movement (a study in perpetual motion, if ever there was one) and a piston-like left jab that cut the brutish champion and eventually began to buckle his knees. Clay even went so far as to taunt his opponent throughout the bout. It was one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight boxing history. The foregoing information is nowhere to be gleaned in ALI. By omitting these facts, Michael Mann does his movie (and his audience) a great disservice. He actually undercuts the drama by failing to build suspense. On the plus side, his use of professional boxers in all of the major fight scenes is to be commended: this lends the film a verisimilitude lacking in most 'boxing movies.' The punch-for-punch recreation of some of the most memorable moments from some of the 20th century's greatest fights is likewise laudable. (The fidelity to the fisticuffs alone makes this a must-see for fight fans.) Certainly there are few scenes in the history of fight films as powerful as the slo-mo shot of 'Sonny Liston' spitting out his mouthpiece after his drubbing at the hands of his brash challenger.A bit of narration, here and there, could've added immeasurably to the fight scenes; could've given non-boxing fans unfamiliar with the history of The Game something tangible to hold on to. Nor would it have hurt to have actually shown the destruction of both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton by George 'Thunderfist' Foreman. The significance would've been clear, even to a non-fan, of the four-round elimination of the only two men to have beaten Ali up to that time. (Frazier had battled Ali toe-to-toe for a total of 27 rounds, Norton 24, without so much as a handful of points separating them. Frazier fell in 2 brutal rounds to Foreman- losing his coveted heavyweight title in the process- and Norton, who'd broken Ali's jaw, went in two as well. How could anyone have expected Ali to beat Foreman and regain the title? The notion at that time was nothing less than preposterous!) (Footnote: Consider this, as well: Mike Tyson, hailed by many as the greatest thing since bottled milk, pulled out of a big payday with the geriatric George Foreman. Tyson understood something that a lot of people did not: that even an over-the-hill George Foreman still had the power to separate a champion from his title, as he later showed. Not that it mattered, as Tyson was kayoed by Buster Douglas, the man he opted to face in lieu of Foreman.)There are moments of great beauty in this film, and any true boxing fan needs to see it (if only for the beautifully-choreographed fight scenes, which put to shame the lame-brained antics in the ROCKY movies), but anyone who doesn't follow The Sweet Science may find themselves outside looking in.",4,3,5,21 May 2002
Iron Man 3," The right mix...
","IRON MAN THREE came as a pleasant surprise: better than the second installment, it's a perfect blend of comic book super-heroics and Big screen sensibilities. Robert Downey is at his best. The writing helps. So do the fx, which are 100% believable. (Even seeing the 'human chain' dangling over the Cape Fear River when the movie was being shot here didn't prepare me for the sequence: it's mind-boggling.) This was one of the few times that watching the movie was as much fun as reading the comic books. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back. The scene following the end credits was by far the funniest (and the best) of the 'tag' scenes. (And Stan Lee's cameo- as a lecherous old man watching a bikini contest- was great.) Hollywood finally got one right...",10,14,22,16 November 2013
The Ring," Anachronisms abound...
","Though it's only little over a decade old, THE RING is chock full of anachronisms: a VHS tape (analog, as opposed to the current digital dvds); a newspaper reporter who actually goes out and hunts down a story; a newspaper; a newspaper that actually prints the story that the reporter turns in; an implicit warning about the horrors of watching too much television; etc. Although it's an 'Americanized' remake of a Japanese Fright Film, it's not dumbed down in the traditional manner of American remakes: it's superbly crafted, with some fine performances throughout; there's even a bit of suspense along the way. The opening scenes culminate with a real zinger (it surprised me back when I first saw it, and I was already familiar with RINGU). The makeup is VERY effective, by the way. Anyone who watches the tape that triggers the Horror has seven days to get their Earthly affairs in order. Rachel (Naomi Watts), the reporter, makes the mistake of showing the tape to her ex and, later, leaving her son alone with the tape- which he, too, watches. At this point, it's a race against Time as the Otherworldly occurrences commence. When Rachel tracks down the man ultimately responsible for everything, Morgan (Brian Cox), he tells her: 'You take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it. You spread it like a sickness.' It's Morgan's dead daughter who's back from the dead, a 'horse whisperer' who hated being in the barn with the horses that the Morgan family bred. THE RING is one of the better Fright Films of decades past, and it's still worth a look Today. (Note: Yet another comment has been censored. Looks like someone- a lone individual- ain't none too happy with some of my comments. Be advised that ALL of my deleted comments are 100% accurate. They've been fact-checked by professionals. So much for 'net neutrality...')",10,1,1,24 November 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Good- but vastly overrated, even back then...
","The opening scenes of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK had me convinced we were seeing something special- the discovery of the vine-overgrown temple ruins, the penetration to the heart of the temple and the theft of the golden statue, the subsequent hair-raising escape from the self-destructing structure... it was all fantastic. It was at that point that the movie began to self-destruct. It went from being a fast-paced action film to an uneven love story cum religious tract. Granted, a good many of the serials that RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK borrows from (sometimes, shot for shot) aren't as accomplished overall- but, back in the day, those 12 to 15 chapter serials were done for a lot less than the cost of the titles for a Big Budget effort like this. There ARE a good many sequences throughout the movie, but there are also a good many less-than-impressive sequences and lapses in logic and unexplained plot points that remain (one of my pet peeves has always been the idea that Jones somehow managed to ride a submerged Nazi submarine halfway around the world, a point that was taken up in an episode of THE BIG BANG THEORY, but I've never seen the missing scene that allegedly explains the discrepancy).",8,0,2,8 November 2014
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Lincoln be stinkin'...
","The notion of Civil War-era vampires is nothing new (see the xlibris book THE NIGHT RIDERS for my own personal take on just such a scenario)- but it HAS been handled better (see the xlibris book THE NIGHT RIDERS...). From the looks of things, a great deal of money was spent on this one. Not much of a return on such a big investment, if you ask me. While it might've made a decent manga, it's not much of an anime (which it is, because most of the action is cgi). In THE NIGHT RIDERS, we learn that a slave ship from Africa has unleashed an ancient evil on these shores. The story works as metaphor, something ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER doesn't even ATTEMPT; it's just one more expensive cgi cartoon hardly worth the time it takes to sit through.",1,0,2,4 December 2012
Kung Fu Panda," Bitter disappointment...
","It never fails to amaze me how lame American animated movies tend to be. Maybe it's because I've been an anime otaku for so long (since washed-out bootlegs in the original Japanese- sans subtitles- were first offered up at comic book conventions for ridiculously high prices), or maybe because I grew up on the likes of ASTRO BOY and JONNY QUEST (which were both aimed at kids whose sensibilities weren't of the Special Needs variety), but the current crop of Big Budget cgi cartoons (including those that blend the cgi with live-action characters, like TRANSFORMERS and the two FANTASTIC FOUR fiascos) leave me numb. Perhaps because I've also been a martial arts movie fan for most of my life, I was looking forward to KUNG FU PANDA. My own KUNG FU CATS (which also featured a hero named Po) was available for quite some time online (at fanboycomics.biz)- until the site went down- but it certainly wasn't written down to the video game level of KUNG FU PANDA. Anyone fed up with this kind of slap-in-the-face stupidity should check out some of the aforementioned anime (Japanese animation).",4,3,8,21 November 2008
Chinatown," Cowspiracy...
","Roman Polanski's take on Film Noir harks back to Huston's own version of THE MALTESE FALCON: flawless filmmaking, with outstanding performances from outstanding players working from an outstanding script. It rarely gets better than this. With California currently in the throes of 'the worst drought in Recorded History,' CHINATOWN is all too relevant for Today's audiences. And the cattle barons are apparently to blame (see COWSPIRACY.com); while Ordinary Citizens are being forced to cut back on water usage, the Corporate Farms are being allowed to conduct Business As Usual- and, just today, it was announced that another city (Baltimore) was going to follow in the footsteps of the Powers That Be in Detroit, and shut off the water supply to people unable to pay their water bill(s).

Se7en," Thinking outside The Box...
","SEVEN was one of that rare handful of movies that didn't punk out in the end- it followed through, all the way to its bitter end, and was rightfully hailed as a modern masterpiece for having done so. From top to bottom, SEVEN delivered. I happened to be working at a video store (which, for lack of a more appropriate name, I'll call Lackluster) and I heartily recommended SEVEN to those browsing for a weekend's diversion. Alongside me at Lackluster worked a beautiful young blonde who eventually came to like me (naturally). She asked me one evening what I wanted for my upcoming birthday. Being a bit of a wise-ass, I replied that what I really wanted, more than anything, was a human skull to display on my mantle (which I didn't even have). The next thing I knew, she brought a battered cardboard box into Lackluster and laid it before me. 'Happy birthday,' she said, and walked away. I looked at the box, which was fairly heavy (I hefted it), and I noticed that there were dead WEEDS sticking out of it. I stuck my courage to the sticking place and opened the box. Inside was a human skull. A hole in the top of the skull revealed an empty brain cavity; the INSIDE of the brain cavity was lined with criss-crossing red and blue veins. I politely thanked the girl for such a thoughtful gift and declined it. She left with the box that night and I never saw it again- but, the very next day, a news item caught my attention: a local graveyard had been 'vandalized' the night before and 'one of the graves had been desecrated.' There were no details, but I'd wager that the desecration involved the removal of a corpse's head. Just goes to show you: be careful what you ask for...",10,2,4,12 June 2013
Unbreakable," Puts the Human in Superhuman...
","With a storytelling skill that belies his credits, M. Night Shyamalan crafts superb cinema. His directorial approach is definitely deft, and UNBREAKABLE puts the 'human' in superhuman in a decidedly dramatic fashion. Bruce Willis soars to new heights as the urban uberman. The story unfolds logically, the overall plan glimpsed here and there in tantalizing bits and pieces, as with any good mystery. And the questions at the heart of this particular mystery are answered satisfactorally along the way. Shyamalan never misses a beat. Only someone incapable of appreciating good drama (or superior filmmaking) could be disappointed.",10,0,0,24 August 2002
Star Trek," Star Drek...
","It's mind-boggling to think that fans of the teleshow(s) would actually wax enthusiastic about this one: STAR TREK ZERO (the all-too appropriate working title) lacks every single essential ingredient to make a movie memorable. The performances are all of high school talent show-calibre and only make all the more glaring the faults of the disjointed storyline(s). (Bana must be singled out, here: I honestly don't recall the last time I saw so uncharismatic a villain in a major motion picture. Unless, of course, we count the two FANTASTIC FOUR films.) The camera swoops and spins and dives and goes in one ear and out the other, up the nostril and through the nasal passage to grandmother's house we go- all in the vain hope that viewers won't notice that there's nothing really going on (like in a video game). Not since ALIENS (the second one, by the guy that did GIGANTIC) have I laughed so hard at so many 'dramatic moments.' Watch this one on the internet and save yourself a couple of bucks. You can thank me later.",2,41,62,10 May 2009
Citizen Kane," A parable for Our Time...
","One need only look around at the unbelievable number of boneheads on illegally monopolized cable 'news' channels to draw some very clear parallels between the 'Kane' of Old and you-know-who of New. Orson Welles may or may not have been sounding a warning back in 1941, but hindsight would certainly suggest as much. Granted, the monopolization of 'The Fourth Estate' may be almost incidental to the goings-on in CITIZEN KANE, but it's there and clearly delineated. Illiteracy has skyrocketed in this country over the past four decades, going hand in hand (not uncoincidentally) with the rise of television viewing- and, by controlling television (as per George Orwell), we've seen- and continue to see- the 're-imagining' of History. It's proving difficult to shake the parasites loose, too, because they've so entrenched themselves in the guts of the mass media that their eventual (but inevitable) departure will leave a gaping hole in our national psyche. The end result of 40 years of two-faced Politics (and complicit lying by the boneheads who've bowed and scraped for so long at the feet of they mastas that they no longer know how to stand upright) leaves one feeling more than a little left out in the cold. Never trust them again- no matter what means they use to try to reach you.",10,1,2,30 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Vainglorious bastard...
","Alfred Hitchcock had no third act for LIFEBOAT. It happens. It also happens that the unprecedented influx of 'independent filmmakers' of just a couple of decades ago has given us some of the worst movies of all time. The reason, more often than not, seems to be Ego. Having read glowing review after glowing review, these Vainglorious Bastards have let it all go to their head(s). Has Kevin Smith lived up to the promise of CLERKS, or Robert Rodriguez the brilliance of EL MARIACHI? Tarantino's 'breakthrough' moment (RESERVOIR DOGS) was much (much) less convincing than either CLERKS or EL MARIACHI, but his follow-up, the vastly overrated PULP FICTION, garnered him a fawning following. Believing he could do no wrong, he proceeded to crank out one borderline unwatchable movie after another. Which brings us to INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Forget the fact that it's an alternate reality version of History: what makes it one for the might-have-been-great-ones is Ego. Tarantino, convinced of his own Gifts, gives us totally forgettable dialogue- and at Great Length; over and over. Brad Pitt (as the 'Apache' taking scalps) does the goofiest Goober accent this side of Alan Alda in THE MOONSHINE WAR- with a straight face, too, as if he were likewise convinced of his Gifts. His dog soldiers (or 'ZOG soldiers,' as our home-grown Arryan brothers might call them) are nigh indistinguishable from one another. As are the two females: I literally lost track of who was who, three and a half hours into this mess. It took me two tries to get through this one, but I did so knowing that I'll never have to slog through another Tarantino movie as long as I live.",4,2,5,29 December 2009
Underworld," Form, with just a touch of substance...
","Beautiful sets and cinematography, directed with an in-your-face directness that lends it that RUN, LOLA, RUN quality. Like the lesser THE BREED, UNDERWORLD is flash and sizzle and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. (It's good, from time to time, to be able to just sit back and relax and enjoy the ride. Even if you already know where you're going.) Vampires and werewolves have never looked so good. (Well, there WAS Ingrid Pitt in THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD and THE VAMPIRE LOVERS and...) The one and only thing I'll harp on is the 'history' between vampires and werewolves. According to some of the ancient lore, vampires are actually supposed to be the risen spirits of dead werewolves. This 'truth' would make a great 'reveal' in the sequel. And don't forget: you heard it here on the IMDb first.",6,0,0,25 September 2003
Dawn of the Dead," What Richard Matheson by way of George Romero has wrought...
","Filmmaker George Romero has often cited Richard Matheson's classic SF shocker I AM LEGEND as the inspiration for his chiller NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. In Matheson's short story, DANCE OF THE DEAD, a 'loopy' comes twitching to life before a crowd of onlookers ('loopy' being a play on 'Lifeless Undead Phenomenon'). Unlike the vampires in I AM LEGEND, the zombie in DANCE OF THE DEAD is slow-moving and uncoordinated. Like the walking dead in Romero's classic(s). (Or perhaps Romero found inspiration in the first feature based on Matheson's I AM LEGEND, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH; certainly the living dead in Romero's movie mimic the ponderous, slow-moving vampires therein- not to mention the undead in INVISIBLE INVADERS.) In the 'remake' of DAWN OF THE DEAD (a remake in name only), the zombies are even closer to the vampires that originally inspired them. They are no longer the lumbering, slow-moving creatures that we've all come to know and love. Like the zombies in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, the reflexes haven't slowed since death. This makes for an even bleaker scenario than in the Romero films (in which there often seems to be, somewhere in the gloom, a faint ray of hope, however dim): not only do you need to be faster than the guy next to you, you need to be able to outrun creatures impervious to pain; creatures dying, if you will, to taste your very flesh... The film starts off well, but begins to lose focus as characters crowd in on one another, with 'throwaway' victims introduced just minutes, in some cases, prior to their deaths. (It's hard- if not impossible- to feel for these 'throwaways,' as we learn very little about them.) The interplay between the principals, however, more than makes up for the shortcomings of the diversionary deaths. (In all frankness, the gratuitous gore is a given in these movies- it's part of their allure-, but makeup fx alone do not a worthwhile feature make.) All in all, a topnotch entry in the (sub-)genre.",10,1,2,8 February 2005
Iron Man 2," Ironed Man...
","By far the best thing about IRON MAN TWO is Scarlett Johansson as The Black Widow: her cgi-enhanced fight scenes make this virtual movie virtually worth watching- but it's the lack of any genuine humor (the saving grace of IRON MAN ONE) that makes the running time seem to drag. Downey is capable enough, given what he's given to work with, but watching an addict playing a drunk is hardly my idea of a fun evening. Had the filmmakers opted to say something of substance about substance abuse, one might've been inclined to forgive them the shortcomings of the script (which are legion). Rourke's threadbare role (a reprise, of sorts, of his character in THE WRESTLER) adds not one whit of sheen to his shine: he not only looks like a homeless man, his persona screams it. A true waste.",5,3,6,15 May 2010
World War Z," World War bore...
","One part 28 DAYS LATER and one part DAWN OF THE DEAD II (which is one part RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD), WORLD WAR Z, with its fleet-footed, teeth-gnashing zombies, may be the final chapter in the seemingly never-ending cycle of zombie films set in motion by George Romero and Company so very long ago. Where to go from here? What's left to say that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? (MUTANTS was a nice variation on a theme, but even there we were watching what was essentially 'just another zombie movie.' And THE WALKING DEAD, sporadic at best, has milked the concept dry in every way possible.) WORLD WAR Z has its moments, but many of them seem to be unintentionally memorable; such as when the people in First Class aboard a plane are set upon by the folks flying coach- the one percent quite literally being ripped apart and eaten by the 99%; or when the Israelis try to throw up a wailing wall to keep out the infidels, only to find that they've managed to wall themselves IN; or the one true moment of fright in the entire film, when a dying man's eyes, which have rolled back in his head, suddenly drop down again (a direct steal from RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD)... While zombies still have plenty of potential to scare the s### out of us, movies like WORLD WAR Z (and even THE WALKING DEAD, in which characters dispatch zombies without so much as breaking stride, using a seemingly endless flow of ammunition) cheapen the whole experience (ironic, considering the budgets).",2,1,3,19 September 2013
Shaun of the Dead," The Zed word...
","SHAUN OF THE DEAD is hands down one of the finest and funniest send-ups in the history of Horror. Oh, there've been other outstanding examples- like Roman Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS or the Mel Brooks monsterpiece YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, to cite but two-, but not so many that SHAUN OF THE DEAD gets lost in the shuffle (zombies shuffle...). In fact, like many of the very best parodies, this one boasts production values far superior to most of the type of movies it pokes fun at. From beginning to end, it's played straight and THAT above all else is its funniest aspect; it's by no means a stupid tongue-in-cheek wink-wink, nudge-nudge kind of movie. If you're tired of all the 'straight' stuff shuffling around out there, try SHAUN OF THE DEAD.",10,1,3,24 October 2014
Argo," Ergo, Argo...
","For some reason, I was expecting this one to be about the collusion between the Reagan administration and the Iranians (i.e.; the agreement- now a matter of public record- that the Iranians would hold the hostages until the Reagan regime came to power). I wasn't expecting a story about a group of filmmakers rescuing... anybody. Whatever; the thing that I found of interest here was the apparent participation in the intrigues of John Chambers (whose Academy Award winning makeup for the original PLANET OF THE APES made me a lifelong fan of the man). I've seen one of the 'disguise kits' he helped develop for undercover agents, so it wasn't a big stretch to imagine him being involved in this particular escapade. The movie's not bad, but it's not as suspenseful as it should've been- nor is it as interesting as it could've been (had the filmmakers concentrated on the filmmakers involved).",7,0,1,7 May 2013

And that's what's at the heart of what's wrong with this movie: it never pauses long enough, at any point, to build some much-needed suspense. Everything happens in a much too quick 'and-then-she-joined-the-resistance-and-they-got-ratted-out' manner; the storytelling isn't carefully measured, it's rushed, as if getting as many shots in the can as quick as possible was the director's overriding concern. The fact that the camera almost never stops moving suggests as much (it's a common practice in low budget film-making). To cite but one example: the scene where the son of the leader of the resistance is being tortured. There's absolutely no suspense whatsoever in this scene (a pivotal moment in such a film, one would think). Had this one been pared down to a handful of essential scenes and had those scenes been thoroughly thought out and presented, BLACK BOOK might've felt a little less like a rush job. And that's no rush to judgement, either.",6,5,6,4 June 2009
Batman Returns," The Christopher Walken show...
","BATMAN RETURNS has the distinction of featuring more memorable villains than any other comic book-based feature film. We have Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (in a role that would've been better served by Sean Young, if you ask me) and Danny DeVito as the mutant Penguin- but it's Christopher Walken as Max Shreck who steals the show: his delivery is the reason. When he catches secretary Selina Kyle going through his files looking for evidence of corruption, he asks her: 'And how exactly did you access confidential files...' And here his voice drops to a mere whisper as he concludes: '...May I ask...?' In a movie chock full of what were probably meant to be witty quips (there's very little real dialogue in the film, but that's okay, it's implied: this is only a 'comic book movie'), Walken's handling of almost throwaway lines is masterful. Catwoman's costume is sexy, to be sure, and the Penguin is one of the most horrific creatures to ever waddle through a comic book cum movie, but it's Walken as Shreck who really stands out. (Oh, and Michael Keaton is still great as Batman.)",10,2,6,8 November 2014
The Others," Classically creepy...
","***SPOILERS*** THE OTHERS harks back to classics like Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS (which was based on Henry James's 'The Turn of the Screw') and Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (based on Shirley Jackson's novel, THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE). In and of itself, this bodes well (so to speak- for the viewer, at any rate): likening THE OTHERS to classic fright films based on classic written works automatically elevates it to a height most fright films (unfortunately) never even ASPIRE to, let alone attain. Ambiance can be EVERYTHING in a fright film- hence, the term- but, all too often, the alleged 'auteurs' prove themselves more 'hack' than visionary. Fortunately for filmgoers, director Amenabar is one of the more gifted young filmmakers now plying their trade. (Should Dan Curtis again resurrect DARK SHADOWS, it might prove a wise move to enlist the aid of the capable Amenabar.)",8,0,0,26 May 2002
Ed Wood," Never say die...
","Watching Johnny Depp as the irrepressible Ed Wood always brings back the memories (most of them bad): memories of trying to make Public Access movies with amateurs whose sudden 'claim to fame' led them to dictate how we would and would not shoot a scene that I had conceived and written and was supposedly directing; watching my would-be 'stars' as they literally walked away, time after time, from location after location without cause and without giving reason; etc. In January of this year, I'd planned to begin a remake of a short I'd made 15 years ago (IN THE WOODS, about a group of homicidal mental patients rampaging through a forest near the hospital from which they had escaped). At the last minute, both the cameraman (who had a camera capable of shooting widescreen and in black and white) and the makeup/fx guy (who claims to have worked on a zombie film shot in New Orleans last year) punked out on me (though they kept the copy of my script). In February, I wrote and planned to direct THE CRAVING (about a cabbie who battles a zombie plague here in Wilmington- called 'Filmington' in my script), but the cab we were to use developed transmission trouble the day we were to begin shooting; nix the cabbie vs. zombie movie. By March, I'd done a story for the fourth issue of my black and white comic (CAPE FEAR COMICS), entitled BOTTOM FEEDERS. The story involved a group of homeless people who do battle with the UNdead- another homage to George Romero. I'd hoped to premiere it at a zombiecon in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in October. Things got off to a good start when a guy who'd helped put on a local stage version of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD volunteered to be the lead. We went out and shot some scenes of him arriving at the local bus station and then getting mugged (leaving him thus penniless and homeless in a strange town). That very evening, apparently, he got a call from a local video store to which he had applied. No longer would he be available for BOTTOM FEEDERS. As this is being written, I'm trying to cast for my fourth attempt at making a movie this year: it'll be called KILLBILLIES, and it's a cross between DELIVERANCE, SOUTHERN COMFORT, and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. One of the leads is a professional wrestler who lives here in Wilmington (North Carolina). Like Ed Wood himself, I refuse to be dissuaded, but the lack of money has proved an almost insurmountable obstacle (NOBODY is willing to work for nothing around here). I'll keep you posted.",10,1,1,22 May 2010
L.A. Confidential," Stylized neo-noir...
","One of the more interesting (if theatrical) westerns to come down the pike over the years was TOMBSTONE: the performances were sometimes over the top and the progression of events pared down to their absolute bare minimums, but it worked. Ditto, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL. Many of the performances are theatrical in the extreme (those of Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Kim Basinger, in particular), but the film overall is effective. While some of the twists and turns aren't exactly unexpected (especially not for fans of films Noir), as a whole the story succeeds admirably: it's Neo-Vintage Crime Noir at its best. We haven't seen very many of these kind of movies in recent years. More's the pity: we could sure use More Noir.",8,0,2,13 October 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Sea sickness...
","The first two films in this series were absolute gems. I'd hoped to hold off reviewing any of them until I'd had the chance to see them all. Unfortunately, the third (and no doubt final) chapter in this trilogy has been written... and is to be found lacking. Ponderous in the beginning (so much so that I found myself drifting off- and pirate stories were a staple of my childhood, and among the kind of stories I enjoy to this day), PIRATES III manages to confound the viewer (at least, this one) by bogging down in too much piratical patter. Action speaks louder than words- especially in a pirate movie, made with sound... The long, drawn out hallucinatory sequence with Johnny Depp had my eyes rolling back in my head. Alfred Hitchcock once ventured that he should've left a scene out of a movie he'd made when he came to understand that the audience saw something happen in the scene that hadn't actually happened in the movie proper (the scene recounted was a lie). His audience had been confused. It was a valuable lesson, and he never made that mistake again. I mention this only in passing.",6,0,3,29 May 2007
X-Men," An adult approach...
","Bryan Singer's straightforward, adult approach to X-MEN is to be commended: like Tim Burton's treatment of BATMAN, Singer's approach to the subject of super heroes is as dramatic as it is super-heroic- the perfect blend. (Both BATMAN and X-MEN have humorous moments, but the humor is not out of context- and it's certainly not the kind of goofiness that we find in, say, the BATMAN TV series of the 1960s and all too many of the subsequent attempts to bring superheroes to The Big Screen.) Both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen lend the proceedings a gravitas lesser lights could NOT have. In fact, the cast from top to bottom is solid. The black leather look that has been de rigeur since Burton's BATMAN is on display here, as well- and it works, in this world of mutants with extraordinary powers (like many of the characters on THE X-FILES, the characters in X-MEN are all treated realistically- despite some truly Comic Bookish SUPER super powers). The cgi are beautifully integrated, as well. (Note: the cgi actually looked better on The Big Screen than they do on television...) In an age when Genocide has become the Norm (the death toll in Gaza has today passed 1100), it's genuinely sad to see Magneto staring up at the Statue of Liberty and musing, 'America was going to be the land of tolerance...'",10,0,0,29 July 2014
Zodiac," Exception to the rule...
","Although movies about serial killers often have all the charm of a charnel house tour, this one proves the exception to the rule. That it's based on history is part of its power: seeing young lovers necking early on in the film becomes squirm-in-your-seat suspenseful when they realize that they are being cruised by... a mysterious stranger. Director Fincher manages to ratchet up the tension to an almost unbearable degree simply by allowing us to observe the mounting anxiety of the vulnerable victims. Like Hitchcock with PSYCHO, Fincher makes us- willing or unwilling (I'm sure there were some who covered their eyes at this point in the proceedings)- voyeurs. And it's this witness-to-the-scene-of-the-crime approach to storytelling that makes ZODIAC so riveting. We can watch, but we can't intervene. Now that's suspense.",10,1,4,22 March 2007
The Terminator," The Outer Limits redux...
","When I saw this one in 1984, I couldn't help but point out that it was nothing new: anyone who's seen THE OUTER LIMITS (the original, black and white series) can attest to that. THE TERMINATOR 'borrows liberally' from at least three episodes: THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN, SOLDIER, and DEMON WITH A GLASS HAND. The latter two episodes were both written by noted Fantasist Harlan Ellison. He would sue the filmmakers for plagiarism and win. (When the movie played theaters, the 'acknowledgement to the works of Harlan Ellison' did NOT appear at the end of the movie.) Cameron and company took the romance between Martin Landau and the soon-to-be mother of the man who would bring about the end of civilization from THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN and coupled it, if you will, with the time-traveling title character from SOLDIER (brilliantly played by Michael Ansara) and the Mandroid (another brilliant performance, by Robert Culp) from DEMON WITH THE GLASS HAND. Focusing more on action than anything else (though it's Michael Bien's passionate performance as the hero that makes the movie worth watching), THE TERMINATOR proved the perfect vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger: he says little, but is physically imposing enough to intimidate anyone he comes into contact with. The fx were good enough for their time (and still hold up on the small screen) and the music is unforgettable.",10,0,1,24 May 2009
Sleepy Hollow," Steampunk sleuth...
","One of my favorite versions of SLEEPY HOLLOW was the black and white comic book adaptation by artist Bernie Wrightson; though much shorter than the story upon which it was based, Wrightson's patented style made the comic worth reading. Likewise, Tim Burton's Hammer-driven take is worth a look: it's dark, but light; scary, yet funny. The idea of Crane (Depp) as a steampunk forensics 'expert' was sheer genius; that he's squeamish at the sight of blood was a nice touch, too, and his fainting spells make for some fun moments. Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken and every other member of the cast are perfectly cast. The music is memorable; the cinematography to die for. If not Burton's very best (I still tend to lean toward the remake of FRANKENWEENIE, though that may be comparing apples to oranges), it's certainly ONE of them.",10,2,3,16 September 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Caring for Cassidy and The Kid...
","BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID was the first western I saw in a theater as a kid (during its re-release) and it blew me away. The contemporary attitudes of the two leads and the relative realism of the action that was depicted were two of the things that really stood out at the time (older westerns rarely if ever risked attempts at the kind of self-deprecating humor that Paul Newman engages in throughout the movie). When Robert Redford's eyes lock onto his accuser's gun during the opening confrontation, it's enough to establish his character's single-mindedness (and potential for violence at any moment); it's a great little touch and it's just one of many throughout the movie. Unlike all too many westerns, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID makes us CARE about these two characters (rogues though they may be) and it's THAT carefully-cultivated caring that makes the ending all the more poignant.",10,0,1,20 August 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," The Republican Reich fascist fantasy...
","Guillermo del Toro directs circles around most filmmakers, and PAN'S LABYRINTH is Exhibit Number One. The mix of brutal Reality and beautiful Fantasy has never been done better, though the historical horror overshadows (and eventually consumes) the imaginary world that del Toro creates. When Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen arrive at their new home with the sadistic Capatain Vidal in 1944 Spain, the stage is set for the fantasy that follows. The ever slow-moving camera watches scenes play out in an almost dream-like manner, drifting in and out and around the players the entire time. I've always liked this approach to cinematography: it helps make even static scenes tolerable. When the fascists begin to round up and torture and kill some of the 'rebels,' del Toro contrasts these horrors with the mundane, everyday indifference of the world around them: the forest itself is undisturbed by the wanton murders. Ofelia follows a fairy into an underground world where she meets a faun. 'You're going to a very dangerous place,' he warns her. Unfortunately, she doesn't heed the warning, and... well, see for yourself what happens next.",10,0,3,11 October 2014
Blade II," Cinecomic actioner...
","BLADE II lays claim to being even more comic-bookish than the first film in this series; and better, to boot. While I'll always contend that Blade- the character- was 'inspired by' the movie GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE (in which William Smith plays the half human-half vampire son of vampire Michael Pataki, who rapes a human woman in an open grave), the filmmakers who opted to bring the character to the big screen committed a cardinal sin when they tricked him out with a variety of automatic and semi-automatic weapons. In the comics, he carried wooden stakes, which sufficed. In the movie(s), wooden stakes never enter into it. Go figure. BLADE II has several things going for it: a sometimes frenetic pace... and the director, Guillermo Del Toro. If nothing else, Del Toro's participation automatically means that the movie will look great: he incorporates the Mario Bava and Dario Argento influences that have given his movies a most distinctive look. The vampires, too, prefigure the creatures in THE STRAIN (the teleseries) and The House of Pain has to be seen to be believed (it's where vampires go 'to feel something,' which takes on a whole new meaning when you're a vampire and you have what amounts to super powers). The ending is identical to the ending of a script I submitted to the first season of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE (titled VAMPYRE, about an undercover cop who goes all the way by allowing himself to be bitten by a vampire), another reason I really liked this one.",7,1,5,30 October 2014
Alien," Planet of the Vampires redux...
","PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES may just be Mario Bava's greatest achievement: there is a brooding feel to the proceedings that the cavernous sets only serve to enhance; it's as if the movie were set in a cathedral in space. Gigantic landing gear dwarfs the puny astronauts as they disembark from their ship and the misty, storm-ravaged surface of the planet is about as inhospitable an environment as anything theretofore presented in a science fiction fright film. Tracing the mysterious signal (a warning) to its source, they enter an alien ship through a giant orifice that lends the film a subtle, adult edge not normally found (up to that time) in such films. The fossilized giant was likewise unique for its time. I could go on, but I logged on to comment on ALIEN, the PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES remake (though it was never credited on screen as such). Borrowing also from IT!, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE and David Cronenberg's THEY CAME FROM WITHIN (a.k.a. SHIVERS), writer Dan O'Bannon and director Ridley Scott remade PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES without the vampires but with a terrifying new creature courtesy of Hans Rudi Giger. The Alien itself stands alongside THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON as one of the greatest costumes ever conceived for a fright film. Atmospheric in the extreme (thanks in no small part to the score), ALIEN is one of those creepy classics that deserves to be revisited from time to time. As is PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES.",10,0,1,9 October 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Close shave...
","The Great Goth (Tim Burton) has gifted us with many fine films over the years; rare have been the disappointments. Still, there has, on occasion, been unevenness. To wit: SWEENEY TODD. While the pale black palette is picture perfect, the music in this musical is something less than it might have been; all of a single note, as it were. Better all around if this had been a straightforward drama, sans songs; or, better still, had it been lighter in tone (like the bulk of Burton's work). The bloodletting- in a musical, remember- should've been counterbalanced. That it isn't accounts in no small degree for the overall unevenness. Next: POE- THE MUSICAL, with Depp as the tortured author (who may have been an unwitting carrier of TB, which could explain the untimely deaths of all those he loved)...",6,2,6,29 December 2007
Taxi Driver," All too plausible...
","Take it from someone who drove a cab for years: the TAXI DRIVER scenario is all-too-plausible. DeNiro's performance is dead on: I saw more than one 'Travis Bickle' out there on the streets at night, men who carried guns (though it's illegal for a cabbie to carry one in this town), who drove drunk (or worse), who robbed passengers (often by running what's known as 'a hot meter,' where the meter is switched from a mileage counter to a timer, usually at long stoplights, thereby allowing the driver to make more money off of the unwitting passenger) and who talked incessantly of 'cleaning up the city' (a common refrain, especially among former cops). Of course, some of this behavior is understandable: cabbies themselves must pay for their own gas at the end of every shift (which means that, more often than one would wish, one ends up owing The Company money at the end of the night); the driver eats it when a customer bails out on him and doesn't pay (a common occurrence with college kids, who think it's funny); if a cab goes down (usually because of a slack mechanic- and the term 'reliable mechanic' is as much an oxymoron as 'honest lawyer' or 'trustworthy politician'), it's the Driver (as most of them like to be called, 'hack' or 'cabbie' being each in their own way demeaning) who's s*** out of luck: bills to pay or not, if there's no cab for you to drive, you don't go out; and robbery (you're on your own if you get robbed- and, if you don't have the money to pay The Company their 50% of each fare for the night, you OWE The Company). Because I wasn't part of the Inner Circle where I worked, I usually got the s***-end of the stick every night- what were known as 'the crack runs.' I wasn't allowed to refuse a fare and, because the dispatcher had it in for me, I eventually came to be known as Crack Man. More than once, I came THIS close to dying out there: I once had a crack dealer literally hanging from the passenger window of my cab grappling with my passenger over a piece of 'rock' (crack cocaine). A crowd of dealers charged my cab. I proceeded to pull a manuver that I remembered, quite literally, from Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND (see chapter five). It saved my life. Anyone who can't buy the premise of TAXI DRIVER has never driven a cab.",10,0,0,1 July 2013
Shutter Island," 'It's a madhouse- a madhouse!!!'
","Not unlike Richard Matheson's 7 STEPS TO MIDNIGHT (itself a cross, of sorts, between SHUTTER ISLAND and THE BOURNE IDENTITY), SHUTTER ISLAND keeps one guessing. We've seen these kinds of questions dealt with throughout the history of Hollywood (and beyond), from THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI and BEDLAM to (sorta) CARNIVAL OF SOULS (and, hence, David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DR.) and JACOB's LADDER to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and TITICUT FOLLIES (the latter a documentary) to Scorcese's own BOXCAR BERTHA, TAXI DRIVER, and RAGING BULL. An uncle of mine fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War Two and it had a lasting effect on him- as it no doubt had on any man who fought there (or anywhere else during that war) (or any other, for that matter). Both Martin Scorcese's brilliant direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance make SHUTTER ISLAND an important movie. See it.",10,1,8,26 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The new Old World Order...
","Things got off to a bad start when I went to see CAPTAIN America 2: thirty minutes of TELEVISION COMMERCIALS preceded the movie. Shades of MAN OF STEEL... Sure, I know we're all living in a Corporate Culture, now, but gimme a f***in' break! (The Corporate Culture of which I speak permeates the movie: The Falcon himself wears clothing sporting the infamous logo of a notorious, internationally-reviled sweat-shop operation wherein 1,135 worker-slaves died. Apparently, he has no qualms whatsoever about said building collapse...) On a more positive note, our heroes DO end up taking down the Neo Reich, whose intentions are to bring back the Old World Order. (They even mention Dr. Stephen Strange as 'a person of interest.' That's DR. STRANGE, for those of you who don't know- 'Master of the Mystic Arts.') It was good to see former UFC welterweight champion Georges St. Pierre as Batroc the Leaper, though his part was much too small. Most of the PHYSICAL hand-to-hand fight scenes are good, though some of the cgi are (as usual) forgettable. (The Falcon soars all too briefly in this movie, and gets his wings clipped far too soon.) The yellow-orange makeup slathered on Scarlet Johannson gives her a sickly, yellow-jaundice look and the 'secret' of The Winter Soldier comes as no surprise to anyone who paid attention to the 'foreshadowing.' (And how DOES he get through metal detectors...?) All told, it's not a bad movie, but it IS long and talky for a superhero show. Hail Hydra. (Jack Kirby- who, along with Joe Simon, CREATED Captain America- also created a far more interesting character late in his comic book career- OMAC, The One-Man Army Corps, set 'in the world that's coming.' It's almost prescient, OMAC. It's set 'in the era of the Super Rich,' when a rich man can literally rent an entire city and populate it with hired assassins. You can also upgrade and get 'new bodies for old.' There's also Brother Eye in the sky, and the Global Peace Agency. Sound plausible...?)",7,0,1,27 April 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Malingering malady...
","FULL METAL JACKET suffers from the same malady that plagued the even less well-realized FROM DUSK TIL DAWN (the first one): the first half is interesting enough to hold one's attention, while the second half is all over the road. What makes the second half of FULL METAL JACKET nigh intolerable are the clearly contrived scenes (some of the worst, most clearly STAGED scenes you're ever likely to see in a feature film) , coupled with shockingly amateurish performances. The greatest failing of the Great Technician (Kubrick) has always been the on-screen performances of his players: from THE KILLING to FULL METAL JACKET, his films have always relied more on behind-the-scenes TECHNIQUES than on on-screen performances; it's what makes THE SHINING a mediocre movie, and what makes A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, in the final analysis, little more than an exercise in cinematography (long, uncut master shots that play out ever so slowly). Like Dario Argento, Kubrick was more Technician than Storyteller.",6,0,1,8 September 2014
Pacific Rim," Otaku rejoice: Pacific Rim holds true...
","It occurred to me even as I watched it that PACIFIC RIM was a lifelong dream come true: a live-action version of the ASTRO BOY and GIGANTOR cartoons I'd watched as a child, done right. Del Toro doesn't waste a lot of time trying to infuse PACIFIC RIM with the kind of boring, pointless melodrama that most such movies engage in: he gets down to business early on and rarely strays from the program. (The jab at Modern Man's world-destroying efforts is appreciated.) Moviegoers who've waited for a true Summer Blockbuster will walk away satisfied, though the hype surrounding this movie has been a tad on the RESERVED side, if you ask me: considering what we have here- the overall scale of EVERYTHING-, the trailers should've been Longer and even Louder. The fx actually ENHANCE the drama, the way fx always should (but rarely do). If you're a fan of Giant Monster movies or Giant Robot movies or Giant Monsters vs. Giant Robots movies, you're in luck: PACIFIC RIM is now playing.",10,3,10,12 July 2013
Glory," Powerfully poignant...
","It's impossible for me to watch this one without choking up again and again and again- and I've seen it half a dozen times. There aren't a lot of movies that are flawless, but, for me, this is one of them. It works so powerfully on an Emotional level that very little else matters- it's overwhelming. Matthew Broderick as the baby-faced Shaw is matched dramatic moment for dramatic moment by the likes of Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman and Andre Braugher and Cary Elwes- and the gut-wrenching score by James Horner drives home the point(s) further still. In its depiction of the utter INSANITY of War- we see men charging headlong at one another, all of them armed and determined to kill- it's about as accurate a reenactment as one could hope for. And all for what, finally? Nebulous notions of Nationality? Belief systems? Whatever the reason(s), many of those men (and women) believed that they were going on to an even greater GLORY.",10,1,1,16 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Clone of the Drones, half dozen of the other...
","Episode 5 (or is it 2 of 9? I never was any good at Algebra...), THE ATTIC OF THE DRONES, is the quintessential STAR WARS entry. It has everything, from a beginning to a middle to a cliffhanger ending. When Queen Armadillo falls for Annie Highwalker- or was it the other guy, Onliwun Canoli?- the movie threatens to appeal to a more mature audience than the previous 4 entries put together (or has there really been only 1? I'm still a bit fuzzy on this point, as well...). Not to worry, though: with Ace Hoodoo, Django Fatts and Master Oduh on the scene, we know it's not going to degenerate into anything even remotely resembling an adult thinkfest. The CGI are literally rollin' right off them CGI conveyor belts as fast as they can be copied and pasted and it don't take long for the Redeye Knights to whip out their laser sabres and commence to cuttin' stuff in twain. Short on story and character (let alone character DEVELOPMENT), Episode 2/5 is long on length (clocking in at around six hours, though it felt MUCH longer) and cgi spfx.

Guess not. What we've got here is a cgi knockoff of a comic book that's actually far superior to the cinematic version. Not that that hasn't happened before: as of late, comic book characters have been regularly getting reamed royally by Hollywood honchos. Even the comic creators themselves don't seem to think twice about tossing their creations to the wolves.

Well, they were right to label this one so. The camera never stops moving. Literally. I actually got motion sickness watching this movie. (I'd heard someone say the same thing about THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but, as I hadn't experienced nausea at either screening I'd attended, I didn't know what to make of the comment. Now I do.) Stepping out into the light of day, I actually felt like I might toss me cookies. That was no reflection on the story (which was moving too fast for me to spot any gaping plot holes) or the acting (which I'm pretty sure there was some, although briefly) or the all-out, non-stop, in-your-face action (of which there was aplenty, much of it shot in close-ups so close that it was hard to tell exactly what was happening- but it was fast, and it was loud, lemme tell you).

","John McTiernan has directed two of my all-time favorite action movies: THE 13th WARRIOR and PREDATOR (DIE HARD is fun, but not one of my top 100). PREDATOR boasts one of the most monstrous creatures to ever appear in a Fright Film- massive and mindless and quite clearly a killing machine that would just as soon KILL you as LOOK at you. I'm referring, of course, to Arnold Schwarzenegger. (Yahahaha. Just joshin' ya.) Like the Sword and Sandal movies of Old, PREDATOR features a bunch of muscle-bound men versus an even larger Monster. Testosterone doth ooze from the very pores of the players as they glisten their way through the jungle to their varied Ends.

I wasn't picky: I ate it all up, every title by every publisher I could get my hands on. I see in Rorschach Steve Ditko's faceless hero, THE QUESTION (a back-up feature in the resurrected and overhauled BLUE BEETLE comic from Charlton Comics) and Nite Owl is a cross between Jerry Siegel's Golden Age hero THE OWL and the Dell reprise of same. (Siegel, you'll recall, in collaboration with artist Joe Schuster, took inspiration from Phil Wylie's hero in the pulp novel THE GLADIATOR and co-created Superman, thereby giving birth to the superhero comic in America. Siegel also created another favorite of mine, THE SPECTRE.) Dr. Manhattan is a cross between CAPTAIN ATOM (another Charlton hero rendered by Ditko), Gold Key's DR. SOLAR, MAN OF THE ATOM, and Marvel's long-suffering cosmic hero, THE SILVER SURFER. The Comedian suggests THE PEACEMAKER, another Charlton Comics character (I remember art by Pat Boyette). I can't recall a female hero from the Charlton line that might've inspired The Silk Spectre, but she reminds me of a Golden Age hero called PHANTOM LADY (down to her costume). Ozymandius is, of course, the fabled Kryptonian himself (I'm guessing). The Minute Men could've stepped straight from the covers of a hundred Golden Age comics. One of the ironies of a movie like THE WATCHMEN is that it revolves around (and borrows liberally from) comic book characters that, until now, have had no screen time. Not on the big screen, nor the small. (And the handful of heroes we've seen on television over the years have, for the most part, been badly done- heroes like Prince Namor (that's 'Roman' spelled backwards), who surfaced as THE MAN FROM ATLANTIS; BATMAN ('nuff said there); THE FLASH (saddled with a sidekick); THE SWAMP THING (who became, like THE HULK, a kind of wandering social worker); Superman in SMALLVILLE (whereupon he doesn't even wear the costume that, to my mind, makes every hero one in spirit with the likes of Muhammad Ali or The Red Baron: 'Here I am, come and get me!'- the raison d'etre of crimefighters, this willingness to stand up and say to Evil: 'You gotta get by me, first!'); WONDER WOMAN (though it's hard to fault their choice for the lead); etc. About the best that can be said of televised super-heroics is that there have been some decent animated shows done over the years- but, wth the exception of the George Reeves series, nothing of lasting value when it comes to live-action. (I'm talking about super heroes, here, and not ZORRO with Guy Williams or THE SCARECROW with the late Patrick McGoohan or THE LONE RANGER with Clayton Moore, or any other such non-super hero.) Feature films have been far better, overall, but, even there, the pickings are still pretty slim. The graphic novel series MARVELS would be a good way to introduce a number of heroes at once (the original combustible-android HUMAN TORCH, Bill Everette's SUB-MARINER, THE VISION, DR. STRANGE, et al), or KINGDOM COME (THE SPECTRE, MARTIAN MANHUNTER, THE CREEPER, DEADMAN, THE JUSTICE SOCIETY, etc.). ASTRO CITY would be a good choice, too. Or the Tower Comics (DYNAMO, NO MAN, etc., by Wally Wood) or MAGICMAN from FORBIDDN WORLDS or NEXUS- or Russ Manning's MAGNUS, ROBOT FIGHTER and Frank Thorne's MIGHTY SAMSON from Gold Key (not to mention TUROK, SON OF STONE, which featured Indians vs. dinosaurs and cavemen); or TERMINAL CITY... I could go on, but the point has been made. THE WATCHMEN is (and I'm still flush from having seen it, for what that's worth) the greatest realization of a comic book universe I've ever seen. The music beautifully underscores both the action and the dramatic twists and turns throughout; visually, it's simply stunning (the trailers on television do not do it justice); there's not a single bad performance- not one, from the Highest to the Lowest player. The direction could not be improved upon. Sex, politics, and rock and roll- all in one dynamite movie. You gotta see this one.",10,0,2,11 March 2009
The Killing Fields," 'The Nixon Doctrine in its purest form...'
","Ironies abound in THE KILLING FIELDS. 'Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine in its purest form,' boasts one of the twentieth century's greatest war criminals (who himself lived a long and happy life, thereby putting the lie to any and all notions of karma). The Vietnam War, we're told, resulted in 3 million deaths (70-80% of all casualties were civilian). Does that total factor in the Cambodians who were murdered in the war's 'aftermath?' (90% of all deaths in Iraq were civilian, by the way. Evidence has now come to light that the U.$. actually AIDED Saddam Hussein when he used chemical weapons against the Kurds in Iraq. That's right: the same government threatening to bomb Syria back into The Stone Age actually had an active part in the mass murder of Kurdish civilians. Or was it IRANIANS, during the Iran-Iraq War? 'Six of one, half dozen of the other,' U.$. politicos might say, but the distinction DOES matter, especially if you're Iranian or Kurdish... I may be wrong about the Kurdish murders, but I'm not going to change my comments until I see some paperwork showing otherwise. And there are 30,000 drones in the skies over the U.$., even as I write...) Another of the ironies is what happened to Haing S. Ngor (Dith Pran in THE KILLING FIELDS) after he came to the U.$.: having survived genocide in Cambodia, he was murdered here, in the street. Maybe THIS is the true Killing Field.",8,0,0,26 August 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Lock, stock and barrel...
","Hype is the name of the game, and even the best of us sometimes fall for it; I did, when I read the plethora of glowing reviews of this movie. Did no one else notice the cheesy effects, the deadening performances, the often lackluster direction...? The movie has its moments, but mere moments do not a three hour film make. When it's not dragging along like a crippled animal, it's dashing headlong like a video game gone haywire. And that, I think, is the audience at which this one is aimed: the 'shut-in' kids who spend most of their time (and tons of money) on video games and the ilk. Certainly it's not geared toward mature viewers, who quickly grow bored with the paper-thin plot (Tolkein has never been mistaken for a writer of great literary worth) and the even thinner film-making sleight-of-hand that Jackson employs. (I was genuinely shocked by some of the downright dunderheaded things the filmmakers tried to get away with when it came to fx- from incorrectly aligning composite images, to cheesy video game fx that never even come close to passing muster, to the use of what are quite clearly children in wide shots showing hobbits and humans and elves together.) I could go on, but there's really no point: the film is a financial success, and that's all that Jackson and company are concerned about, anyway. (Reminding me in that respect of Ridley Scott, a once promising director reduced now to making movies like the godawful HANNIBAL, who boldly proclaimed in one nationally televised interview, that he no longer cared what anyone else thought of his films.) One would do well to remember one thing: even if a million people say a stupid thing, it is still a stupid thing.",5,0,0,8 January 2002
Man of Steel," Puts the Super in Superman...
","DIRTY WARS wasn't playing, and neither was HARVEST OF EMPIRE, so I opted for MAN OF STEEL. (Oddly enough, there was a Wal-Mart promo before the film, but no mention of the 1,127 sweat shop workers killed in Bangladesh.) MAN OF STEEL is better than I thought it would be, though some of the casting (of Perry White and Lois Lane) is questionable and the whole ode to our Military Industrial Government is more than a little off-putting. The fx, however, are truly stunning (especially in 3D) and the slugfest that comprises the bulk of the movie should satisfy any vidiot with a first-person shooter game at home (though it drags on WAY too long for my tastes). Worthy of note also are the several genuinely dramatic moments that occur throughout the film that lend it a timeless resonance; if some of those scenes don't leave a lump in your throat, consider yourself beyond all hope (the director has a deft way of milking a dramatic moment for all it's worth)- and the film DOES manage to convincingly convey the sense of SPEED and POWER of the Greatest Superhero of All Time. Director Snyder has done The Man of Steel justice. As a lifelong fan, I came away satisfied. More or less.",7,1,10,13 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," Better than the original...
","The first extended preview I saw of this one (featuring Robert Carlyle's less-than-heroic bid for an infection-free existence) was the proverbial 'grabber.' As adept at the dramatic as the funny (THE FULL MONTY had me rolling in the aisle), Carlyle was inspired casting and his all-out performance proves most satisfying (the filmmakers don't punk out when it comes down to the nitty and the gritty, either). For the first time since David Cronenberg's RABID, one gets the uneasy feeling of what it might actually be like to get caught up in a siege situation in a major metropolitan city- and, also like RABID, 28 WEEKS LATER manages to convey this sense of foreboding with a minimal 'show of force,' as it were: the handful of rooftop snipers (voyeurs, who spy on their charges with telescopic sights at night), the solitary helicopter hovering over it all, the armed guards who usher the herds of humanity on to their holding pens, etc. Like 28 DAYS LATER, 28 WEEKS LATER makes the most of not a whole lot (by Hollywood standards) and proves, yet again, that imagination and talent can go a long way. It would be interesting to see what these filmmakers could do with a book like THE NIGHT RIDERS by M. Kelley (an Xlibris book about... well, read it and see). I can hardly wait for 28 MONTHS LATER...",10,0,3,23 May 2007
The Thing," The pinnacle...
","The critical response to THE THING was par for the course: having been brainwashed by kiddie corn like E.T., they could hardly be expected to view objectively what has turned out to be a timeless masterpiece. From an opening evocative of any of a number of 50's sci-fi schlockers (not to mention the closing moments of Carpenter's DARK STAR, itself) to an ambiguous though not unsatisfying ending, it's clear that this masterfully macabre monsterpiece is a bona fide tour de force- a coup de grace, par excellence.The 50's version, which plays out more like the James Whale FRANKENSTEIN, pales by comparison. Carpenter is a meticulous craftsman (he has contemporaries, but no peer) and, for those of us who like our flights of fancy tempered with a bit of storytelling, he does not disappoint: by simply returning to the source material and notching up the suspense in his patented manner, he and scenarist Bill Lancaster have fashioned a claustrophobic chiller that plays the e-t incognito exactly the way it should've been played the first time around. The players, to a man, are excellent. Carpenter's overriding concern is clearly this band of enjoyably eccentric misfits and their reactions to the malevolent monster in their midst. He navigates the tight rope between fantasy and reality like an expert. (Which he is: this is his frightening forte.) The 'thing' itself is truly the stuff of which nightmares are made: the movie showcases, without catering to, some marvelous mechanical makeup effects by master monster maker Rob Bottin. Under Carpenter's artistic aegis, these effects are utilized as dramatically as possible. If there's another candidate in the running for greatest monster movie of all time, I haven't seen it. Nothing else comes close.",10,5,11,4 February 2005
The Orphanage," Stunning...
","Some of the finest fright films are deeply moving. Can one help but feel for Chaney, Sr., as either Eric, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, or Quasimodo, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME? What about KING KONG (in any version, including the often laughable De Laurentis entry)? Recently, of course, movies like 28 DAYS LATER, THIRTY DAYS OF NIGHT and THE MIST (among others) have proved emotionally powerful and dramatically satisfying. Now comes THE ORPHANAGE, with one of the saddest of happy endings I've ever seen in my life. I don't think I've cried this much since I saw THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD (which, for my money, is hands-down the greatest love story ever made). What a directorial debut! If Bayona can top this one, he's in a very select company, indeed.",10,2,5,23 November 2008
The Shining," Good, but vastly overrated...
","Kubrick's craftsmanship speaks for itself- but his greatest strength was definitely TECHNICAL (as opposed to artistic). Case in point: THE SHINING. Superior cinematography, to be sure... but not much else. Cold and uninvolving, THE SHINING has the dubious distinction of being an overblown technical exercise with some of the worst performances of all time. Casting is partially to blame: when Jack Nicholson first appears on screen, eyebrows arched and making comments that can't help but seem somehow snide, one can only think: 'This ----------er is crazy.' He OOZES Crazy from every pore. Shelley Duvall is so miscast that she looks like she's on the wrong PLANET. And don't get me started on The Kid. Only Joe Turkel seems reasonably comfortable in his part, but he isn't given enough to do to make any real difference whatsoever. Kubrick was a great Technician, but when it comes to a genre as visceral as Horror, he simply didn't have what it takes.",7,0,2,10 September 2010
"I, Robot"," MAGNUS, ROBOT FIGHTER all over again...
","Because it was directed by the man who gave us THE CROW (but who also gave us DARK CITY), I allowed myself to be talked into going to see this one. Had I only had the fortitude to stand my ground... I didn't expect much, so when I found myself watching what amounts to a Big Screen steal of Russ Manning's MAGNUS, ROBOT FIGHTER (with a dash of Richard Corben's superbly satirical MANGLE, ROBOT MANGLER thrown into the mix), I was more than a little bit surprised. My first reaction when I heard that I, ROBOT would finally be brought to the big screen was outright joy: I'd read Harlan Ellison's script (based on the stories by Isaac Asimov) and I was eagerly looking forward to seeing THAT particular dream realized, at long last. Imagine my disillusionment when I saw the cardboard standee touting this 'coming attraction.' We've had more than enough mindless sci-fi foisted off on us these past three decades; it's about time somebody in Hollywoodland wised up and started cranking out something worth seeing.",2,1,1,2 February 2005
Apocalypse Now," From film-making apocalypse to redux to complete dossier...
","Every few years, now, we're presented with another APOCALYPSE NOW update. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Being a big fan of the film from its opening day, I gobble up every new tidbit of information that comes my way (my copy of NOTES is near The End of its usefulness as a source of info: it's about to fall apart). A FILMMAKER'S APOCALYPSE was chock full of newsworthy bits, as was the REDUX (which, with the exception of the ghostly French Plantation sequence, only proved that Coppola had been right all along to excise the scenes he'd excised). More interesting still is the COMPLETE DOSSIER. From day one, I'd wondered about two characters in particular who seemed to have vanished into thin air in the movie: the 'Colby' character played by Scott Glenn and the gonzo photographer played by Dennis Hopper. Here, at long last, we have our answer. It's about time.",Null,0,1,2 September 2007
The Battle of Algiers," Inside and outside...
","Although in the final analysis there's just a single 'side' (we're all, like it or not, made of the same stuff- to the very core), it can be- and has been, interminably- argued that there's an inside and an outside (especially if you're a politician or a religious fanatic). 'Place your bets,' someone says at one point in THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS. That one statement says much (too much, perhaps) about wars like this one. The bottom line is, all too often, the bottom line (and nobody knows that as well as Americans: in this country, money not only Talks, it clearly Walks- especially when one is forced to ante up in the hallowed halls of Justice, which can be an expensive proposition, indeed). The opening sequence with the guillotine lends a Grand Guignol ghoulishness to the proceedings. Evenhanded film-making? Perhaps. As someone posits along the way, 'Men have two faces.' Two men, therefore, have four faces. Some of the carnage here has all the objectiveness of newsreels, and THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS certainly manages to capture the feel of a city (and two Peoples) under siege. (The claustrophobic interior shots involving explosions are truly amazing; it's a miracle no one was killed.) When the soldiers (whose bullying has forced fed-up civilians to strike back) opt to 'make their own opportunities,' by way of torture no less ('Legality can be inconvenient.'), one can't help but lament- again- the timeliness of this movie. Excellent guerilla film-making.",10,1,2,17 November 2007
Van Helsing," SOLOMON KANE rip-off...
","Anyone familiar with Robert E. Howard's SOLOMON KANE will recognize VAN HELSING for what it is: a rip-off, plain and simple (with emphasis on the 'simple'). The prologue, which promised much, fizzled miserably much too soon and proved, unfortunately, a portent of things to come. While I must confess I thought Jackman was great in the two X-MEN movies, he seems miscast here: the director might just as well have stood a mannequin before the camera; it would've been cheaper, I'm sure-and the overall effect would've been about the same. And the awful cgi only make matters worse: the movie virtually(!) turns into a video game whenever anything remotely interesting starts to happen, with fx so cheesy that one wonders why the producers didn't simply render the entire feature thus. Why bother with live action at all if you're that gung-ho for computer graphics? TOY STORY and SHREK (among others) have confirmed the viability of cgi features. Anyone out there familiar with anime...? Or, say, Richard Corben's DEN- a series of stories that would lend themselves readily to this particular form? There's a veritable plethora of untapped material floating around that would make good cgi fodder. Dispense with the flesh-and-blood folks and get busy with some real animation, if that's what you're interested in doing...",3,1,2,2 February 2005
Monsters vs. Aliens," For kids of all ages...
","Bridging the 'Generation Gap' isn't easy- especially not in this, 'the age of the computer.' This month's Flavor of the Month is next month's washed up has-been: the Darling of the Media, adored and idolized one moment, is vilified and pilloried the next. MONSTERS VS. ALIENS pays homage to two of the most often vilified and pilloried genres of them all: horror and science fiction films. In so doing, it manages to bridge the aforementioned gap. While longtime fans of the genre(s) will pick up on and greatly appreciate the references, the tots will marvel at (and no doubt appreciate) the state-of-the-art visuals. A lovely movie, from first to last. Can't wait for the sequel.",10,1,2,11 January 2010
Spider-Man," A mixed bag...
","***SPOILERS*** While it's more or less faithful to its source material, Sam Raimi's Big Screen treatment of SPIDER-MAN often teeters on the verge of outright idiocy. How, for instance, could Peter Parker drag a lunch tray around a high school cafeteria, in front of scores of witnesses, with webbing shot from his wrists... and not be found out??? These lapses in logic (which occur throughout the film) work against the powerful, poignant moments that give the movie its emotional resonance. Nor does it help that the movie often drags laboriously along like Raimi's infamous FOR LOVE OF THE GAME. The fx vacillate between real-life believability and video game cheesiness of the LORD OF THE RINGS variety. On the plus side, there are the performances and a sometimes beautifully moving script and superb cinematography and sets and music and touches of directorial brilliance (as with DARKMAN and much else he's done, Raimi distinguishes himself here as a very capable filmmaker when it comes to fx-heavy material). SPIDER-MAN is a mixed bag, to be sure, but it's definitely worth the price of admission.",6,0,0,4 May 2002
The Machinist," Andersonville...
","***SPOILERS*** When the unbelievable horrors of the Andersonville prison camp were made known following The Civil War (a most un-civil affair), the survivors looked not unlike Christian Bale in this movie; same reason(s), too (near starvation). There have been actors whose performances have hinged, to one degree or another, on their appearances (and I'm not talking here about 'glamorous' looks; I'm talking, of course, about the chameleon-like transformations of actors like Robert DeNiro in RAGING BULL or John Hurt in THE ELEPHANT MAN, to cite but two). Nothing that has come before (so far as I can recall, with the possible exception of documentary footage of German concentration camp survivors) can prepare the viewer for Bale's appearance; it's that unsettling. Having stressed out for years while driving a taxi at night in a city acrawl with crack-heads, I can relate to the sleeplessness that plagues the machinist (said stress contributing, in the end, to a heart attack in my own case and quintuple bypass heart surgery). Guilt is the dagger of the mind (so Shakespeare tells us in MACBETH and Poe in THE TELL-TALE HEART). If you're interested in gritty, often surreal film-making (the music, which sounds a lot like the music from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, helps set the tone, as it were), don't miss THE MACHINIST.",10,1,2,26 January 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not so amazing...
","It IS amazing that every filmmaker who comes down the pike feels the need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the origin story of the superhero whose franchise they've just taken over; that's known as needlessly spinning one's wheels. What's even more surprising is when the origin has been done so often that viewers know it by rote, but the latest director to take up the reins fouls it all up. That's what happens here: it's almost as if English weren't even their SECOND language. I mean, how hard can it be to rechew one's cud (which is pretty much all these remakes are, anyway)? There are some neat fx shots, but little else (and WHERE did they get this kid, anyway- was he somebody's nephew or something? What were his credentials?). THE NOT-SO-AMAZING SPIDER-MAN has to be one of the weakest Big Budget superhero movies to come down the pike since The Big Boom began. You'd think that the money men could make better choices.",1,0,15,15 June 2013
The Exorcist," One of the truly Great love stories...
","Sure, it scared the bejeezus outta me when I was a kid (I literally couldn't close my eyes that night without seeing THAT FACE or hearing THAT VOICE), but one of the things I've always found most interesting about THE EXORCIST is that it's one of the truly great love stories. Father Karras sacrifices himself in the end out of love. His doubts about his religious beliefs aside, the ending proves that the man hasn't lost his innate love of Humanity: he's willing to trade HIS life for the girl's. In a fright film as powerful as this one, that's one hell of an affirmation. The re-release, which contained the previously excised 'spider' scene, was well worth seeing (though I still can't figure out why it was cut in the first place): it's hands down one of the scariest things I've ever seen; the sound effects alone were worth the price of admission. Unlike the re-edited versions of THE WARRIORS (in which Walter Hill totally ruins the break-neck pace of the movie) or THE OUTSIDERS (in which Copolla drowns out the drama with gratuitous music) or BLADE RUNNER (in seven re-edits of which Ridley Scott makes not one substantial change) or APOCALYPSE NOW (which was edited right the first time) or JAWS (in which Spielberg has Scheider as Brody idiotically saying 'Blow up!' as the shark makes its final charge) or STAR WARS (in which George Lucas mistakenly thought that making Han Solo faster than a speeding bullet was a good idea- which completely undercut the character's character) or any one of a number of other 're-dos,' the restored version of THE EXORCIST IS worth a look.",10,2,3,28 May 2013
Tropic Thunder," A real blast...
","It's a fine line, indeed, the one between comedy and drama. Or between unintentional comedies that would be dramas. First and foremost, there's Robert Downey in blackface and Ben Stiller in whiteface; and then there's Danny McBride (he of THE FOOT FIST WAY, another comedy I would recommend), whose pyrotechnic expertise proves pivotal (though he labors under the misconception here that he has 'blinded Jamie Lee Curtis' somewhere along the way)- and the kid, Brandon Soo Hoo, who is spot-on as the terrible Golden Triangle tyke. First rate in every respect (Stiller proves himself a director to be reckoned with), TROPIC THUNDER gets under the skin of the Hollywood Blockbuster like nothing I've ever seen- and does it with just enough of a mix of drama and humor to make it effective. (Would a drama have been half as good? We've seen funny war movies before- TOP SECRET!, the Chuck Norris and Sly Stallone films, to rattle off but a few-, but when was the last time that a comedy took us so deeply into the Heart of a FILMMAKER'S Darkness...?) McBride's rescue of his fellow filmmakers could be viewed as a metaphor for the way fx guys have been 'saving' movies in Hollywoodland for years, now. Even funnier than the movie itself is the DVD commentary with Lincoln Osiris. Checker out.",10,1,2,4 January 2009
No Country for Old Men," The operation was a success...
","One of Hitchcock's tenets of good Cinema was that the filmmaker must never cheat the moviegoer; must never leave the audience wanting. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN does just that, repeatedly. While the technical aspects are topnotch all around, the telling of the story leaves more than just a little to be desired. Resolution? Yeah, right. Wonky Woody Harrelson's 'baccer-chewin' cowpoke stands out like a sore thumb in such close proximity as it is to so many so much better, and Brolin literally falls by the wayside in one of the lamest twists I do believe I've ever witnessed in a major motion pitcher. (Hitchcockian only in the PSYCHO sense, it's one of the major reasons I rate this one no higher than a six on the scale of one to ten.) Tommy Lee Jones is great, but being sidelined as he is makes his performance little more than incidental.",6,8,13,6 January 2008
District 9," Half-baked hybrid...
","The first trailer I saw for DISTRICT 9 I totally ignored: I thought it was just another in the seemingly endless stream of TV ads for video games. Come to find out, I wasn't far off in my assessment. Ripping off everything from ALIEN NATION to THE FLY (the David Cronenberg version), DISTRICT 9 is nothing more than a disjointed jumble of hyperactive cgi. The easily-pleased are awestruck by the video game cgi; viewers looking for something even marginally original, however, are left wanting. As this is being written, James Cameron's AVATAR is wowing videots the world over. They marvel at the fx, but bemoan the 'stupid storyline.' Thanks to movies like STAR WARS, American filmmakers have been banking on the fx guys to carry the burden for decades. (No reason to stop now.)

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Slow-moving filler...
","THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG boasts some of the most beautiful locations I've ever laid eyes on- and some truly unbelievable sets. Unfortunately, that's about all. This is clearly filler between parts Last and Next, and it's also the biggest information dump I think I've ever seen in my life. Characters are introduced one after another so fast that it's nigh impossible to keep track of who's who- and the inter-cutting between The Quest and The Rest does absolutely nothing to make matters clearer. In fact, this constant cutting back and forth effectively undermines any attempt(s) at building suspense; there is NONE whatsoever. And Bilbo's big confrontation with Smaug is milked for far, far more than its worth: by the time the movie abruptly ends, it's almost impossible to give a s--- one way or the other. At two and a half hours, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG offers more Gab than anything else.",4,1,1,16 July 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Partners in paranoia...
","An unusually thoughtful meditation on murder, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD BOB FORD cleverly sidesteps most of the gun play that made the James-Younger gang so (in)famous and focuses instead on the cult of personality and the debilitating power of paranoia. While Brad Pitt as the cobra-calm eye of the storm more than holds his own, the nail-biting performances by both Casey Affleck and Sam Rockwell give this one an edge-of-your-seat tension that is, for the most part, unrelieved. Their paranoia, ratcheted slowly to the nth degree, results finally in the foregone conclusion (see the title)- but doesn't stop there. The film follows through (as did the far more stylized TOMBSTONE, several years ago) on the aftermath of the gun play. Though there's very little in the way of actual gun play, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES is yet another notable notch on Hollywood's figurative six-shooter.",10,2,5,22 March 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Overall, not bad...
","THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is frankly one of the better entries in this series- for the most part. However... when our heroes fall afoul of the goblins, the computers take over and we're once again dashing headlong up and down a virtual roller-coaster ride that almost undoes all that's been carefully established prior to this. There's absolutely no suspense- much less drama- when it comes to the gravity-defying cgi. Better to have given us a handful of PRACTICAL effects and a suspenseful hunt through darkened caverns than what we see here. And it's bad enough that the cgi are employed so heavily in the chase- but then they're used in the follow-up scene as well, so that we end up with two back-to-back video sequences that lack- again- any real suspense or any drama at all. Still, I'm giving the movie an 8 out of 10 because the scenes leading up to the cartoon parts are good.",8,0,2,4 December 2013

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Cgi simians rule...
","This 'reimagining' of CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES owes as much to the telemovie A COLD NIGHT'S DEATH and PROJECT X (and 28 DAYS LATER and 12 MONKEYS, among others) as it does to the Arthur P. Jacobs films. Much of what we see here was unimaginable in Jacobs's day- which is exactly what a 'reimagining' should strive to do. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES goes where no Apes movie has gone before, with what John Collier in his 1931 novel HIS MONKEY WIFE called 'the suggestion that the kingdom of Heaven and Earth was at hand.' In a world where a monkey's head was successfully transplanted to another body (in the early 1970s, by a Dr. White) and where signing apes like Koko the gorilla have actually developed their own words (and where, we've just learned, 2700 new records for high temperatures have been broken in July of this year alone), ANYTHING is possible. 'An opportunity soon came,' Collier wrote in 1931... (On a field trip, once, my class visited the Washington Zoo. There, I saw a caged gorilla. I walked up to the bars and stood staring in at him. He froze; snarled- and then began screaming at the top of his lungs and bouncing off the walls. It was the scariest thing I think I've ever seen in my life. Take it from me: the LAST thing you want to see is an enraged gorilla all up in your grille...) One of the more curious aspects of RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is that, for all the carnage, it's almost BLOODLESS (unlike the original version, which was considered kiddie fare and therefore a bit TOO bloody). All things considered, it's a worthy 'reimagining.' Great Apes, indeed.",10,10,18,6 August 2011
JFK," Stone's stones...
","If there's one thing Oliver Stone doesn't lack, it's GUTS. He speaks his mind, and stands behind what he says; you can't ask for more than that. JFK is an absorbing account of one of the more heinous criminal acts of the 20th century (everything that followed, as Stone has observed, has been a Backward Progression). The recent book by Thom Hartmann collaborator Lamar Waldron, THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF THE JFK ASSASSINATION, gives us yet another detailed look at the murder, based in part on FBI wiretaps of the Mafioso allegedly involved. It's been suggested, too, that a rookie Secret Service man accidentally fired the fatal shot that killed Kennedy. Until the million or so pages of classified information about the assassination are made public, speculation is all we really have. I have my own theory, of course: the man on the grassy knoll was none other than Joe DeMaggio.",10,2,9,21 November 2013
Django Unchained," Django's djunk...
","No one to blame but myself for giving this one a look; got just what I deserved, too. Unlike, say, GHOST DOG: WAY OF THE SAMURAI or THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS, DJANGO UNCHAINED doesn't seem as much like a filmmaker paying homage to what has come before as grave robbing. Sure, everybody does it, but the two aforementioned movies were done with a bit more genuine love, it seems, than this one. Scenes drag on interminably (THIS script won an Academy Award???), which is bad enough, but my biggest gripe has to be the PERFORMANCES. I don't know who the lead actor is (nor do I care), but he reminded me of the actors in movies like THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVERA and SIX STRING SAMURAI: he's clearly an actor doing his lines- nothing more; we never, at any point in the pointless proceedings, feel like he IS the character. The scene where we see Django's djunk was more than a tad odd: the actor holding said djunk does so gently, and releases the djunk carefully. I'd be willing to bet that that was co-star Jaime Foxx's favorite day on the set... (Ah, to be cradled in the loving hands of a caring director...)",1,29,50,14 May 2013
Bolt," Smitten with Mittens...
","Just one of the unfortunate consequences of so many home foreclosures over the past couple of years in this country has been the abandonment of household pets. It's not a happy story, nor one that gets a whole lot of coverage. (It happens to have happened to my sister.) For a Disney film to even touch upon this subject is surprising (LADY AND THE TRAMP notwithstanding)- and commendable. My favorite of The Three Mouseketeers is, of course, the streetwise Mittens: her sad little tale of woe, blurted suddenly in a moment of emotional vulnerability, is enough to make this one of the more memorable animated features of the past several decades, and it gives the movie its considerable Emotional Impact. I honestly don't remember the last time I choked up watching a cartoon cat spill its emotional guts. A tip of the hat to all involved: you blew ME away, anyway.",10,2,3,26 April 2009
Ghost Rider," Better than I'd expected...
","Due in no small part to its sometimes self-effacing humor, GHOST RIDER rolls along at a pretty brisk clip and is very, very rarely (despite what you might've heard to the contrary) tedious going. Nicholas Cage sometimes has a way of making potential misfires sure hits (or near misses- although even he couldn't make the remake of THE WICKER MAN worth sitting through); his just-a-hint-of-Elvis delivery helps. Eva's cleavage is mighty danged impressive, no doubt about it, but the real star of this one- make no mistake about it- is Cage. The way the story ties into the original GHOST RIDER mythos is likewise noteworthy (fellow comic fans will feel the urge to clap and cheer, I'm sure: I did, and I've read very few of the 'reincarnated' GHOST stories). Don't make the mistake of passing on this one: it's supernatural superhero fun on a grand scale. I can't wait to see THE SPECTRE and DEADMAN on the Big Screen...",8,5,8,22 March 2007
The Lives of Others," A sad Doomocratic sonata...
","The stated goal of the Stasi- 'To know everything.'- speaks for itself... because only a fool thinks he knows everything. 'You should choose your words more carefully,' Herr Hempf ominously warns a comrade who mentions blacklisting in THE LIVES OF OTHERS. But who watches The Watchers...? In a Doomocracy (wherein you're doomed if you do and doomed if you don't), that's the rub. (And I can't help but think about Harlan Ellison's 'REPENT, HARLEQUIN!' SAID THE TICKTOCK MAN.') 'Can anyone who has heard this music... really be a bad person?' Oh, yeah: one can Hear without Listening. Happens all the time (in this country, of late). 'I'm your audience,' herr Eavesdropper tells his subject at one point. The irony is that the voyeur, Wiesler, has become the Final Arbiter. THE LIVES OF OTHERS is a powerfully written eulogy for the buyers and sellers of souls. There.",10,3,4,17 November 2007
Hellboy," Mike Mignola's Monster...
","In celebration of HELLBOY's 20th anniversary, our local comic shop (Fanboy Comics) arranged a screening of both HELLBOY movies at a post-production screening room and it was well worth the effort: the ONLY way to appreciate these kind of movies is to see them up on The Big Screen; even the new, larger format flatscreen televisions don't really do them justice. The production values of the two HELLBOY movies are mind-boggling, to say the least, and Ron Perlman was the perfect choice to play Mr. Boy. The introduction of a character not in the original comics was one of the sticking points I always had with the first movie (filmmakers always seem to need to have 'someone the audience can relate to' in a fantasy film, but they're usually wrong about that- as they were with both THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE CROW, to mention but two of the fantasies that bog down in the 'Real World'). Still, the fx are stellar- and I can't wait to see what Del Toro does with THE HULK.",8,0,0,4 April 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Fantastic journey...
","Just thought I'd drop you a few lines to let you know we're back from our vacation. This year, we went to Middle Earth. Spent two wonderful days with a remarkable tour guide, a gentleman named Peter Jackson. He's well-versed in the lore of the region, and never once bored us with his take on things Tolkein. We traversed terrain the likes of which we never imagined existed. The locals were a colorful lot, and quite unforgettable- in particular, a fellow mostly skin and bones who went about on all fours and wore nothing more than a wash-rag loincloth. (I daresay the chap wasn't quite all there, as he was often overheard conversing with himself.) The countryside literally came alive for us as we travelled. Reminded me somewhat of our trip to Oz.Well, I must be off. Here's hoping you're the same.",10,0,0,10 April 2003
The Incredibles," Fantastic Foursome...
","It's hard to believe that it's been a decade since I saw this one... The trailer that showed the long-retired Mr. Incredible trying to fit into his old costume was what hooked me; I'd written a story for the American Zoetrope website about a decade before that dealt with the exact same thing- only without the humor. Being a lifelong comic book fan (whenever money permitted), I recognized The Fantastic Four the moment I saw them (although, to be fair, Mr. Fantastic was actually preceded in comics by Jack Cole's Plastic Man and The Human Torch before he became Human was an android capable of setting himself alight). The opening scenes establish that THE INCREDIBLES Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were just two among MANY Supers who roamed the land before a lawsuit brought them all down (a lawsuit, we learn, that was the result of fanboy 'Incrediboy' interfering in Mr. Incredible's attempt to stop the dastardly Bomb Voyage from blowing up a building)- and all of this en route to Mr. Incredible's wedding to Elastigirl... The disenfranchised Supers shoe-horn themselves into 'normal' society, but each and every one of them is chomping at the bit to get back into costume. Meanwhile, the evil Syndrome is making plans to destroy Mr. Incredible. Will he succeed? Next issue: The Shocking Answer!!!",10,1,1,17 July 2014
The Mist," EffectSive filmmaking...
","This one just happens to be based on my all-time favorite Stephen King story, and it doesn't disappoint. (Well, there IS one moment early in the movie- the scene where Thomas Jane as the hero is trying to hang onto a stock boy who's being pulled through the loading dock door by a tentacled monster- where Jane's plea for help is oddly flat, without any sense of urgency, but that one small moment- pivotal though it may be- can be overlooked when one sums up the totality of the movie.) Having spent far too many lonely nights stocking shelves in supermarkets (and watching rats in the stock rooms nibble and urinate on bags of rice), I found the setting inspired. (I felt the same way, having worked in warehouses most of my life, when I read GRAVEYARD SHIFT.) The cgi actually make sense in THE MIST: Practical Effects might not have been as convincing, as insects tend to move very quickly, although the preponderance of mist and darkness would've lent themselves very well to Practical Effects. One of my favorite lines comes after the biker-type has been torn in half and Marcia Harden as a bible-spouting religious fanatic begins to cause some un-needed trouble. Says Jane: 'I'd like to leave before people start drinking the Kool-Aid.' This is exactly what I'd intended to do in a year-long serial story I submitted to a local paper- to be titled THE STORM-, but the story wasn't selected. The pharmacy run is fast-paced and effective, with almost non-stop action, but it's the subsequent scene, wherein we learn that the military had discovered a 'view' into 'another dimension' (called 'The Arrowhead Project') that's the cause of all the trouble, that things start to come to a boil. This sets up the stunning ending, which has to be one of the greatest twist endings in the history of Horror Movies. THE MIST has it all. Highly recommended.",10,2,6,24 October 2014
The Elephant Man," Quintessential Lynch...
","FREAKS was the undoing of director Tod Browning; it touched a nerve, let's say. THE ELEPHANT MAN, not unlike FREAKS, touches a nerve or two, as well. And it's quintessential David Lynch. I was already a fan by the time THE ELEPHANT MAN saw release: I'd seen ERASERHEAD at several Midnight showings and had hunted down and seen on a college campus two of his shorts, THE ALPHABET and THE GRANDMOTHER. Going in, I was pretty sure I knew what to expect. I was wrong. Eschewing the surrealistic touches that made his previous endeavors so quintessentially quirky, he opted this time around to tell a straightforward tale of the Human Heart. 'Abominable things, these machines,' Hopkins as Treves says when first we meet him, treating a burn victim: 'You can't reason with them.' In ERASERHEAD, the dark, industrial landscape through which Jack Nance as Henry moves is every bit as uncompromising as the Industrial England of Merrick's time. This integration of the Industrial with the Human would continue full blown in DUNE and, to a much lesser degree, in TWIN PEAKS- which boasted an 'industrial soundtrack.' David Cronenberg pioneered Biological Horror; Lynch, a type of Twisted Industrial Surrealism. (I wanted to see a Bernie Wrightson black and white comic book adaptation of THE ELEPHANT MAN, but, alas, 'twas not to be.) Feckless politicos here in these so-called 'United' $tate$ could learn a great deal about COMPASSION from the Treves character in THE ELEPHANT MAN.",10,1,1,22 April 2015
I Am Legend," Man vs. virtual vampires...?
","Just when I thought that Michael Bay had cemented forever his place as the king of Second Unit Cinema, along comes I AM LEGEND. $150 million worth of fx- to what end? I've gone back and rated THE OMEGA MAN higher than I had before I saw the (progressively-worsening) trailers for this one. I now see it for the towering achievement it truly is. The Corringtons (who, together, can't hold a candle to the writings of the grandest of the Grand Masters of Horror, Richard Matheson) dumbed down the original story for a 1971 audience and the witless wonders behind this one apparently didn't bother to go back and read the book: they simply used the Corrington script as their jumping off point (if only!). Casting a lead whose credentials are questionable at best didn't help. Opting to turn the vampires of the novel into cgi mutants may've seemed to the filmmakers to be yet another stroke of genius- but it wasn't. By a mile. Only someone whose tastes run to videocy (video game idiocy) could truly appreciate the monsters in this one. (There are some great shots of a deserted New York city- but, with a price tag of $5 million, there ought to be... At the very least.) Dumber even than THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, I AM LEGEND reeks.",3,10,16,19 December 2007
Kick-Ass," Lame-ass...
","In addition to having very probably the dumbest title of all time, not to mention some of the most uninteresting characters ever conceived, KICK-ASS can also boast being The Most Blatant Rip-off Ever. (Not content with just raiding The Bat Cave, the 'creators' of this one even misappropriated Frank Miller's Robin-as-a-girl twist.) Paper-thin characters with an even thinner plot don't add up to much. For the past several decades, comic book writers have been trying to make what's essentially clich√©d kiddie fare- the Masked Hero genre- palatable to 'adults.' One method often employed has been the use of lots of four-letter words (which is about as childish a method as one can imagine)- and sex (see THE PROFESSIONAL). Heroes have been done well before, and will no doubt be done well again, but KICK-ASS is little more than the Candy Ass kind of movie it tries so hard NOT to be.",6,2,9,9 October 2010
The Hurt Locker," Kathryn Bigelow's deft touch...
","THE HURT LOCKER is presented in a matter-of-fact, documentary-like fashion that underscores the average, everyday routine of the hardly average, day-to-day routine of disarming bombs in a war zone. Bigelow DOES pick a side, but any side would do in such a scenario; it's not the Right or Wrong of anything but diffusing an explosive situation (which is a play on words, there, of course; forgive). The faces, totally unfamiliar to me (as, I must confess, are the faces of many of those who've gone and fought in that particular Far Off Land, though not all by any means), make the performances less than the usual Hollywood 'given' performances (and thereby enhances the already heightened suspense). The last shot is absolutely brilliant. See it. But don't forget to keep your head down.",10,2,14,26 February 2010
La Grande Illusion," Feckless...
","Granted, Jean Renoir had yet to experience the long Nazi nacht to come (as his disclaimer on the Criterion disc makes perfectly clear), but, to see an all-singing, all-dancing pro-war film made just prior to same is more than a little mind-boggling. 'I owe these riches to the misfortunes of war,' one of the Upper Crust boasts early on. As well he might: in addition to great accommodations (a castle), there's caviar and vodka and fine clothes (including spit-and-polished uniforms and jackboots); all pilfered from the dead. 'Where there are Germans, there is order.' Uh-huh... Erich Von Stroheim is hilarious as Herr Hermann the Humane. 'I beg you,' he pleads with an escaping prisoner: 'Come down!' When the prisoner refuses, Stroheim reluctantly caps him. 'Forgive me,' he asks the wounded man: 'I aimed at your legs.' 'It was five hundred feet, with poor visibility,' the all-too-forgiving recaptured prisoner replies: 'Besides, I was running...' 'Please, no excuses,' Stroheim persists with a clearly pained expression: 'I was clumsy.' This is just one exchange among many that make THE GRAND DELUSION rife for ribbing. (One can only imagine what the crew of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 could make of this one...) Renoir's contention is that 'The war of 1914 was almost a war of gentlemen.' When escapee Gabin and his buddy, in plain sight of their German pursuers, are allowed to cross a mythical border into Switzerland, one almost expects them to stop and turn and wave. Perhaps Renoir never heard about strafing or machinegun nests or poison gas. This movie certainly suggests as much.",2,10,24,19 November 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The Pre-fab Four Ride Again...
","It was bad enough the first time around: bad writing (the Fantastic Four become the Fantastic Five, for no apparent reason, yet come to be known as THE FANTASTIC FOUR), bad acting (if the guy who played Doom could just learn to project a little; or to act, maybe...), bad direction (the bland leading the bland)- bad movie. To think that the second go-'round would be even worse! Inconceivable... Until one considers the fact that what we're seeing here is THE RISE OF SECOND UNIT CINEMA. For the record, SUC is cinema that is co-directed by special effects geeks (in particular, graduates of the cgi school of cinema) or movies that play out like one long, drawn out stuntman's demo reel. (Take your pick.) THE FANTASTIC 4 2 will definitely get a RISE out of moviegoers fed up with movies directed, for all intents and purposes, by the fx guys.",1,1,4,15 October 2007
Grudge Match," For xboxrz only...
","Professional boxing, it seems, has always been on the ropes in one way or another (lawmakers have been trying to outlaw the sport for hundreds of years). As Drama, boxing's about as pure as it gets. Consider Shinya Tsukamoto's powerful TOKYO FIST, for instance, or Rod Serling's REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT (either version); or John Huston's FAT CITY; Robert Wise's THE SET-UP; THE HARDER THEY FALL, with Humphrey Bogart; THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, with James Earl Jones; Russell Crowe in Cinderella MAN... There are others; there will be more. Unfortunately, GRUDGE MATCH is exactly what boxing DOESN'T need: another prefab fight film with more flab than jab. (A larger than life statue of Stallone was erected in Philadelphia in honor of the ROCKY movie franchise. No such statue honoring the late Joe Frazier- the Real Life Heavyweight Champion of the World, who fought out of Philly- was ever erected. In yet another bit of irony, Stallone's character in GRUDGE MATCH reveals that he's blind in his left eye- a medical condition that Frazier himself had but kept under wraps throughout his entire career.) Far more realistic than a pay-per-view bout would've been a charity exhibition between the two old timers. (A recent look at the Maidana-Payweather travesty- in which Maidana won nine rounds out of twelve, yet somehow managed to lose the decision!- is indicative of just how little most of the folks feeding us 'boxing' really know about the sport. One of the know-nothing commentators actually suggested as a strategy that Maidana 'jab to the body.' While jabbing to the body might set up something ELSE- a follow-up body shot with the right or a hook off the jab to the body or a right over the top-, jabbing to the body alone makes no sense. In the end, it didn't really matter: Maidana LOST points for hitting his opponent, while Payweather was GIVEN points for each blow he took- and he took a LOT of them. Look at the laughable 'punch stats,' which were CLEARLY in error. Home Box Orifice was bad enough, but now ShoTime's rigging decisions for its in-house fighters. Maidana summed it up nicely when asked if he wanted a rematch. 'Since I won the fight,' he said, 'I'm willing to give the challenger a rematch.' On the other hand, when he started to hold up a cookie he was eating, the ShoTime toady with the mic snatched it out of his hand with a remonstration: 'Huh-uh'- meaning NO- while every single inch of the ring and the cornermen's clothes were adorned with corporate logos.) Stallone, more than any other actor, has cashed in BIG TIME thanks to boxing- but he's given little back. Why not start a Sports Channel with BOXING at its core (something we haven't seen since the early days of ESPN); someone with Stallone's pull could get it done. (James 'Bonecrusher' Smith is trying to get a Boxing Hall of Fame opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Stallone could throw in with Smith...)",2,5,13,12 May 2014
Transformers," Transform this...
","As nigh unto impossible as it may seem, the master of Second Unit Cinema- none other than Mr. Michael 'Oy vey' Bay- has rocketed to the top of the charts with his take on the old TRANSFORMERS toytoons. (I was one of those who watched the original series when it aired because, even though it wasn't- nor isn't, nor ever shall be- food for thought, it beat the daylights- then, as even now, believe it or not- out of the infinitely inferior Americanimation to be found on the tube... or even on the Big Screen, for the most part... again, to this very day.) Even Second Unit Cinemasters like Tim Story (whose FANTASTIC BOREs run a close second and third to TRANSFORMERS) can't begin to come close to what Mr. Bay has wrought. Bay, unlike Story, at least had the good sense to go with a full cgi cast and thereby save himself the embarrassment of working with real, live human beings. (One of the cgi even looks like Angelina Jolie's father. The geniuses who generated these computer images must take a bow- as should their computers, who did most of the work, anyway.) By handing the reins of most of the film over to the techs, Bay frees himself up to do what he does best: direct the second unit. It was nothing less than a stroke of genius. If there's another director more worthy of the title of Master Of Second Unit Cinema than Bay, I've missed him.",1,14,25,17 October 2007
Children of Men," Just plain bad science fiction...
","Wow. That so many would tout so highly so silly a film is nothing less than truly amazing... Anyone who's ever read science fiction (not to mention The Black Book from which the basic premise of this one seems to have been lifted) has to have come away from this one scratching their noggin in confusion. What's the big deal here? This is compelling science fiction the way Joyce Carol Oates's 'dissertations' on boxing are insightful- which is to say, not at all. Forget the hackneyed storyline and the barely watchable performances: with the sole exception of the cinematography, there's nothing to recommend this one. Be warned.",3,2,5,9 February 2007
Casualties of War," Video gamers, please take note: War = Rape + Murder...
","Just yesterday morning, AMC (that's American Movie Classics) ran an infomercial offering 'more sex, less stress.' That was followed by two Three Stooges shorts, then a heavily redacted version of CASUALTIES OF WAR. I'd seen the movie way back when, but I'd dismissed it as just another of Brian DePalmer's overblown would-be epics (like the vastly overrated SCARFACE, which features Al Pacino's worst-ever over-the-top performance). Because I'm not a video gamer, I have no idea if the first-person shooter games, set in a variety of war zones, feature any of the more True-to-Life perks that actual War provides- perks like Rape and Indiscriminate Murder. Certainly any video game set during The Vietnam War would have to feature such bonuses. As Nick Turse points out in his exhaustive study of The American War, KILL ANYTHING THAT MOVES, 'atrocities were committed by members of EVERY infantry, cavalry and airborne division... That is, every major army unit in Vietnam.' 'Soldiers realized that small groups of civilians could be killed with impunity and logged as enemy war dead...' One medical officer listed a civilian's cause of death as 'running from U.$. forces.' And it was none other than Douglas MacArthur who set the tone for the war by telling General William Westmoreland: 'You might have to employ a scorched earth policy in Vietnam.' The U.$. released 30 BILLION pounds of munitions in Vietnam (and by the early 70s, there were 20 million bomb craters) and 70 Million liters of herbal agents- most notably Agent orange (which Turse refers to rightly as 'ECOCIDE'). This was the equivalent of 640 Hiroshima bombs... 'Detained civilians and captured guerrillas were often used as human mine detectors and regularly died in the process.' The Biggest crime of all, called Operation Speedy Express, was, according to concerned soldier George Lewis, '... a My Lai each month for over a year.' The International Commission of Enquiry Into U.$. Crimes in Indochina concluded: '... The main burden of responsibility must lie with those who have been making this policy.' Said Kissinger: 'Once we've broken the war in Vietnam, no one will give a damn about war crimes.' As Huynh Thi Nay (whose son was murdered) said when she spoke about it: 'It became dark as night.' Maybe gamers could get extra points for Civilian deaths- or bonus points for Rape (unless they get caught, which might entail a loss of turn or something)...",5,3,10,10 July 2014
Mulholland Drive," David Lynch's Hollywoodland...
","***SPOILERS*** It's all about mood- the creating and sustaining of it. From THE GRANDMOTHER on, 'mood' has been Lynch's mantra, and MULHOLLAND DR. is an excellent example. Lynch manages to 'keep it up' from frame first to last. Few filmmakers are as capable. (And there IS a coherent storyline, despite popular misconception.) I was thoroughly satisfied with what amounts to Lynch's version of CARNIVAL OF LOST SOULS. After the tender mercies of THE STRAIGHT STORY (whose final, breathless moments blew me away), I was concerned that Lynch had himself 'gone straight' (as have filmmakers like David Cronenberg and John Woo, to name but a pair, who have eschewed that which made their work unique in favor of more 'legit'- i.e.; more 'commercial'- pursuits), but MULHOLLAND DR. takes a sharp left back into the landscape where the soul of David Lynch lives. It's good to see he's back.",10,2,3,25 May 2002
Guardians of the Galaxy," Assembly-line computer-generated comic...
","I've got to admit that GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY caught me by surprise: it's rare that a movie turns out to be even WORSE than I imagined it might be. You try to sit through movies like this- like BATTLEFIELD: EARTH or BUCKAROO BANZAI or TOTAL RECALL (the Schwarzenegger version; I still haven't bothered with the 'reimagined remake') or THE FIFTH ELEMENT or any one of a thousand others- and it becomes nothing more or less than self abuse. 'My government knows no shame,' proclaims Ronan in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY; nor, apparently does his Studio. You know your movie's in trouble when the one and only character worth watching for even a nanosecond is a cartoon raccoon- named Rocky ('Rocket'), who, incidentally, has the best line in the movie: 'All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to nothing at all. Pathetic.' (That's called a nutshell review, by the way.) This is just plain sloppy storytelling, based on one of the least-interesting comic books ever to see print. And ANT-MAN is next??? What are these people thinking? There's no rhyme or reason to anything they're doing. Forget the 'lack of continuity;' this is simply hyping cgi sequences that might as well be cut and pasted on a disc unto themselves, without the 'human' element.",1,8,19,8 March 2015

The Evil Dead," EQUINOX redux...
","EQUINOX (1971) is a creepy, almost documentary-like low budget fright film that begins with four college kids going out into the mountains for a picnic. They stumble across an imploded cabin (the home of a professor, played by the late fantasist Fritz Leiber) and find a book whose pages are made of human skin. If our intrepid quartet can't keep the book from falling into the wrong hands, there'll be, well, Hell to pay...
EQUINOX appears to have inspired Sam Raimi's fright-fest, THE EVIL DEAD: the parallels are, uh, Legion... But, whereas EQUINOX (available for years on video tape under the oddball title, THE BEAST) features towering, ape-like split-screen creatures, stop-motion animation, and forced perspective shots of ancient castles and the like, THE EVIL DEAD relies primarily on some extremely effective makeup fx. THE EVIL DEAD is intense, and there certainly are some shocking scenes, but the series began to slide into self-parody with the second installment (which I liked, nonetheless), and finally into outright cornball slapstick humor of the Three Stooges variety. It's a shame Raimi didn't stay the course: there are few enough 'legit' fright films as it is; by opting for the dim-witted kiddie crowd, Raimi denies us a series that might well have rivalled George Romero's Living Dead trilogy in terms of sheer terror.",10,1,2,15 January 2002
Ip Man," The stuff of legend(s): Ip, Ip hurray!
","'Bruce Lee was the progenitor of postmodern martial art,' writes Davis Miller in THE TAO OF BRUCE LEE (a book I just happened across recently at the local library). Lee boxed in his younger days (photos and diary entries exist, one of the latter ending with 'I won, but got blacked eye'), and later sparred using headgear and body armor to further develop his own personally tailored approach to martial arts. Yip Man, it's been said, sowed the seeds of Bruce Lee's Evolutionary approach to martial arts. IP MAN delves into none of this, although Bruce Lee's name is clearly an integral part of the ad campaign. Be that as it may, IP MAN is a solid action movie (as one might well expect, with Samo Hung doing the fight choreography), though I must confess I'm not a big fan (nor have I ever been) of wirework or cgi. (One of the distinctions between most of what Bruce Lee put on film and everything else was his insistence on BELIEVABLE martial arts. And, just for the record: the greatest fighter in the world isn't the guy who can tackle you and elbow you or choke you out by mounting you from behind: the greatest fighter in the world is the one fast enough of hand and foot to get in and gouge out your eyes before you can stop it. That said, a movie about the originator of wing chun- a woman- might be in order.) It's because of the wirework and cgi (not to mention the 'speeded up' action so long so much a part of these movies) that I give IP MAN a 9 out of a possible 10.",9,1,2,9 August 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," From Dark To Dumb...
","EL MARIACHI was one of those first-time efforts one can't help but admire, and it showed a world of promise. By the time we get to FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, it's hit and miss with the director- and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is the very epitome of 'hit and miss.' The first half is tense and dramatic and, watching it, I thought at the time of its release that I was seeing one of the truly GREAT vampire movies... but, following the hottest tabletop dance in the history of motion pictures, the movie abruptly fell apart. It suddenly became a comedy of over-the-top gore fx that had seemingly nothing whatsoever to do with anything that had come before. Switching gears is always an iffy proposition in a movie, but THIS big a switch was downright shocking- partly because it's a one hundred and eighty degree turn, and partly because the switch makes absolutely no sense in any way. What COULD'VE been a Great movie ends up being a barely tolerable one.",5,0,1,27 October 2014
Here Comes the Boom," Unfunny formula film...
","THE KING OF QUEENS was one of the few teleseries of recent memory (along with EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and THE BIG BANG THEORY) that I tried to keep up with during its initial run. Kevin James was (IS- IS!) a very funny guy. Unfortunately, the formula 'comedies' he's been involved with since departing the Small Screen have been... lackluster, at best. The man has talent (we've seen that and can attest to the fact), but the by-the-numbers feature films he's been involved in haven't begun to scratch the surface of what he has to offer. Like Bob Newhart, Kevin James is one of those guys whose greatest asset is his Every Man approach to humor (though they're about as different, stylistically, as Night and Day). Here's to hoping someone with the right mindset hooks up with Kevin James before it's too late. (I liked the IDEA of an unknown coming from nowhere to win the day- it happens from time to time in sport, in mixed martial arts more often than it should- but the execution left a lot to be desired.) On the plus side, Bas Rutten does a great job.",6,0,1,7 May 2013
Big Fish," 'I (wrote) to say no to death.'- Cornell Woolrich

The Dark Knight," Super heroics...
","A lifelong fan of 'the Bat-man,' I must admit that (like other 'lifers') I've had occasion over the years to grind my molars in frustration. 1989 changed everything- for a brief while. Tim Burton and Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito showed the way. Then came two questionable entries in the series and fans found themselves, once more, on less sturdy terra firma. Those of us who had suffered through the limp-wristed television series experienced the eerie deja vu that comes from reliving an accident over and over. Limbo followed. The Big Screen remained dark. And silent. And then a faint light appeared at the end of that long, dark tunnel. The 'franchise' was resurrected. While the operation was a success, the patient wasn't looking very well. Movement was slow, sometimes downright cumbersome. But there were signs of life. Hope. And now, finally, fanboys can unite in fanjoy. THE DARK KNIGHT, while a bit long (two and a half hours), boasts some of the greatest action yet in a Big Screen superhero story. That in itself is enough to recommend it. Never mind the simply spectacular look of the film, or the true to the very marrow performances all around or the surehanded direction. A ten on a scale of one to. Fanboys rejoice.",10,2,5,29 July 2008
Annie Hall," Anal Allen...
","One often finds oneself wondering what the voting members of The Academy were thinking when they selected a particular film (or director) as Best of the Year. Not so this time. If ever a motion picture earned its Oscar(s), it was this one. Woody Allen's best. Were I an aspiring filmmaker wanting to delve into comedy, I would make a point of hunting down this one and studying it. Dying, it's been said, is easy- comedy is hard. Allen covers both bases with this observation: 'I don't mind dying... I just don't want to be there when it happens.'",10,1,2,20 August 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Douglas Trumball Show...
","I cite Douglas Trumball (though he was only One of MANY) because HE has gone on to great fame because of what he did in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY- AND because neither HIS name nor the names of any of the other visual fx technicians who worked on the movie are listed as they SHOULD be- as co-directors. (Would 2001 be the classic it is without those fx...?) Still, although it was Trumball and company who actually played the tune, it was Kubrick who conducted the orchestra. (Six of one, half dozen of the other...?) Storywise, 2001 leaves gaping holes big enough to house a million Monoliths. Why, for instance, did the aliens give Man his very first WEAPON instead of a tool that might make for a far brighter future (the wheel, say)? And was there just ONE Monolith, or THREE? Was the Monolith on Earth the same one that was later discovered on the Moon (or the one that appears at the end of the movie)? The entire Moon sequence could've been cut without adversely affecting the narrative in any way, but I must confess a fondness for The Blue Danube Waltz. Was HAL sabotaged by the aliens to somehow TEST Man's worthiness to make it to The Next Evolutionary Step? 2001 leaves a lot of questions unanswered (I saw it TWICE in theaters, hoping to pick up on details the second time around that I'd missed during my first go, but no such luck). The greatest success, early on, seems to have been with the very 'stoners' who would make Tolkein's books runaway hits, but there are STILL a lot of unanswered questions.",10,3,6,13 September 2014
Puss in Boots," Puss no wuss...
","Cats, closer in temperament to human beings than most people would like to think, were once held in high regard in some of the more advanced ancient civilizations; the Egyptians even worshiped them. Righteous religious zealots have often deluded themselves into believing that cats were somehow Evil, and not just the morons in the Middle Ages: just a few years ago, cats were slaughtered by the thousands in Romania; they were deemed 'Demons in disguise' by religious leaders. Here at home, witch hunting was likewise instituted when beach goers at one of the local resorts noticed 'too many stray cats' wandering the area. Though they bothered no one, the stray cats were rounded up and killed. ALL of them. But... No sooner were the cats gone than large river rats began to roam the beach. These rats could be seen through the windows at night scampering on restaurant tabletops and counters and running up and down the streets. The Wise Men who make the Big Decisions decided to truck in more cats. PUSS IN BOOTS is great fun (though the all too familiar storyline DOES drag a bit) and Antonio Banderas never looked better. The animation is state of the art, of course, which can help make even often told tales seem new and interesting. For my money, the scene in The (G)litter Box is most memorable, though there's something here for Kids of all ages.",10,4,7,28 November 2011
Avatar," Cgi run wild...
","$300 million-plus Big Screen video game run amuck; pretty much sums it up, don't it? Cameron, clearly a fan of Robert Heinlein (STARSHIP TROOPERS), Joe Haldeman (ALL MY SINS REMEMBERED), and Harlan Ellison (SOLDIER, DEMON WITH A GLASS HAND), has actually managed, this time around, to incorporate THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS into his Big Screen video game. How's THAT for juxtaposition...? Unfortunately, the end result is something less than satisfying (unless, of course, you have the constitution to sit through a 3-hour-long video game, couched in the usual clich√©d military setting- which I don't). On a somewhat related note, I found out the hard way (by first purchasing and then watching it) that the 'director's cut' of George Lucas's THX-1138 had been TAMPERED with: spankin' new cgi have been added that undercut the gritty realism that made the 'original version' so much better. There is at least one reference to a 'wookie' being run over (yuk-yuk) and the in-bred trolls who attack Duvall at movie's end have been replaced by unconvincing cgi monsters. Maybe, one of these days, filmmakers will learn to leave well enough alone- but I doubt it.",1,7,12,21 February 2011
Drag Me to Hell," ... and make it quick- please!
","Although the ending was rather pedestrian (especially considering who the director was), I thought THE GIFT was a decent movie. Nothing to write home about, to be sure, but a minor diversion on a minor scale. The rough cut of A SIMPLE PLAN that I saw was likewise well crafted, but, again, nothing to get worked up over. The second SPIDER-MAN movie had a lot going for it, but it also had an elderly woman hanging from a building by an umbrella (and clobbering Doc Oc), not to mention yet another outing of a masked superhero (is Maguire claustrophobic?), so it, too, was a mixed bag. Cribbing from everything from CURSE OF THE DEMON to THE EXORCIST to THE HAUNTING and THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (as well as several of the Japanese horror movies that've made the rounds the last couple of years), DRAG ME TO HELL is just plain bad. It's almost as if Raimi were sleepwalking his way through this one- or feeling his way along blindly. The 'big scares' are about as uninspired as something from a Knob Zombie movie. A big disappointment.",2,3,7,5 November 2009
Mama," Give it the benefit of the doubt...
","Well done in the heretofore Japanese fashion (which has been co-opted in recent years by filmmakers from every corner of the globe), MAMA teeters on the brink of excellence: it's well-crafted, with good music and sound effects, and a decent enough storyline. There are some genuinely creepy scenes (the youngest girl crawling around on all fours is startling), but the cgi- yet again- gum up the works when they are needed least- at film's end. Drama goes right out the window once the cgi start; lacking credibility (they LOOK like what they are: cheesy computerized effects), they yank the rug right out from under the viewer. When are filmmakers going to learn that just because they're ABLE to use cgi, they aren't always preferable...?",7,0,1,4 December 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Masterpiece of Static Cinema...
","As someone who's spent time laboring in the no-budget world of experimental film and video, I can appreciate A CLOCKWORK ORANGE on a purely technical level. By the same token, I recognize in it (and in most of what Kubrick did) an almost amateurish overindulgence. Being by nature a photographer, his emphasis was naturally on the Visual; characters were there to simply enhance the shots he set up. In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, long static scenes unfold (one after another) as the camera sits and watches. This is a habit many low budget, indie filmmakers engage/indulge in: I've done it myself over the years. But it's a mistake when a paid professional does it because it results in what could best be called 'motionless pictures.' So intent is Kubrick on the Visual in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE that he never even bothers to explain the significance of the title. A small oversight, perhaps, but an oversight nonetheless.",7,1,3,10 September 2010
The Fly," The Metamorphosis...
","In Franz Kafka's classic THE METAMORPHOSIS, Gregor Samsa wakes one morning to find that he's turned into a man-sized insect. I've always thought that THE METAMORPHOSIS would make a great episode of a horror anthology (in something like TWILIGHT ZONE- THE MOVIE, OR as an episode of a teleseries). One of the more interesting aspects of adapting the story would be to SHOW Samsa's metamorphosis. (I tried something similar conceptually when I submitted a script entitled VAMPYRE to George Romero's TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE series: in an effort to go 'undercover' and infiltrate a group of vampires terrorizing a city, I had the main character allow himself to be bitten by a vampire. The scenes immediately following depicted his transformation from a man to a vampire. I was told that the episode would be 'too expensive' to do.) THE FLY (the remake, helmed by horror meister David Cronenberg) is the next best thing. Jeff Goldblum's absent-minded, muttering acting schtick is pitch-perfect for the character of Seth Brundle and we BUY him as the scientist. Geena Davis does well as the love interest (though I was never really a fan, she does a GREAT job here and is 100% believable in an underrated performance), but it's Goldblum's gradual metamorphosis into Brundlefly that makes THE FLY worth seeing. By far the best of the Cronenbug films. (Boxing fans, take note: durable Canadian heavyweight champion George Chuvalo plays an arm-wrestling barroom brawler.)",10,7,10,19 August 2014
Rocky," Schlocky...
","Even in the hands of more capable directors like Walter Hill (UNDISPUTED), Martin Scorsese (RAGING BULL) and Michael Mann (ALI), boxing has proved almost impossible to do well on The Big Screen. The way over the top slugfests in ROCKY lend the character an almost comic-book aspect (which suited the character well in later movies, when he faced everybody from Rocky, Junior- played by Tommy Morrison- to Godzilla- played by 'Hulk' Hogan). Stallone would base yet another of his ROCKY movies (III) on the shenanigans of Ali (against giant Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki) and Wepner (versus Andre the Giant). Stallone's debt to both Ali and Wepner is something that the star only begrudgingly admits (though it's crystal clear to anyone with at least one working eye). (As far as the Apples and Oranges argument about Boxing versus Wrestling goes, one wonders why it's always a boxer trying to wrestle and never the other way around...)",7,0,3,1 August 2014
Rocky III," Rocco goes down hard...
","Suffering from what's come to be known as 'boxing dementia,' our hero Rocco (like filmmaker Stallone himself) coasts along, milking his name for all it's worth. Everything's fine until a menacing challenger appears on the horizon- 'Mr. T,' as Clubber Lang (an Ernie Shavers type of puncher; hence, the moniker 'Clubber'). Clubber threatens the franchise, ridiculing Rocco's mixed martial arts bout with the infamous Thunderlips ('Hulk' Hogan). When he runs out of places to hide, Rocco gives in and takes his medicine. You can't take that many shots to the head and walk away unaffected; it's fantasy to think so. Just look at what happened to fighters like Jerry Quarry. (Many of the greatest fights ever fought can be found on YouTube, but almost NONE of them can be found on DVD. Maybe Stallone could help some of the real life fighters who fought the fights by starting a line of high-quality dvds showcasing them and donating some of the proceeds to their retirements.) I just recently revisited this one (hence, the updated comments) and I realized that it's not as bad as I'd originally remembered it being- it's WORSE. This is a comic book made for the Big Screen- and not in a good sense: it's chock full of the kind of know-nothing s--- one finds in television shows (ESPECIALLY those that purport to be 'boxing' stories). Originally, I thought that Stallone had asked Carl Weathers (as Apollo Creed) to teach him to 'fight like a black man' in the movie. I was mistaken. Wherever I heard that statement, it wasn't in ROCKY III- but it STILL stands as one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.",6,1,1,8 August 2014
Thor," Kirby doth live!
","At long last, the cosmic concepts that Jack Kirby wrought with imagination and artistry have been rewrought for the big screen with the flamboyant filmmaking (and cgi) of Kenneth Branagh. As per Kirby's dictum that 'comics shouldn't REFLECT reality, they should TRANSCEND it,' THOR the motion picture TRANSCENDS. (Not in a WATCHMEN kind of way, but Transcendent, nonetheless.) JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY #83 was a dramatic departure from the standard 1950s Atomic Age movie-inspired origins of most of the Marvel super heroes. (Kirby had been using Thor in comics prior to that- his hammer even turned up in a western, at one point-, but, this time around, he zeroed in on the gallant God of Thunder and his homeworld of Asgard.) The result was a comic book that I personally felt outstripped everything that had come before it. (See my comments regarding Kirby's death in a newspaper article that appeared shortly thereafter at capefearcomics.webs or on our facebook site.) Kirby was an artist whose cosmic sensibilities were never really tempered by his blue collar work ethic: he was a visionary in the field, and a quick perusal of any one of the four black and white reprint volumes of the THOR saga (inked by MY all-time favorite Kirby inker, Vince Colletta) clearly shows WHY. Like Bruce Lee, Jack Kirby was an inspiration to those of us who were paying attention- and, like Bruce Lee, Kirby represented the promise of Unlimited Potential. Gods knows this movie doesn't QUITE live up to its promise, but it's close enough for now. I'll leave you now with a few words from Mark Evanier's beautiful Afterword to KIRBY: KING OF COMICS: 'Heroism was much more heroic, villainy was all the more villainous, and love was just plain lovelier.' Not a bad epitaph.",10,1,3,6 May 2011
The Happening," Fine fantasy...
","The impression I got sitting through THE HAPPENING was akin to the feeling one gets sitting through a good fantasy novel (of the T.M. Wright variety, say, or Stephen King at his very best). The cinematic craftsmanship speaks for itself: it's superb, on all fronts. Like LADY IN THE WATER, THE HAPPENING was (for me) a fully realized fantasy- like a dream, functioning, at times, on an almost subliminal level. It would be interesting, indeed, to see what Shyamalan could do with one of the hundreds of novels or short stories written by the likes of Richard Matheson (I AM LEGEND) or Charles L. Grant (HOUR OF THE OXRUN DEAD) or Charles Beaumont (THE HOWLING MAN) or Harlan Ellison (FLOP SWEAT) or Shirley Jackson (THE SUNDIAL) or H.P. Lovecraft (THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE) or Robert E. Howard (PIGEONS FROM HELL) or Edgar Alan Poe (THE OBLONG BOX) or Henry Kuttner (THE GRAVEYARD RATS) or... You get my drift. (THE MIST, by Stephen King, was turned into a decent movie, by the way.)",10,2,7,11 July 2008
Zombieland," Romeroland romp...
","Having just spent a weekend at a zombiecon (where I saw not one but two more unacknowledged but clearly Romero-inspired no-budget zombie movies), I didn't really expect a whole lot from ZOMBIELAND. Good thing, too. Most of the funniest lines were in the trailers (all but one, by my count) and the cgi were downright underwhelming. Woody Harrelson shoulders the bulk of the acting burden (which ain't exactly a stretch, in this case), mugging alongside what has to be one of the blandest young leading men to ever come down the pike. Bill Murray, who hasn't been in a movie worth watching in decades, becomes the butt of the film's best joke- which you can see coming a mile away. In fact, everything that follows is instantly forgettable. (And the brief scene tagged onto the end of the closing credits isn't even worth waiting for.) The most egregious error is the omission of the number one rule for surviving a zombiepocalypse: you don't have to be faster than a zombie to survive- you just have to be faster than the guy next to you.",6,1,2,13 October 2009
Psycho," Master Moviemaker Makes Murder Masterpiece...
","When one considers the fact that PSYCHO is based on the depredations of Ed Gein (by way of Robert Bloch), it's almost impossible to imagine that even as great a Movie Maestro as Alfred Hitchcock could turn it all into such a stylish and suspenseful masterpiece. But he does. (Let's not forget to give credit where credit is due: Robert Bloch is the man whose imagination transformed the ghoul Gein into Norman Bates; Stephano fashioned his scenario from the novel.) For those who aren't familiar with Gein, he was a cannibal necrophiliac who wanted to be a woman- his mother in the book and in the movie, but female, period, in real life. He would actually dress up in a 'suit' made of a woman's skin and dance around his deserted farmhouse at night. (I've always loved the song DANCIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT by King Harvest, but whenever I think of Ed Gein these days- which ain't often-, I think of that song...) THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE was also based on Gein's atrocities and comes closer, I think, to the real horror of what he did, but Bloch and Hitchcock first separately and then combined turned it into one of the Truly Great Murder Movies- one for the ages.",10,1,3,18 July 2014
Rosemary's Baby," Bad Seed, indeed...
","Roman Polanski's version of ROSEMARY'S BABY isn't quite as subtle as some have led others to believe: when 'the father' begets The Child, for instance, we actually SEE Big D in action and he's a scaly, monstrous creature. In the hands of a lesser director, the scene could've been ridiculous, but Polanski manages to pull it off without too much fanfare. Cassavettes is good as the actor willing to sell not only HIS soul but the souls of every member of his family to get what he wants, but it's Mia Farrow as Rosemary who makes the movie a classic: she never once strikes the wrong note, and her reactions at the end of the movie are particularly noteworthy. There's a subtlety to her final scenes that can't be overlooked or denied- she MAKES the movie (with a little help from Polanski). Horror fans could conceivably view ROSEMARY'S BABY as a prequel to movies like THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST (to name but a few).",10,1,3,6 October 2014
Crazy Heart," Meandering pandering...
","I'm a Jeff Bridges fan; have been since I saw him in movies like THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and HALLS OF ANGER- but this overblown, meandering mess of a movie makes me wonder what it was I saw in him in the first place. But it's not Bridges; it's the ridiculous writing and the lackluster film-making that conspire to dull the sheen by dulling the senses: CRAZY HEART is professional pandering at its worst. Every cardboard character goes through his or her paces at a snail's pace- and every step of the way, we see what we've seen before, again and again. In FAT CITY, Bridges was the young up-and-comer who doesn't quite have what it takes to make a go of it in one of the toughest professions on this planet (professional boxing); in CRAZY HEART, aided and abetted by one of the lamest songs you're ever likely to hear, he's an over-the-hill down-and-outer who probably (judging by the song) never made it in the Big Time. It's a lackluster performance. Still, one can take some small consolation from the thought that Jeff Bridges the actor still has more than a few good performances left in him.",2,2,6,1 June 2010
War of the Worlds," Convincing carnage...
","Utterly believable fx buttress plausible performances all around and make Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS one of the truly great invasion epics. Like GODZILLA (the 1998 version), WAR OF THE WORLDS depends greatly on its special effects- and, also like GODZILLA, the fx are very much up to the task. I've bemoaned the fact the most fx-heavy movies of the past several decades have left a great deal to be desired, but, when the DRAMA is this well integrated, even state-of-the-art fx are laudable and only ENHANCE the performances. (JAWS is still one of the scariest movies of all time, but the fx therein are all Practical Magic- and all the more remarkable because of it. Unfortunately, one need only sit through any one of the subsequent sharks-on-the-loose clunkers to see that cgi sharks are by no means as frightening as the faux 'real thing.') With PACIFIC RIM looming on the horizon, it looks like we'll be treated to yet more convincing carnage. Keep 'em comin', I say.",10,3,5,19 June 2013
12 Years a Slave," Big budget bull****...
","12 YEARS A SLAVE is one of those movies on the borderline between Big Budget and Just Plain Boring. While the intentions may have been good (the only thing I came away with was the idea that even slavery was something that could be overcome with a lot of hard work and some unbelievable LUCK), it's Ejiofor's lackluster performance- and the ridiculously LAVISH look and feel of the movie- that undermines whatever serious message or insight(s) the filmmakers may have had in mind. Not ONCE during the course of the movie did I BELIEVE what I was seeing: it has an almost over-fed Television quality to it (not unlike DJANGO UNCHAINED, for instance). The Hype turns out to have been just that.",2,7,14,10 June 2014
30 Days of Night," 30 days of fright...
","Superb cinematography and special effects combine with outstanding performances and literate storytelling to produce one of the few truly epic vampire films in 30 DAYS OF NIGHT. The director's acute focus on his stellar cast and their would-be killers accounts in no small part for the effectiveness of this film; in fact, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker (of whom there are all too many these days), this could very easily have deteriorated into another stinkfest. From the moment the 'Renfield' character wanders from the ice-bound ship, it's clear that this isn't going to be just another hokey, ho-hum horror movie: the fx are so beautifully integrated into the gorgeously-shot sequence that it suggests at once that fright film fans are in for a (trick or) treat. This early promise is fully realized. The aerial sequence showing the overwhelming assault on the hapless townsfolk calls to mind the very roots of the legend itself, and suggests that the horrifying legends stemmed not from some faint scratching at the door and imaginations run wild but from some unforgettable night of bloodletting that must needs endure in legend thenceforth. Like the Nazi occupation of Europe that followed. (The parallel is there: the survivors hide out like the family of Anne Frank, and the town itself looks like and is laid out not unlike a concentration camp.) The final decision of the Hartnett character makes sense, given the situation, and makes for one of the most poignant endings I've ever seen in a fright film. 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is everything one could ask for in a fright film. Bravo.",10,3,6,21 October 2007

Absorbing viewing for the most part (though, being a second-guesser, I would've done away with the second doing-away with, ending instead with the revelation that the two were not related). The ruthlessness that the prospect of big money engenders is given about as thorough a scrutiny as is cinematically possible.

Man on Fire," No-nonsense neo-noir...
","The often underrated Tony Scott has crafted, in MAN ON FIRE, a truly exceptional, take-no-prisoners neo-noir masterpiece. Denzel Washington as Creasy gives perhaps his finest performance in a career chock full of outstanding performances. Scott was a visual virtuoso whose movies were always worth watching, even when the writing wasn't up to snuff. MAN ON FIRE unfolds logically and, when the s--- hits the fan, it hits the fan HARD. This is the kind of movie I tend to prefer when it comes to the Driven Man out for Revenge: it's uncompromising and, ultimately, very, very satisfying. All things given, the ironic ending is almost inevitable, but it's still hard to take (all things given). I was impressed with MAN ON FIRE when I first saw it; these days, I'm blown away by it.",10,1,2,9 September 2014

It happened in Germany, too, in the mid-1930s, and this semi-documentary look at the Final Days of 'The Thousand-Year Reich' is riveting. There are lessons to be learned, here.

Army of Darkness," Stupid ain't the same as Funny...
","We were en route to see ARMY OF DARKNESS when a former friend and I spotted Sam Raimi on a local side street shooting second unit footage for THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. It was cold and raining and my buddy thought I was full of s--- when I yelled at him to stop. He shot me a quizzical look and asked me why. 'Back there,' I said: 'It's Sam Raimi- the guy who made ARMY OF DARKNESS.' Whereupon he informed me that I was full of s---. 'Just let me out and go around the block and pick me up,' I begged: 'I just want to see him in person.' And he did. And I did. Then we went and saw ARMY OF DARKNESS. I warned him going in that it wouldn't be half as good as EVIL DEAD II (which we'd both loved); afterward, he thanked me for the heads up: he was better able to accept the movie for what it was (and wasn't). I've been a Raimi fan since first I laid eyes on THE EVIL DEAD, but I've often wondered if he really GETS the difference between Stupid and Funny. They can sometimes go hand in hand, but the truly FUNNY things in Life aren't usually the STUPID things (which tend to infuriate rather than please us).",8,2,4,21 October 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Another whitewashing...
","Film-making, when it's undertaken with 'clean hands,' can be as moving and vital as the reality it reflects. When it's done with questionable motives, it reeks. I first read about Idi Amin Dada in the mid-1970's. It was, to say the least, an appalling revelation. Amin was- sad to say- the quintessential politician. In one account, a cruise ship was prevented from continuing downriver because crocodiles had eaten their fill of the bodies clogging the mouth of the river and the excess had caused an importune blockage. Drat the luck. And with international correspondents on board, too... The filmmakers responsible for this travesty should hang their heads in shame. Forrest Whitaker should have his head examined (and his soul): to portray this man as 'just a good ol' boy' is nothing less than a criminal act.",1,9,29,5 August 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Dreckula...
","Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. 'Who joo talking to...?' Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole 'You gotta be kiddin' me' Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Madonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in 'BRAM STOKER'S' Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The 'origin' story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...",3,2,3,30 July 2013
Jaws," An enduring classic...
","Little wonder that JAWS has become the quintessential summer movie: it's big and scary and a boatload of fun- STILL, after all these years. It wasn't until I migrated South that I caught my first glimpse of a real-life shark. It was an overcast, rainy day, and The Wife suggested we go to the beach. I don't 'do' the beach ('Drowning,' as Roy Scheider's Chief Brody explains in the movie.); fell asleep on the beach one day and woke up three hours later with golfball-size blisters on my shins. But I gave in and we went. I was sitting on the beach, watching as She swam out into the choppy waters. She rolled over, belly up, and started drifting toward a nearby pier. I was watching, not really interested, when something broke the surface of the water on the far side of my wife. It was a momentary thing, but I clearly saw the arched back- and the fin. I stood up and shouted a warning. She waved me off and continued to drift toward the pier. I followed, searching the surface of the ocean for another tell-tale sign of you-know-what. When she finally came ashore, I told her what I'd seen. She argued that I was just lying to scare her out of the water so we could go home. She went back into the water and I spent the rest of that day watching for the attack I was convinced would come. There was no attack- but, the very next day, not one but THREE sharks were hooked by fishermen fishing off of the pier toward which my wife had drifted. After learning of this, she decided to never again take a dip in the ocean. I could sympathize: after seeing JAWS, I vowed NEVER to get in the ocean. If Man were meant to swim, he'd have fins...",10,2,5,24 June 2013
The Wrestler," Fat City wrestler...
","While Cinderella MAN may just be the greatest boxing movie ever made (it manages to convey- and convey vividly- the give-and-take one experiences in close-quarters hand-to-hand combat), movies like FAT CITY (which deals with down and out fighters whose skills will never take them to the top) hit even closer to home (there can be only one champion at any given time, and a whole lot of losers). THE WRESTLER is to 'professional wrestling' what FAT CITY is to boxing: an unvarnished look at the guys at the bottom (and why they sometimes end up there). Like 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper, Mickey Rourke's Randy 'The Ram' Robinson has his day in the sun (the often referenced first match with 'The Ayotolla'), but hits the skids somewhere along the line and ends up one missed rental payment away from homelessness. (I once spent an unbelievably hot and humid night in a North Carolina high school gym- where the air-conditioning had, of course, gone out- helping carry and assemble a wrestling ring for a local troupe. I was also their videographer that night. These were the kind of guys who weren't household names in their own homes, if you know what I mean, but they gave it their all. There was one guy who'd actually been on a big time cable show several times, but now he was bottom feeding. The most interesting aspect of it all was seeing how the wrestlers themselves swarmed all over the promoter trying to get their money before he could give them the slip. I found it all a bit amusing until I showed up to video tape another event- held in the parking lot of a biker bar- and got nothing for my trouble but a pat on the back. Truly, the greatest show on Earth...) Rourke's Robinson is one of the most sympathetic characters in the annals of sympathetic screen characters (it was almost impossible for me to keep from bursting into tears every time he delivered one of those quiet comments that sent shivers down my spine and his examination of his surgical scar- which I call my 'autopsy scar'- had me quivering with repressed emotion). If you haven't seen THE WRESTLER, I urge you to do so at once- and don't forget to bring a hanky.",10,1,2,12 February 2009
Dark Shadows," The Addams Family meets The Munsters...
","Knowing in advance that this one was a send-up wasn't warning enough, because it was Tim Burton at the wheel, with Johnny Depp riding shotgun. What could go wrong...? Well, what went wrong was the ****ing SCRIPT. This DARK SHADOWS (unlike the series that spawned it) is so badly written that it REEKS. So many opportunities were missed, even given the premise: it would've been far funnier to have the boy, David (played here by another of those bland child actors who don't really seem to belong on screen these days), be the one to experiment with mind-altering drugs or to play rock and roll records backward (giving Depp as Barny reason to believe that The Devil does indeed hold sway in the swingin' 70s); or to really explore pop psychology with Dr. Hoffman; or to have Barny in bell-bottoms- or dressed like Superfly after taking in a 'shadow play'; or have Barny cringing behind a couch while watching the original broadcast of Dan Curtis's teleclassic, THE NIGHTSTALKER; or to have Barny emerge at film's end from his coffin prison into the early 21st century... The possibilities are endless, but whoever wrote this one apparently didn't really think things through- proof enough of that being that any send-up of DARK SHADOWS would absolutely HAVE to hark back to THE MUNSTERS and THE ADDAMS FAMILY. Not that it's ALL bad: Depp is still most adept at creating a likable character, even given the lackluster nature of the material he's been given, and the movie looks gorgeous. The music never settles in long enough to establish any real mood, however, and the climactic pyrotechnics are just so much sturm und drang, signifying nothing. Subtle, it ain't.",6,2,4,14 May 2012
WALL¬∑E," Pics-r dumb-ees sill-ee...
","It's been so long since I saw an animated movie that was produced in these here United States that I thought was good that I can't remember what it was. Literally. Now we have Artoo Deetoo and See Threepio making out on the Big Screens at The Mall. And that's entertainment? Not where I come from. It was difficult not to nod off during this one, but I hung in there because I always go in to a movie expecting to be pleasantly surprised; maybe even enlightened; at the very least, mildly entertained. Zip. Nada. Nein. While anthropomorphism is okay when it comes to cgi animals, cgi robots are another thing entirely (so to speak). ASTRO BOY is a personal favorite of mine, and I liked ROBOTS a whole lot (due mostly to the voicework of Robin Williams), but WALL-E malfunctions on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin. For one thing, he has no personality. Bells and whistles just don't cut it, no matter how many millions of dollars you spend on cgi: a soulless automaton is still a soulless automaton. Look at Republicans.",4,3,12,6 December 2008
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Pretentious, amateurish scenery chewing...
","In high school, we staged plays like the one Michael Keaton's character puts on in BIRDMAN; they were just as bad, just as forgettable. Prior to his turn as BATMAN, Keaton starred in two very memorable films, THE DREAM TEAM and CLEAN AND SOBER. Both movies showed that his casting as The Dark Knight was inspired and not the evidence of Tim Burton's madness that many had proclaimed. Keaton's choices following BATMAN weren't as shrewd: though he had his pick of parts, he seemed to be trying to distance himself from The Caped Crusader. In so doing, he boxed himself into corners. In BIRDMAN, which is about as pretentious a movie as anything I've ever seen, his character does as Keaton did, with predictable results. Predictable? Clich√©d to the Nth Degree is more to the point- and the hand-held camera trailing along behind him adds absolutely NOTHING to the film; it simply becomes TEDIOUS after an all-too-brief time. Like the aforementioned high school plays, BIRDMAN is Amateurish to an embarrassing degree- and whoever 'wrote' this one needs to learn HOW to write; that's the worst aspect of all. BIRDMAN is, to put it simply, for the Birds.",1,5,11,19 March 2015
Prometheus," Chariots of the Gods...
","I have to agree with zetes (the only comments I've read regarding PROMETHEUS): this is a showcase for the production designers and the special effects crew. Nothing more. Harking back to THE CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, PROMETHEUS offers little more than second-hand ruminations, coupled with some of the most overblown filmmaking ever seen. Granted, ALIEN itself was hardly what one would call ORIGINAL in concept (it was a hybrid of a number of lesser known films, most notably Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES and IT!, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE), but one would think that a filmmaker with Scott's (financial) pull could come up with something better than a rehash of Von Daniken. (Want to see the same concept done much better? Check out THE ETERNALS, a comic book done by Jack Kirby.)",3,3,4,4 December 2013
Halloween," Supernatural suspense drama...
","I'm not here to toot my own horn (my neck isn't long enough), but, if you look real close, I think you'll find that Yours Truly was the first person in this country to praise HALLOWEEN in print (way back in Famous Monsters of Filmland #155, I believe it was). I felt then (and still feel today) that it's one of the finest supernatural suspense dramas ever lensed. The premise is simple but effective and John Carpenter, by focusing closely on his cast of characters, manages to evoke edge-of-your-seat suspense from beginning to end (it helps that his characters are believable, and sympathetic); his chilling score only serves to (quite literally) underscore that effectiveness. The HALLOWEEN 'formula' is relatively simple: put sympathetic, well-drawn characters in jeopardy, and you're halfway home (something the makers of the plethora of slasher films that followed in its wake didn't seem to be capable of doing). HALLOWEEN has been ripped off more than any other film I know of, but remains the unequaled original.",10,1,2,2 February 2002
Carrie," Seeing red...
","CARRIE was perfect drive-in fare (which is where I saw it), and just happens to be Brian De Palma's best film to date (in my own, ever-humble opinion). Piper Laurie as Carrie's demented mother deserves mention, but it's Sissy Spacek as the title character who really steals the show: she's as convincing as an actress could be as the tormented teen and when she finally unleashes all of her pent-up frustrations, the screen quite literally runs red with blood. Another noteworthy scene is the one where she turns her mother into a pin-cushion: this was done way back before fx became the province of computer operators, and it was done very effectively. I haven't bothered to see any of the remakes; the original will suffice.",7,2,3,21 July 2014
The Queen," God save the screen...
","A truly remarkable film- the fifth in George Romero's fabled zombie series- THE QUEEN takes up where LAND OF THE DEAD left off. The Living Dead have taken over (there's not a single living soul in evidence anywhere in the film) and have established a monarchy of their own. This one's set in Jolly Old England- but, unlike the hilarious SHAUN OF THE DEAD, THE QUEEN lacks the humor that made the former tolerable. The result of this lack of humor is a staid, motionless picture that fails to entertain on any level. The makeups sported by the principals are very lifelike, but, given the fact that these zombies do little more than walk and talk, that isn't saying much; most remain totally expressionless throughout the proceedings. If you're a die-hard lover of The Living Dead (as am I), you may want to give this one a wide berth.",1,9,22,9 February 2007
Mary and Max," 84 Charing Cross Road meets The PJs...
","It's a fine line, the one between sanity and insanity. Take 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD, for instance: a beautiful story, beautifully told. Charter a ship to the other side of the ocean and you might very well find yourself in the Claymation world of THE PJs (The ProJects)- a very different milieu, indeed. Now, combine the two very disparate elements and flavor it all with just a touch of David Lynch and you get... MARY AND MAX. It's not a bad mix, really, though a bit on the slow side (not that there's anything wrong with Slow: some of my best friends are Slow...). It'll do until somebody bootlegs some episodes of THE NOBLETS. (I have to confess I greatly preferred the alternate ending to the one they used.)",7,2,6,6 September 2010
Vanilla Sky," Bogs down in its own pretentions...
","If you find inane dialogue witty, if disjointedness is your idea of a film on the cutting edge, if pretentiousness is your cup of tea, I give you VANILLA SKY. This movie bogs down in its own pretentions. Overdone and overlong, this one confounds the viewer to the very end (when the 'cheat' ending becomes clear). Tom Cruise cruises through this one like a man truly stunned by the hammer, but it's just not enough. Especially given the aforementioned lamebrained dialogue (which is straight out of some dreadful made-for-tv movie). It's just not an engaging film on any level. Much better was JACOB'S LADDER (although that film, too, punked out in the end with a much-used cheat ending that undermined everything that came before).",1,0,3,20 January 2002
The Dark Knight Rises," Godawful on a Grand Scale...
","Hundreds of millions of dollars, and the best they can do is yet another bloated episode of a TV cop show??? The first hour or 90 minutes of this talking heads marathon plays out like a segment of LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND BORING. Maybe the Nolans haven't gotten the news, yet, but We ain't all that fond of watching the Rich wallow in their Riches over here. Where was the guy we came to see- the guy with the black leather body armor and the cape? Doing his impression of Howard Huge! Really? THAT'S what we came to see? (Not that that really matters: Batman gets outed yet again in this installment. Little wonder he doesn't bother to suit up...) Nolan's idea of an Occupy Movement says a lot, I think: the VILLAINS take over City Hall (or whatever it is in this monstrously slow-moving movie) and are set upon at film's end by Gotham's finest like peaceful protesters at a sit-in. The guy who plays Bane seems to be channeling Sean Connery, and Catwoman transmorgriphies, finally, into Batwoman. At least the worst-designed Batmobile in the 70-plus year history of the character has been laid to rest (not to mention the aerodynamically unsound piece of flying wreckage that's supposed to be the Batplane). (I've always thought that SPAWN was by far the worst-designed comic book character in comic book history- a mish-mash of ideas lifted from Spider-man and Doctor Strange-and a character whose name was ripped off from a Jack Kirby NEW GODS story- but the Batmobile in this trilogy made me step back and reevaluate things. Batman's wheels in these films look like slabs of scrap metal haphazardly fused or magnetized together. Hopefully, we've seen the last of them.) For future reference: filmmakers, if we pay money to see a super-hero movie, it's because we want to see the super-hero- NOT his UNsuper-heroic alter ego. Is THAT so hard to grasp?",1,10,18,2 January 2013
Iron Man," Hard-hitting humor...
","The hard-hitting humor is the saving grace: it makes what might've been just another celluloid superhero flick something worth watching. (IRON MAN also boasts what is by far the funniest Stan Lee cameo appearance ever.) Like L. Frank Baum's Tin Woodsman, Tony Stark is in search of a heart- and he finds it. It's refreshing in a big budget fx fest to find a soft, chewy caramel center. Unfortunately, the producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (the latest version) weren't quite as capable of finding said center. Good, but by no means the achievement that IRON MAN is, THE INCREDIBLE HULK reminded me more than a little of the original SUPERMAN serial (with Kirk Alyn), wherein our hero literally transformed into a cartoon every time he took to the skies. (I don't recall that happening in the original CAPTAIN MARVEL serial, nor the ROCKET MAN serials.) By excising the bothersome human element, the producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK have simply given us another cgi cartoon crowded with real folks who seem oddly out of place.",10,1,3,11 July 2008
Blade Runner," 'More human than Human...'
","This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.",10,0,4,17 July 2013
Ben-Hur," One for the ages...
","Man, what a career; what a voice (it commanded your attention); a profile that should've been carved into a mountainside; an on screen presence so palpable that the word 'charisma' simply couldn't do it justice. If ever an actor deserved the accolade 'superstar,' it was Charlton Heston. He was a no-nonsense type of leading man who always seemed to tower above the merely mortal, on screen as well as off. It was Charlton Heston who opened my eyes (and mind) to the larger world Out There. But it was his presence Up There that got me hooked, that made me love going to the movies. Nor was I alone: the success of his movies speaks most eloquently for itself. Not a bad legacy, and one tough act to follow.",10,2,5,5 April 2008
Trainspotting," Spot on...
","Growing up around addicts (whether alcoholics or drug users), one comes to see the dark humor in most everything. A pregnant girl who has overdosed in the hallway outside your apartment, for instance, has to be stepped over so that you can get to work on time. A kid born to a junkie mother just down the block is born deaf and without eyes. The kid of another junkie mother who lives directly behind you is born without a brain. Because the child won't live through the night, the young mother is allowed to bring it home. The child dies in her arms. A brother-in-law, strung out on heroin, almost causes his wife to have a miscarriage because he can't function well enough to get her to the hospital when her water breaks. Her baby is born with brain damage as a result. I could go on, but it's late and I'm not really up to this. TRAINSPOTTING is superb film-making, with credible performances, great music, and some of the most surreal sequences ever shot. And, as that old philosopher Alice Cooper once pointed out: Dead Babies can take care of themselves.",8,0,0,16 March 2009
Signs," Superb cinema...
","The tale's in the telling, we're told, and I would have to agree. SIGNS is at times as poignant and powerful as Shyamalan's previous two films- and as suspenseful. Like Hitchcock and Romero and Carpenter before him, Shyamalan never loses sight of the fact that it's the WAY you tell a story that makes it memorable (or forgettable). The plot can be by-the-numbers, the characters tried and true... but the director's APPROACH needs to be compelling- consistently (otherwise, s/he's a one-shot wonder). In this regard, Shyamalan soars: his films are superb cinema. All too often, budding filmmakers evince a promise that is never fully realized; on rare occasions, remarkable filmmakers turn every opportunity into the building blocks of a great career. Shyamalan has now carefully laid the foundation.",8,0,2,5 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," The second half of an epic comic book movie...
","THIS is why it's so important for producers to pick the right director. In the hands of a less competent filmmaker, this one could've been laughable. (Not that a filmmaker suited to ONE franchise will be suited to all- SUPERMAN RETURNS being a prime example, in this case.) 'Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute,' Professor X tells us in the opening voice-over. We're soon introduced to the sleazebag William Stryker (Brian Cox), who manipulates the weak-willed Nightcrawler into a one-man assault on The White House. This sets in motion a 'reprisal' raid, in which Stryker is able to capture a sampling of teenage mutants to experiment on (his son, it turns out, is a mutant and Stryker has been experimenting on him): he wants to turn the world's mutants into 'normals.' Magneto, meanwhile, plans to reverse the effects of Stryker's machine (Cerebro II, patterned after Professor X's Cerbro, which allows him to telepathically contact every mutant on the planet at the same time). My one gripe about X-MEN II is the almost incidental part played by Cyclops- my favorite mutant from the early days of the comics (patterned after The Comet, no doubt, an early comic book hero who could fire bursts of energy from his eyes; the only real difference between the two being that The Comet could fly). None of the subsequent films in the series equaled the first two.",10,0,1,1 August 2014
The Ringer," Short cut via the short bus...
","Brian Cox as the unrepentant gambling uncle almost steals the show in THE RINGER, but Johnny Knoxville hops aboard the short bus to success when he agrees to fix the Special Olympics. THE RINGER is often laugh-out-loud hilarious (as when Knoxville discovers that his undercover name will henceforth be 'Jeffy Dahmer'), but it's also a nice little love story and- most important of all- a reaffirmation of the Human Spirit. I LOVE the fact that the guys with whom 'Jeffy' is rooming not only find him out (when he lets his guard down and 'acts different'), but also agree to help him perpetrate his fraud because they can't stand the star of the Special Olympics, Jimmy (who arrives in a limo with a gaggle of publicity people), who is favored to win again this year. On a personal note, I can sympathize with people who might be offended by some of the humor in THE RINGER, but it's actually relatively mild when compared to the kind of hurtful, humiliating humor that one encounters out in The Real World. (With LOVE, this one's for Sissy.)",10,0,0,17 July 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Thor- a bore...?
","Given the possibilities, it's more than a little disappointing that the makers of THOR: THE DARK WORLD would opt to do a story about 'dark elves.' For one thing, there WERE no dark elves in the original comics- not ONE, that I can recall. (Granted, 'this ain't your daddy's Thor,' but it IS, just revamped for today's less discriminating moviegoers.) Why not do a story about Ulik, mightiest of the Rock Trolls...? ('Cause this ain't your daddy's Thor...?) To see the mighty troll marshal his army to invade Asgard itself would've been great. Consider: We see an Asgradian outpost on the edge of the Troll Lands. Battle-armored trolls attack the outpost (using the widest array of weapons imaginable, forged in their underground furnaces). Cut to another outpost, as trolls emerge from underground to attack and capture it. Thor (wearing his trademarked helmet, which he DOESN'T in THOR: THE DARK WORLD) gathers his men for a counter-attack. The armies battle to a standstill- at which point Ulik steps forth to challenge Thor to a one-on-one slugfest (no cgi, just breakaway boulders and such). Here, we discover that Loki has had a hand in the troll invasion, giving them strategic information every step of the way. Thor, to overcome superior numbers, calls forth a thunderstorm that wipes the troll army back from whence it came. Compare THAT scenario to what we see in THE DARK WORLD. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clich√É¬©d lines in quite a while. While the makeup effects and the cgi are better than in the first film, the story is every bit as ponderous: scenes drag on interminably at times, with pompous characters hammering the point(s) mercilessly- and the attempts at humor, while they might garner the occasional chuckle, are sophomoric at best and are used more often than not to undermine the 'seriousness' of the situation(s). And am I the only one more than a little tired of the post-credit 'tag' scenes? (We were subjected to a half hour of television commercials prior to half an hour of previews BEFORE the movie started- then we had to sit through ten minutes of production crew credits before the last scene. Come on, people- give us a break.)",7,0,2,8 November 2013
Am√©lie," 'Even artichokes have hearts...'
","AMELIE is not a staid CineMall movie but a quirky-plus unreality check- which was to be expected, coming as it does from the director who gave us both DELICATESSEN and THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN (both way over the top where AMELIE is an ephemeral fantasy). The amiable Amelie's theory that a dead man is leaving his photo all over town so as not to be forgotten is only the beginning. The ever-evolving story plunges full speed ahead and the cinematography (which is beautiful, by the way, as it is in the aforementioned 'eccentric cinema' classics) carries the viewer along like a roller-coaster gone haywire. The performances are razor-edged and it's only taut direction that keeps it all from getting out of control. It's like something you might find in your dreams. (Which brings me to another thought: Jeunet would be the perfect choice, it seems to me, to direct a live-action version of Winsor McCay's LITTLE NEMO IN SLUMBERLAND.) See AMELIE before luck flashes you by...",8,1,5,27 September 2007
Rear Window," Best of the best...
","Based on Cornell Woolrich's brilliant short story 'It Had To Be Murder' (as fine an example of the form as exists; read it and judge for yourself), REAR WINDOW also happens to be my favorite Hitchcock film. Who but 'Hitch' himself could've taken a wheelchair-bound leading man and crafted such an unforgettable tale of suspense? While the voting members of 'The Academy' never saw fit to bestow upon him a 'Best Director' award, Alfred Hitchcock was the kind of filmmaker who could make even an act of voyeurism compelling cinema. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly rate mention here, as well, but it's the sheer genius of one of the greatest directors who ever lived that makes REAR WINDOW the classic it is.",10,0,2,25 August 2002
Godzilla," Plodzilla: Slow. Very... very... slow...
","GODZILLA 2014 is an excruciatingly slow soap opera with a giant monster thrown in almost as an afterthought. In fact, take out Gojira altogether and what you have is a television-sized soap opera about a military man and his family with video game cgi battle scenes. Consider this puzzling fact: every time Gojira and one of the other two monsters in the movie butt heads, the director cuts away to something else (the first time, he cuts away to a television newscast of the monster, the second he literally has a door close on the action, shutting the viewer within and the battle without). We also get to see the After Party aftermath, but never the REASON for the rubble... For some of us, we paid twenty bucks to see THE MONSTERS, not the soap. I almost applauded when the sole Japanese cast member (who has a bit part as a scientist who stands around doing a lot of heavy thinking), says (of the monsters), 'Let them fight.' Even though this admonition came about two hours into this three-hour ordeal, the audience I saw the movie with (a good dozen people were there) breathed a collective sigh of relief. Finally, we were going to see some action! And we did- and it was great (the fx guys knock it out of the park); but it was also too little, too late to save GODZILLA. The Rol Em version was FAR superior (this version is about as humorless as it gets, what with the pointless and seemingly never-ending military musings). See this one for the Big Brawl at the end or because you like state-of-the-art fx, but don't expect a whole lot else.",5,10,20,16 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 'The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded...'- George Lucas
","The studio dismissal of his first (and, arguably, best) film, THX-1138, and the phenomenal success of his second feature, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, led George Lucas to undertake an Americanized version of Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS- by way of the old FLASH GORDON and BUCK ROGERS serials. Replacing the two flesh and blood leads from THE HIDDEN FORTRESS with a pair of robots who might well have stepped straight from Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Lucas fashioned a kiddie corn classic. Luke Skywalker, one supposes, is the young Lucas himself (whose interest in fast-moving machines nearly cost him the farm in his misspent youth). Forgettable in many ways, but nonetheless entertaining, STAR WARS has become the backbone of big-budget fx filmmaking in this country. One can't begrudge Lucas his phenomenal success, but one tends to find oneself longing for a return to the old, inventive days when he made movies with a tad more substance- movies that didn't follow the selfsame beat, frame after frame...",6,2,6,6 February 2002

","300 is a movie stripped to its bare essentials in every sense of the phrase. Storywise, it could be recounted on the head of a pin- with plenty of space left over. Acting doesn't really enter into it, as there isn't any: the actors themselves are mere set-pieces, and trot about in the nearly naked spouting clich√©s we've heard spouted by players in every forgettable TV series or fantasy film set among the toga-draped for the past 2,000 years. Like its second cousin on its father's side, SIN CITY, 300 almost manages to dispense entirely with the bothersome human element.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A big step forward...
","Sequels are rarely as good as the films that spawned them- but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (thanks to the direction of Irvin Kershner) proves the exception to the rule. Mature and thoughtful in a way the first film never was (though still chock full of the kinds of critters and fx that most fans of the original took to), this first sequel remains the best (by far) to date. For once in this series, the viewer feels s/he's in the hands of a genuine STORYTELLER. While Lucas himself may have written the script, it's Kershner who gives EMPIRE life, whose taut direction lifts what might've been just another also-ran sequel to a much higher plane than the original ever attained. (For every step forward, there is a step backward: the next film in the series would turn out to be the worst of the lot.)",10,0,0,30 January 2002
Sin City," Lost in translation...
","SIN CITY (unfortunately) points up one of the major flaws with most comic books: while the writing may seem new and dynamic to regular readers of comic books (who- trust me- put up with unbelievably bad writing), it simply doesn't hold up when fleshed out. (HELLBOY is another case in point: purty pitchers, but an unvarying storyline that always ends with Mr. Boy pounding his supernatcherl adversaries into dust. Creator Mike Mignola has recently taken to lifting ideas from the late Manly Wade Wellman's Silver John the Baladeer stories and, most recent of all, 'borrowing' a storyline from the teleseries ANGEL. None of it makes HELLBOY any more readable, or the movies worth watching.) Frank Miller, mistaken for God by many of the aforementioned famished fanboys because he took that bastion of Law and Order, Batman, and tried to make him out to be some kind of Outsider (when, in fact, Batman is 'by the book' to the core), did a decent enough job with SIN CITY (the comic versions), but the whole thing falls flat on the Big Screen. The reason is all too obvious: the writing. Visually on a par with most video games, it just doesn't hold up where it needs it most.",2,1,6,24 May 2010

","Sometimes it pays to read the fine print- but I wasn't paying attention: I glimpsed the trailer and thought that this was a remake of Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD. Which it ain't. Sorta. It's a limp-wristed attempt to cash in on the SCREAM formula, with a dash of WESTWORLD thrown into the mix. In the process, it manages the amazing feat of dumbing down the old SCOOBY-DOO cartoons- a show made for American children with Special Needs! At no point in the proceedings- not ONCE- did I feel empathy for ANY of the cardboard cut-outs; the unleashing of the cgi didn't make it any easier to sympathize with them, either. (It's yet another of those man-versus-cgi scenarios that leaves one wondering just what the **** the filmmakers were thinking when they conceived it.) Giver a pass.",1,1,4,13 November 2012
True Romance," A hit and a miss...
","TRUE ROMANCE, like most of what Tony Scott directed, is worth seeing. The one sour note (for me) was the ridiculous scene-chewing by Gary Oldman as a Pasta (a white Rastafarian); not only doesn't it ring true, but it's SO over the top that it undercuts the other, much better performances by everyone else throughout the film. Christian Slater (the once-promising young Jack Nicholson) carries the load admirably, and Patricia Arquette is sexier than ever. If Quentin Tarantino should be remembered for any one film, it's this one: it's by far the best movie bearing his name- thanks to a mostly outstanding cast, guided by a director who really knew his stuff.",9,1,2,9 September 2014
Donnie Darko," Dynamite debut!
","Having heard absolutely nothing about this one, I risked a rental and came away very impressed,indeed, by Mr. Kelly's debut film. He has learned his lessons well: every technical trick that CAN be employed IS employed- to great effect. (It's a testament to the storytelling skill of this neophyte filmmaker that the very impressive visual fx never once detract from the story.) The ending, too, comes almost unexpectedly from left field (and is the very first time I've ever been COMFORTABLE with this type of ending). Casting Gylanhaal was a stroke of pure genius: this young man can ACT! No doubt about it: this is one of the most impressive debut films I've ever seen in my life. The only thing I can't figure out is why this one wasn't hailed the way the vastly overrated VANILLA SKY was; this is clearly a far superior film. If you haven't seen it yet, get thee to thy nearest vidout and rent it. You WON'T be disappointed.",10,1,2,26 May 2002
Cinderella Man," Down but not out...
","Braddock's remains one of the most inspiring boxing stories ever- and Ron Howard's version of it just may be the finest cinematic treatment of the subject we've had so far. Crowe is outstanding, as are Zellweger and Giamatti; but it's Howard, the director, who deserves praise in the highest. I made a point of seeing this one on the big screen, but it took me a while to get around to commenting on it (in great part because watching it causes in me a welling in the throat and a mistiness in the eyes). Cinderella MAN, despite what some may have taken to be melodramatics, happens to be a genuinely dramatic Real Life Story with few equals. ROCKY? Forget it. Compared to Cinderella MAN, ROCKY (and all its sequels) are tantamount to some of the cornier GODZILLA movies, with Rocco battling one giant monster after another. (Yes, I realize that Stallone was simply taking a page from Real Life when he wrote a script based on Chuck Wepner's fight with Muhammad Ali, but he subsequently turned it all into one big comic book series.) One of the more interesting aspects of Cinderella MAN was the depiction of Max Baer. The fact that Baer DID, in fact, kill a man in the ring made him a fighter to be reckoned with (although the beating began with a rabbit punch- a blow to the back of his opponent's head) and the filmmaker's milk that notoriety for all it's worth. As a screen villain, 'Max Baer' is akin to the likes of Real Life full contact Middleweight Karate Champion Bill 'Superfoot' Wallace in A FORCE OF ONE: he comes across as a man fully capable of KILLING someone in the ring. In The Real World, Baer was 'The Clown Prince of Boxing,' and he often smiled or laughed aloud or even TAUNTED his opponents. In his dismantling of Primo Carnera (a former circus strongman who'd ALSO killed a man in the ring), he was at his belligerent best- but it took him longer than one might've imagined to do away with Carnera: he seemed to tire midway through the fight- but the reprieve was short-lived and the hapless Carnera eventually succumbed. Against Braddock, Baer never seemed to be able to get untracked. He often stiff-armed Braddock with his left to try to measure him for a right, but Braddock invariably derailed him by popping him in the mouth with a solid left jab. It's hard to tell from the fight films I've watched, but it LOOKS like Braddock bloodies Baer's mouth with that jab. Baer grinned once or twice when Braddock jabbed him in the mouth, but it quickly became clear that he didn't find it all that funny. He tried desperately to end it in the fifteenth and final round, but the thing that surprised me most was the fact that Braddock stood his ground and traded punches with Baer until the final bell. He had handily outboxed Baer. It remains to this day an inspirational Real Life success story. (And it didn't end with THIS fight: before he put the title on the line against Joe Louis, Braddock had a stipulation put into their contract that, should Louis win (he did), Braddock would get a percentage of his subsequent title defenses. Which he did.)",10,0,1,21 July 2014
Jurassic Park," Uniformly uneven performances...
","JURASSIC PARK has one thing above all else going for it: those dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the uneven performances of most of the cast tend to undermine even THOSE fx. Laura Dern appears BEMUSED throughout the whole thing, like a kid who's wandered onto a playground when in fact she was looking for an indoor outhouse; she appears oddly out of place. Likewise, Attenborough himself: he often seems to be waiting for direction. Goldblum constantly mutters to himself like he's stumbled into the wrong movie and can't figure out how to get out. His reactions to the monsters are almost sedate. Sam Jackson literally chain-smokes his way through his wantonly gratuitous scenes as if he has nothing better to do. The best performances are those of the dinosaurs. I guess THAT really sums this one up for me. It COULD'VE been Great, but is, ultimately, a mediocre movie with great fx.",7,1,3,21 July 2014
Valkyrie," Terrifying tale well told...
","Even Bryan Singer's near misses, like APT PUPIL (which punked out in the end, for understandable reasons) and SUPERMAN RETURNS (a needless remake of a needless movie, with more lapses of logic than a Michael Bey movie), are beautifully crafted. So is VALKYRIE. Unlike the two aforementioned movies, the latter also boasts (like THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the first two X-MEN movies) superior writing and outstanding performances all around. I must confess I rarely read posts by others on the IMDb, but I came across one at random that sought to point out (needlessly) that the man portrayed by Tom Cruise was a Nazi and an anti-Semite. What was the tip-off- the Nazi uniform? While an examination of such a man's mind-set might (or might not) be interesting, VALKYRIE is about a coup attempt against the twentieth century's greatest mass murderer. It's a suspenseful story, told as well as can be told, and is chock full of small but memorable moments. For me, the most memorable has to be the scene where the Cruise character, missing his right hand, is ordered to salute a superior. Just one moment among many. Highly recommended- or, as one of the characters puts it: 'You should hear what they have to say.'",10,4,6,22 May 2009
All the President's Men," Dogged determination...
","JOURNALISM 101- a.k.a., ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN- is a textbook example of how to uncover a story; that Woodward and Bernstein outed some of the most powerful political criminals in History is in itself laudatory, but it was their sheer determination that 'gotter done.' It's mind-boggling to think that what they uncovered Back Then didn't bring about the much-needed CHANGE in our now-legalized Corrupt system. (To make a movie about American politics as (mal-)practiced these days, it would perforce have to be as hilarious as it would be ludicrous. Imagine: LEGALIZED CORRUPTION, legalized by the Corrupt; the fixing of elections by family members of the candidates; the wanton invasions of any and all countries where planet-killing Toxins are discovered, just so the biggest and most powerful Company in the world- U$- can profit from Mass Suicide/Genocide; the arrogant ignorance of 'elected' officials who thumb their noses at anyone and everyone who questions their Ulterior Motives, etc.) There's absolutely NOTHING that Politicians of ANY Denomination should be hiding from the Public (who elected them in the first place): surveillance cameras should be on any business conducted in The White House, 24 hours a day, seven days a week- and any politician found LYING should be liable to prosecution by his/her constituents. Assessments should be made of every candidate: test their knowledge of American and World history. Any Mental or Physical Health problems should factor into their Eligibility for Office: and no one above Retirement Age should be in office of any kind; this would prevent Stasis. Any elected official should be paid Minimum Wage- take the monetary corruption out of politics; the only real incentive should be a desire to MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR ALL. All elections should be done by MAIL and ANY Bill or Amendment or Rider should be voted on by any and all Voters. And that's just for Starters...",10,1,1,30 January 2015
Evil Dead II," No-holds-barred...
","This time around, Sam Raimi throws in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink. It's an odd mix, bloody horror and slapstick humor (see Charlie Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR, in particular the scene where a man is lynched from a lightpost, and you'll understand what I'm getting at here). Not that it can't be done, of course; we've seen it done, and done well, in movies like THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, etc.;  but it was more than a little strange to walk into a theater to see the sequel to one of the spookiest shoestring-budget shockers of all time, THE EVIL DEAD, and find oneself laughing one's head off. Money changes everything. Raimi indulges himself (to the point of overindulgence), and yuck follows yick in this no-holds-barred assault on the senses. Although I prefer my horror straight, I'm also able to laugh when the opportunity presents itself, and Raimi kept me laughing throughout this one. EVIL DEAD II: DEAD BY DAWN qualifies as an immensely ENTERTAINING film, but I'm not sure if I'd classify it in any way as a 'horror' film (in title only, perhaps)...",8,1,2,3 February 2002
