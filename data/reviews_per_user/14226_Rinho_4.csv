Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great adventure moveie
","The film is great because of : action, Harry, Steven, great special effects. It´s better than the 2nd, it´s better than the 3rd, but it´s not as funny as the Last Crusade. Harry is my favourite actor of all time, aside Tom Hanks. Steven Spielberg is my favourite director of all time.",10,0,0,26 January 2000
American Beauty," The 2nd greatest film of 1999
","I Think 'American Beauty' is the second best film of 1999. The best film is 'The Sixth Sense'. I have one favorite part in this film. ItÂ´s when Ricky shows to Jane his favorite home video. That shows a bag which flies in front of a wall. I loved this moment... Also I think that Angela ( Mena Suvari ) is very beautiful and a very talented actress. The 5 Oscars American Beauty has won , American Angela has deserved.",10,0,0,11 October 2000

Jurassic Park," My favourite film
","I´m sorry for my English, I think you will find a few mistakes in my comment. But now I start the comment: Jurasssic Park. That´s ( one of ) my favourite film(s) of all time. I loved it from beginning to the end, esspecially the scene which in the T-rex  comes out of his area and starts to hunt the people. The action is great, the music too, Steven Spielberg ( the best director ever )does ( again ) a great job,the special effects are well-made, of course, too and just everything is great. I´ve only seen one Steven Spielberg film which I didn´t like, and that´s Close Encounters of the third kind. But all the other films of him ( Indy 1 - 3, Jaws, Duel, Jurassic Park 1 & 2, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER´S LIST ) impressed me a lot. I don´t understand why this film doesn´t get the Top250. I don´t understand why films like L.A.Confidential,Touch of Evil, The Godfather Part II, and get the Top250, but not this film. I´ve been interested in Dinosaurs my whole life and so this film is of course great. This isn´t anything like King Kong or Godzilla: The monster(s) must be killed, because we are human and we have the best technology of the world, we can win against the nature ( that´s no English I think ) and so on. This film shows that the dinosaurs are also animals like dogs, cats or fish ( but not sharks ). If you haven´t seen this film yet, GO AND SEE IT ! ! !",10,2,3,18 December 1999
