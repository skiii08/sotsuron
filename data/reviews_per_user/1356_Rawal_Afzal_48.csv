Blade Runner 2049," One of my life's most awful experiences on the big screen!!!
","I just cannot begin describing how for an utterly awful, pointless and boring two hours and 43 minute long piece this is. A piece of nonsense and garbage! I wonder what the point was to have it in 3D when there wasn't even a remote need of it.I know there'll be people out there who'd say that I didn't understand the film. Well, alright, I really have no further time than the 163 minutes that I already gave this dustbin to understand it. For the first time in life that I felt so bored in the cinema that I would've literally shot the screen had I had a weapon! I think the reason behind such extreme frustration from me for this particular film is its really long length.Avoid at all costs! Don't go by the positive reviews and the money that it must be making.",1,39,85,8 October 2017
Skyfall," The film makes no sense to me!
","So let me get this straight, this film is about Bond's brilliance, right? How come that he makes such a foolish plan which ultimately results in the death of the very person he was supposed to protect? He come that, let alone actually deserving a slap for such a failing plan, he is not even asked by anyone from the authorities above him?!Let me explain myself, the villain, the bad guy, wants to kill 'M', he however hasn't been successful in doing so after attacking her at a meeting, where Bond arrives at the last minute to rescue her, kudos to him. But then, instead of letting that woman rest peacefully at home (or somewhere) where she can have her security, Bonds thinks of a plan on how to catch Silva: to be on the move all alone with M, to use her as a prey to invite Silva. Silva arrives, injures M to the extent that she dies of her wound (the mission hence fails), Bond himself kills Silva. How utterly daft is that?!Apart from that, the film was slow in pace and got boring at times, but some good action and thrilling moments makes me still give it five stars. How generous of me!",5,4,8,10 November 2015
United 93," It has the ability to have an affect on you like not many films can!
","The fear, the panic, the chaos.... all of it is depicted in an amazing manner. The film is very short, to the point, and full of thrilling moments. The last 15 minutes or so almost leave you with tears in eyes and make you feel like one of the passengers going through the horror. For a moment one feels as if to vow to never travel by air.One most emotional aspect of it was how people in it bravely decide to take on the hijackers and devise a plan. How I wish that they had been completely successful with their plan and had been able to land the plan safely after fully rescuing it from all four hijackers. Regardless, them being able to prevent the hijackers from reaching the aimed target itself is a great story of success and I salute them for that.One annoying thing about the film was the noise and constant, loud chatter in the control rooms. 'There is a hijack', 'No, there isn 't', 'We go this way', 'No this idea is better.' The noise causes headaches an hour into the film. I respect that this is how might have been the case on that chaotic morning in September, but a film should always be made differently, with the aim being to engage the viewers.",9,0,1,30 July 2015
Argo," A chase all the way down to the runway!
","I understand that lot of spicy stuff has to be added to a film even if it is based on true events, but I have this habit of liking films that are based on real happenings, to whatever extent possible. Although the film starts off as a bit too noisy, but slowly it progresses and gets better and better, and its best part arrives when the agent arrives in Iran. His plan initially sounds a bit strange and impracticable, but the ending makes one realise what a masterpiece it turns out to be!Those minutes from where leaves for the airport,... unbelievable suspense and the aforementioned moments are such nail-biting ones! It gets thrilling and more thrilling! Absolute heart-stopping moments when the revolutionary guards find out about their true identity and chase all the way down to the runway and then bhoom, the plane takes off just at the right moment. I would rate that as one of the most thrilling moments ever that I have watched in films, wow!I have now watched three Ben Affleck films now (the others being 'The Town' 2010 and 'Gone Girl' 2014) and have given them all full marks. He is a genius!",10,0,5,19 August 2015
Zodiac," A very engaging film
","I thought this was quite an intriguing and engaging thriller that very well manages to keep one on his toes.Best of all where some heart-stopping moments, such as the killings shown that the Zodiac killer conducted, and the scene where Robert Graysmith gets a scare in the basement of that man. That almost made my younger sister scream.The good thing about films based on true events is that you can't really point to too many plot-holes, since it is shown as it is in reality, and I suppose this is what makes this feel much more realistic than many of the other mystery killer films.One blot on the film though has to be its length. It is so long that somewhere around in the middle of it the film loses its pace for a while and all the chatter begins to cause headache. It should have been at least 25 minutes shorter than it was.Overall though, a seriously good film.",9,2,4,22 November 2015
The Terminator," Gripping and entertaining!
","First of all, the background music is a killer, absolutely mind-blowing and amazingly fitting to the film.As I wrote in my review for 'Aliens' (1986), I am quite reluctant to watch old films, however it was that film that convinced me that James Cameron is a man whose films transcend all such barriers and his works are meant for any era and are ever green. This has only added more to my belief and I am awe of this one as well. The best bit for me in the film has to be the ending scenes where the terminator had to be killed three times, of which the best was when he shows up for the third and the last time without legs. Assured that they can't get it wrong twice I thought him to be dead, as I shouted a loud 'Oh' my God!' when he attacks them for the third time. His death was intelligently shown as a crushing from which he could never have recovered.Personally though I had bit of a funny experience as, having watched 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991) I was influenced into thinking that here too Arnold Schwarzenegger would be the hero but scene after scene my expectations of a hero weren't being met and it was when he attacks Sarah Connor for the first time and the other guy saves her, it's that where I got things right. Hahaha!All in all, the terminator film concept itself is one the most unique and worthy of appreciation. Clearly a work of a hugely capable and creative mind.And once again, the background music is a beauty! I can listen to it again and again and never get bored. It has that touch of inspiring you and make you feel like that the war is real, or even better, that you are a part of it all.",10,2,3,24 August 2015
The Town," Thoroughly enjoyable!
","What a wonderful film! I can go on and on writing positive things about the film, but one aspect that I would really like to highlight is, is its ending. Extremely realistic and the kind of approach that people take in real life.Thrilling, keeps you on your toes throughout and is one of the best heist films. The best thing about it being that right through, till the very end, one gets the feeling that the guy will not be able to flee and would eventually get caught, but he doesn't. Throughout you deal with a fear, yet in the end it proves out to be nothing. A thing where it differentiate from a lot of heist films is, the guy/team were never shown to be any smart players, or masterminds of any kind. It was all so real and it just happened, you know.Again, in short, a brilliant film!",10,1,3,15 July 2015
Shutter Island," A film that plays with you, makes a fool out of you!
","I really love this film. Today is the third time I have watched this, each time with a new person, each time kind of fooling the person sitting next to you. So today it was my elder sister and her husband, throughout I keep on feeding them with what Andrew Laeddis assumes the mental asylum to be, and then, boom, they discover that all that they had been thinking, all that they had come to know so far is all wrong. I love that feeling, haha! My sister is currently having a severe headache!Actually, I can very well relate to what goes through your mind watching it, since it fooled me like everyone else. It goes like this, till before the last 15 minutes.....'Great film! Brilliantly highlights how cheap humans can be at times and how cruel they can be on one another. Pretty much shows how low we can fall. Extremely disturbing, sad and frustrating because of what innocent people have to go through.'But then, after the ending, I was left to laugh at myself and to admire this masterpiece. I thought it was a bit similar to 'Momento' (2000) in a sense considering the ending.The IMDb summary goes like: 'In 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels is investigating the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane and is presumed to be hiding near-by.'Well, there is not even a percent of truth to this if you see the ending!So a big thumbs up to this masterpiece, which was of course into its full flow thanks to such a brilliant performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, and actually by everyone.",10,0,2,18 September 2016
The Revenant," A Leonardo DiCaprio special in the greatest survival film ever!
","Firstly, I must state here that I was so confused about what the title of my post should be because I could think of so many. It is the most painful, hurting and brutal film that I have watched in my life. All of it had such great realness to the film that it was impossible not to feel Hugh Glass' pain and suffering, to the extent that I almost felt like crying at some of the scenes. Leonardo's unbelievably awesome performance has left me speechless. Hats off to such a brilliant actor, wow!This film has involved my emotions like not many films have, and reading that some of it was in fact inspired from true events has left me struck (and most of my praise, if not all, obviously applies to the book that this film is based upon). The realness of it made me reflect on what life could turn out to be for some souls and what great trials and ordeals life can demand from some people, and how fortunate we are after all in life despite the constant complaining. Walking out of the theatre, neither myself nor my brother-in-law could utter a word for a good 10 minutes. There was this heaviness in the voice.The start itself was a dazzling one with that shoot-out, it made me feel that we in for a good film, but then came the mauling from that bear. Despite it being a film, I bet it couldn't have ever been more real than this. It sent shivers down my spine, and the second time it attacked him I literally felt his pain and utter humiliation. One of the most terrifying scenes ever!Then came the scene that was personal to me to the extremes; when they leave Hugh alone to die in the forest. Now, this is not the first time someone was abandoned in a film, but the injuries had so much hindered his physical movement that he was completely dependent on others' help. Despite facing so much in life bravely and with a smile on my face, and it is something that my family members often laugh about, it is an established fact that right from my childhood days my biggest fear has always been being left alone (and this fear developed after an incident in childhood). I can't bear it, never can! For example, if my father is alone at home with me, he has to first alert me even going to the balcony and has to return within a given time frame. So adding that personal touch to it, coupled with the earth shattering scene of his son being murdered before his eyes, and then not even being able to tell due to the temporary loss of speech caused by the injuries, it almost made me cry.Then we proceed to his survival, which is perhaps an even more touching part of the film. He crawls, he fights, he eats things that we might end up vomiting by the mere thought of it, he sleeps 'In the horse' (yes, that is literal, not metaphorical in any sense!), and reaches his people, takes his revenge. Every scene of it deserves an essay written on it. Amidst all this, the cinematography deserves a special mention. This film is scenic beauty and contains awesome pictures of mountains, streams, trees, and of course, the relentless snow! It added a perfect mix to the story and wonderful performances.'As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe... keep breathing.' This is brilliant, and in every way inspirational and a lesson for anyone struggling in his life. There's nothing more beautiful than your own life, therefore fight to keep it. It is your very existence, and once gone it won't return. Somehow, these quotes sounded better and more powerful in the language that he spoke and reading these lines translated on the screen felt more catching to the memory.It is, again, one of the most unique films that I have watched in my life. Since it felt so real, what I watched yesterday was not a film. It was reality, or in better words, the brutal aspects of reality. I have so many things to say about the film... I am eagerly waiting to talk to her tomorrow on Skype and tell her the details of a once in a lifetime cinema experience.",10,2,9,14 January 2016
Dunkirk," Two hours in the war zone, Nolan's best work!!! Hans Zimmer you beauty!!!
","What a fabulous film, what a great depiction of the battlefield. Nolan has doubtlessly pulled off his best work and one that he'll himself find it hard to surpass. Right from the scene where the first aerial attack takes place and the Allied soldier trying to gun down the plane gets wiped away from the earth, the film never looks back and provides one gripping moment after another. The dogfight between the air forces yet will forever go down as the most thrilling scenes in the history of any war film. Mind-blowing work!As many World War Two films do, this doesn't resort to showing blood and gore, or deformed dead bodies to depict a war (which isn't necessarily wrong), but yet makes the point of the horror of a war in a most eloquent way. It seems as if Nolan had over the years been watching war films as a layman instead of a film-maker, and had realised that the public is demanding for something more than just deformed dead bodies. Yet on the other hand, it doesn't show any false bravado on part of the Allied forces. It just depicts the reality of the battlefield, and gives a hint of Forces beyond their control having made it happen.Hans Zimmer's background music will forever be remembered as the ultimate decoration of any Nolan film. That music was killing and created nail-biting suspense even in moments of relief, coupled with it the sound effects that make you feel as if bullets are coming your way from every direction - another highlight of epic film-making. I'd a time of my life, two most thrilling hours ever spent at a cinema. #ThankYouNolan - thank you for the heart palpitations and the shortness of breath!-------Now, let me address some of the criticism directed at this film by a minority of people, two of which were my brother and my brother-in- law, who went to watch it yesterday with me (first time by the way that I've walked out of the cinema with a split opinion with anyone that I've gone in to watch a film). Yes, the film doesn't show a background or even a short history for the laymen watching of the Battle of Dunkirk. So anyone going into it with expectations of a proper story will be disappointed, as will be those who haven't done any bit of a research on the battle.Secondly, yes it has no characters and doesn't even show a single German soldier, and as a last bit of the criticism, omits reactions or the talks of the people in command from either sides, or discussions from the offices as to what the plan is to get them evacuated and how much under stress they're regarding this, or how the Germans are plotting to attack them. But that's not criticism, that's a misinterpretation of the purpose of this film. Showing all of that to please some viewers would make it a film, and this isn't a film. This a literal presentation of what war is or what the happenings of the surroundings of a battlefield are. Ask yourself, if you were amongst the Allied soldiers stuck there, would you on that beach have an idea of what the people higher up are planning to save you, or what the Germans are plotting? No! The problem is, showing any of that would make it a film with breaks and stopages and will never give you the feel of a battlefield. A war zone, a battlefield is exactly like this and it offers no time to wipe a sweat from your forehead. It is relentless, it is unfair and it constant. Watching it, by the 40th or the 50th minute I myself was exhausted and was saying that such a film should have an interval of 15 minutes, but again, the battlefield has no intervals and being exhausted is a part of it. There are moments when you scratch your head as to whose plane is flying overhead, but here too one has to study to understand that it is after this particular battle that the Allied forces chose to draw a colour- based distinction on their planes for identification. So here again Nolan makes you go through exactly what the Allied soldiers on the ground had to.I'm a fan of Nolan but not a huge fan. I criticise his films when I don't like it, but here he has succeeded tremendously in making you as an audience feel like a soldier effected by it. It's a project, not a film. As for characters and a story, a war does have a story, but a battlefield doesn't. A battlefield just has gunshots, grenades and bombs, and soldiers fighting for survival. At most, the only criticism that I can remotely accept is that the action or the plot didn't have a prelude, which would've been useful for a layman watching this film without having studied the Battle of Dunkirk, But again, Nolan has his own thought process here and it has its own justification.All in all, 100 out of 10 for this masterpiece. I wouldn't mind it getting a well deserved Oscar. Nolan and co. have richly deserved it.",10,7,14,1 August 2017
Aliens," Way, way ahead of its times! I am awestruck!
","'Titanic' 1997 is my most favourite Hollywood film, add to that 'Avatar' 2009 and ' Terminator 2: Judgment Day' 1991, it is an easy guess to make what I think of film- maker James Cameron. However, I am someone who is a bit reluctant to watch old films, however critically acclaimed they may be, just because I feel that sometimes a film may be great for the era it is made and we, the people from our generation for example, may find flaws after flaws. Although some of my all-time favourite films are from years ago but still, very few.Despite this, I decided to give 'Alien' 1979 a go and it was good. I gave it eight out of 10 and admired it for the era it was made in, but this one transcends everything. This is a great film for any age and I am still not able to fully recover from it, merely thinking that this is 29 years old film. It is a tremendous and mind-blowing film! I would give it 20 out of 10. Full of brilliant action, great from the technological aspect as well (particularly that device telling them how far away an alien is) and the last 30 minutes or so are gripping, thrilling in the best form and move from scene to scene with great pace.The best scene from the film for me has to be that suicide hand grenade attack on that alien. Hair raising stuff and an out of the world scene!Here's a salute to James Cameron! Here I am waiting for my brother to come home just to be able to tell him how far ahead of his times this great man runs.",10,1,4,16 August 2015
The Conjuring 2," Scary as hell!
","The film might have had faults, and it did, but I have a habit of going light on films that fulfill its purpose. The purpose of this one was to scare the hell out of you, and by God it deserves hundred percent marks for doing that so well. Not a minute goes by without killing suspense. The best of the lot was the knocking on the door, which I am sure they must have done using a hammer or something. It was terrifying, every little scene.What was so unique about this horror flick was, and I have only watched a handful of those in my entire life, that the ghost in this one did his tricks when when other people were present. It usually goes like this in films that they make a target and then that target goes through all the haunting, he/she isn't trusted by anyone because the ghost goes completely missing when others are present. Here was a ghost with a clear thought process and a brave one too. Secondly, the usual script is that it takes off lightly and keeps getting stronger, but each scene in this film has been given equal and as much attention as for example an ending scene would. It was balanced out intelligently. So it was a lot different from many of the mainstream horror films. The film- makers deserve a huge amount of credit for making it feel so real. There might have been many other horror flicks that caused me nightmares in childhood and made me many sleepless nights, but as a grown-up into mid-20s, I can definitely attest that I haven't seen a film like this. Terrifying!A bit sad that I only got time to watch this one nine days into its release over here in Germany. There were hardly eight people present in the theatre, two girls who screamed occasionally and were very noisy, but couldn't quite have the added fun that I did whilst watching 'Annabelle' (2014), which was a full house and very noisy (the noise is only good for a film of this genre mind you, not many others).I was most curious about the whole story this film was based upon and did some reading into it. Interesting stuff. Whilst not necessarily needing to come to believe in ghosts and demons, I still respect what the family might have gone through back then. As someone who has been through a lot of medical conditions, some of which may sound outrageous to others, I have learnt that we should respect others' experiences and suffering. I'll just leave at that, without the need to get into whether the family played a prank, whether it could be a mental condition of the girl that might have led the family into believing that something else is going on, or even, again, there were demons indeed. You never know when the day might arrive that you suffer from something and no one believes you, therefore, I will just respect their experience.Watching this film has reminded me of a couple of fears that I had in my childhood for example. One which stayed with me till we moved to Germany was, that whilst being asleep a dog would come and bite off my feet. This had history. Back in our village we used to sleep outside the rooms in summer, and a dog from our neighbourhood was notorious for having previously bitten people. As it happened, it climbed the wall and landed in our house, by a whisking passing by by uncovered feet. That frightening moment stayed on for months and months. The other being, watching a horror drama on some Pakistan TV channel. Actor Nabeel, who now works in the comedy TV serial 'Bulbulay' on ARY Digital, worked in it and would haunt his mother at night who masterminded his death in an accident. He would walk from one wall of the house to the other at nights, muttering 'Aeyh zaalim maa'n (O' cruel mother)!' That was horrible for me! For months afterwards I regretted watching it, and only I know how much I went through and how much time I took to come out of them.Lastly, I must add something outrageous here. Now, had I seen any pictures or videos of the film, or even had slight knowledge of this, I wouldn't have watched the film, or at least not taken my brother with myself. Coming straight to the point, the house in it, its shape, form and appearance from outside 10 out of 10 matches to the building in which my brother has an apartment. I was left speechless at the very first sight of the house from outside and from then on we both watched the film with as much personal touch as not many would possibly have.",10,3,8,24 June 2016
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," Your chance to meet MS Dhoni!
","As a huge fan of MS right from the time of very first substantial score that he made in 2005, there's this pretty much impossible desire to meet him, to get to know him a a personal level, even if for five minutes it may be. Having watched this film and to have through it got to know so many of the untold things about him and his life, it feels as if that wish has been fulfilled, right here at my own place. I was so sure of it being a good film that I got photos clicked of myself whilst the starting scenes ran on the TV. Just for the memories.When Sushant walks in to bat in the very beginning, the film completely over-takes my whole being and from then on it becomes a journey, a ride, an atmosphere that you live with him. I thought Emraan did tremendously as Azharuddin in 'Azhar' (2016), but Sushant was equally impressive and in fact mind-blowing at copying MS' style, his stroke-play, the walk to the wicket and the trigger movements on the way. I noticed that black spot too below the left eye, that MS has. The beginning and the ending scenes themselves are worth millions and a piece of very intelligent film-making to evoke the emotions of the public.It was very emotional, any angle you look at it from; whether from the hard-work that he'd to put in, the set-backs he's had to suffer on the way, or the achievements he went on to make. What stands above all is the the tragic death of his girlfriend in a car crash, whilst he was playing cricket in another country (there're differing reports as to when it happened. Some say it was whilst he went on a tour for the India A team).The most fun part of course was discovering how and from whom he learnt the helicopter shot, a shot that signifies the man's unorthodox character. I find it very heartening on his part to have given someone else the deserved credit for his trademark shot.Despite MS' request against it, some over the top glorification is always expected, given that films need heroes, and so too is the minor tweaking of the details and the timings of the events, but it remains overall a pretty solid film that I can watch again and again, and can't help but place it amongst my all-time favourites. So a big thumbs up to everyone involved!Also, during his career itself, the film serves as a timely reminder for those of his critics who always credit his success as captain to him being just lucky. We may not like a sportsman, or criticise him, but we should respect the hard-work put in by anyone of them to have reached it to the highest levelDetailed write-up: http://textuploader.com/d5jx2",10,2,3,18 October 2016
The Pianist," A compelling story of a fortunate man
","I thought this was a brilliant film. A fantastic adaption of the real life events of a pianist who survived. His survival itself is an interesting story. He is no clever or sharp-minded person who escaped situation, he is shown as just a common guy who feared death and suffered from hunger. He is just shown to have been fortunate on occasions. This itself makes it a compelling drama worthy of admiration.This was my first film on the atrocities on Jews by Nazis. Some of the scenes were very depressing, the most one of them being where the Nazi Army throws a physically disabled old man from the balcony together with his wheelchair. This stunned and silenced my younger sister, whom I had to help moving on from that scene to watch the rest of the film.The most heartening and poetic scene for me was the scene where Captain Hosenfeld asks for Szpilman for his own rescue, and even better to see Szpilman being himself willing to help the former. So the ending scene was a cherry on top.",10,0,1,24 October 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," It is a great story of the application of thinking powers to get freedom
","I first watched it the last year and have ever since gone through this one about seven to eight times. It is my second most favourite Hollywood film ever after 'Titanic' (1997) and I keep recommending it to every person that I befriend or get to know.The greatness of the film lies not only in its smart plot and concept, but also in the perfect combination on display of emotions and inspiration. It depicts the bond between a human and an ape/animal in a way that it feels like a story of a father and a son. The suffering of Caesar and others is so well shown that when the apes' turn comes you unintendedly find yourself rooting for them. The plans of Caesar and the way he applies them and the way he uses his thinking powers is such an amazing thing in the film, especially the way he successfully crosses the bridge with his 'troops'. His plan of sending a half of his followers to under the bridge and the other half to above it is simply mind-blowing planning!I in fact find myself asking whether I have ever seen a better hero than Caesar in all my life from the films that I have ever watched.",10,3,5,30 July 2015
Get Out," The hype is fully well deserved!
","My friend from Canadian recommended this (although I'd have watched it anyway, as I do with most of the well rated new releases), and he spoke very highly of it. So I was just eagerly waiting for its release in Germany.This film goes down as one of the greatest mystery films of all times, as simple as that. The turns and the twists that it follows as the mystery unfolds are jaw-dropping, disturbing and scary. The connection put between one event and the next is really commendable and gripping. The weird behaviour by everyone over their, especially the black servants, builds one's interest in a way that it never dies down. The suspense is killing.... So a highly enjoyable film, a very unique concept and a film that I 'm sure to watch many more times! Here I wait for its release on BluRay and DVD.....",10,6,17,7 May 2017
The Theory of Everything," A brilliant film on a brilliant man that was made even better by Eddie Redmayne's stunning performance
","It is a brilliant film, as good as a biopic can be in all honesty. It is sad in many ways, to the extent in fact that throughout the whole length of the film I sat with a heavy heart and with a lump in my throat, but at the same time it allows us to celebrate the career and the achievements of a man highly capable and most determined to fight himself more than anything/anyone else. The scene where he breaks down in tears when his wife suggests of herself finally wanting to part from him is just..... If I see that again it could potentially lead me to depression. I would need days to get over it.A special mention for Eddie Redmayne. For a moment I had myself asking whether this is the Professor himself acting in the film! Equally, I would like to mention the film-makers for making his physical appearance look so similar.I can relate to a thousand things from the film and his life, yet on the other hand a lot of the things not because I have yet lived a third of his life. Most memorable one for me keeping in mind my personal experiences, has to be the bit about tracheotomy and the loss of speech caused by it. I could have had to face exactly the same but since thankfully mine was a less severe case I went against the advice of the doctors and was rewarded for my hard work and determination by regaining the ability to breathe independently (except whilst asleep) within weeks by training so hard. So the moment it was mentioned and alongside it him losing speech, it hit me hard, as it did to elder sister who watched the film with me. I wasn't willing on her to join me knowing how for an impact it could have on her, but I couldn't ask her to leave the room, the result of which is that she keeps mentioning the film again and again and is finding it difficult to forget it.It is a overall a very sensitive topic to comment on much, so I would refrain from doing that, but there perhaps a few things that could have been done or managed differently in order for him to avoid a lot of troubles and the heartaches that he had to bear, but again we have to keep in mind that the events discussed are from many, many years ago and people back then thought differently about things as we might do in this age. Also, this is hindsight for you, and it is a lot easier to analyse others' lives than to be in someone else's place.Again, a brilliant film from every angle. I was recommended this by a friend in an email.",10,0,3,6 January 2016
Schindler's List," Schindler's divine and sacred list!
","Before I proceed to add any comments on the film, I must simply salute to this great human-being. Compassion and love is the most natural state of us humans, any other emotions of hatred, rage and violence are an alteration of our very being and existence. It is most commendable of Mr. Schindler to have stuck to his natural state amidst all the violence and the preaching of extreme hatred for Jews, amidst a world war to put it best. It is a perception that rich people care the least about the poor and the suffering, but above all is God Almighty's unbeatable Law of descending good people amongst bad people, and vice versa, and here he descended an angel in the form of a rich business, the best option, for the Jews who'd been suffering hopelessly. I smiled when he said to his secretary that if the German army becomes suspicious of the incompetent works done in his factory he'd buy ammunition and weapons from some other factory and then sell it to the army to keep things in control. A masterminded person!It was so touching and heartening to see him instead of feeling satisfied at his achievement or taking pride in it, he chose to cry and curse himself for having not saved even more lives and for not having used earlier opportunities to take this path. He cursed his rich lifestyle and the expensive things he bought for himself instead of spending even more money to save even more lives. Truly a sign of a great human-being who chose to reflect on his flaws instead of the good works he did, which itself was a huge, huge risk that could've cost him not only his status, business and money but also life if the army could've got even a minor sniff of it.On the film, since it was based on true events I can't really find faults and point to things they could've done differently. So no issues with it. However, two things annoyed me a bit, the first of which being it being in black and white. It prevented me from getting a good feel of the atmosphere, the surroundings and the whole drama. I felt as if I was looking at the screen from a place very far. So this wasn't a smart move on Spielberg's part in my view. By the way, I mean no disrespect to the films of years ago which were in black and white anyway. They'd to be shot that way and you as a viewer understood the limitation of the film-maker, but that can't be said of a film released in 1993.Secondly, although I fully admit that the film had to be full in every detail and very spread out with explanatory scenes, but still feel it could've been shortened at least by 20 minutes. Three hours is just way to long for a film of which its entertainment value is its least strength.In general, films on suffering and pain shouldn't be that long, never. Since such films are low on entertainment, the aim should be to make the viewer stayed focused throughout, and if the film turns out to be as long as three hours then somewhere in the middle of it you'll find the viewers scratching their head, looking left and right, talking to others in order to re-find their focus after a few minutes break. In short, such films should be shorter in length.",8,9,13,13 July 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Alright action and 3D effects coupled with a boring story!
","This is my first film from this particular series. If the earlier ones are anything to go by this installment, I'd have to conclude that it's vastly over-rated and pretty boring - or at least, this one is.The action and the 3D effects do wake one up in between and begin to catch your interest a bit, but then the slow plot and in fact a very nonsense kind of story diminishes everything.As a side-note, is that what Captain Jack Sparrow is all about? In this one at least, he plays the role of a passenger who's carried by others, and circumstances, here and there with him being in control of not even an ante. Some of his dialogues do provide a good comic relief, but surely that's not why they cast Johnny Depp? His role was nothing less than that of a joker.",5,6,16,27 May 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The film-maker needs to see a psychiatrist!
","I know the title of my review is very insulting, and I fully realise this, and very rarely, like once in five years, do I ever take on an individual with such harsh words or write about someone in such a manner. I say this with an apology in advance to Quentin Tarantino and his fans, but this guy seriously needs help.Hell no, don't get me wrong. I do not to prefer to watch films that portray the bubble that I am living it. I am in fact very fond of hard hitting films that make you realise how brutal life can be, or how brutal a human-being can be, or still, how for a suffering death can be. To point an example, I absolutely loved the war film 'Fury' (2014) and recently, I have been awestruck, spell-bound and absolutely blown away by 'Revenant' (2015). The difference between these being, those, and possibly many other films that depict so much brutality, had a story, a plot, an aim, a purpose. The purpose, aim, the very reason for this films seems like violence, blood, brutality.After I watched my first film by him, 'Django Unchained' (2012), I really kept asking myself who the director is. After searching his name, I literally stamped it on my head not to watch his films again, because his fascination for violence was apparent from merely one film. How right I was! Today, just now, I googled his name to get his name's spelling right in this write-up, I found this quote:'Violence is one of the most fun things to watch.'Now, the important question, why did I watch this piece of gutter? Well, I made the mistake of not reading the film-maker's name when I organised this film for myself. Still, 15-20 minutes into it I guessed whose brainchild this could be, but I went through it for the sake of it, and to confirm whether my conclusion after watching just one film by him was right or not. Well, at least I have my answer, an answer which in short is the title of this review.",1,2,6,19 January 2016
Jurassic World," I can watch its as many shows as possible and still never get tired of it!
","I watched it back in June when it was released and couldn't think to compose much of a review, but I watched its second show on Wednesday and I have to admit that I enjoyed it even more and was able to understand it a lot better.It will be a harsh thing to say if people think that this is all about action and there is not much of a plot or story-line. No there is, and quite on the contrary in fact, I think the overall plot is quite a brilliant one. Let's be fair on this, the first one although had a much more logical and better story than the second or the third part, but it was still quite a simple and easy one: experts visit the park in order to issue a cerificate, hell breaks out, that is it (no disrespect intended to the great spectacle that it was back in 1993. It has all my respect and a great coincidence might be that I have at home and just around 50 minutes ago watched it with my brother-in-law's brother).This one however revolves around a much harder plot, one that is not as easy to come up with. So as it goes, in order to win more vistors to the park and to make it more attractive, they think of coming up with something bigger and scarier. In all this, the mistake they make is, they make it a raptor, an animal hugely intelligent. So, whereas it wasn't bigger or scarier than they intended (to make it), but it was surely way more intelligent than that thought. All of a sudden, they realise that they have made a monster, an animal that is now beyond their control. This surely sounds like a great plot to me. Questions might be raised about the aspect of that army-man who jumped into it out of nowhere, coming up with the idea of using these beasts for war, but that still was kind of a sub-story, running on the lines of the main plot. So neither that disturbed me much to be honest.So, 10 out of 10 not only for the action, but also for a pretty smart story-line and a good, sensible build up and connection from scene to scene. Sure enough there must be flaws, but I have this tendency of being generous on films that are able to entertain me.",10,39,98,24 July 2015
Silence," Poses some powerful questions but provides zero answers!!!!
","It started off as something very unique and extraordinary, then you prepare yourself for the path that it takes, but then comes such a twist (by showing Rodrigues dying with a crucifix in his hand) that makes you feel robbed off a good ending, makes you question the whole purpose of those 160 minutes.It's really confusing as to which idea or what concept this film sides with.1. That, that faith can be practised even privately even after apostatising? That's problematic because they then shouldn't shown Rodrigues help the Japanese government further Christians who'd try to sneak in Christianity-related symbols and objects as means of propagating the religion. Why doesn't Rodrigues make even a slight attempt at saving a single Christiant by not even pretending not to have known that a certain symbols/object was a Christianity-related one? How would such an act go with God - that is, the act of helping the others catch and punish your fellow believers?2. If it favours faith and also shows that it can still be practised privately, then why did they've to make Father Ferreira's argument to Rodrigues sounds so convincing? It suddenly sounded as if it's against the concept of Christianity.3. If, again, the purpose was to show that faith never dies and can never be taken out of an individual who believes no matter what the circumstances are, then why did they show on countless instances Rodrigues question himself and his faith? Such scenes actually gave a strong feeling that it questions the purpose and the idea of faith.4. If it's whole idea was to criticise the Church, then at least this film hardly holds the right to point fingers at Church/Christianity/faith because it's exactly as confusing and impractical as it portrays faith to be.Make no mistake, this film poses some powerful questions with the circumstances that it creates: for example, showing Rodrigues question himself as to what Jesus would've done in his situation, a unique situation where he's given the choice to apostatise in order to save other people's lives. A powerful question indeed, because, as it is, the Bibical account is solely of Jesus tolerantly facing the violence upon himself which, as hard as it is, is still a decision and a choice that brings far less regret than when someone else is killed because of your action, or inaction in this instance. But here too, it shows something strange: Jesus' voice is heard by Rodrigues which actually asks him to step on that symbol, which is a fair interpretation of the noble man that Jesus of Nazareth was, but why doesn't the same voice guide and stop him from helping the Japanese government in catching other Christians?Kichijiro's repeated offences and confessions were a masterpiece though and extremely thought-provoking, and Rodrigues questioning himself about him and whether Jesus would forgive such a man too was very powerful.Coupled with that, I loved the atmosphere that it shows of the persecution of Christians and how for a fearful life it must've been for the minority of any faith living in a place where any day could bring about your death; and equally creative yet very painful were the punishments shown that they handed to the people caught by them. However, the thing remains that the film this film had the ingredients of all-time greatness, but chooses to take a route that confuses you more and more. It pretends to be knowing the answers, but in the end doesn't have a single solution.",5,0,1,30 March 2017
Everest," I felt the cold in the theatre!
","A majestic 3D experience and one that had full entertainment value. The funny thing was, both my brothers-in-law argued after walking out of the theatre that it was pretty cold inside, and whereas I kept quiet and let it be, the truth is that it wasn't. Although the season of autumn has taken its full effect, yesterday however was a pretty warm day as none of us wore jackets or pullovers; so there is no way that it could be cold inside, it was just the affect of what we were watching on the big screen in 3D. The great thing about the film is that the environment is such that viewers watching in theatres are bound to get a good feel of the experience of the climbers, and hence their suffering. One thing though, I would have waited a couple of months more and released this film in November or so, which would have allowed for it to have an even greater affect on people watching it.Even though I know that this film is based on true events, I refrained from reading anything about the tragedy to avoid spoilers. I must add here that it is a thing very filmy to see someone going to rescue others and getting stuck, eventually dying himself, but in Robb Hall's case it indeed turned out to be true. Quite a hero he was I must admit. A brave guy. The film was going well and as one that one would rate as above good, but the tragic ending sealed the deal for me and made it a great, great film. Having had no knowledge of the event, I was stunned and shocked in the end seeing him dead, and saddened of course.Andy's death for me was the most horrible scene. The first thing that I did after reaching home was to study whether such a condition exists - the one of feeling overheating despite being in the cold.All in all, a brilliant film. The best thing that they did probably was to show the pictures of the people that they made the film on and to end the film with the picture of Rob's daughter. A very sweet gesture!",10,2,7,22 September 2015
Avatar," The greatest work of fiction!
","Yes indeed, this film is the greatest piece of fiction ever to come out from any film industry I would say. The new world, their systems, their 'humans', the animals, the birds, a whole new language for God's sake! It is an amazing and out of the world piece of imagination, and I can't even begin to imagine how much of hard-work and dedication it must have required. It is the highest earning Hollywood film ever, an achievement fully deserved! Watching it for the third time in my life I went through the entire film with a smile on my face. A smile that one wears when you are really enjoying something, and I did every bit of just thinking that this dream-world is a product of someone's fantasies. It is the kind of film that I would stand up for at the end to clap in the theatre. The most impressive thing for me has to be its language. The production of those avatars just to be able to have people like them as well was quite unique I thought.The most clever part of the film was, the person who later on turns to be one to stand in their favour and to appreciate their world, was shown as a physically disabled person, so he was in the best position to judge the physical beauty of the entirely different world. He was bound to appreciate it more just for the physical freedom and abilities that he could enjoy in it. Basically, his whole world had changed, making him automatically feel to belonging more to them than his former life and world.The fact that we had here been thrown into an absolute new world meant that it needed for the to be as long in length as it was. So I am kind of coming up with a justification for the only flaw that I could think of.All in all, it is stunning and more of an experience than a film, the kind of experience that I would get if I was to visit a country, or something.",10,3,6,23 August 2015
Stalingrad," The concept of a burning hell needs a re-think!
","You could literally say that it was, well, frozen hell. It is a brilliant depiction of the horrors of a war, the Battle of Stalingrad, and how the reality is far different to the concept of heroism, the glorification of war and all that nonsense. It is a great example of how the army generals, the heads of the state rest in their homes and give directives to do this and that, and see it all is some sort of sacred and holy undertaking, but on the battlefield it is bloody, it is scary and not to be glorified in the first place.The film is a very sad one.... It hits you with reality. It revolves around soldiers who are tired of the nonsense, want to go home, be with their families and are looking for ways and excuses to escape from the horror. Their conscious does not bother them, it does not call them cowards, for above all they are humans first, like us, they do not want to be killed and tortured, they do not want to play with blood all the time. This is the reality, heroes-like soldiers is greatly imaginary. The ending scene where they die in the cold is one of the saddest scenes that I have ever watched. It had such sever after-effects on me that I thought of this all night. A brilliant scene!A great film overall but the blot on it had to be that it took too long to materialise and get to the main point, the point mentioned above. The battle scenes last for too long and that is something that I do not appreciate much.",8,1,3,13 October 2015
Don't Breathe," Amongst the best this year! A jaw-dropping film!
","Wow wow, just wow! What an incredible film! Gripping, thrilling, a heart-stopper of the highest order, one which is actually a lot more scarier than a mainstream horror film! I'm in awe of it.It is so, so engaging that you unintentionally find yourself practising calm breathing sitting in the hall!Given the reviews, I'd gone in with a lot of expectations from this one, hardly minutes into it the dog scene gives you an early indication of what you're in for, and trust me it keeps getting better and better. Despite its very, very short length, the suspense is so draining that you get the feeling as if you've been in for three hours!I haven't watched too many better thrilling films than this, and from the ones released this year, I'd rate this one as the best alongside 'The Conjuring 2' and 'The Revenant' (which was actually released this year in Germany). Really tough to pick the best one from these, but are surely miles ahead of the others that I've watched at least.Although everyone acted really well and did full justice to their respective roles, but Stephen Lang's facial expression alone during the hunting alone is worthy of being written about for pages. It's all easy to pull of a blind's man roles with black glasses put on, it is another to actually roam around in a way that really makes you look like being someone whose eyes don't function normally, if you get what I mean.Don't even get me started on the 'twist' in the story! Quite cleverly, it in a sense told you the reason behind him being so awake and aware all the time.Anyone reading this, just get the hell out of here, go and watch this flick, it is a must!",10,3,10,10 September 2016
Sicario," A good film but perhaps a bit over-rated
","Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but I waited on and on for that special thing that made it deserve eight stars over here and win so much admiration all over the Internet, but it never arrives. Nothing special happened really.Also, usually if they give a woman such a role they tend to show them as strong and smart, but it was hugely disappointing to see Kate literally play a cow, a weak, dumb woman who has nothing else to do except giving curious looks! She is in a sense irrelevant to the film, the story and everything undertaken by that FBI team. The only thing of note that she does is almost having sex with a person from the enemy group!",7,53,82,7 October 2015
Titanic," 'Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime'
","The greatest film in the history of mankind, the most engaging love story ever made, this film has mesmerised me like no other on the face of earth. After watching once in childhood I watched this on again at the very start of 2011, and have ever since watched it a thousand times. I am such a huge fan of this film that I have even dedicated a poem to it, consisting of 53 verses (a shame I have never shared it online fearing plagiarism, a fear quite justified given the number of fans it has online). I also watched it at a cinema when it was released in 3D, on the 14th of April 2012, either hours or a day short of the tragedy's 100th anniversary!Each time I watch this film I tend to stay quiet a few hours afterwards and usually have that heaviness in my voice; it just affects my like no other film can. Just to avoid looking like an emotional fool, I usually start a conversation with anyone who happens to be sitting next to me so that I don't end up being in tears at the scene when Jack dies.The great thing about the love story was the joy that you so felt for them. So many hurdles stood in their way, there were so many things to fear from, yet they bore every hardship simply looking into each other's eyes. It is one great display of what the power of love is and what love can make us do. They way they rescue each other from one situation to the other, and the way the whole story builds up, and that once in a lifetime tragic ending scene, it is masterly work by James Cameron.Besides that, the whole depiction of the way the ship sinks, the horror in the end, the way the people die by either 'slipping' from it or in the freezing cold, the panic shown at the time it hits the iceberg, all of it is pure brilliance!Lastly, it should not at all be criticized for not being historically accurate, as for that you better watch a documentary film. They had to put up a build-up to the disaster that it was.",10,2,3,10 October 2015
Enemy at the Gates," Very thrilling despite the flaws!
","The film is full of flaws, the needless triangle love story being the first to come to my mind, and many other illogical things, but above all for me it remained an entertaining film throughout, very gripping and thrilling, and for that alone I have decided to shower my generosity upon this one to give it eight one of 10.The thing to stand out for me from this film is that it is a lot strategy based, unlike a lot of other war films, including the good yet very over-rated 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) that is quite casually all about lives of soldiers during war and killings. Admitted that some of its strategic points too look very flawed at times, but that in my opinion still remains a thing worthy of praise. The scenes where they wait on for hours for each other with the gun, the traps that they set for each other and the way one escapes from another by inches, all of it make for an intriguing battle. Although not perfectly implemented, but I salute the film- maker for having come up with the idea of such a unique war film that is not after all not only about slaughtering.Ed Harris' mere presence as Major Erwin König stole the show. He looked quite suited to the role and was brilliant in his performance. Although Vasily Zaytsev does mention of a German major by this name having had a duel with him, it is a shame that no German record of its military show any evidence of any such major having ever existed.",8,0,1,17 September 2015
The Departed," A masterpiece full of brilliant twists!
","Firstly of course, it has to be added that any of what I would write in this film's praise should apply to the 2002 Hong Kong film which this one is a remake of.It is, as the summary of my review mentions, a masterpiece full of brilliant twists. It is a case of some amazing tricks played by a policeman who acts like nothing short of a politician - he is bad, corrupt, a mole, kills people for his gains, makes partnerships with bad people, yet still earns praise and is clapped for and gets promotions. It was amazing to see the way it ended considering how the good cop entered the scene as someone with a bad family reputation, and the mole as someone who impressed them with merely his presence.The ending however, as every other man is killed except for two or three, reminded me so much of a Bollywood masterpiece, 'Johnny Gaddaar' (2008), which though was completely different but had a similar kind of ending.The cast was perfect for the film and each and every actor put in a great performance. Jack Nicholson resembled so much to the Undertaker in this film. Mind-blowing resemblance in some scenes!",10,1,3,23 September 2015
Sausage Party," A very creative idea ruined by disastrous application!
","The trailer used to promise a lot but then when it came out the reviews suggested that this film hasn't quite set the world on fire, so I was watching it with zero expectations but looking for some laughs. If you think about the idea itself, the fact that foods, drinks etc. have lives, they talk, see etc. and are like humans or animals, one can't resist being fascinated by it, but the application left a lot to desire.The first 20-25 minutes were a total headache really, with every phrase filled with the F-word three -four times - it was beginning to drive me mad but then once they get out of the market the film gets better and finally funny. The Arabic Sheikh style lavash was the funniest character, as was the physically disabled chewing-gum on the motorised wheelchair. Some jokes were really funny during that particular phase of it.BUT!Then the film-maker seemed to end the film in a fashion that made it resemble to a drawing by a child who does his job neatly but then draws random lines on the paper to ruin his work just because he has set his eyes on the toy lying next to him. That war between them and the humans was plain needless, but the porn film-like ending takes the cake! It was just disgusting and garbage. Really hated it!As a footnote, it didn't sound pleasant to the ear them abusing 'gods'. They should've simply shown humans as humans, opposed to gods. It felt awful to the ears.Overall, in short, a creative idea ruined by poor application. It had its occasional funny moments though.",4,1,6,26 January 2017
Downfall," A masterpiece! Right amongst my top war films!
","Let me first of all begin by stating that Bruno Ganz's performance as Hitler is in my book the greatest ever from amongst those based upon historic personalities. It is mind-blowing, brilliantly fantastic! The way he adopts Hitler's accent, the way he talked in general, the way he angrily reacts to every news of doom, is all out of the world. I in particular liked his acting in the scene where he discovers about Himmler's 'treason'. Pure brilliance, that scene. Knowing the German language of course lands me in a position to comment on these factors, as the dubbed English version of the film would have taken taken all these factors out of the equation, sadly.The film in general is one great depiction of the last day events. So far it is easily the best German film that I have watched. One great thing was that it makes you get a good feel of the war, the things happening out there. For the whole two hours or so I really felt to have been living in 1945 in Germany. It was at times laughable to see Hitler sticking to his belief that they were closer and closer to winning the war, and then of course were there his generals who could clearly see the downfall. It was really interesting to see how different people belonging to two mindsets saw the whole situation differently.Whereas 'Fury' (2014) for now continues to be my favourite war film, possibly because it was my first ever introduction into 'feel' factor of the World War II, which is not experienced through extensive reading but through a film, documentary or a drama, this goes down as a film really close to that one in my war films list, very close. The film well and truly deserves to be in the top 250 IMDb films, as it is on number 116 I see.",10,3,6,1 October 2015
The Green Mile," There are better ways to show an innocent person being punished!
","I usually post reviews of films that I happen to be completely mesmerised by or those which I think could have been worthy of 10 out 10 stars if not for this or that flaw (and for the latter ones the sole purpose of the review itself is to point out the flaws), but this one has compelled me to write out a review just for how bad it is! 'Django Unchained' (2012) was a film that almost made me compose a review for the same reason but that at least had the charm of Dr. Schultz's role and the unique concept of bounty-hunting.This film however is so bad that I didn't even want to give it one single star but I had to in order to register my protest on the IMDb. Still, if I have had to justify that one star I would it split into halves for the performance by Tom Hanks and for that brilliant joke by by one of the guards of carrying a mouse in his wallet.It might have made sense as a novel, so no disrespect to that, but as a film it did not. What really was the purpose of the film? To show an innocent being punished? A miracle man? Ill-treatment of blacks? Or worse, the tricks a mouse can perform, or the suffering caused by a bladder infection? Any or all of it doesn't mean that you should end up making such an amazingly boring film. John Coffey 's tears and show of innocence made me feel like punching the screen. He was annoying!The worst being, they make a three-hour long film, bore you to death, and yet still leave so many questions unanswered: how exactly was John trapped into being accused of raping and murdering those girls? It hasn't been shown, not even when he makes Paul 'feel' his pain by holding his hand - the only thing shown in that scene is how Wild Bill rapes and kills them. So it is left as a John's claim. And, for exactly what was Bill in for? What was his offence?Another strange scene being, Melinda welcomes John in her room by hurling abuses and asking him not to even come close to her, and yet after she is cured she suddenly relates a dream to John in which she saw both of them!The first half hour gathers your interest and then you wait on and on for that thing to arrive which makes it earn 8.5 stars over here, but it never does! Arrrgghhhhh, a bad film all around!",1,4,21,18 September 2015
Kong: Skull Island," Two hours of intense terror!!!!
","What a cracking time I'd yesterday watching this in 3D! Two hours of intense terror, thriller and entertainment that I'm unlikely to forget for some time. What a giant animal, wow! The best visuals that captures how big he's is the one 'he' stands tall with the sun in the background, which's also the poster of this film. A weapon of mass destruction is Kong!The scene where they fly into Kong's territory with helicopters will go down as amongst the greatest scenes I've ever seen at the big screen. It involves you so much as a viewer that at times it gets to the point of causing you dizziness. Simply unbeatable, the way he crashes, crushes and dismisses helicopters from his presence. I couldn't help but compare that to us humans dismissing flies away from our presence, and I'm sure the thought process behind that particular scene must've been the same for the film-makers.Samuel Jackson was very good here as the colonel, a role most suited to him and especially his so expressive eyes. The scene where immediately after the aforementioned scene he stands there and, instead of escaping from the destruction, looks Kong into the eyes is an awesome scene. It looked as if we're set for an epic war between the egos of two relentless personalities.But then the film drifts a bit, but the action remains. Monsters after monsters they come across, which only adds to the excitement, ultimately. Then, when the team stands against the colonel to prevent him from killing Kong, I feared that we're in for a disappointing, action-less ending, but then very intelligently the war re-ignites but against a different but yet another unrelenting creature. So the ending was worth it, especially the unbelievable scene where Kong rescues the girl from the other monster's gut. That was just wow!The questions asked by that soldier from World War Two, who stayed stranded on the island for 28, provided the much needed comic relief. Some of his questions about the years gone by were really funny, especially the one about the Cold War. 'Do they take the summer off?' Hilarious!Lastly, although I haven't watched the previous King Kong films, but I did watch the one from 2005. I understand the progress made from that time to now in terms of the technology and the equipment available now, but that wasn't my main issue with that film. My problem was with the over three hours of length and the plot itself. King Kong going mad for the girl and wanting to take her with him looked so odd. That was depicted better here, as just the friendship or love that can exist between a human and an animal.So then, 'Kong: Skull Island' is one of the greatest monsters films that I've watched, giving the Jurassic Park and the Aliens series a good competition. 'aliens' 1986 still wins the race though, any day.",10,3,9,18 March 2017
Arrival," What on earth was that?!
","I know that there'll be people, a lot of those mind if you see its reviews (and it was a full house today at the cinema), who'll argue that this is a film which has certain 'depths' that only 'Qualified minds' would understand and that it is just a 'Different kind of film' that just happened to have escaped me, but please pardon me that rubbish! It remains throughout a consistently boring and nonsense film which made me yawn a total of 20 times I think.I waited a whole length of two hours for finally 'something' to arrive that would engage me as a viewer, but the garbage kept on coming at a consistent pace! You think of a film about aliens, you think of thriller, excitement, adventure, fasten-your-seatbelts moments, but you get none of that in this piece of utter garbage!I fully agree though that this was a different film, it was different for the sake of it. It was a film for the sake of it. All in all, it has left such a poor taste in mouth that I desperately need to watch another but better film within the next 10 days, I really have to. All eyes set on 'Sully' (2016) for now.",1,11,20,27 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best endings of all times! Simply wow!
","I am at a loss of words to describe the greatness of this film, and by all means I give full credit to the book that it is an adaptation of.Half way through the film I began to enjoy the capabilities of the man and begin to see all that as the point of the film, but then it slows down in pace a bit (for the final 'assault') and I end up asking myself the purpose of it all, but then the ending leaves me speechless!This film, alongside the Bollywood biopic 'Manjhi - The Mountain Man' (2015), are two great examples of the fact how time is of little value when there are no better alternatives to achieve your goal. Often in our life we deny to take certain steps which might help us in achieving a goal in some years, but exactly after spending as much time sitting mum, we reflect on the time spent and regret not having taken those steps in all these years.A maternal cousin of mine from Denmark visited us in the summer of 2012 and he mentioned this film in a lot of conversation. Sadly, I wasn't too much into Hollywood films yet. Now that I am since over 15 months I checked the IMDb list of top 250 films and found this on the first place. I was immediately reminded of my cousin and thought that he wasn't after all just randomly naming a film. It was very clever to have shown Andy as innocent. This makes the viewers get more engaged into his suffering in the prison. The scene where he goes to his room with the rope, you almost find yourself saying in heart how this will be great injustice and something very, very sad and depressing.Again, all in all, this film is out of this world. One of the best of all times.",10,0,1,19 November 2015
Prometheus," A disappointment!
","The only thing that made me give five stars to this film were the occasional thrilling scenes, and that was it I am afraid.Firstly, I got nothing new from this film, nothing at all. I throughout it felt as if it is a remake of 'Alien' (1979) of sorts. I think it would get very boring and meaningless if all the Alien franchise films were to run a similar kind of story. James Cameron's 'Aliens' (1986), a masterpiece, is a great example of the fact how you can after all run a different story whilst staying on the same topic.Secondly, the film leaves so many questions unanswered and moves from one subject/topic to another that it all ends up being confusing.All in all, a major disappointment. It sets up nicely for that 'Big thing' to arrive, and you wait on and on, but it never arrives.",5,2,5,19 October 2015
Speed," This one is for the action lovers!
","Wow, what an action, thriller and entertainment filled was this for a film! An incredibly gripping film which keeps you on your toes for the entire duration of the film.There is maybe a thought of it having been stretched a bit with that kind of an ending (as it could have been ended with the bus scene and then catching the villain), but to be honest, by the time we arrived there I was already so struck by the film that I was never going to criticise any aspect of the film; no way.I can't put it in words how much I enjoyed the film right from the moment the hero receives that phone call. He runs after the bus, chases it, they ignore him, speed up, get it over 50 KpH, and then the fun starts! There were so many heart-in-the-mouth scenes in it that it is hard to pick any as the best, but I think that little cunning trick with the camera was a mind-blowing one. I commend the film-makers for having come up with such an intelligent idea that literally sealed the deal, because throughout there was this question running in the mind as to how on earth will they be able to get out of it before it explodes.All in all, a complete entertainer, this film. I am sure I will watch this one again some day.",10,1,3,12 April 2016
The Sixth Sense," Good, very good!
","I've a friend who has this habit of later on claiming about such endings of films that he guessed it beforehand when this or that particular sequence happened. I never believe him, and I think it's just some kind of an attempt in not giving up to the film beating your intelligence, your observing and sharp thinking. So I wouldn't claim that either in this film's case. My younder sister did remark at the halfway mark of the possibility of the doctor being one of the spirits. I wasn't convinced by her but it turned out, she was right after all!However, one thing that was stuck in my mind throughout and something that I saw as a genuine 'flaw' was the lack of report by the doctor to the child's parent - or whoever brought him into play. Because, as it is, the patient wasn't an adult, in which case it was incumbent upon the doctor to report the latest to an elder, especially the finding of the patient's 'supposed' schizophrenia. Turns out, it wasn't quite clearly a flaw in the film.A good, engaging film. The acting by the child artist was out of the world, just awesome!I don't quite know what to put it down to, but despite it being such a unique concept and having a climax as fabulous as it has, it didn 't quite, for me, make it to the level of 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994) or 'Shutter Island' (2010). Possibly, possibly because as the climax approaches, the film begins to go in a lost direction, which fails in making you hold your breaths for such an ending. In the end, it wasn't as perfect despite such a brilliant ending. Certainly didn't convince me to give it 10 stars, something that I do very, very often.",8,0,1,27 June 2017
Life," Exceeded my expectations by 20 times!!!!
","I get it, it doesn't belong to the original Alien series, yet forms most of its basal concepts on 'Alien' (1979), a lot of its scenes almost mimic the trapped-in-space troubles shown in that, but all of that goes out of the window once you start watching this film. It has its own feet and legs to stand on, its own horror to scare you and is special in its own ways. From one scene to the next, from one trouble to the next, it engages you so successfully that if you'd any predetermined thoughts of comparing it to the Alien series, you gradually forget all of that. The way it kills the rat and its first victim was a jaw-dropping start to the game, visuals that'll stay in my memory for some time, and from then on it just takes off.I saw someone over here complain that the difference between the scientists of this film and 'Alien' (1979) was that these were shown to be highly incapable bunch of guys who're making one mistake after another. Whereas I don't dispute that observation, but I don't mind that. Thinking from a realistic point of view, irrespective of how capable you're, anyone would goof up things dealing with a creature like Calvin, a monster with abilities beyond their expectations and calculations. So that can happen, it's human.And as it is anyway, a point that makes it different from the Alien series, this film shows the alien as having succeeded in the battle, as opposed to the others showing that there's always at least one human who kills it and survives to tell the tail - not something that I think is an any lesser concept than this. So the mistakes by the crew are justified by the note that it ends on.The end-plan being goofed up totally is exactly what this film stands on, something that makes me give it 10 out 10 for its originality in that regard, and it ends on a tragic note. With the last 20 minutes approaching I'd that look on my face of having seen it all before, but then it surprises you with a brilliant ending. So, extremely sharp work by the film-makers. I was literally like 'wow' when they showed the wrong capsule having landed in the water. I loved it!I hope they make a sequel of this, because it's been always a fantasy of mine to see a film that shows the aliens on earth, as opposed to just in the space or on other planets. If they don't, well, I'll be bitterly disappointed. But I can still where this is coming from, because if I were myself a film-maker I'd be a specialty of mine too to end films on a tragic and unfinished note, because such an ending makes the film stay stronger in the viewers' memories.All in all, an intensifying cinematic experience of my life that I 'll cherish for some time. Eagerly waiting for the next film from the other Alien series this May!",10,5,18,26 March 2017
Heat," Too long, but still a very good film!
","It is a good film, no doubt about that, but one thing lacking in the film was pace. It takes too long for things to materialise and get going. The first half is painfully slow and coming to the point in short, the overall length of the film was an issue. This is one aspect that annoys me the most about a lot of films and it is hard to get me look past this point (of too long films), unless it happens to be a film with great pace throughout or highly entertaining from minute to minute. This is a point in general that I think should be amongst priorities for a film-maker. I am sure that like many of those excessively long film, this too must have had scenes which they could have done without. What really is the point of making an otherwise a very good film that is going to have scenes that the viewers can easily afford to talk to each other through it?Another point to raise would possibly of not showing what happens to the only guy left, Chris. But I would just add that it would have been nice if they had shown, instead of saying it was a must.But, overlooking all that, it was quite a brilliant film, full of great performances from all the actors.",8,1,3,11 August 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A breath of fresh air amongst war films!!!!
","Although I'd some minor idea as to what this film is going to be about, but still I was expecting it to be your average battlefield film, but it really surprised me once it got to the point of showing his accomplishment. Admitted that it's literally impossible to re- enact the happenings of a war and to show 100% accurately as to what exactly might've happened, but I think it was a very commendable effort by the film-maker, coupling it with the hide-and-seek kind of thrilling moments where you'd always be on your toes seeing the Japanese soldiers chasing him and often them missing him by a whisker.A couple of blips on the film were, firstly the whole thing in the start could've been shorter to shorten the length of the film, and secondly the lead-up war scene to the main act was a bit too long and boring, really giving me the impression that the film is going nowhere and made me fear that this will be exactly like your any war film.Overall, again, really appreciable the fact that this film chooses to show and glorify another kind of war hero other than the average Joe with a gun. He was different and indeed a brave guy, a guy who stepped onto the battlefield without a gun - the most unique kind of act in a war. His determination to stick to his words and not to be pressurised into going against his principles is worthy of praise.",7,2,6,20 February 2017
Me Before You," The ending spoils a sweet, cheerful and funny film!
","I remember a few years ago having a discussion with a friend on the Bollywood film 'Guzaarish' (2010) - a film that holds 95% similarities to it. His opinion was that a film (or a film-maker to be precise) is under no moral obligation to show the right 'thing', the right ending or showing something that matches the common standards of 'rightness', and that a film is just a recording of a story - right or wrong doesn't even come into the picture.Although he did make a very solid and thought-provoking point, the point remained in my view that this too depends on the gravity of the topic and how sensitive it is; and making a film about physically challenged people is a sensitive theme, just like rape is. I asked him whether he'll stick to his otherwise very intellectual point if someone were to make a film about a habitual rapists who and end the film on the note that he goes on to lead a very wonderful life full of happiness. He got stuck there, and this remained my standard to judge films: in short, the topic, its gravity and sensitivity is all that it depends on.So that remains a problem with this film and I can fully understanding the reactions that it's getting from physically challenged people and such organisations. I'd still give it seven stars because it was otherwise a very, sweet, cheerful and funny film (I understand one isn't supposed to behave that rudely with anyone, but Will's witty replies were really hilarious!), and highly engaging too with its theme revolving around freedom and being yourself, being true to yourself. Despite a bad ending, the last scene with Louisa walking away with those striped socks was really heartening, and, again, despite that, I couldn't help praising the film because it was incredibly sweet.I remember I blasted 'Guzaarish' back then, but the reason for that wasn't only the topic but also the fact that the film was dull and boring beyond words! So there's a difference between the two.As a footnote, I thought Louisa's ex-boyfriend got a harsh treatment. He wasn't at fault too much and was neither a bad guy. Showing him as a the 'Other type of guy' could've actually pressed more on the 'freedom' angle, but alright. They didn't show something that isn't possible: falling in love with another guy/girl than your boyfriend/girlfriend. It happens, whether that is alright or not or whether it qualifies as cheating is a debate for another day and place.*Most of what I've written in criticism of the film applies to the book too of course that it is based on.*",7,2,3,24 January 2017
Gladiator," What was this?
","I am yet to come to terms with the hype this film has got. Nothing in it makes it deserve to be in the IMDb's top 250 list, neither the Oscar, nor all the good things that have been written in its praise.The first 30 minutes or so are good, quite impressive indeed. They kill the emperor, kill Maximus' wife and son, but that is it. The story takes off well but completely loses its flight right from the point he is captured by those slavers. From then on the film loses its point and becomes a tiring exercise, predictable too. It gets more and more boring as well as the film approaches its ending. A huge disappointment if I am honest.",4,0,7,20 October 2015
Macbeth," A bit disappointed
","I think the film should either have been word to word completely based on the play (by Williams Shakespeare), or the changes made should have been a lot better. One prime example of the latter that comes to my mind is the Bollywood film 'Maqbool' (2003). The changes made in it that differ from the original play, 'Macbeth', make it an even better as a film, and is my most favourite film ever based on any of Shakespeare's play.One flaw that I can point to is, Malcolm, the son of the slain king, flees despite being an eye-witness to the murder of his father. Surely he could have screamed and shouted on the spot, gathered all the king's servants etc. and avoided himself being killed by Macbeth (as did the latter threaten) and, at least could have got it crystal clear on the spot as to who murdered king Duncan. Instead of all this, prince Malcolm flees, settles in another country and never returns! The murder scene and the whole conspiracy surrounding it was best depicted in the aforementioned Bollywood film.Secondly, either Lady Macbeth should have been shown to have committed suicide, as the original play depicts, or her should should have been depicted due to some serious causes. Showing that depression, guilt or hallucinations alone caused her death seemed a bit overboard. This too was brilliantly depicted in the aforementioned film: she suffers from guilt and depression before dying, but her death was caused due to Maqbool/Macbeth having picked her up from the hospital in a very weak condition, straight after a delivery.All the criticism aside, the film overall was still quite good. The performances by everyone were solid. Still, despite it being the film that I most desperately wanted to watch in the last three-four months, it did not entirely live up to my expectations.",7,2,3,30 January 2016
Valkyrie," A pretty good film!
","I thought this was a pretty good film. The two flaws to stand out for me would have to be the slow pace of the film, coupled with the portrayal of Hitler by that man, whoever he was. He just didn't to be the man suited to the role, somehow. Hitler, although a villain of the highest order, had his own firm style, solid way of talking etc. Pretty much everyone acted well apart from him I think.Now, moving away from the film and addressing this whole case, a true event that it was, I have held general dislike for the glorification of the armed forces and the instilling of belief amongst masses that they are supposed to be some kind of heroes, for I refuse to believe such people as heroes who are puppets to their boss in a matter as serious as war - killings etc. - and go on to commit any atrocity that is demanded from their chiefs (nuking two whole cities for example). The mere act of putting on a uniform and going on to kill people cannot make anyone a hero in my view. However, it is people like Colonel Clause that deserve our admiration and such a status, for they go against the trend, against the brainwashing and programming done of their brains, use the human intelligence and reason to differentiate between the right and the wrong.I understand that an argument can be made against him of after all being part of the same system for so all and the initial years of the war, but you again, the point to be considered is, he did see the light after all and made an attempt before it went completely out of hand. It confirms once more that God makes prevail the right over the wrong one day. At that time an outcast minority condemned to death, their legacy lives on as heroes and Hitler and his cronies are a denounced people.",8,0,1,18 September 2015
Alien: Covenant," The horror is more nauseous than thrilling!!!
","Although I wouldn't call it a disaster, but I certainly think that the film delivers way below the expectations. The action may make for some trembling moments, but the story and the overall plot is makes one yawn to be honest.The horror has no thrills or hair-raising moments like the 1986 film had, and leans more towards making you puke as opposed to making you hold your breaths. I certainly expected better from a film made in 2017 - with more equipment, technology and resources available - as 'Jurassic World' 2015 so aptly makes my point.The entrance of the Aliens has no build up, the reactions from the actors seemed so fake as if they dinner with such monsters every Sunday, and on their walkie talkie type sets they hardly tell the other members of the crew that they're seeing some extraterrestrial form of life or a monster, and just mumble through the words. Instead of a fight for survival, this looks like a dish where humans and aliens are randomly thrown into one plate and they keep on bumping into each other.The story seemed to focus more on the android and his evil plotting than the aliens themselves. It gets increasingly 'facepalmic' when it begins to behave very creepily - attempting a rape! Ridley sadly got his priorities wrong I'm afraid. Michael Fassbender behaves more like a eunuch than an android, although this isn't the main point in my objections.Still though, the film has its moments and was still enjoyable in parts. My criticism is based more on the franchise that it belongs to and more so the highly reputable director that made it. Whereas the great James Cameron fulfills the demands of the common man and explores his emotions and stimulates his mind, Ridley Scott sticks to what he believes will be right - on its way, often his vision ends up agreeing with the public and sometimes not. Due to this thin yet a deciding difference, I'll have to bury my desire of wanting to re-witness something as great as 'Aliens' (1986) - unless of course, Mr. Cameron decides to make one himself.For now though, give me 'Life' (2017) over this one any day!",7,16,33,21 May 2017
The Martian," Best space film that I have ever watched!
","One of the best films of the year, this is one great survival story and a film that maintains its pace throughout. Not for a minute does it get boring. This beats 'Gravity' (2013) and 'Interstellar' (2014) for me and is officially my most favourite space film ever.The great thing I felt was that he never ever took pity on himself, or even showed any kind of fear. He simply got on with the job, let his knowledge and skills take over, and deals with ever calamity with a smile and humour.The most awesome scene of the film was yet was its ending scene, the scene where up in the space the crew and Mark meet. A real heart-in- mouth moment and it literally made me say 'Wow!' sitting in the cinema hall. Also, it was a full house on a Sunday afternoon, something which made the experience somehow even better. It was a rare occasion for me as I usually go in the weekdays when more than two-thirds of the seats are empty.So all in all, a wonderful film from every possible aspect. Really enjoyed it.",10,6,15,12 October 2015
