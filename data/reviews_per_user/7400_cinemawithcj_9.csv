First Man," First Man - Cinema with CJ Review
","First Man reminds us how goddamn scary space travel is and that sheer bravery and heroism that fuels the impossible being possible.Damien Chazelle continues to be a director I very much have excitement for. From the universally acclaimed Whiplash to the divisive La La Land (I love it), Chazelle has put together a completely different beast. Music isn't the through-line for once - though don't think that means that Justin Hurwitz once again knocks it out of the park - but instead it's the claustrophobic, captivating journey and motivation of Neil Armstrong towards the one thing the world knows him for.Starting almost a decade prior to the event, whether you know the history or not, First Man highlights it's the work of many brave people and sharp minds to put man on the moon, and the cost therein. Film tends to paint a pretty picture of astronauts (unless things go wrong), but even when things are going right you're thrown into extreme closeups of men packed like sardines thrown about by the threat of burning rockets and technical hitches and sound design that keeps you rattled alongside them.In fact, the sound design is so on point, there's a particular moment that took my breath away. For best effect, go out and watch this movie in IMAX. You'll see what I'm talking about. Once again with space on film, bigger is better. So don't wait until you can see it at home or on the phone or heaven forbid, a boring-ass airplane.First Man is damn fine filmmaking, even if it does strip the glamour from it. Gosling powers through with a solid cast as Armstrong, and the film faults only really with some second and third act pacing (which is initially perfect) and how the breathtaking and powerful moments are few and far between. But maybe that's just because we know how it ends, and it costs a lot to get to that money shot.",8,5,10,1 December 2018
A Star Is Born," A Star is Born - Cinema with CJ Review
","A Star is Born (2018) is a movie I don't get but the rest of film criticism seems to. Apparently it's a revelation, Cooper's directorial debut is apparently stellar with a deep, rich story, apparently it's Oscar worthy. Pfft.The thing about A Star is Born is that even ignoring it's a remake, it feels like a million movies you've seen and doesn't do anything new, and it doesn't really do it better.It has pacing issues, it feels hollow, it feels like Cooper still wants that Best Actor Oscar he still doesn't deserve just yet, and for that...You're finding me checking my watch an hour in and dreading the hour left to go. The good I can pull from the movie is that Lady Gaga is great. And it's a 2 hour 15 movie that shows me how well she can sing. Unfortunately, I already know Lady Gaga can sing, so it's a bit of an unnecessary production.The editing is a bit janky, and there are seriously only two good shots in the film. There's a lack of scale to a lot of the performances, and there's a lack of a sense of time and rise/fall of the characters.A Star is Born fails at improving the structure of even the lighter versions of this genre. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping and Josie and the Pussycats (a legit underwatched underrated 2001 flick) manages to handle its characters, pacing and comprehension better.Those two examples also have better music. It will undeniably get Original Song Oscar buzz, but it doesn't deserve it. The big trailer song isn't even the key. It's the gateway to the rest of the film, followed by lacklustre country and pop that is bolstered only by vocals.A Star is Born is a lot of things but none of them include anything really good. I couldn't care less about Cooper's fall. Because I've seen it before, and I've seen it better.I'd much rather see more of the star being born, dying, and coming full circle than Cooper making it about him and betraying the good story that's actually there. It's overrated, it'll be overseen, and potentially over-rewarded. Which is a shame.",2,3,5,1 December 2018
Aquaman," Aquaman - Cinema with CJ Review
","Aquaman is the Nicholas Cage of superhero movies. Wild, unpredictable, off-beat, all over the board, crazy, funny, entertaining, and you'll never really know if it's bad or good.If anything, Aquaman is a gift. If this wasn't a year with a great line-up of superhero movies, this would be the best superhero movie of the year, and not by default.It seems that every Worlds of DC movie not involving Batman or Superman (tragically) has something great about them. Not perfect, but great.Aquaman feels like everyone was just given free reign to do what they want, so they just made it the most insane concept ever. At the base of it it's the usual hero's journey, but it's one that on the surface has you jetsetting under and over the sea, Aquaman punctuated by guitar riffs, one cartoonish pirate villain who customises a suit given to him by a secret underwater race in order to stop the true king of Atlantis from taking the throne from his half brother therefore putting a stop to a war against sea and land, a sea creature voiced by Julie Andrews, and a cover of 'Africa' by Toto.It's something saying that the soundtrack is more diverse and more fun than the work of Hans Zimmer, or Junkie XL, but it is. Whether it's a cool Aquaman theming, or the left-field choice in covers, or the neon-fuelled Atlantean City music, all the choices are out there and work, which is the lifeblood of all of this movie.Given the reigns to James Wan was the best idea. Wan, probably always more well known for this horror work at the time of writing this, also gave the world Furious 7, the first time the seventh film of a franchise is seen as second best/the best. Like that movie, Wan takes everything up multiple notches, crafting an utterly cartoonish and more accurately, utterly comic book feeling movie.The colours of this movie leap out of you just like the colours would leap off the page. We're not working with darkness and shadow, we're not dark and gritty, and the more we strive away from that in superhero cinema the better.Aquaman is fun. Plain and simple. It is utterly crazy (it seems to be the season for crazy given my last two reviews) and it embraces it so strongly. It knows just how ridiculous it is.The entire cast bring this movie alive, but goddamn does Jason Mamoa lean perfectly into his characterisation here. It's the surfer dude Aquaman you've seen before, but here it works perfectly for the tone.Clearly everyone has realised that if Aquaman was gonna have a film, he'd have the potential ridicule aimed right at him if it was attempted to be made seriously. Pop culture has filled the world with Aquaman jokes, but by the time you even get to Aquaman getting a version of his iconic costume, the laughs aren't in ridicule, it's in the ridiculous of the world and being baffled of actually liking and enjoying the movie.This film is going to be divisive. Not in a critical way, not in an offensive way, but in the admission to whether you actually had as much fun as I did with this movie.It's got its flaws. I wish there was more Black Manta, I wish the film was shorter, despite my fun and enjoyment, I wish there was more bonkers sea war stuff, I wish the 80s adventure peppered with romance sequence carried through a bit longer, I wish for all of DC to embrace this tone. It's not Marvel Imitation Syndrome, it's going in the ridiculous comic direction that's just fun and over the top and true to the larger than life superhumans of the DC Universe.It's hard not to keep coming back and saying that Aquaman is such an enjoyable and confounding-ly weird but great time at the movies. It should have failed on every level, and it's potentially not going to be a financial or critical hit, but really, this is another slice of how these movies should be. Shazam! looks to be in the same direction, so I'm down. I am legitimately excited to see what else comes in this new world of the DC Universe.And you'd think that of all things, Aquaman would be the least likely place I would have thought that.A controversial, in most eyes barely scrapes if at all,8/10 Stars.",8,6,12,12 December 2018
BlacKkKlansman," BlacKkKlansman - Cinema with CJ Review
","BlacKkKlansman is Spike Lee spouting more of that fo' real, fo' real sh- and I dig.I dig real hard.A few slices from perfection, but still all in on all the things that still matter. It's pretty well worn the comments on how the film is perfectly timed and a wonderful snap back at the real state of the union, but in its real construction...That's what I'm talking about.For all the Trump parallels, the commentary on racism on all levels, the evolving but still problematic nature of police investigation, to all the other themes that stick and resonate so hard, especially in those last five minutes...Spike Lee reminds you once again why he teaches on the subject of film. He constructs a damn fine one.There's a sequence near the beginning that alone shows the power of powerful dialogue, strong direction, purposeful cinematography, and masterful editing. Then you get that throughout the rest of the film. BlacKkKlansman speaks through the medium of cinema in how calculated and important each cut is, and it speaks through Cinema itself. Hell, it opens with film footage that already throws in a reversal and then uses film further in many scenes following to play off the heroics of 'white' cinema and 'black' Cinema. Juxtaposition is alive and well in BlacKkKlansman and sometimes the simplest technique is the most powerful.We see how two worlds are so different through their similarities, and context truly plants where the line in the sand is. Lee has created another film to shine a light on how f-ed things are and some people are, and that times haven't really changed and that all lives matter. There are still some misjudged violent wrong people in the world and they haven't stopped yet. But Spike Lee has made another flick that can be put in cinemas and show us - because that's where we go to see our heroes - that there's good people fighting the good fight, and infiltrate hate.Because this film points out pretty easily...that hate is stupid.",8,10,19,1 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody - Cinema with CJ Review
","Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) has a sequence where the titular song is released to their original, critical reviews. Queen's song was later seen as a masterpiece, but in its initial release was only deemed 'Perfectly adequate' by some. The latter, and probably not the former, describes the film of the same name.
Bryan Singer (or Dexter Fletcher) has created a perfectly adequate musical biopic here that doesn't do much revolutionary, but at least doesn't rob you of any time.
That is carried very much so by Rami Malek and co-stars disappearing into their roles as Freddie Mercury et al as Queen. Malek truly steals the show as the band's frontman, bringing the energy and life and mannerisms of the iconic Mercury. If there's one solid good to take from this film, it's that Malek's performance is a perfect capture.
Bohemian Rhapsody is bolstered by the fact that Queen (I would say objectively, but let's say in my opinion) have so many brilliant songs and of course that means this film gets to flaunt them all. Each song is a performance of all elements coming together and you get Queen's greatest hits translated onto the big screen. If you're gonna watch this movie at the cinema please at least splash out on the IMAX for the big screen, big sound experience.
If Bohemian Rhapsody was just a concert movie starring Queen or even just these facsimiles of Queen, it would be perfect, but the execution of this narrative biopic brings the film down a notch or two. There's always a curious case of poetic license with biopics, First Man recently has a bit of this, but Bohemian Rhapsody creates many an eyebrow raise.I am by no means a Queen aficionado but I'm sure I'm not the only one doubting just how fortuitous and neat the story of Queen and Freddie Mercury is. The film saunters for the majority of it with next to no conflict and brushing past themes and issues and moments that could have done with more fleshing out. Events go by and you wonder just a little too much on whether they actually happened. Usually you don't need to bust out the fact checking like a Neil deGrasse Tyson of film, but this is a biopic with such glaring leaps of logic and license you can't switch that off.
There's just something off about cartoonishly evil characters or how people just stumble upon the music they're iconic for. The creation of the titular song felt like it was a through-line of the story until it suddenly wasn't, and that thread was full of 'this is a bit too on the nose'.
Bohemian Rhapsody has as much subtlety as Mercury's character. Very fun, well performed, nostalgic, and goddamn, that last sequence would be an all-timer if it wasn't just a shot for shot recreation with iffy special effects enhancement.
Inconsistent style over substance, it brushes past and messily tackles themes such as Mercury's sexuality and later years all for another hit Queen track.
It feels like one for fact-checking, but it also feels like Bohemian Rhapsody will forever remain Perfectly Adequate. And that's only down to the music of one great band, and one great group of actors translating that to screen.",6,2,4,1 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - Cinema with CJ Review
","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse makes you aware pretty early on you're in for something special. The curious project long in development unsure of where it sits in Spider-Man canon makes it known that it is the Spider-Man canon.It's a love letter to every single piece of Spider-Man you know and love and even the stuff you might not. The movies, the cartoons, the comics, the character, the icon. If you want a definitive Spider-Man, I think you're looking at it.Into The Spider-Verse oozes so much style from it you can't help but be sucked into its universe. The animation is slick and gorgeous and perfectly on form here, translating Spider-Man to the big screen like you've never seen before. It's beautiful and it's technically impressive, playing with all sorts of styles (helped by the diverse supporting characters) but never losing sight of its spirit.There's never been a more true comic adaptation. Watchmen is so far back in the mind alongside every other comic book movie here, Spider-Verse uses so many techniques in it you just feel everything you expect Spider-Man to actually be. It's like if Deadpool had those yellow boxes, or if Fantastic Four had a good movie.You feel so much love for Spider-Man in the making of this film, full of everything for the hardcore fan to the most casual movie-goer. Whatever your working knowledge of Spider-Man, you're going to be impressed.The actual story and characters haven't even been touched in this review so far and that's because Into The Spider-Verse gets the groundwork just so right of course everything falls into place. It subverts expectations, it gives you the exact payoffs you want, it has such smart humour and touching emotion. It's everything great about every Spider-Man piece of fiction and almost none of the flaws.Into The Spider-Verse surpasses even the likes of Spider-Man 2 here. It's not hammy (beyond Spider-Ham), it's not cheesy, it's not full of bad CG, it's not got soap-Opera antics that don't land, it's not set outside New York, it's none of those things.Spider-Man is reinvented alongside all the references of his reinvention. It gives us an origin story that doesn't suck, because it knows you know all of that. Several times over. It knows how smart the audience is. It knows we know the stories. The beats. So instead it gives us a show. It gives everything slightly different to what you know and expect, but leaves you happy with how familiar things are.The entire cast and crew have truly made something special. The writing, the directing, the animating, the acting, the soundtrack, everything. It shows the work that has gone into it. It stands apart from most of the other animated movies of recent years. It makes yet another good case for animation needing more of that mainstream blockbuster highlight. This is better than pretty much most of the superhero movies that have been made to date.Life has been breathed into Spider-Man yet again. And it's not necessarily gone bigger and better. It's human. It's funny. It's down to earth. It takes us on the journey Miles Morales is being taken on. Things get weird. Things get fun. An all star voice cast's praises can't be sung more. None of the people involved can't be celebrated more.There's great power given when you get the reins of Spider-Man. And with it comes great responsibility. Or however the saying goes. I'm just glad that I'm in the Spider-Verse were it all goes perfectly with this movie.",10,38,110,6 December 2018
Halloween," Halloween - Cinema with CJ Review
","Halloween (1978) is another classic I've recently retread, and while you can probably guess the ending of this review, let's talk about getting there.John Carpenter directed, co-wrote, and scored a legitimately fantastic movie. It's one of those cases where the term 'genre-defining' is actually applicable. Following the footsteps of films like Psycho and Peeping Tom a generation behind it, Halloween is the birth of the modern slasher movie. You can try and say it's other flicks like Black Christmas, but Halloween stands ahead of them all. Hell, it's the one most of you know the name of. It's bolstered by the birth of the scream queen herself, Jamie Lee Curtis (and yes, obligatory mention of her being the daughter of Psycho's Janet Leigh), who in turn has since enjoyed a long career that sometimes brings her back to the franchise that first introduced her, but let's not talk about those...(except for Terminator 2-starring-Laurie Strode, Halloween 2018)Halloween is full of great indie horror filmmaking, all the way down to filming at summer in California and having to paint bags of leaves brown for shots. Whether it's the simple but effective main theme over an ominous Jack-O-Lantern, the brilliant POV opening, the slow-burn storytelling, the omnipresent creepiness of Mike Myers, the Hitchcockian suspense and it's other influences, or just the dozens of other elements, Halloween is a perfectly constructed movie that has maintained its effectiveness over 40 years, and will continue to for many more.",10,1,1,1 December 2018
Creed II," Creed II - Cinema with CJ Review
","Creed II somehow legitimises the most cartoonish (and admittedly/embarrassingly my favourite) Rocky movie - Rocky IV - and brings it into the grounded world of this new Creed franchise. It works.Even when other things do not.Steven Caple, Jr. takes over the reigns from the great Ryan Coogler, and while it's nice and thematic to give a relative newbie to mainstream cinema another underdog shot, you can tell this isn't quite Creed.It is still very serviceable. The boxing is solid and the emotions hit you and the soundtrack rises inside you like all these movies have accomplished before.Stallone has co-written a film that makes you sympathise with the logical conclusion for Ivan Drago after the events of Rocky IV, and it makes you feel for Adonis Creed's uncertainty in where his life is even after the events of the first Creed movie.What the film has problems with is its propulsion. It hits so many beats it needs to hit - from the matches to the human drama to the montages - but the way in which it does it doesn't quite snatch you.You can predict the way the narrative is going to go, but the characters themselves don't feel like they know why it's all happening. Creed is so caught up in his confusion that he doesn't really know why he's doing things, Rocky is a bit muddled on his choices, Tessa Thompson's Bianca has her own problems with her hearing and the threat of their child inheriting their condition, and even Ivan Drago and his one-dimensional son don't quite know what they're fighting for after they've achieved it.The arcs all work themselves out, but through most of the film you don't quite feel anything that strongly. You don't quite feel Rocky facing his inner demons in the death of his friend to Ivan Drago being brought up to the surface, you don't quite feel Adonis' frustration or motivation towards choosing to fight Drago, you don't quite feel what's supposed to happen to the Dragos in Russia after playing their first hand. Viktor Drago feels like such a wasted opportunity - instead a puppet for his father's failing and losses after fighting Rocky - one just wished he was more than a powerful boxing machine. He's just an obstacle to overcome and a tough one at that.Everything just feels like it's coasting and a bit more subdued here. Coogler made probably the best Rocky franchise movie not called Rocky (or only to me, IV), but Caple, Jr. plays it way too safe. There aren't as many risks, there aren't as many powerful awards worthy performances (well, none to Stallone's one in Creed), and criminally...Creed doesn't come out to JamesBrown's 'Living in America'.Creed II will get you pumped, and it might make you want to go to the gym or box. It's never going to blow your mind, and it's not the bigger and better sequel you were hoping it to be. It's a shame Black Panther took Coogler away from this sequel (albeit to make a solid and important Marvel Studios Movie), but Creed II still does the job.Just not as well as the previous outing.So like Rocky II. History keeps on repeating itself.",8,0,1,3 December 2018
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park - Cinema with CJ Review
","Jurassic Park doesn't really need much reviewing by this point, but I saw it at the Royal Albert Hall in London recently with live orchestral accompaniment and fell in love with it all over again.One of Spielberg's finest, Jurassic Park has all the hallmarks of the filmmaker who made Jaws and grew even more in their expertise by the time he retread ground with dinosaurs.Spotlights are everywhere in this masterful film full of great camera techniques, memorable characters, great visual and aural storytelling, brilliant set design, and of course...those special effects. There's a reason why I make jokes at more modern movies' special effects saying 'X years after Jurassic Park'. This was 1993. And it made you believe in dinosaurs. I mean, they did exist, but whatever.In regards to the orchestra that played, it does make one realise that goddamn, they play the main theme a lot. But it's another John Williams masterpiece, so it's fine. It captures everything good about this movie. The joy, the wonder, the adventure.That's what every subsequent movie in the series lacks. That wonder. The miracle of dinosaurs. It's an amazing incredible thing. It's not meant to be a horror movie. Or a slasher. It just happens to turn out that way. But that's not the focus.It's not about that. Jurassic Park is about a man who realises he's ready to start a family. That's the good sh-. Not T-Rex and Raptor versus fake dinosaur fights.Spielberg is the master. And goddamn, there will never be a more joyful reveal than the entire 'Welcome to Jurassic Park' sequence.",10,1,1,1 December 2018
