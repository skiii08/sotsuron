Men in Black 3," Time Travel can be Funny Too
","While watching Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprising their roles as agents J and K, respectively, one maniac and fast-talking and the other with a face of I'm-doing-this-only-for-the-paycheck, I was thinking about a family that is invited to stay in for a couple of days with some friends but after 1 month they have overstayed their welcome. But then, Agent J travels to the past and somehow everything was better in the world, much better.The plot: There is a secret government organization that monitors extraterrestrial life on earth on a daily basis, protecting humans so they can go on with their normal lives. When one extraterrestrial named Boris 'the Animal' escapes from the Lunar Prison, he uses and invention from one inmate to travel to the past, kill agent K and several years later conquer Earth. As Agent J is the only one aware of this (explained with a sweet scene that comes until the end), it's his mission to travel back in time and save agent K and the Earth.The Actors: Will Smith continues using all his charisma and bravura to make this a funny character, although his incessant complaint to agent K about not being open with his feelings is too much and boarding on the stupid and needy. Tommy Lee Jones thankfully has few scenes cause is clear that he is getting tired of the role. But the real revelation is Josh Brolin, who as Agent K from 1969, makes a great Tommy Lee Jones impersonation and gives the character a much needed light heart. He carries the past part and thanks to him the movie doesn't feel like a rehash of the previous two movies.The Good: As I wrote before, once the movie takes the leap to the past, everything begins to fall into place and moves at a greater pace. We learn that Agent K is investigating several alien killings (done by Boris) and meets an Arcadian that gives him an Arcnet to stop Boris's race from conquering earth. Although the past could have been used more to enhance the difference in the society (you know, Agent J is black and is walking around like he owns the place) there are several jokes that have a good use, like meeting agent W as Andy Warhol and he begging to be 'killed' because he can't stand the frivolous life: 'filming this man eating a hamburger. It's transcendent'. The Arcadian is also an interesting character, he can see all the possible futures of a situation and shows his powers in some key moments. The special effects are OK, Boris is threatening and funny in occasions and the launch of the first mission that set foot on the moon is used as the climax.If you like the humor in the Men in Black movies, you will like this one, there is nothing new, surprising or profound, but the movie is really entertaining once we get to 1969. At the beginning I wasn't expecting very much but by the end I was laughing and was interested on how all would take place so I think the movie did a great job of redeeming itself.",9,0,1,23 October 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," Excellent third (final?) installment
","I was very lucky to see this movie at the worldwide premiere that took place last Monday (May 15th) at Mexico City. I have to say that for me this was the movie to see this summer, and actually it exceeded all my expectations. I have loved the previous X Men movies, and this was not an exception.First, the story is right in all its contents, Drama: The cure that has been developed to suppress the mutant gene has a particular resonance (curing homosexuality, anyone?); Action: The war surfacing among both sides of the mutants and the humans caught in the middle of it all that , and of course the Mystery that brings it all together: The return of one very powerful character (actually anyone that has seen X-Men: United and the marketing for this movie knows exactly who I am talking about).The action is in the right place and in the right dose, although it does take a little to kick in, and as with the previous installments the visual effects are top-notch, including of course the new entries to the teams Angel, Juggernaut and specially Beast, he looks as good as Nightcrawler in the previous installment, despite some previous concern. Moreover, the change in director is practically non-consequential, it has the great quality that was the norm with Bryan Singer (who we hope does a great job in Returning Superman to the big screen.)Although in the other movies the acting has not been the center stage, I believe that in this particular movie, Ian McKellen and Famke Jenssen gave very good performances, particularly towards the end of the movie in which every thing is decided, including of course 'SPOILER BEGINS' who dies and who loses its mutant powers because of the cure (for a hint: In the Full Trailer for the movie an image of Rebeca Romijn Â– AKA Mystique- without her blue skin, can be seen). As a matter of fact despite the excellent quality of the movie, I am very surprise that 20th Century Fox decided to ended these successful series in the third installment, believe me when I say that it has ended because X-Men: The Last Stand sheds as many characters (or powers) as Beast sheds fur in the furniture (or for any TV fan, as 24 shed characters this particular season). 'SPOILER ENDS' Despite the good grade that I am giving to the movie, one particular was not that good: Some characters are a little (if not very) under used, with so many mutants returning and as many new some mutants being added to the mix, not all of them have that much screen time and that diminishes the impact of their stories (although they are not that important in the end to be true, but somehow it will be better to focus in some of the wide variety of mutants.) In the end, I believe this was a better movie than the previous two, it has it's heart in the right place, it's pace is solid and never lags an excellent story that at the end has as many repercussions as could be imagined.",10,22,44,16 May 2006
