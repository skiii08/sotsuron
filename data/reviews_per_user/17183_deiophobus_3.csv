Raiders of the Lost Ark," Possibly one of the greatest action movies of all time.
","It's great. It's amazing. It's well-made. It's exciting. It's a movie I can watch countless times and never get bored of it (I have seen it several hundred times but can't count how many exactly). Simply, it's the quintessential action movie! One with a amazing story, super-cool hero, great bad guys, and awesome settings. There's not much else to be said...just watch it!",10,11,13,16 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Good for the masses
","Before anyone says I'm being a snob for the title in my review, let me state that, well, it's just true. Predictable, hollywood political, and just simply boring. I wasn't expecting much going into the movie (and truth be told I wouldn't have watched it if not for someone else wanting to). So I guess I'm a bit slanted in my opinion, but so would anyone else with any IQ over 72. Big explosions! Fights that don't mean anything! Huh...3 stars for the occasional laugh.",3,6,12,16 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Potentially good movie ruined by bad choices
","Well, after I watched 'The Force Awakens', I had wished that they didn't carbon copy 'A New Hope' and instead did something different. After watching 'The Last Jedi', I now wished they just carbon copied 'The Empire Strikes Back'...The pacing of the movie was off, and there were a lot of boring/pointless scenes which could have been deleted. The fleet chase was plain silly and could have been done a bunch of different ways better. Flynn and that useless unfunny sidekick also were just fillers; nothing necessary or interesting was happening there. Snoke died...wait...why was he even in the movie? We knew nothing about him and I guess never will... Luke and Rey's scenes could have been done so much better. I could go on but I think you get the picture.I'm not a die hard Star Wars fan (although I like the originals a lot), and I'm not a 'purist' of the movies. Star Wars or not, this was just a poorly made movie overall.",3,12,18,10 March 2018
