Requiem for a Dream," As real as you can get.
","My friends have always told me about Requiem For A Dream, and I have always wanted to see it, so for Christmas I purchased it. No other movie(and i have seen many) have affected me in the way this one has. Darren Aronofsky has directed a brilliant film. Im 18 years old and i am sure to never pick up heroin or any other heavy drug for that matter, i recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 13. Requiem is quite possibly the best anti-drug a kid could watch. I was pleased with the minimal amount of needle visuals, this made the movie easier to view. The cinematography is excellent. I have so many positive things to say about this movie, I cant stress how important it is to show to people this film.",9,1,2,4 January 2007
