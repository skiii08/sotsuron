The New World," A painterly poem. A poetic symphony.
","A painterly poem. A poetic symphony. And Malick is the master.If you can be in the moment and let this one pour over you, you just might experience a taste of nirvana.Malick's films get more and more exquisite.Days of Heaven, Thin Red Lineand now The New World. If you get great pleasure from lying in the grass and feeling sunlight dance in your eyes and feeling the wind's breeze across your cheek perhaps you will come away in some sense high after seeing this film.Great soundtrack is worth CD ownership.",9,4,9,10 February 2006
