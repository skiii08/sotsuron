Insidious: Chapter 2," Did Not Disappoint...Scary Fun!
","Insidious 2 (or any James Wan film) is like a little pill, it doesn't really affect you once you watch it. Sure it makes you jump and squeal a bit a increases your heart rate while watching it. But after a while, when you're all alone, you can't help but convince yourself that there is no such thing as ghosts. Yet you still get that feeling like someone is watching you and then all the images that you saw from the movie just pops up in your head. Yeah, that's what Insidious did to me. There were plenty of scenes that will really startle and scare you and James Wan did not hold back. The story wasn't entirely the best one, but it was well projected (Helpful Hint: Watch the first one before you watch this one). I saw it just recently and the theater was packed, it did not disappoint the audience for sure. Scary scary indeed.",8,1,3,13 September 2013
