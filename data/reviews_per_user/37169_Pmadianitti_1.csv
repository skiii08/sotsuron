Captain Phillips," Great Movie....
",Another wonderful movie with Tom Hanks. I just saw this movie today and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting was terrific by all and the story was interesting. It brings to light a subject that not too many people are aware of. The fact that its a true story makes it even better. What I like about it is the peaks of humanity and feeling that both of the main characters show despite the situation. You feel sorry for both characters. This movie makes you think about why people do what they do. I think it should be one of the best movies of the year and Hanks should be nominated for this. Great suspense throughout! Everyone should see it.,9,2,5,24 October 2013
