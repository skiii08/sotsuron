The New World," just another Pocahontas
","If it was sufficient to show lovely scenery than the movie would be a masterpiece, but I think a movie should be more than pretty pictures.The story itself was a bit boring and an excessively romanticize version of events. Do we really need yet another Pocahontas! (and to make matters worth no funny old willow tree).The movies main failing is it terrible continuity. Based on the reviews by the people who loved this film, I guess that discontinuity is what passes for 'artistic'. The continuity was so bad I kept thinking perhaps the scenes were dream sequences or an imagination of what might happen. As a particularly extreme example, the fort which apparently has 37 people (including children). They do a sortie out of the fort to disperse the naturals. Why would they do that, as defenders of a fort armed with fire arms and artillery they have a HUGE advantage as long as they stay in the fort -- but are vulnerable at close range to the naturals' clubs and arrows. They form a pike square, fire a volley, and then charge. Why would pikemen run into battle, it defeats the whole POINT of the pike as a close order infantry weapon. They have cannons! Why not use canister shot, chains, bars, stones, or grape shot from their cannons to disperse the naturals instead of a pike push? Anyway, they charge, and are overwhelmed and appear to be dying left right and center and the next thing is they are all standing around apparently negotiating with natives until one hothead goes and shoots someone. More close combat ensures, but in the next scene they miraculous escape into the fort, but have to fight natives climbing over the wall. It sure looked like they were dying, but perhaps they were only injured and were miraculously cured (in an age before antibiotics where a scratch could be fatal)? Perhaps a new ship load of setters arrived in the meantime full of reinforcements? OR It may be just be a case of really bad editing -- perhaps the standing around was supposed to occur first, then the pike push, then the retreat into the fort? Most likely the director had shot so many pretty pictures that he just couldn't part with any of them. Like Peter Jackson (King Kong) or James Cameron (Titanic), Terrence Malick really really needs a editor to work with him to CUT CUT CUT the crap, organize it, and focus on film making. Some directors really need to be put on a short leash.The excessive stuff and the poor continuity really takes away from what might have been a decent film. Dear Terrence Malick, please edit this mess and re-release it!!!Incidentally did natives bow to their leaders? Worth watching I guess, but just barely.",Null,0,4,11 June 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Zombies out for a good times.
","It used to be that the Americans copied British ideas for entertainment; this film suggests that the opposite is now taking place.A British Twist on the zombie film.The film is presented as a spoof on zombie films, but instead it really is a silly zombie film, rather than a spoof on a zombie film. The only British aspect of the film is that they retreat to a pub instead of a mall. Big deal. As a comedy it has its moments, but it is too much of a zombie film and not enough of a comedy. The first time they see a zombie, and the ending with zombie as pet are about the only parts I really enjoyed.If you like gory films, that make no sense what-so-even, that have an occasional joke, you'll like this one.But don't expect a great film.",Null,0,4,26 October 2007
Madagascar," The kids liked it, but enough with the anti-meat cartoons!
","Madagascar is a passably good cartoon for the little ones.I found it much, much more entertaining than say the recent film Robots. And the hour and a half during which none of my children spoke, squirmed, wanted more stuff (popcorn or drinks), or needed to go to the bathroom, suggested to me that it succeeds very well at entertaining its target audience. It also had enough adult oriented humour so that I wasn't merely suffering through it (like I suffered through Robots, or Pokiemon the movie, or the Cat in the Hat).I found some of the other reviewers comments rather amusing... One person suggested not to waste money or time on the movie 'unless you are under the age of 12.' Thats rather funny, because I'm pretty sure that the under 12 set is the intended audience. I get the feeling that some reviewers aren't able to appreciate the movie from the point of view of its target audience.Many of the best scenes are near the beginning -- the escape by the subway. And the penguins are terrific.The whole animals thinking and acting like people, was a bit tiresome. But animals acting like animals are rarely seen in movies. Its hard to believe that a lion would forget its predatory nature, just because it gets its fill of steaks.I really enjoyed the contrast between what one dreams about and what one really finds ('this suck' says one of the penguins looking at the ice bound wastes of Antarica), but I think that could have been played up a bit more -- for example I would like to have seen the Zebra discover that life is not so good in the wild, not just because of a friend turned predator, but for all the other problems involved. I would like to have seen them portray New York more realistically (the crime, pollution, litter etc.). Objections. There is a really pervasive anti-meat animal rights campaign going on in kids films these days. Sharks that have a 12ve step no-fish program; Vegitarian sharks Lions that eat bugs rather than talking warthogs or meercats the horrible monster 'sharp tooth' in Land before timeAnd this conspiracy is certainly not new... Dalmatians that are too precious to be turned into something useful (coats). The tears we shed over the death of Bambi's mother death... etc.Although I enjoyed the movie, the anti meat message was rather annoying.I suppose I agree with what Ebert said in reviewing the movie that seeing the lion picking his teeth while relaxing on a zebra skin rug would send some kids crying from the theatre.Not my kids though (boys ages 6, 9 & 12), they would have loved to see that... but other kids, normal ones (i.e., not my blood thirsty crew), might have been a little disturbed to see the environmentally natural predator / prey relationship explored in a movie.I give the movie top marks for bringing up the touchy issue, and for the amusing animation of animals turning into steaks (which made me a little hungry), but would criticise them for not following it to its nature conclusion... and instead promoting once again some kind of semi-vegetarianism (I believe some types of vegetarians are allowed to eat fish) reminiscent of the Lion King where bugs were OK to eat.",Null,0,0,23 June 2005
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," counter, counter, counter espionage at its finest
","I've always been a fan of John le Carre's novels. I was thrilled to here that one of my favourite novels had been made into a movie, but until this week it didn't look like I was going to be able to get a chance to see it on the big screen.John le Carre's novels are an intimate look at the day to day work of a spy during the cold war era. Not James Bond, who all the villains know, but real spys. This has no absurd escapes like one would see in the Bourne Identity and no major shot outs like the A team. Its not an action film, its a spy story. The basis of the story is that control believed that there was a mole in the British secret service and wanted to find out who it was. The speculation was that some one in a position of power in the circus was a soviet agent. The phrase trust no one really is apt in this film. George Smiley, a character who never seems to smile, is asked to come out of retirement and spy on his colleague in order to figure out who is the enemy spy hiding in the British secret service.Its not an easy film to watch. The film has a grainy quality that gives it the look of a film from the 70's. The flash backs can get confusing and George Smiley spends a lot of time just thinking. From what what I recall, the book is not an easy book to follow either. But once you are immersed in this world of paranoia and betrayal and intrigue, its very enjoyable. My 12 year old son also enjoyed it. If you like films about intrigue and puzzles, this is the film for you I truly wish they would make more films like this.",Null,2,4,21 January 2012
Interstellar," Silly new age spiritualism
","This movie is terrible on so many levels... good graphics... AMAZING GRAHICS... but the film made me want to gag so often... Not just the new age misinterpretation of quantum physics, and the non-sense of the power of love... and the paradoxical time loop that would mean he created his own destiny by tinkering with the past But moreover, the whole premise of a unfixable world where the only hope is to create space habitats to save people... Seriously folks, if all the food sources are being destroyed by a fungus, it will be pretty much impossible to get into space without bringing that fungus with them. Furthermore, if they have the technology to create a space habitat... they have the technology to fix this planet or at the very least to make habitable space on earth... so why not fix the world we have (or build biospheres) instead of wasting all that money and time and scientific brilliance on building a space habitat!!!",Null,4,8,18 November 2014
The Patriot," terrible history, but an OK brainless action flick -- Conan the Patriot
","As someone of Bristish ancestry, I feel very offended by this film... But on the other hand, the story is entertaining, the costumes are well put together and the military technology is for the most part well presented. Apparently Mel Gibson thinks we English are Nazis. Lets think, hummm, who ended slavery first the US? Very funny how the slavery issue is dealt with in the movie given the fact that it was the land of the free where slavery was accepted for another 80 years (after the war of 1812, Britian refused to give back slaves freed by the British armies because they argued that people are not property).It would be nice to see an honest film about the revolutionary war... people struggling for self determination and puritan ideology (a leftover from the disastrous English civil war) on the one side and on the other side a superpower not really knowing what to do, but above all not wanting to lose face in a manner that would make its rivals (e.g., France, Austria, Prussia, Russia, Turkey, Spain) think it was weakening.If you can get past the horrible depiction of the British, and the excessively nice depiction of the American, then the movie is an OK story about being forced to fight for ones family. It might be argued that this is fiction, but the story is about real events and present a very distorted depiction of real events that has the danger of distorting the audiences perception of those actual historical events. If Mels wants to write pure fiction, set the story in a fantasy world (e.g., like Conan the Barbarian, or Star Wars). If on the other hand Hollywood creates a story that touches upon real events in a manner than can damage the audiences understanding of it, I think there is an obligation to keep to historical facts.Incidentally the battle near the end where the Americans turn the tide in the movie was actually a pretty small affair -- Cowpens. It was an important battle because it was a turning of the tide where the American began to work out tactics that were affective against their more experienced but less numerous foe. The book 'What if 2' cites it as one of 13 times when the revolution was in danger of collapsing.Certain aspects of the film accurately depict how an invading army would act at the time... seizing food supplies, burning houses, rounding up enemies & spys etc... this was standard and not something unique to nasty British. Its called foraging. No army leader with any brain is going to leave behind resources that could be used by the enemy. The British however were one of the first armies to place explicit limits on foraging and destruction. During the siege of Quebec city (1758) the British soldiers were explicitly told not to burn any church because despite the general anti-catholic nature of the English commoner, the British leaders recognized that all Churches were sacred and that destroying churches would unnecessarily hinder the process of conquest. So burning a church by itself would be inaccurate, burning it with people inside would be unheard of.The movie also fails to depict atrocities committed by 'patriots' against loyalists.I think that the real disappointment is that the movie chose a cowardly approach of making the hero all good and the enemy all bad. We don't need to see the British colonel as an evil man. Hollywood never seems to understand the power of its own media. Executing a spy would have been within the rules of war (still are today), seizing property etc., but the movie goes out of its way to make him bad. He was justified in shooting the silly kid, but it would have made a better story, if he was shown to regret it (or if one of his men had shot the kid). A firm, but honorable enemy (just doing his job, fighting for his King, protecting his back) would have been a much better choice. A sympathetic portrayal of the enemy would actually be (1) closer to the truth, (2) make a more definite stand about values (what they're fighting for -- For Independence and self determination, not against British brutality), and (3) help reconcile old wounds by redefining the battle as one about a clash of values, not a clash of good vs. evil. Few wars (if any) are about good vs. evil.Mel, how about making a film about the revolution that both American and British citizen can watch, enjoy and come away thinking, now that was a good movie. Instead Mel chose to vilify the British to sell tickets... ironically he did this at a time when the old enemies continue to form part of the strongest superpower alliance the world has ever seen.",Null,2,3,25 July 2006
Ratatouille," a delight
","This film was a pure delight. I loved the juxtaposition of garbage eating rats and fine french cooking. I loved the idea of turning the nasty reputation of rats on its head and making one rat's quest to create the center of an amusing story.It was hilarious. Yes it was absurd, but then most of the funniest jokes are absurd -- what Disney used to call plausible impossibilities. I'm not sure if I'd group it into the top 250 films of all time... too many other great films, but it was a pure delight for a Sunday afternoon at the movies. It is by far the best film I've seen this year so far. My children (boys ages 8,11 & 14) all enjoyed it very very much.",Null,4,7,25 July 2007
To Rome With Love," Hilarious study of love and life in Rome
","Cute movie. Four stories of love and life in Rome. One story was of an older man following what appeared to be his younger self around and advising him about falling in love with a friend of his girlfriend.In another story an ordinary man is suddenly made into a celebrity complete with a photo paparazzi. and the media hangs on his every word for a couple of day... and then he is dropped as an object of importance. I'm not sure if that was supposed to be some sort of cruel reality TV show. The film was directed by Woody Allen. He also played a part as the father of one of the other characters, and he used to be involved in the music business, but was ahead of his time. The most hilarious part, to me anyway, was Woody's discovered of a fantastic opera singer, who can only sing in the shower. I shall now always expect an opera star to be carted onto the stage in a shower.The fourth story is about a shy couple in the big city for the first time, lost and confused, and who accidentally end up both cheating on each other.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," OK film, but terrible fight scenes
","Badly choreographed fights scenes detract from what would otherwise have been a decent film. The traditional Kung Fu movie always had the actors perform superhuman feats, but they were done in a way that always left one thinking, wow, how did he do that. But in this movie, the wire work is so obvious it kills all possible enjoyment of the martial arts. One doesn't think, 'how did she do that' because the wires are just so obvious. And if the flying and jumping is so obviously fake that it make you think the entire fight scene is fake. Realism is fight scene is especially important when viewing a woman engaged in martial arts; to buy into the idea that she is a great warrior, the audience has to believe in her skill. So its particularly important that skill show be at least plausible.Visually the film is stunning. The story might have been interesting, but I was so turned off by the poor quality of the action sequences that I really stopped paying attention to the story. I've seen many, many eastern martial arts films and this one has the worse choreography of them all.",Null,0,1,3 February 2008
2012," This is what happens when special effects drive the story
","2012 is not just another end of the world film; its the dumbest of the lot. Knowing, had some intense emotion; deep impact had drama; the day the world stood still and the day after tomorrow had a message. 2012 has none of that. It has special effects of plane dodging around earthquakes, falling buildings, and volcanic bombs and ash. The story is basically some scientist find out the world is doomed to have catastrophic disasters -- that apparently happen every 600,000 year if I recall correctly. Nutrinos then mutate (nutrinos don't mutate because they are not alive) and start reacting with the core heating it up and causing the crust to destabilize and move. If they had change to become reactive, why would they react on the core and not the crush.... ahahahahahaha logic does not work with the mess of a plot. Although one would think that magma would be the first sign of the impending disaster, no, its non-tectonic earthquakes that are the first sign. Anyway to save parts of humanity, the governments of the world team up and build arks (as in Noah's ark) to save life as we know it - well the very rich and important people anyway. But instead of building them on the coast where they could be launched they build them in the mountains where they'd be crushed during earthquakes... But wait only one is damaged by an earthquake. Add to this the government that keep it all a secret for some unstated reason... why not give everyone a change to buy their own boat and have a chance to survive.Anyway. the fact real tsunamis are only dangerous on land and barely register out in the open sea is never mentioned... apparently these Tsunamies are unique and require mountain top arks to survive. and these tsunamis stay on land for quite some time, but the film does not explain why these tsunamis defy gravity so well -- this is something about ocean floor stability is some confused non-sense in the background.Everest is flooded by a wave 1500 metres high -- math was not a strong point of the directors I think. Oh, and lets not forget that China moves 1000 miles and yet only one ark is damaged in the ensuing earthquake... compare this to the Indonesian earthquake/tsunami that was around 9 on the Richter scale that moved the ocean floor a 100 feet or so... how could China move 1000 miles would out the mountain caves collapsing!!!!! OK, yes you go to a movie to be entertained, but this movie was not entertaining it was just a stupid film designed entirely around the special effects with not a moments thought to creating a satisfying story. It was not entertaining because it was not interesting to be entertaining.With all the man made disasters that are much more probable, having a film maker stir up the audience with a silly contrived film about an improbable global disaster is just irresponsible. Its seemed designed to distract the audience from the more real disasters we are busy creating for ourselves (polutions, CO2, depleted oceans, dead patches in the oceans, ozone depletion etc.).",Null,2,4,29 March 2010
Taken," Daddy knows best and France is dangerous
","This silly but very violent bit of non-sense could be summed up neatly as daddy knows best and France is dangerous. Not much else to the story.Basically a girl from a well off background gets trapped into the sex slavery market through kidnapping and drugs, while visiting Paris.The Daddy is some sort of superman super spy who now works as a body guard. He knows all about the world and was immediately worried when his daughter set off to spend some time in Europe with a friend. He knows how dangerous the world is and of course, in the traditional Daddy knows best theme... it turns out that France IS a dangerous country. So, then daddy turns into superman secret agent and kicks butt all over Europe.If you don't mind pointless violence, like French bashing, the obligatory Arabic sounding bad guys, or if you think that outrage over a daughters abduction justifies torture, murder and other atrocities (shoting some French cop's wife) than, well, perhaps this is your film.Personally I vacillated between laughing at the stupidity of the premise, thrilled at the display of martial arts, and at the same time disgusted over the film's violence.Regarding the stupidity of the premise, I should explain that there is a terrible irony in the depiction of Europe as dangerous when the murder rate is 3.6 times higher in the US than in France. In addition, sexual slavery often involves importing 3rd world women into the US (and into France for that matter); not kidnapping well off US kids in France.",Null,51,76,2 June 2009
The Da Vinci Code," entertaining but rather silly
","This film should have degraded into a Monty Python sort of self parody. The filming was good, the acting was good, it was exciting it parts, but the story is so silly that I just couldn't believe the actors could keep a straight face during the show. It comes close to being a parody of conspiracy theories. If it wasn't for the complete lack of humour, I think I would have found this film to be very funny.What more amazing is that people are apparently now taking Dan Brown misinterpretation of the Grail seriously as an alternative history and the conspiracy for real.OK so lets get this straight. Jesus was married -- big deal. He had a daughter -- big deal. His bloodline still exists -- big deal. And one branch of the church is protecting this blood line while another wants to end it.... why exactly should we care if he (1) had a daughter, and (2) that her descendants are still amongst us, is not clear. Oh, but if the truth had been told the would be a much better place today free of racism, sexism and so on! This last idea makes about as much sense as idea that the meaning of life is 42 -- it just does not compute.Apparently the body of Mary Magdalene is important because it is proof of this silly story. First there would be hardly any genetic relationship between Jesus and the current descendant. Assuming that there would be a generation every 20 years (in the past women married before they were 20 -- so 20 is a reasonable estimate), there would be about 99 generations. That means that the relationship between Jesus and the current descendant would be .5 to the power to 99 -- which according to excel is 1.57772 E-30 -- that is essentially zero genetically speaking. The descendant might as well be randomly selected. Not even the guys at CSI would be able to make that case stick. Unless the descendants have been meticulously interbred for the past 2000 years, the current Grail would have no more relationship with Jesus than you or I. Perhaps thats the real shockers of the story, the incest necessary to keep the blood line pure! Aw, perhaps they mean mitochondrial DND!!! That would be possible if and only if the current woman was from an unbroken line of females dating back to Mary Magdalene. However that would only prove that the person in question was from the same general population as Mary Magdalene -- not that she was a descendant at all because mitochondrial DND is not person specific. For example apparently amongst all the native Americans that have been tested there are only 5 strands of Mitochrondial DND which are also shared with some other peoples in Eurasia. So the current generation might have the same pattern of mitochondrial DND as the corpse of Mary Magdalene, but so too might millions of other very distantly related people. And even if the current grail was related to Mary Magdalene, it would not prove descent from Jesus.In addition, getting genetic material from a 2000 year old body is not an easy thing to do -- they might not actually find any usable genetic material left.Finally, even if they were by some miracle able to prove the descent from Jesus.... what difference would it make!!! In setting up this genetic link as being so all important is Dan Brown actually telling us that Jesus's divinity rested in his genes -- a sort of Mutant X -- god power? That could be passed on to his descendants? Gods spirit (if you believe in such a thing) presumably was in Jesus's soul, not the body, and therefore if you believe that he was the son of God spiritually, the genetic link would be irrelevant -- the Godness of Jesus would not be transmitted to his descendants and therefore his progeny would just be ordinary people -- not demi gods. The idea that the children of Jesus would be divine as well would be more like the Roman religion (Where the children of Gods are demi-gods). One critic suggested that the book challenges the divinity of Jesus -- but his bodies ability to have children really says nothing about his divinity. Are we to think that Jesus wasn't divine because he could have children? If so, then why is the san grail special? If Jesus was just a man like any other then his bloodline would be irrelevant so why do we care about protecting the identity of his descendants? Another oddity is that to protect his descendants they kept records of them. Why keep records? Wouldn't it be safer not to keep records? And why have they set the little room up like a museum with dates for the various members of the secret society? On the other hand I didn't dislike the film. It was entertaining and the actors were pretty good. Some of the story was far fetched -- hiding in the back seat of a car to escape the police. But not a big problem.I don't personally believe in any gods so I was not offended by the characterization of church in the film. I must say that the fact that Dan Brown can create such sacrilege and get away with it, is a really testimonial to how far the catholic church and Christianity in general has grown and matured over the past few hundred years. There have been a flurry of shows debunking the Da Vinci code (several a lot more interesting that the movie itself) but no sensational anti-Da Vinci code campaign or death threats that I know of. The relative lack of a (over) reaction by the Christian community must be applauded. Their lack of a (over) reaction and really renewed my respect for Christianity.",Null,2,4,16 March 2007

I think you'd have to be married to get some of the jokes. I love the framing with the use of marital therapy. And the marital squabbles about a past marriage during a shoot out / car chase, what a blast.Spoiler alert*** The story to set up the action makes no real sense, but since when does the set up of for a joke need to make sense!

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Nicely done, but way too long
","The story is interesting and has some merit, but its not the greatest story. As ring stories go, the Islandic Sagas (Tolkins source for some of his ideas) or Wagner's Rings of the Nibelung are much more interesting stories. Why personify evil and divorce it from human nature at all? Albrect's ring (in Das Rheingold) is not evil, but the lust for its power drives gods, giants, dwarfs, and men mad and turns giants into dragons. Its a much deeper story philosophically than Tolkins version. Both Tolkin's book and the movie could have been shortened considerably.... with each new ending of Return of the King, the audience audibly groaned.... not another anti-climax.... Get on with it. I made the mistake a buying the extended version on DVD... A movie that is already too long, made even longer.... I suspect there is a good reason that directors aren't normally allowed to make the final cut -- they like to drag things out too much.and those boring scenes about human / elf love... yawn...

300," Being a cartoon is no excuse
","I enjoyed this movie a little bit. My kids (boys) loved it. The story is OK, but predicated on the audiences willingness to see stupidity as heroic (never retreat, never surrender). Much of the story and the dialog were stolen from the 1962 film The Spartan 300. Much of the acting is massively overdone -- worthy of early episodes of Star Trek. The film is all done in dim colors to hide the poor quality of the set design. The costuming is ridiculous. It was mostly Spartan armor and strategy that gave them an edge over the Persians. Why are they depicted nearly naked? My main problem with the film is related to the gross historical inaccuracies. Yes its based on a graphic novel. But the fact that it is a live action version of a cartoon, sorry, graphic novel, is no excuse for being so historically wrong or for promoting racist attitudes towards the Persians.Spartan's as freedom fighters! Gag. They were slave masters. They ruled with an iron fist. They practice eugenic selection on their own people in order to breed perfectly stupid warriors.Persians on the other hand, freed slaves, allowed all ethnics groups to return to their place of origin (e.g., the Jewish people were allowed to go home to Isreal). In fact Persians are believed by some to have created the world first declaration of human right. In addition, they promoted the idea that all of the nations that came under the umbrella of the Persian empire, were equals... an idea that did not occur to anyone again until the 20th century.Yes the Persians invaded Greece, but it was because the Athens was interfering in the Persian owned Greece states in Anatolia.I wouldn't say the Persians were right to invade. I think the Spartans stand of the 300 was truly heroic, and saved Greece so that Macedonia and then Rome could take it over instead. The Romans incidentally greatly admired the Spartans for their discipline. The British also admired the Spartan coldness towards their children. Nonetheless it is instructive to recall that Sparta no longer exists in part because their harsh treatment of their children, their stupidity on the battle field (e.g., never retreat! what idiots), and the harsh treatment of their slaves the helots who revolted.The thing I don't like about this movie is that it presents a complex historical event as a very simple conflict of good vs. evil and it has such a strong anti-Persian view. Most films have some underlying political content. In the original 1962 film The 300 Spartans the message was 'we Brits stood up to the Natzi, just like the Spartans stood up to the Persians, and we'll do it again if the Russians attack.' At the time the West was facing a real threat so creating a shield thumping rah rah film is excusable. But in the current context with the US as the preeminent superpower -- and the only real threat is terrorism (defined by military experts as a desperate war by the powerless against the powerful). The whole vilification of the Persians is inexcusable. It certainly does nothing to promote understanding of international politics or history -- indeed it does the very opposite.That final speech about an age free of tyranny and mysticism really annoys me given the complete lack of freedom in the Spartan world and their adherence to a mystical ideal of the warrior.They couldn't even get the skin color of the Persian right (they should be white or at most lightly tanned -- the Persian were Caucasian and speak a language's that shares many words with European languages such as Greek, German, French, etc.).",Null,2,3,4 September 2007
Ran," A Masterpiece
","King Lear has never really appealed to me. I'd much rather see big Bill's history plays (especially Richard II and III) than suffer through Lear. Ran is based on King Lear but it is so much more. Ran is a true masterpiece of art, drama, image, theater, and music. Kurisawa has taken elements of the greatest art of the west and the east and blended them so seamlessly. Kurisawa looked into Lear and pulled out a gem that I had never seen in Lear -- of how the Gods look down and sob at our evil actions (scene 21 on my DVD) and asks the question 'why do we kill each other?' The film is haunting, it is stunning, it is so much more. Usually I can find one or two things wrong with a film, but not Ran. I like the Seven Samauri, but this to me is a much greater film, so much more universal and deep.To some of the haters: Yes it is overacted, that is quite intentionally a reference to No theater. It is sublimely overacted. Its not supposed to be realistic, its supposed to be grand theater in every sense of the word. The dialog and acting are much more natural then Shakespearean drama which was spoken in blank verse iambic pentameter poetry.The filming was quite intentionally devoid of close ups. The effect of the long shots is to separate us from the film a distance as if we are the looking down on the world where evil actions predominate... and perhaps we might learn. I finally have a TV big enough that I can appreciate this film the way it was meant to be seen.... but I wish I could see it in the theater.Yes it is long, but its about half the length of King Lear (If you've seen a Lear that is shorter than Ran, you've seen a heavily edited version).The film is actually quite accurate historically. Fire arms were used in middle age Japan. They were issued to peasants, not samurai (as depicted in the film wearing the typically conical peasant helmet). Muskets required a few days of training whereas the Japanese long bow required a life time of practice. Muskets proved decisive in a number of Japanese battles. I believe that after the civil wars ended (1608 or sometime like that), fire arms were banned by the Shogun. However, I do question the firing practices of the soldiers. The soldiers in this film all fired in either bad volleys (what we in the reenactment hobby call popcorn volleys) or independent fire. In Europe at the time forces fired in carefully controlled volleys because sparks from one mans gun could set off another gun or power source. The firing sounded more like modern fire arms, but perhaps that was intentional (see commentary on the criterion DVD, scene 20).Thats about it.See the film. Ita a masterpiece.",Null,2,5,1 January 2008
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpson's have truly lost their edge
","To tell the truth I had low expectations about this movie. Movies made to cash in on the popularity of a TV show are almost always terrible.The best joke comes just after the opening sequence where Homer complains about paying to watch a show that he could see at home for free... I always appreciate a show that makes fun of its own audience. After that.... downhill all the way.The story is that the lake is polluted and Lisa runs a campaign to clean it up. Homer, steals a pig from Crusty thereby saving it from death (something one would think that Lisa would congratulate him for). He appears to be a loving pet owner, which is rather out of character because loving pet owners tend to also be loving parents.Anyway, he saves the waste in a silo which Marg tells him to get rid of properly. Instead he dumps it in the lake. The pig waste tips the balance of nature and a mutated squirrel grows new eyes. The EPA comes in, gives President Swartzenegar 5 options, a dome is placed over the city, the Simpson's escape and go to Alaska, blah, blah, blah.OK, Simpson writers. I have news for you. Pig waste is natural. Pig waste is less disgusting than typical dog waste. If used properly is GOOD for the environment (fertilizer); placed in a lake is certainly not an ideal solution, but it would not create a mutant squirrel. Get your environmental problems straight. Industrial waste, or nuclear waste (doesn't Homer work at a nuclear energy plant! Duh!) or even careless disposal of household clearer or batteries would have made a more realistic story that would of made a point about pollution. But pig waste is natural! Anyway, why wouldn't Homer, just dispose of the pig waste like any dog owner gets rid of dog waste (e.g., flush it down the toilet, or put it in the garbage, or let it sit on the lawn, or let the pig poop in the park; yuck); why would he collect it in a silo? After that stupid story, the movie does not get better, it goes downhill.The Simpson's used to be a marvelously cynical satire on modern life. I find the show has really gone downhill in recent years; the jokes are getting rather old and lame and repetitious; and much of the slapstick is getting rather juvenile. But the show is still much much better than this movie.There are funny jokes in the movie -- especially centered around how politicians make decisions (so I give it a 2 for that, rather than a 1), also the spider pig theme is rather catchy, but is also very pointless. Overall there are few jokes worth listening too.On the whole this is a really bad movie; if you love the Simpson's, watch the show. Don't waste your money on this movie.",Null,18,27,4 January 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Dumb, Dumber and Dumbist
","This is the worst comedy I've seen since Dumb and Dumberer. The humour was, well, to say the least not funny. If you like stupid humour (e.g., Dumb and Dumberer) then this might be the movie for you. The depiction of many characters was offensive and I'm getting really, really tired of the French bashing in American made no-brain comedies.The only good part was when the Ricky Bobby's mother started disciplining Ricky Bobbys nasty children. Thats about it.I'm not really a fan of NASCAR so it might be that racing fans would enjoy this more. Is hard to enjoy a movie in which you don't care about any of the characters what-so-ever.My kids liked it, so I suppose if you are an adolescent looking for a movie that chases any intelligent parent out of the room, it might be worth getting.Fortunately I got it free from a library so at least I didn't waste any money on it (except for the late fee, because my kids forgot to return it one time).",Null,1,4,22 November 2007
