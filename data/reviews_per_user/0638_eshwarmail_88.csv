The Lobster," While it is well made and acted, the disconnect & incompleteness of the primary premise didn't allow me indulge into its absurdity
","Sometimes the premise can just be weird, but nothing that I have ever seen is so lack of sense, purpose or necessity. Having said that, the clarity, vision, ambition for this non-sensical concept has to be appreciated along with a committed performance from its top stars. In a future world where single people are taken to the 'Hotel' and given 45 days to find a suitable partner failing which they will be converted into an animal of their choice and sent off to the 'Woods'. David (Colin Farrell) has lost his wife recently after which he was moved to the 'Hotel'. Customary to the on-boarding process, the Guest has to decide which animal they would like to transform to in case they couldn't find a partner and David choose a 'Lobster'. Colin Farrell was on the path to become an action superstar when he started his career with back to back box office hits until it got derailed spectacularly with Alexander. He is a terrifically talented actor and the duds allowed him to associate with movies of different genres without the necessity to alter scripts for mass appeal. 'The Lobster' is one such movie which is so offbeat, independent and full of experimentation. The entire movie making process was structured, well edited, smartly produced and aptly cast. However the constant voice over to explain the proceedings shows a weak screenplay and the lack of purpose or necessity of the primary premise left me disconnected occasionally. There is also a rebellious group who fight to stay single (again without a purpose or a backstory) which again leaves you wondering about the motivation for any of their actions. The rebel leader's actions and why anyone would follow her also leaves you with more questions. Most of the unanswered questions doesn't feel like a meta narrative that lets the audience decide for themselves but as just incomplete.While it is well made and acted, the disconnect & incompleteness of the primary premise didn't allow me indulge into its absurdity.",6,0,2,20 August 2016
Whip It," Mildly engaging and easily forgotten
","Reviewed May 2010There is nothing on display that is either new or would impress you as what we expect from a director's debut - fresh ideas. It follows a template structured narrative style that is visible in most movies of this genre and tries to emphasize similar values as following the passion or about friendship, love lost and gain etc. Just a few working formulas are chosen, a new backdrop picked and hashed into a movie. Out of all these what goes right here is that they don't do a bad job at it. I have admired Ellen Page's performance in Juno and she is only getting better at it and this movie also features a host of good supporting performances too. The roller derby scenes could have been done a lot better and when I saw that Kiwi stunt woman I thought we are in here for a treat of sequences. There is absolutely nothing from her and overall a bit too disappointing. It's a movie where you don't get bored and the performances try to connect with you for a bit, but by the end memory of the movie fades away quickly.",6,1,2,6 January 2017
Men in Black 3," A more energetic, simple and fast paced addition to a faded franchise
","Fun, energetic and the time travel gimmick did work. Josh Brolin was a fantastic addition making K his own with a subtle impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones that does wonders. As a plot, it is still as thin as the first two editions with no new innovation to the special effects, gadgets or weaponry.Boris The Animal, an alien assassin who was captured by K (Tommy Lee Jones/Josh Brolin) escapes from a maximum security prison on Moon. Boris vows to avenge his loss of limb caused by K. He plans to go back in time before K does the damage and kill him. When K goes missing from the present, it is left with Agent J (Will Smith) to correct the past.What it does to best is to sticking to its basics on what worked before and adding a fantastic addition in Josh Brolin. I get it that Apollo 11 is one of the most remarkable milestones in human history, but the Hollywood's obsession to revel on this period makes it a little been there already so many times feel. Maybe it allows them to add those loopy bits of music in their soundtrack which otherwise might not fit in contemporary stuff. The main antagonist has the required buildup and motivation but lacks the superpowers to make him formidable. Emma Thompson and Alice Eve who play older and younger Agent O respectively had very little to do going by what they can do.A more energetic, simple and fast paced addition to a faded franchise",7,0,2,2 December 2012
Lucky Number Slevin," Glossy to look at but never stays with you after the credits roll
","Reviewed June 2011Someone has watched a lot of Guy Ritchie's movies but couldn't make one in the same league. My rating is purely for entertainment value where the pace is quick and is occasionally funny. But if you take this movie as a whole, well it is full of holes. It is a story of mistaken identity where a guy is thought to be in debt to the two most powerful men in the city and is pushed around to make them some favors and is also closely followed by the police. It tries to exude style out of every frame while killing, getting killed, scared, angry etc etc. The performances were so flat even with the talent available just for the same reason mentioned earlier as Arnold Schwarzenegger could've played every role in the movie and could've pulled it off. The story was complicated to great lengths and the non-linear screenplay adds to the trouble of making it even more. It also has that revelatory end that unfolds in a way the Scooby Doo writers will be very proud of. The story is left for extreme coincidence and perfect execution of a plan that was hatched long long ago. Finally, it is just another case of style over content. Glossy to look at but never stays with you after the credits roll.",6,0,0,6 January 2017
Captain Phillips," Thrilling raw drama
","What's with Tom Hanks being stranded in the sea and giving a stellar performance for a character to root for? An edge of the seat thriller defying the conventional runtime with a very strong antagonist character having layers of depth that even the Dark Knight's Joker could have a run for his money. While majority of today's action thrillers rely on massive set pieces, special effects, explosions etc, it is good to see a fulfilling raw human drama between very original characters.Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is your average captain of a merchant ship MV Maersk Alabama with a thinking cap and practical attitude. Muse(Barkhad Abdi) is a volatile young Somalian pirate with a devil- may-care attitude and lots of enthusiasm to out perform his peers. When Muse's hunt for prey encounters MV Maersk Alabama, the crew throws everything they have at the pirates to keep them at bay. but Muse's determination and the ship's under preparedness to handle such a situation leads to the capture. What stays in between is Phillips composure, perfect study of the situation (though initially) and his practicality.Barkhad Abdi is not your typical antagonist with his petite appearance and a not so captivating voice. But his unpredictability and a misplaced courage and stubbornness makes him more than difficult to handle. Tom Hanks shows his masterclass throughout the movie saving his best for the climax. Now what comes to mind about Paul Greengrass? The man who popularized the frantic camera movements and exhaustive editing skills that we have seen from 'Bloody Sunday' to the spectacular 'Bourne Ultimatum'. But he did show some promise towards handling complex human emotions in 'United 93' that does spillover to this one too. What works for the movie is its simplicity and for good or bad, doesn't lose focus from the main subjects like dealing with their back story or the perspective of their family. Which is similar to how it is done in another of this year's wonderfully done 'Gravity'. Powerful acting and a solid hand behind the camera delivers a first-class nail-biter .",8,1,2,21 December 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," A tense atmospheric thriller supported by able cast is possibly let down by an under-cooked payoff that is not worth the wait
","Did it really happen? Is he good? Is the other guy good? Am I still the same person? Too many questions keep popping up throughout the movie without getting much of the answers for most part. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a talented actress and she seems to have found the right balance between off-beat independent cinema and mega-budget studio offerings and this movie actually is a bit of both. The tense atmosphere, terrific acting by its leads, the suspenseful twists along the way kept me quite engaged until it is all undone by a hasty, under-cooked climax that threw all the good work done so far out the window. If the rumors are right, a script about an abduction of a girl followed by imprisonment in a basement (aptly titled 'Cellar') has been modified to have a science fiction twist after JJ Abrams production company Bad Robot acquired it. More rumors try to connect it with 2008's independent hit 'Cloverfield' but I couldn't find where the link was. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is going through a rough time in her relationship and starts on a road trip alone. She meets with an accident and wakes up in a basement with her legs chained to the wall. Puzzled and scared, she is greeted by Howard (John Goodman) who says that he rescued her from the accident and also the airborne chemical attack that has wiped the population outside. She remains skeptical and when clue after clue unfolds, she understands the true nature of Howard. But is that the only monster she has to fight?The movie starts with a beautiful soundtrack that loops through the first few voiceless minutes and broken by Michelle's accident which is when the story kicks in. The screenplay toys with the audience by giving the same knowledge what Michelle has and letting us think with her and solve the puzzle. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a terrific performance as the scared and vulnerable girl who is unsure whether to be grateful to her savior or fight her way out from the abductor. Just when Michelle seems to make a little breakthrough, a highly coincidental incident occurs to put her back in place. So the screenplay could have been a little more smarter there. She is well supported by John Gallagher Jr. playing Emmett who is yet another occupant of the basement and helps her put some thoughts through. They share a warm friendly chemistry especially during the montage when they have to kill the time through board games. But John Goodman's fantastic performance as the temperamental conspiracy nut whose mysterious intentions is what takes the movie to another level. As the screenplay puts clues in strategic places and keeps mounting the suspense, it will only work if there is a huge payoff and there is one - but might not be to the liking of everyone. The genre fusion which is very prevalent these days targeted to reach more audience, might actually be in a little trouble losing out on the actual genre audience. A tense atmospheric thriller supported by able cast is possibly let down by an under-cooked payoff that is not worth the wait.",7,1,3,24 July 2016
Skyfall," A very well made action thriller not just for the Bond fans
","Easily the most entertaining Bond movie I have come across and the best after 'Casino Royale' which only beats it for its trend-breaking factor. A Bond movie is basically an action-thriller and the thriller part has been forgotten for so long until the movies with Craig started and this one complements it to the core. It got most aspects right with a good balance of dramatic elements, subtle humor (occasionally Q misfires not with the bad taste of jokes but the wrong timing), a villain to match, brilliant visuals and action sequences (I especially liked the silhouette fight in Shanghai), pulsating background score (the one with the rapid violin mixing Adele's tune and Bond's theme) and a strong climax (though the final action took forever).Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed dead when a pursue mission goes bad. He comes out of his exile when he learns about the bombing of MI6 headquarters by a former agent Silva (Javier Bardem) who is planning to exact revenge on M (Judi Dench) for betraying him during his time with the agency. M is under scrutiny for the security breaches from Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and she wanted Bond so badly that she puts him on active service even though he fails all his tests. With the body count rising, Bond resorts to isolate Silva to take him on individually going against odds with little firepower and no backing from the Agency.It is not without its flaws even with all the positive chatter for example, the bad guy getting caught intentionally has been overdone these days and the editing during some action sequences did not look studio standard and so are the numerous obvious continuity errors or goof-ups. Craig looked old and may not suit for another installment but fits the part perfectly as the story recognizes his aging. The Bond girls share too little screen time unlike its predecessors. It was a surprise for me when I heard Sam Mendes will be directing a Bond movie but he actually did a fantastic job by having a good story, developed characters but also mixes all the craziness associated with the franchise.A very well made action thriller not just for the Bond fans",8,1,8,12 January 2013
The Young Victoria," If you like Emily Blunt, you should give this a go as you see more of her personality than the Queen Victoria.
","Reviewed June 2010Though this movie does not enlighten you more than a single glance at wikipedia, it does charm you with the talented Emily Blunt. Though she is not pinup poster beautiful, she grows on you with every movie through her confidence and impeccable voice diction. As the name of the movie suggests, it is the story of Queen Victoria just before her coronation to a few years into her marriage with Prince Albert. The love story is mature and educative of the period's tradition in proposal and approach. What does not augur well in this storyline than most of the other British Royal movies is that, it is a very personal story of Queen Victoria and is told in a way that they knew her. So that thought in mind makes you feel this entire thing is too fabricated. It features apt support performances and production does not leave anything out to show the richness of it's dynasty. If you like Emily Blunt, you should give this a go as you see more of her personality than the Queen Victoria.",7,1,1,6 January 2017
Marie Antoinette," Stylish and extravagant like the protagonist, but it barely holds the ground with such little substance
","Sofia Coppola endured brickbats and razzies with her debut stint in 'The Godfather III' only to come out stronger as a director with a unique aesthetic. Apart from her trademark visuals and over the top soundtracks, she has a knack and penchant for presenting loneliness and people in out of place situations that hasn't been bettered before, especially my personal favorite 'Somewhere'.'Marie Antoinette' is an extravagant venture just as its protagonist, expectedly following a box-office and critical success - 'Lost in Translation'. With no compromises in the costumes, the background locales, the rich interiors or the talented cast, Coppola is armed to present her stylish vision to narrate the story of an equally if not more stylish Austrian-born French Queen Marie Antoinette, aptly casted and brilliantly portrayed by Kirsten Dunst.The story starts with Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) being shipped off to France for an engagement with Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman) who is a heir to the throne and eventually becomes Louis XVI. Being a stranger in a faraway land, Marie initially struggles to get accustomed to the traditions, pressure to conceive and being looked as an enemy/spy by some subjects due to on-going tensions between France and Austria. Once settled and with growing number of acquaintances, she embraces the fashion and party scene of Versailles and gets carried away with it. Her public display of extravagance and the diminishing coffers makes her a soft target by the hungry public during the midst of the French Revolution.Where Coppola succeeded in visual presentation of style and extravagance, she failed miserably in conveying the biography as it should have been. Intentionally or not, the major political events of Marie Antoinette has been conveniently replaced with more party scenes and display of elegant costumes which after a point gets repetitive in a biography especially. Since the story deals with the majority of Marie's lifespan and not just a segment in her life, it was important for Coppola to have included more of her protagonist's political choices into the narrative. Another interesting observation is that the movie never shows common public until the final revolution occurs, which is intelligent - as it makes the audience realize even harder by suddenly seeing soiled hungry people after repetitive partying and costumes and richness.Kirsten Dunst has fit the role like a glove exuding confidence, charisma and mischievousness necessary for the role and her presence is a major factor into making this movie watchable. Jason Schwartzman has a limited screen-time but does a decent job as the shy confused introvert. There are a number of other actors whose roles are partially developed like that of Duchesse de Polignac by Rose Byrne or Count Axel Fersen by Jamie Dornan and they seem to come and go without making any impact. Coppola is famous for her soundtracks and it was very bold even for her to come up with a contemporary soundtrack for an early modern period drama, but it does sound good with its slick editing and presentation. There are many movies with style over substance, Coppola (after Tarantino) seems to have made it her own with necessary skill-set and creativity to execute it to perfectness.Stylish and extravagant like the protagonist, but it barely holds the ground with such little substance.",6,0,0,10 May 2016
In Bruges," Simple story set in a small town has a very big heart
","Reviewed July 2011It deals on a very serious and sad story to be called a comedy, but it's consistence in humor is way too dense than your regular fun movie. It does not pack any laugh out loud kind of jokes, but the one that leaves a smile on you with it's subtlety and darkness and a nod of appreciation for it's wit. A hit goes bad as a kid gets killed by accident and the two guys Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) responsible for it are asked to go to Bruges, Belgium to get away from the heat. Takes a little while to get used to Colin Farrell's histrionics as it starts and it gets better as it goes. Gleeson does full justice to a terrific role. Bruges, the town itself is a character and justifies the title of the movie. Last and not the least, Clémence Poésy has the best smile going around and she is mostly used as a pretty doll. It packs sharp and dark satirical dialogue that is full of wit and fun and there are many sequences which makes full use of it, be it the ones involving the midget or how they go on in the climax about honor. Though there is nothing to enlighten you here (which one shouldn't be expecting out of any movie), it is a thoroughly enjoyable film with fantastic writing and performances.",8,1,2,6 January 2017
Chinatown," I will not say that this is a movie not to be missed, but you will not get disappointed if you take the chance
","The movie seemed to have a soul of its own. Acting oozes with confidence and there is an intimate understanding of the characters they are portraying. The background score is poignant and the screenplay makes sure the movie never lags.Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private investigator specialized in matrimonial dealings gets a high profile assignment to track the movements of the city's chief engineer of water and electricity department from a woman claiming to be his wife. After Gittes gathers and delivers enough evidence, it is all over the news next day and a bigger jolt was awaiting him that the women who gave him the assignment was not his wife, but an impersonator. Soon after, the engineer is found dead in the bottom of the reservoir and the police dismisses it as a suicide. To make things right, Gittes approaches his wife Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). Being vulnerable and no one else to trust, she requests him to pursue this case even further.Jack Nicholson is in his own personal best with occasional bursts of his trademark histrionics and eccentricity but stays true to the character apprehensive about his understanding of Mrs Mulwray's character. But the star here clearly is Faye Dunaway with her flip flops from a confident woman who has things under control to a vulnerable lonely woman. The complexity of the story is revealed in small pieces and the screenplay and editing does a terrific job in putting those pieces together for the audience.I will not say that this is a movie not to be missed, but you will not get disappointed if you take the chance.",8,0,1,13 November 2012
Gravity," Amazing while you watch, fizzles out a bit when you think back
","To be able to generate the amount of hype for a two character movie is one thing, to live up to it is quite another thing altogether. Alfonso Cuaron's thrilling space saga achieves just that. Though I wouldn't rate this big as a compelling drama, it more than compensates with its spectacular set pieces and jaw dropping visuals achieved through precise use of 3D technology. Even the drama quotient had its moments leveraging on more than capable Sandra Bullock's intense portrayal of a lonely stranded astronaut who has lost her way and hope but not ready to give up. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer who is on her first trip to space along with the smooth talking veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). When a Russian satellite is hit by a missile, the fast flying debris hits their explorer shuttle and drifts the two further into space. It now becomes a race against time to reach a nearby space station, get into an escape pod and reach Earth. While the movie gives a very satisfying visual experience with the leads charismatic and intense portrayal complementing each other quite well, the story as a whole leaves a lot to be desired and believable. Hopping into different space stations, reading through manuals and controlling the systems all made to look quite easy. Letting go of Matt's character that easily did not make any sense for the following obvious reasons - 1) He is full of life and wouldn't part with his life that easily for someone he just met. 2) They have no clear way of knowing the tensile strength of the string they are hung on. 3) They don't even attempt to save him before deciding. By not showing any other character on Earth with just some distorted voice signals, the director manages to create that eery atmosphere of loneliness which Sandra Bullock took it to another level. The use of latest and smartest use of 3D technology made me feel like I was in space for a moment especially when Ryan was rolling away in space, it was through Ryan POV and it made for a horrifying yet thrilling view. Like the director's superior 'Children of Men', the relentless and continuous action sequences and a restless screenplay doesn't let you ponder about its logic until it is done.Amazing while you watch, fizzles out a bit when you think back",8,2,4,28 October 2013
World War Z," A must watch on the big screen but strictly a one time watch
","Delivers exactly what the trailer promises, nothing less and sadly nothing more. At a time when there are a cluster of zombie movies with varying sub-genres, what makes this one unique is its treatment of the zombies as fast, aggressive and restless beings which are in your face whenever they are on screen. Boasting top notch special effects and massive action set pieces that sprawls the length and breadth of the globe, it is one heck of a thrill ride from start to finish. Having said that, it does have its share of misgivings - apart from Brad Pitt playing the central character with required intensity and vulnerability, rest of the characters as well as the depth of the plot leaves a lot to be desired.Gerry (Brad Pitt), an ex-United Nations staffer known for his thorough investigations is caught in the middle of a plague that breaks out worldwide which turns most of the humans into beasts. In an obligation to save his family comprising his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and 2 daughters, he joins the UN for a mission to identify the source of the plague. The clues and leads takes him on a journey across the world including Isreal, Europe etc, brushing past multiple close encounters. Can he find the cause, the cure and save his family in the process is what comprises the rest of the story.Though the movie leaves you gasping with terror and thrill through its superlative special effects, the emotional connect and the human element of the story hardly scrapes its potential. The point that the Zombies they are fighting were actually human beings like them before is hardly realized. For e.g., consider the Spanish couple who turn zombies before their son and tries to attack him. Mireille Enos neither brings enough depth required for the situation her character has been put in nor serves as the eye candy for a shallow viewing. The writers and the director didn't seem to have made up their mind on where to take this incredible journey they have started so competently and sadly left it with their brilliant special effects and action choreography team to fill in for their shortcomings. The background score is apt and does not waver too far from the glimpse shown in the trailer. The zombie make up is on par but doesn't break any new ground especially when TV shows like 'The Walking Dead' is doing such a brilliant job. The climax was not satisfactory enough for me though I generally don't mind the meta finishes.A must watch on the big screen but strictly a one time watch.",6,0,0,21 April 2016
The Hunger Games," Worth a watch for Jennifer Lawrence. Nothing else stands out.
","Exceptionally cast and brilliantly advertised. Set in a futuristic time when all human rights activists had been wiped out and the world is ruled by fashion designers, we are presented with a story of hope, courage, romance and adventure.As a reminder of the treason the 12 districts had once conspired, the Capitol enforces each district to send a teen girl and a boy as tributes to take part in the yearly event 'The Hunger Games' where all 24 of them have a death match that is promoted as reality TV. This is the story of Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) from District 12 who volunteers in place of her selected sister and she pins hope on her intelligence, maturity and hunting skills.The movie boasts of super hype from the books, terrific cast and high production values. But what it really has is a wafer thin story line and themes that have been hashed out numerous times. Most characters perform with conviction as they play roles that go through desperation, fear and display of primal instinct. Apart from this, nothing stood out for me. Most of the aspects felt generic like the special effects, background score, screenplay void of any twists etc. With not having read the books, I couldn't see where this plot could ever lead to spawning 3 more sequels.Lawrence gave her best and is worth watching for her. Nothing else stands out.",7,0,2,22 September 2012
Zootopia," Relevant to a fault and gives an important lesson to its young and adult viewers alike bundled in an entertaining package
","There has never been a dearth in good animated movies especially the ones catered to young audience and Zootopia makes no exception. Beneath its charming lead characters, kids friendly action and comedy, an interesting plot and top notch animation lies the premise which is designed to be too metaphorically equivalent to current society which I think could be the only downside to this entertaining romp. Any standard stereotype tag you name it, you got it here - underdog, buddy cop, judgmental society, prejudice, beyond all odds, **spoiler alert** projected-good-character-is-the-villain etc. It is a world where animals of all species have evolved to shed their natural instinct and live harmoniously in the same society. Judy Hopps (voice by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a feisty young bunny from a small town who is determined to become the first bunny cop in Zootopia. Despite the prejudice and the physical limitation, she successfully enrolls and completes the Police training with top honors through sheer hard work and wit. When a sensational case of 13 missing mammals breaks the headlines, the Police Chief Bogo (voice by Idris Elba) overlooks Hopps and assigns her the traffic duty. Her judgmental view on fox species lets her catch a petty thief Nick Wilde (voice by Jason Bateman) a stumble upon a lead on the missing mammals. Clearing obstacle after obstacle she uncovers the abduction of all the missing mammals that points the Mayor Lionheart (voice by J.K. Simmons) as the chief accused. But is it the end of investigation?There are many aspects that contributes to a good movie or story, either some more aspects or bettering the existing ones make them great. But the level of audience connect with the story makes them a classic. Zootopia falls short of the classic level but has everything to make it great. First and foremost, is the story interesting and entertaining? Full marks for that. Are you able to relate to setup and get involved in its plot? Sure. A lead character that you would want to root for, a wily fox that breaks your stereotype, a supremely entertaining Godfather- esque episode, a ROFL worthy extended sequence involving a sloth, a nude sequence that jumps on you, a thrilling chase through the rodent town and many more. It also has a moral on not crossing a limit to get even - which is very important for young viewers.Despite its familiar premise, generous use of stereotypes and pop culture references and a Scooby-Doo style plot - there is a maturity and skilled handling of some sequences which results in winning moments and that's exactly what makes a movie successful. On top of its beautiful animation it is complemented by excellent voice performances and minimal and apt use of background score. Relevant to a fault and gives an important lesson to its young and adult viewers alike bundled in an entertaining package.",8,7,13,4 June 2016
The Impossible," Touching and powerful occasionally but a little flat overall
","It starts off as a movie with a disaster waiting to happen just as advertised showing off happy moments, family bonds and future expectations just enough to ensure when the disaster hits, it hits hard. It did hit hard. If you forgive the occasional pacing issues and consistent coincidences (being a true story it is nothing short of miraculous), the actors will leave you with a feeling of unease with their brilliant natural and touching performances. The tsunami scene was quick, short, devastating and mostly well executed. Naomi Watts deserves a special applause along with the kid who played Lucas.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) are moderately happy couple who comes down to Thailand for a vacation with their 3 sons Lucas, Thomas and Simon. Just when the holiday mood kicks in the disaster strikes without a warning. With utmost perseverance and love for life Maria and Lucas endure themselves to safety badly beaten, scarred but not broken. On the other side, Henry is in search of his family. How their unbroken spirit and persistence help them to find each other constitutes the rest of the story.The scene where Maria is stuck in a frenetic underwater current makes you look away but could have been done a lot better. It was also difficult to watch with my ardent fear of water. If not for a true story credit, the near misses and the way the family finally reunite looks a bit undercooked. Naomi Watts shoulders the first half of the movie but Tom Holland (Lucas) steals the show for a short while by portraying a kind, confident yet vulnerable character. Runtime could be edited by a good 20 minutes and the melodrama and over emphasis of the power of human spirit (though apt in this instance) was a bit too much. Background score does not leave a mark and nor does the Thai locals performance.Touching and powerful occasionally but a little flat overall.",7,0,2,17 January 2013
Argo," Darkly funny, toned down performances and attention to detail makes this a winner
","It is not easy to put you on the edge of your seat especially if you know how it is going to end which is where Argo triumphs. Hostage rescue from a hostile territory with no macho action or physical daredevilry requires some smart writing and believable performances which are a plenty as do the period and location attention to detail. Some aspects do look highly dramatized and fictitious especially the last step where the rescue happens just in the nick of time from the Iranian republican guard or intelligence. The dark humor is hilarious at times and background score is superb when required. It is a well made entertaining movie but may not be of Oscar winning worth. Ben Affleck has come a long way surpassing expectation and building a solid reputation for himself as a director with each venture, this time he has done one better by coming out of his comfortable Boston setup.Loosely based on the rescue and exfil operation of 6 American diplomats who were taking refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's residence during the midst of the Iranian Islamic revolution. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) proposes a preposterous plan to CIA to rescue the six American diplomats. It was so farcical that they all believed no one would suspect it and it worked. The basic plan is to setup a fake production of a middle-eastern themed science fiction movie titled 'Argo', pose the diplomats as location scouting crew and get them out. The operation is planned to the T with the help of his trusting superior Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) and ably supported by his Hollywood acquaintances Lester (Alan Arkin) and John Chambers (John Goodman).Talking of humor I just couldn't control myself laughing for no reason in John Goodman's introduction scene without him even saying a word. Bryan Cranston fits the role perfectly with a new look since the only other role I have seen him and so often is his egotistic manipulative Mr. Hiesenberg. The Hollywood script reading exercise could have been a little toned down, CIA hierarchy and method of general operations felt too generic. In some parts, the urgency and dramatization felt a little forced to elevate the thriller element. Ben Affleck thankfully was superb with no special histrionics and brings a sense of calm which was so required. The actors who play the diplomats were well chosen and bring in their best at the right moments. Last but not the least is the high attention to detail in regards to the gadgets, clothing, sets and location of the period bringing in a highly authentic feel to it. People playing the Iranian guard were also very intense and believable.Darkly funny, toned down performances and attention to detail makes this a winner.",8,0,1,11 January 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," It is an enjoyable movie for most part until the writers gave up leaving the stars to carry it on their own.
","The build up, humor and chemistry between characters was so good in the first half, the remainder felt like watching a totally different movie with generic writing that just runs through the motions. While talking about the good parts, it is remotely inspired by a subtle combination of 2 iconic movies of the genre - 'American Beauty' and 'Love Actually' with performances inching close to the former. Cal (Steve Carell) has just been asked for divorce from his wife of 25 years Emily (Julianne Moore). His son Robbie (13) is infatuated by his babysitter Jessica (17) who in-turn has feelings for Cal. Emily is reluctantly seeing her colleague David (Kevin Bacon) while Cal meets a mysterious young womanizer in a bar Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who teaches him how to loosen up and get score girls, Cal makes decent use of it. When Jacob meets an interesting but nerdy girl Hannah (Emma Stone) and decides to put an end to his ways and meet her parents, all hell breaks loose. My synopsis has taken a bit of effort to finish both from my side as well as yours (if you haven't taken a nosedive midway), well that is how the characters are linked and I have not included all. The story is about these relationships blended with slightly intentional dark humor. More than the script it is the performances that make it work. Be it the comic timing, just the beauty of watching them or the emotional depth (nah). Like I mentioned earlier, had the second half been handled with a bit more care and some innovation, it would have become an instant classic. The first half makes smart references of contemporary verbiage, Carell's unique histrionics and giving enough screen time for rest of the superb cast portraying well developed characters. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone continues to shine in every endeavor they take up. The kid who plays Robbie is very entertaining. The background score, cinematography and editing does not deserve any special mention here. It is an enjoyable movie for most part until the writers gave up leaving the stars to carry it on their own.",7,2,3,13 November 2012
The Other Boleyn Girl," Entertaining but ends up as unutilized potential
","Reviewed June 2010Though it features fantastic production values and decent acting, it falls quite short of an epic classic it could have been. It is based on real events during the initial phase of Henry VIII's infamous six wives saga. This is a story of ambition, power, ego, jealousy and lust and the makers should have gone all out with an R rated content to induce the grit, drama and madness of the period; Instead it wimps out as an uninvolving paperback thriller. Main problem here is that it does not linger on any important moment as it jumps all over the place in a hurry that leaves us no character to care for. Having said that, it should be appreciated for it's lavish sets and costumes, beautiful locales and all this richness captured in the best camera available today. Natalie Portman delivered a fantastic performance as the wily ambitious Anne Boleyn, a commoner who changed the face of England by making the already married King Henry part with the Roman Church to make way for her. Eric Bana looked apt as King Henry VIII and was especially good with his cold stares and authoritative one line repertoires. Finally it is still an entertaining movie but if you know a bit about the history of this story you cannot ignore the potential that was not utilized.",6,1,1,6 January 2017
Bloody Sunday," A powerful gritty drama with excellent acting and cinematography
","Reviewed December 2011I am an admirer of Paul Greengrass movies mainly for the editing and camera work which led me to watch this. An up close account of the tragic events that turned a peaceful Irish 1972 Civil rights march to a deadly massacre which ended with 13 civilians killed and twice injured kick-starting a political blame game. Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt), the Member of Parliament for the Irish town of Derry leads the charge of a Civil rights march. The British government bans the protest making the march illegal and also involves the military to crush the situation. Like any other riot anywhere else in the world, one thing leads to another involving rowdy hooligans, trigger happy policing and groups with vested interests. The movie divides its focus on a close look from Ivan Cooper's stand point, the British Military view and a couple of families that were affected by this day. Keeping in mind that it would get offensive for the real victims if there is even a single point in the script that justifies the military action, the writers and the directer tread carefully and mostly plays safe. Paul Greengrass shows his early taste for editing and camera work, but his talent is not on best display here. James Nesbitt does a terrific job as the man edging on emotional crisis with the way the day has turned out, but has to maintain his saneness and composure to concentrate on the operational details. Sometimes gets a bit melodramatic and too emotional, but they must have been apt for the circumstance. Doesn't push it as hard as it could have and gets a little biased on the victims side. It has great moments placed in between mediocre ones. I wouldn't say it is a great movie, but does enough to use the emotional depth of this true story.",8,1,1,8 January 2017
Ted," It is nowhere near as funny as it should be.
","An episode of Family Guy might have more jokes than this entire movie. Sure I enjoy Seth McFarlane's brand of comedy but they are too few and too far.John (Wahlberg) is a lonely kid and wishes for his Teddy Bear to be able to talk to him and his wish is granted. Skip 25 years and the Teddy Bear (Ted (voiced by Seth McFarlane)), now a pot smoking foul mouthed ex-celebrity is still living with him and is coming in the way of him moving forward in his life and relationship with his long term girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis).The comedy genre is very similar to that of Family Guy mixing together Peter, Stewie and Brian according to the situations. The premise is quite familiar and does not go adventurous. Wahlberg has a good comedy timing and Mila Kunis sleepwalks through the role that she is quite accustomed to. Have to commend the CGI team for perfectly blending in Ted to make him feel real.It is nowhere near as funny as it should be.",6,2,4,9 September 2012
Oldboy," Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride
","It is one of those movies where you can neither guess the reason for the revenge nor the actual end play (by midway). Definitely the emphasis is on style over substance, glorifying goriness than the emotional connect and acting is definitely not its strong suite. Despite its emotional and language barriers, it is a victory for movie making by having a stranglehold on audience attention up until 90% of the movie. Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is a careless drunk and has rubbed many people the wrong way. On his daughter's birthday, he is abducted and put in a room without giving a reason for the cause. He is put in an independent room of an apartment without any scope for a conversation except for a television, mostly drugged, fed the same duck dumpling and occasionally visited by a hypnotist. As he prepares himself by learning boxing and other martial arts from what he can gather from television to extract revenge on the person who might have done this to him and also digging a tunnel in parallel for his escape, one fine day he is let off after 15 years. Can he do what he has been preparing for?It is a captivating premise to be imprisoned without knowing the reason and source while also keeping the audience in the same state of ignorant mind as the protagonist. This establishes an empathy from the audience who will embark on a journey with the protagonist till the end of story (or the reveal). As the hype builds up over a period of time, it cannot be fizzled out with a run-of-the-mill reason and that's where the story kicks into another least expected dimension. All the loopholes and misfires are temporarily forgotten and we change to the new ride and hop along with a renewed interest which again acts in the movie's favor.A special mention should go to Ji-tae Yu who plays the character Woo-jin Lee, he does it with such elan that makes you think that you are not just seeing a good vs. evil story. The story and screenplay is well thought out and executed that greatly influences how the editing eventually turns out. While the boldness of the content is surely to be appreciated in a mainstream cinema, the way it ends is what emphasizes the grayness of the human mind. A classic generally attributes to how the audience reacted to it rather than how well it is made, in that aspect Oldboy definitely is a cult classic that overcomes the goofy acting, uneven scenes and continuity issues to become something that is much more.Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride.",7,1,2,24 July 2016
Black Book," Seduce you through sex, violence and drama
","Wonder how this stayed under my radar for so long while having so many things in excess - runtime, dramatization, graphic content be it sex or violence, production values, contriving, the number of characters and tragically failed missions. But what was hard to believe was the text that said in the beginning - based on real life events. Were they just referring to WWII in the backdrop? Though Carice van Houten gives her best shot, this multidimensional dream character was never converted to an Oscar vehicle.Backdrop is Denmark has come under Nazi rule and Jews are fleeing the country. Carice van Houten (Rachel Stein) is a Jew living in hiding. When her hideout is blown, she tries to make a run out of the country. She gets together with her family and gets on a boat. Rachel alone escapes a ruthless slaughter when a German patrol boat intercepts them. After she smuggles herself back into the city helped by a resistance group, she decides to fight for their cause. Her role is to setup a honey trap to a German Captain and assumes a new identity as Ellis de Vries.Carice van Houten fits the role perfectly upon her looks where she has to be equally cute, sexy and generous on nudity. Production values were extravagant for bringing an authentic feel to the period. With too many melodramatic moments and a highly commercial approach to presentation has not done enough justice to live up to the words in the beginning 'Based on real life events'. The resistance group is full of caricature characters you will find in any sort of group - an aggressor, a thinker, a comedian, a guilt driven paranoid etc. The dilemmas, perspectives and consequences that happen on the immediate aftermath of German surrender to the Allied Forces has never been dealt before - that too this period is not just a commentary based factual display but a proper thriller thread is induced here. Background score found wanting of elevation at certain moments, the action sequences look dated for its time.Seduce you through sex, violence and drama",8,1,2,17 November 2012
The Great Dictator," Audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious
","One of the funniest opening sequences followed by a highly audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious work of Charlie Chaplin ending with a rousing poignant speech. While playing his run-of-the-mill tramp character with his usual flourish, Chaplin delivered a masterstroke as Hynkel - a mockery of Hitler by generating laughs from the eccentricity and egotistic nature of the character. By making a comedy out of the highly precarious situation of the Jews exactly during the full blown Holocaust might have garnered a reputation for bad taste, but enough care was taken not to hurt feelings and all the angst is directed towards the fascists.A Jewish Barber (Charles Chaplin) suffers amnesia after getting injured in the war saving a General. The barber remains contained in a hospital staying ignorant to the ascent of a tyrant Hynkel - the eccentric dictator of Tomania (Charles Chaplin again) and the condition of his kind. When he stands up to the harassing fascist soldiers after walking into the turbulent world he earns love of Hannah (Paulette Goddard) but wrath from the fascists saved timely by the General. Meanwhile Hynkel is plotting to invade Osterlich by tricking Napolini, the dictator of Bacteria into pulling back their army.Charles Chaplin is already a legend in playing the tramp character, but Hynkel was a different ballgame for him. It is a character of aggression, superiority and eccentricity but still clumsy as the tramp. The war sequences, rich palace settings elevates the scale of the movie compared to his previous outing, an equally magnificent 'Modern Times'. Chaplin is a gifted all rounder with a profound writing talent that always portrays the triumph of looking at life in positive outset and a sense of humor. The background score is melodious and rich according the situations. Paulette Goddard looks aged and heavy compared to 'Modern Times' but retains the charm and infective energy she possessed there. The remaining actors and the technical departments do an apt job in putting together this masterpiece.Audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious",9,2,4,16 November 2012
Concussion," Honest, earnest and textbook storytelling that doesn't achieve the emotional touchdown it hoped for
","What could have been an exhilarating story of putting a Nigerian doctor in the centre of a major controversy involving America's biggest sports body NFL, it rather whimpers into a safe and uninteresting screenplay that trudges to the finish line that you are already waiting for so long. Will Smith might have been too big a star to portray the earnest with the accent and all, my take would have been to have either Chiwetel Ejiofor or Jamie Foxx play it instead. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is an accomplished, unconventional and very passionate pathologist who has immigrated to United States from Nigeria. He has a very practical vision about the American dream, meets a girl Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) through the Church and they fall in love and get married. All goes well until he unearths a pattern of deaths related to retired football players starting with a local favorite Mike Webster (David Morse). When Dr. Omalu starts raising his voice through print media by relating the head banging of the game leading to long term fatal health issues, he becomes a target for one of the biggest and most powerful corporations of United States.Featuring an ensemble of very talented actors, it is safe to say that it is a very well acted movie. But the main problem is the safe direction, which follows a textbook storytelling approach in such a linear format of a script without a bit of innovation in screenplay might feel a bit too exhausting considering its runtime. It also deliberates a bit too long on a love story that feels a little underwhelming. I understand it is a story of a real person and we can't and shouldn't do much to elevate the drama and entertainment factor just for the sake of it, but the script could have focused outside of Dr. Omalu's life and other people involved in this piece of history and identified some other interesting aspects around them. After all it is not a documentary and some documentaries these days are more interesting than this movie. It is not just the story, but presentation matters, entertainment matters and very likely commercial aspects matter considering Will Smith with no resemblance whatsoever with Dr. Omalu and being a huge star gets cast in the lead. Honest, earnest and textbook storytelling that doesn't achieve the emotional touchdown it hoped for.",6,1,2,17 June 2016
Ready Player One," If you are a 90s kid or if you are not. Go watch it.
","What a ride!! Steven Spielberg's new sci-fi saga is a ton of sweetness with effectively used pop culture sprinkled all over a blasting of Van Halen's 'Jump' at the right moments - it isn't a new invention from a Michelin star chef but your very own favorite grandma's recipe served in a new way which has a better probability to succeed.The year is 2045. The world is consumed collectively by a virtual reality game - OASIS. When it's creator dies, he leaves an Easter egg for the world to find and the finder gets to own and control the OASIS. There are individuals, families, friends, conglomerates employing gamers - all trying to solve this mystery until Parzival/Wade (Tye Sheridan) stumbles into a clue that changes the whole dynamics.Steven Spielberg left no stone unturned to mount this simple storyline on to the big screen. There are dinosaurs, rolling boulders, King Kong, DeLorean, Atari and other innumerable pop culture references that can't be missed by a 90s kid.

Suicide Squad," Comical climax, muddled screenplay, under-cooked character arcs pull down an otherwise better attempt from DC in recent times
","Put together a fantastic cast: Check; Bring in fan favorite cameos: Check; Get an entertaining and not so gloomy script: Sort of; Create a terrifying and terrific antagonist: Meh!!; While it gets some things right in comparison to recent DC offerings (apart from the Batman Trilogy), to see it in the bigger scheme of things in terms of re- watchability, scope for a sequel etc., it doesn't seem promising especially with a contrived script, disconnected sequences, uninterested Will Smith (save for some witty one-liners). Saving grace in the form of Margot Robbie carries the entire movie on her shoulders for a while, but there is only so much one can do when it is weighed down by poor editing, generic script and uninventive plot. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), a clandestine Government agent puts together a team of imprisoned supervillians to participate in dangerous covert missions in exchange for lenient prison terms. When one of the recruit June Moone a.k.a. the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) goes rogue and threatens to destroy the Earth (Duh!), the team comprising of Deadshot (a bored Will Smith), Harley Quinn (an excellent Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) dubbed Task Force X led by decorated Commander Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). Once off the leash, will they resort to their evil ways or fight as a team they were hoped to?There are definitely some positives compared to the dull and gloomy Batman vs. Superman debacle - cheeky one-liners, a very original and different take on Joker by Jared Leto, a superb rendition of Harley Quinn by Margot Robbie, par visual effects and not too many dull phases. There were two main failures and a number of sub-failures - a run-of-the- mill plot, sub-par villain, under-cooked backstories and farce of a climax. It could have had a slightly positive effect had it released 5 years ago, but that's not the case and it already looks dated. The charismatic superstar Will Smith is reduced to a side-kick and doesn't even have as much screen time or presence as Margot Robbie which is surprising but not out of place.

Doctor Strange," A very generic origin story trope innovatively packaged with visual effects, hilarious script and strong casting
","Marvel has a special knack for origin stories and it is quite evident with Doctor Strange. Easily one of the most visually innovative of the lot recently along with Ant-Man and the familiar climax destruction sequence has a smart twist too. A barrage of funny one-liners (occasionally corny too) and lead-character orientation reminds you of the first Iron Man movie, casting of Benedict Cumberbatch is definitely a winning decision. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), apart from being a gifted neurosurgeon is also arrogant and egotistic. His world comes crumbling down when he meets with a car accident that leaves his fingers unstable and incurable. Unable to leave his legacy and on the verge of being bankrupt, his desperation leads him to Kamar-Taj - an alleged healing place in the Himalayas headed by The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). While she helps him get better after an initial reluctance, the place draws him into a world of mystic arts and dark powers. The primary working factors for this movie are visual effects, Benedict Cumberbatch and the breezy funny script. Even when delving into the multiverse and time bending concepts - the complexity is replaced with a humorous use of them where the negotiation with Dormammu, stealing books from the library and the astral projection gimmicks in the hospital especially standout. The imagination shown in Inception to alter physics is taken to a completely different level here and is well assisted with 3D effects. Mads Mikkelsen isn't as menacing as required for Kaecilius character and Chiwetel Ejiofor is also underwhelming as Mordo. But the Tilda Swinton definitely looked and did the part and Rachel McAdams is as reliable as ever. The credit time sequence which serves as a prologue to its next installment though very much expected, still generates enough excitement to look forward to.

Captain America: The First Avenger," Watch it if you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, it huffs and puffs to just cross the line
","Reviewed February 2012The greatest strength of this movie is it's makers clarity on it's limitations. So all along, it never shies away from making a joke on itself at the same time presenting a fast paced fun ride. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a pint sized man with a huge heart who is passionate about joining the army and serving the country during IInd WW. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) a bio-scientist working on a super soldier project from the Hitler's Hydra team escapes Germany and reaches U.S. to stop the atrocities of the Fuhrer. The head of Hydra Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) is hell bent on capturing Erskine and also in pursuit of a mystical power for dominance and achieves latter. Erskine chooses Rogers for the experiment for his passion and good heart, and makes him Captain America. As expected from the first product of the franchise, there is enough character building for Steve Rogers before he becomes Captain America and Chris Evans does enough to give a held back performance. There are a string of talented actors playing well known characters from the Marvel Universe and they do their part well. A breeze screenplay and well induced humor can only do a bit for it's flaws of inconsistent visuals, a lack of fresh plot and a lengthy runtime. The hype on it's set up for Avengers is a little overrated. Watch it if you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, it huffs and puffs to just cross the line.",6,0,1,9 January 2017
The Thing," With smart visual effects and leveraging on the drama potential the plot had - it is a decent horror movie
","There is a heavy B movie feel to this but it is a damn good B movie. It packs quite a few genuine scares and definitely enough suspense to hold your attention. I am also quite impressed by the visual effects used smartly and only when required. Acting could have been a lot better though. Set in Antarctica, the movie starts with a Norwegian member of a different station chasing a dog on his helicopter and in the act ventures into the American station's territory and injures one of the members while fully absorbed in his mission. They put him down, take the dog and decides to investigate what is going on in their camp. When they realize that a shape shifting Alien is among them consuming and imitating one crew member at a time, they stop trusting each other and more so themselves. The starting sequence is eerie that pans out quite leisurely with simple yet terrific background score. The build-up to the Thing could have been a little more progressive like in 'Alien' than one guy listing down what all it is capable of just by examining it's blood sample. Where the drama triumphs is the tension between the characters to trust each other than the fear of the Thing itself. It does have innumerable logical loop holes but clever enough screenplay that puts them on the background. There isn't enough emotion captured be that of fear or disappointment of not be able to make it back home. Some terrific scenes to look out for - 1. The dogs scared to death when the Thing put in their cage transforms for the very first time. 2. The starting sequence. 3. Some fantastic visual effects for the time - a man's head parting from the body developing spider-like legs and crawling off. 4. When the Thing transforms while all the crew members are tied to a bench. It may not live up to your expectation if you believe in all the hype around it. But with smart visual effects and leveraging on the drama potential the plot had - it is a decent horror movie.",8,0,1,13 November 2012
21," Doing anything else would be more fun
","Reviewed November 2011Winner winner chicken dinner, a lot of cheese dripping all over. Featuring good looking leads, a real big mentor and a simple script that may not go too wrong. The director messed everything up spectacularly. Trying to pull in every known stereotype attached to the game and genre, way too long in duration and he may better end up being known as the director who brought the worst in Spacey. Features a typical brilliant boy (Jim Sturgess), with an ordinary life and in need of money/scholarship to get into Harvard Medical school. He realizes his scholarship is in jeopardy and at the same time gets noticed by a shrewd professor (Kevin Spacey) who offers him a spot in his team that specializes in counting cards to beat the dealer in Blackjack. He accepts the offer for two reasons. 1) As a means to an end. 2) His long time crush Jill (Kate Bosworth) is in the team. Finally he ends up getting sucked by the glitz, glamour and easy money of Las Vegas. How he gets his act together comprises the rest of the story. Extremely cheesy with enormous number of redundant scenes featuring characters that are mere caricatures. Cinematography is good, background score is peppy, editing is slick and the lead character is believable. Kevin Spacey has given the worst performance I have seen of him and was a total letdown. They could've added a little more fun while presenting the Blackjack games than just the calculations in the minds of the geniuses that we should imagine. I was a bit disconnected with that.I could not think of any recommendation like 'Watch it only if ...'.. nothing comes to mind. Just drop it. It's easy and more fun.",3,0,1,8 January 2017
Knowing," Premise that had potential wrecked by both artistic and technical departments
","It is not exactly as bad as it is portrayed to be. Yes there are a lot of things that could have worked goes wrong. Be it acting, unnecessary side plot, simplicity of the discovery or overall execution. But one has to agree that the premise is quite intriguing and exciting and that worked for me.John (Nicolas Cage) is an astrophysicist and a single parent to an ear-disabled kid Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). In one of the school events, each student gets a letter from a time capsule (letters buried 50 years earlier by students of the same school). While most of them inquires about flying cars and robots, one that Caleb gets just contains random numbers. John gets obsessed with these numbers and accidentally cracks it to find that it contains the list of dates when major accidents or catastrophes happen, number of casualties and the location of where they occur. The last item in the list is soon to happen but the number of causalities and location is incomplete.Somehow Nicolas Cage gets these stories or they come searching for him of late. He is the only A listed actor in Hollywood who acted in most B movies. If the original plot from the synopsis was developed further and presented independently, it would have worked better as a good B movie. Adding the unnecessary subplot, hallucinations, personalization of the premise wrecks the whole interest in the movie. The climax feels more like a mash-up of other superior movies. The special effects are glitch ridden, acting sub-par thanks to Nicolas Cage of late and dialogues are cringe worthy. Except of the primary premise there is nothing that works for the movie which under utilizes every opportune scenario that could have elevated the thrilling aspect.Premise that had potential wrecked by both artistic and technical departments",4,1,3,13 October 2012
Hugo," A classic unlike Scorcese's earlier work
","How often do you see Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Kingsley in the same movie. It happened to me in a single week. How often do you see Chloe Grace Mortez play her age. Only once and this was it. And finally, what about Martin Scorcese doing a children based movie that too a 3D one. Now that I have established it is a crazy combination packaged as a classical movie, how was it implemented is the final question. Awesome!! Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who is covering for his uncle keying clocks at a railway station in Paris. He is passionate about a Droid the last thing he and his father (played by Jude Law) worked on. Hugo meets and makes friends with Isabelle (Chloe) who is being raised by George (Kingsley) and his wife and he has a mysterious past related both to movies and the Droid living a sad life. Putting into this mix is the Station Master (Cohen) with a limp who is by the book and determined to catch Hugo and also is in love with Lisette.It is an epic story spanning decades of achievements, determination, hope and innocence. Though not watched in the format, 3D does not seem forced. Screenplay is neat, background score majestic, cinematography and editing are done in a way the filmmaker knew what he wanted. Chloe does a tremendous job in pushing innocence and maturity to Hugo's character that complements well to the story.A classic unlike Scorcese's earlier work",8,5,6,14 October 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not the best of Fincher's work but a damn good one nevertheless.
","Tense atmosphere, lucid locale, intriguing premise and a breakneck speed defines this latest movie from David Fincher. Have not seen the original but loved every bit of this. Rooney Mara literally blew me off considering what she looked like and how she presented herself in the previous Fincher's flick 'The Social Network'. Such thrillers are hard to come by these days (mostly because each time the plot cannot be set to remote locations with limited access to technology or make them periodical).Daniel Craig (Mikael) is an investigative journalist who just lost a case of defamation on whom he wrote an inconclusive article. On the verge of being bankrupt, he gets an offer to write a biography of a wealthy patriarch in his twilight years and most of his life was influenced by the disappearance of his niece 40 years ago. Once he smells malice in the story, he recruits a malnourished, abused but a brilliant computer expert to help him solve the case.My synopsis adds nothing to what you already do not know and barely scratches the surface of its plot. The story comprises of an assortment of interesting and sketchy characters and the treatment is of orthodox whodunit style. The scripts invests a lot on ideologies of its principle characters which finally justifies what they do when they do it. The director though an expert in this genre considering Se7en and Zodiac does an excellent job here too placing more emphasis on the setup and atmosphere than the actual thrills which works wonders but I don't think he outdid his earlier mentioned work. Rooney Mara steals the show with her portrayal of a person who is difficult to be accepted by the society and leaves a lump in your heart while portraying her fate with subtlety towards the end. Background score is apt and cinematography is dreamy. The movie also boasts excellent production values in presenting the very short periodic aspect of the movie.Not the best of Fincher's work but a damn good one nevertheless.",8,1,4,13 October 2012
In the Name of the Father," Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite
","A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson).The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite",8,2,3,1 December 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Feels like a meal that finished with just the appetizers
","Its not new in Hollywood to present bland silliness and satire packaged with utmost seriousness, 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' comes off initially as a potential winner from this genre. While it had the necessary humor and a stellar star-cast capable of enacting that, the script neither reaches the edginess it should have nor pushes the boundary to make this movie memorable.Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is a journalist by profession and going through a professional and personal crisis that he is so desperate to get out of. When he meets Gus Lacey (Stephen Root) and hears about the US Army's 'New Earth Army' that deals with parapsychology and psychic capabilities trained by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), he knows that he encountered the story he has been waiting for that could get him out of his crisis. He meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) by chance in Iraq and tags along with him into wilderness to cover a 'mission' in action.George Clooney and Jeff Bridges have played goofy characters in the past - 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and 'The Big Lebowski' respectively, a little disappointed that they don't share enough screen space. However it was more than compensated with some crackling chemistry and impeccable comic timing between McGregor and Clooney. While the writers, director and editors succeed in setting up an interesting plot taking cues from disjointed real events, the audience would be stuck in a never ending wait for the stakes to go up. Kevin Spacey does a character he has done a thousand times over and seems to have sleepwalked it. The production values are excellent all thanks to the big cast it boasts of, though the quality of humor is great, the jokes are a little too few and far to get wholesome entertainment. Though the director Grant Heslov is not new to Hollywood, it is still his debut of directing a major Hollywood feature and does a decent job.Watch it for the satire, crackling chemistry and comic timing between Clooney and McGregor.

","Reviewed January 2012One way to come out of the bad vibe the third installment created is to give the fans exactly what they want. This one does just that by revisiting all the familiar places and times. To an extent it succeeds in holding the attention of the viewer but could not sustain all the way through. Shrek is in a midlife crisis and looks for a chance to have his untamed life back once more and meets up a sorcerer who offers him one day of his wish if he gives up a day of his past. This past day ends up being the day of Shrek's birth making him nonexistent for the entire past except for today. So the alternative universe he now traverses through has Fiona he never saved or the donkey he never met. The entire setup was a ruse for the sorcerer to take away the kingdom Far far away. There is a rebellion head by Fiona to end this tyranny in which Shrek joins to get close to Fiona. So it all starts back again as Shrek once again tries to make Fiona fall for him, learns the value of friendship and such. It is exciting and boring at the same time. It has it's heart at the right place but the execution gives away the makers attempt to win back it's audience by trying too hard. Shrek should be contempt that he hopefully got a better ending than his previous outing and they should stop making anymore of it. Strictly for the fans of the series to see it all happen just once more.",6,1,3,8 January 2017
Dunkirk," Dramatic, twisted and uplifting. Not the best of Nolan, but a great attempt to retell an almost harrowing story
","It can be a presumed general consensus that it is easier to become a star actor than a star director. While some enjoy cult following, others are more mainstream. Very few among them are able to consistently balance between the both which is where Christopher Nolan stands on a pedestal among his contemporaries. Nolan had a strong cult following throughout the early part of his career and then 'The Dark Knight' happened. The fans were at a fever pitch during conclusion of the trilogy with chants like 'in Nolan we trust' reverberating the entire social media; there is no such precedence for a movie director. 'Operation Dynamo' which is a code name for the evacuation of Allied soldiers from Dunkirk is a widely recorded operation that took place at the end of May 1940. When the British Expeditionary Forces along with French and Belgian armies were trapped in France surrounded by Nazi Germany troops at the height of their power, the only way out seemed to be an evacuation from Dunkirk which had adequate port facilities. The story is said from 3 perspectives - LAND: Where the ground troops are desperate to find their way to any of the ships available that can ferry them home; SEA: Told from the view of crew of one among many merchant navy and personal boats which came to the rescue AIR: A Spitfire squadron of three in lookout for any Luftwaffe threatsThe thing that strikes you most is the fact that you are in the middle of the operation as soon as the movie starts without a background or a narrative (even when I was not expecting one). The gloomy vista of the beach, pale and desperate soldiers, a body here and there sets up the chaotic but silent atmosphere without hardly a word being said. The electrifying yet subtle background score keeps you at the edge of your seat and takes the overall experience up a notch. A similar compliment for cinematography too. Christopher Nolan has so far been able to meet the sky high expectations of his fans and critics alike but there has always been a trick up his sleeve to wow his audience at some point in the movie. This is not that movie. It has far little character driven story to be considered as a dramatic movie and a complete lack of background narrative to be taken for a documentary. But it does hold a small trick that Nolan has perfected over the years - scrambled screenplay with intertwined timelines; It has become a bit of a habit to let the audience solve the puzzle which is his screenplay and the gratification one gets when the pieces are put together gives him a box-office hit. While I got entertained, I still find it evolving into a pattern. There have been many WWII movies. Some great ones too. What does Nolan's Dunkirk bring to the table in an already crowded genre? It neither has the grit of Saving Private Ryan as much as you hardly see a drop of blood in a war movie, nor does it feature the drama or compassion as in The Pianist or the flamboyance and entertainment value of The Great Escape. But it does hold its ground by staying grounded. There are no faux heroism sequences, an unremarkable debut of a very popular singer and does not try to suffocate itself with too many stories. The ensemble cast delivers to the point that you no longer see them to be acting. The irony of a victory in evacuation is not lost in its storytelling.Dramatic, twisted and uplifting. Not the best of Nolan, but a great attempt to retell an almost harrowing story.",8,3,8,31 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Insensitive, undercooked and unnecessary. Better watch the original again
","There should have been a real epiphany of a tremendous script to be even considered for a reboot of successful trilogy which ended not too long ago. The story doesn't waver much from the original, special effects look the same though it left me in awe the first time around, and the dialogues that seem to be later imposed over the action sequences felt terrible. I became an admirer of Marc Webb for his stupendous '(500) days of summer', but this one came out extremely underwhelming with an uncooked script and an inconsistent screenplay.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is left in the care of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) when his parents die. He is the same semi-nerd, gets bullied in school and invisible with the girls. When he comes across his father's research by accident, he decides to pay a visit to his father's old friend Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Dr. Connors is currently experimenting on cross species genetics in an attempt make limbs regrow using the DNA of a lizard. When Parker is bitten by a Spider when he accidentally steps into a chamber full of them, he senses something is not 'right' with him.It is too difficult and too recent to judge this movie on its own without referring to its predecessor. There really was no sense in rebooting the franchise with the material in hand for any artistic value. Marc Webb even blundered in his strength - romance and screenplay though Emma Stone does an excellent Gwen Stacy to keep it floating compared to an equally brilliant and slightly dark MJ by Kirsten Dunst. Andrew Garfield could have made a better Peter Parker but crushed by the insensitive handling of the moments on his reaction to the suddenness of the super power. Martin Sheen was an excellent inclusion who adds tremendous value to Uncle Ben's character. There is no sense of surprise by any character except for Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy when they realize Peter Parker is Spider-man which was baffling.Insensitive, undercooked and unnecessary. Better watch the original again",4,1,2,15 November 2012
Goon," Go with no expectations and you will not be too disappointed
","Firstly, it took me a while to realize stuff like this happens in real sports. Yes in a spur of the moment there can be a fight or two, but legally recruiting someone to rough up the opposition in a live game of hockey is definitely new. What's even fresher is Sean William Scott plays a humble down-to-earth character even after going for super-stardom.Doug (Seann William Scott) works as a bouncer in a local tavern who belongs to a family of highly educated professionals. One day a hockey team coach notices his talent of dealing with miscreants and offers him a place in the local hockey team, his job is precisely to protect the rest of the team and smash the opposition. He gets promoted to the state level team who is wildly encouraged by his foul mouthed friend Pat (Jay Baruchel). Here he comes face to face with a notorious and legendary goon of the opposite team Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) and facing him will make him part of history.Sean William Scott gives a humble performance who otherwise is associated with jerk like characters. Jay Baruchel is energetic and occasionally over the top, while the rest of the team members are aptly cast. Liev gives the necessary image required for the notoriety associated with Ross Rhea character as the face off builds up the second half of the movie. It is a simple story with generic sports drama elements only that it is not a normal sport and our protagonist is not a conventional sports person. Decent runtime, the injected love story starts good but drags a bit after a while. The final showdown drama is well done Go with no expectations and you will not be too disappointed.",6,0,0,4 November 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast
","'Wow!! A Super-Hero movie' days are gone with one releasing every month and the interest levels getting saturated with the audience. In these times, the studios, artists and technicians are always trying to find ways to out-do each other, come up with something fresh and innovative each revision which sometimes work. Marvel seems to be a clear winner in the genre war against DC which seems to be imploding with its heavy-handedness continuing the strategy successfully used by Christopher Nolan in the Dark Knight trilogy. On the other hand, Marvel seems to have understood the pulse of its mass audience better and kept churning out blockbusters with relative ease - but not sure how long the same strategy works.The storyline is very close to 'Dawn of Justice' and many other recent superhero ventures dealing with people's tolerance towards vigilante justice and accountability for collateral damage. After an operation to thwart a mercenary from stealing a bio-hazardous virus goes bad in Lagos, Nigeria leading to deaths of innocent civilians, the Avengers are held accountable and an accord is passed to give control of their missions to a UN committee. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Natasha a.k.a Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sees reason in this request and plays ball but not Captain America (Chris Evans). When a bomb explodes in the accords convention at Berlin, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) comes out as a prime suspect, battles lines are drawn and each member of Avengers are forced to take sides.What Marvel is getting right in the Avengers series is the treatment - after all these characters and story lines are straight out of comic books. While they try to build mature character arcs and brings in a serious plot involving death of some characters, the treatment is still on the lighter note focused solely on quick and cheap entertainment. If a viewer takes especially this storyline seriously, there couldn't be a sillier premise with the two groups of Avengers fighting each other but not seriously enough to hurt each other. Another attribute that Marvel has been doing so good is how to write a script that gives enough screen time and importance to this plethora of characters.Starting with the technical departments, the special effects are slick and on par with other recent movies. A special credit goes to the writers for coming up with a smooth screenplay with so many characters each having their space. While it features some of the best actors that Hollywood could offer, there isn't enough in the script which requires them to play out of their skin. Most of the actors are veterans in this series who has established characters and mannerisms, so rather than indulging in their performance analysis - I would rather go over some new characters in the Avengers series. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther doesn't come off as menacing as he wants to be without the costume, but the effeminate mannerisms with the costume makes it highly inconsistent. Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) has built his entire career on his comic timing and the writers have ensured they leveraged the most out of it. However the revelation has been how good Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tom Holland) has been integrated into the Avengers universe with lots of wit, charm and heart - which the web wielding audience favorite is know for. Overall the pace is brisk, the battle scenes of the actual premise is entertaining and silly at the same time while other action scenes are worth a watch, the actors seem to be having a good time and it shows in their performances. The makers have overstayed their welcome for sure with the repetitive gags and banter between their lead characters across multiple Marvel movies, I am not sure if I am ready for more of this.Entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast.",7,1,5,9 May 2016
The Butterfly Effect," Another instance of a great premise with potential fizzing out
","Reviewed July 2011It does have an interesting premise and that's about it. The route they took to present this premise is totally off. So far this fantasy concept of alternate universe has mostly been dealt in the comedy genre with some exceptions like the movie Time Machine. When you are going for something serious, it should be a hard hitting subtlety than amateurish sensationalism. Evan (Ashton Kutcher) occasionally blacks out at times from his childhood and a doctor suggests him to maintain a journal to keep track of them. When he is older, he finds a way to travel back in time to those blackout periods and those were the moments that have changed his life. As I have already appreciated it's premise that has a decent potential, every single instance Evan goes and changes the past, the future turns out in the worst possible way or he manages to make it worse with his inexplicable actions. Everyone applies their worst possible judgment to any given scenario. The performances were OK which was more let down due to the scenarios they were in. The plot however bad it is, is woven quite well between the blackouts and the instances of future. Visual effects were just ordinary and the pace of the movie is quick. Another instance of a premise with potential fizzing out.",5,0,3,6 January 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Bigger, better and more entertaining than the previous edition, but falls incredibly short from the adventures of middle-earth we have seen before.
","Definitely more exciting and entertaining than its previous installment that was inevitably burdened with introductions and setting up the base which to my opinion was a little sluggish. With more references to the LOTR storyline, this would appeal better to the fans of the popular trilogy. Shot and released in premium 3D, the number of effects are comparatively very minimal considering we should wear those glasses for its exhaustive runtime. However due to lack of enough interesting characters to root for unlike the LOTR series, the screenplay completely relies on the adventure element which is again a little unsatisfactory having seen similar if not better content already. In a prologue, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) reveals the reason why Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is part of the 'fellowship' of dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage). To reclaim their Kingdom Erebor, Thorin has to unite the 7 dwarf families which is only possible with the possession of Arkenstone jewel lying beneath the fire breathing dragon Smaug inside the lonely mountain accessible through the hidden door. Bilbo as a burglar is expected to steal that. With a little help from the Elves especially Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) who is smitten by a witty dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the dwarf pack manages to keep the Orcs off their tail, but would they be able to do the same of Smaug comprises the remaining storyline.LOTR's effectiveness comes from its multi-layered story with characters coming from a wide variety of backgrounds each having their perceptions and approaches to the common objective and the presence of Gollum. With none of those elements present, this edition of the Hobbit still comes out to be entertaining (sans the awe element). Another major drawback was that none of the lead characters actually standout. Having mastered the craft in presenting the beauty and wonders of middle-earth, Peter Jackson's experience, expertise and his aesthetics play a major role in the making of this enormous project. The climax of the movie doesn't go too well with the title of the movie, but leaves you lingering as good as 'The Two Towers'. The special effects, locations, costumes are directly progressed from past experience, but the action set pieces were a far cry from the middle-earth battles we have seen before. The background score doesn't leave a note you would recall. Having discussed quite a few drawbacks, there is still some good we can take from this movie like the following 1. The dwarfs escape from the Elves 2. Introduction of Smaug 3. Prologue featuring the town Bree and the famous tavern 'The Prancing Pony' 4. Legolas and Tauriel's incredible battle skills 5. Witty lines from Bilbo and KiliBigger, better and more entertaining than the previous edition, but falls incredibly short from the adventures of middle-earth we have seen before.",7,3,4,25 December 2013
Bridesmaids," Watch it for Wiig, I didn't find anything else worth watching here.
","Reviewed February 2012In some ways it reminds me of 40 Year Old Virgin for it's over the top gags, realistic and affecting emotions and an excellently written and performed central character. Through the movie, you laugh, you cringe and you connect. But sadly, by the end of it - you don't care. Annie (Kristen Wiig) couldn't get her life together be it her love life or her professional. Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is Annie's best friend from childhood who is about to get married and she chooses Annie as the Maid of Honor. Though Annie has the best intentions, everything she plans and tries backfires with some help from the other bridesmaids led by Helen (Rose Byrne) and she loses it at some point which leads to her getting fired. While the entire engagement to marriage episode is panning out, she meets a lonely patrol officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) who guides her to sanctity. It is Kirsten Wiig's show from start to end. I became an instant admirer from her role in Paul and she shot through to the top with this. Few women possess the comic timing like hers and an ability to be cute and awkward at the same time which is so required for these roles. Apart from Wiig and a little from Byrne, by the end I cannot say I have enjoyed it as much as other Apatow's treats. Watch it for Wiig, I didn't find anything else excellent here.",6,1,3,9 January 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An adventure that felt a little unnecessary but entertaining and spectacular nevertheless
","Its inevitable but to draw comparisons with LOTR trilogy and rightly so. The theme, cinematography, music, some scenes are direct descendants from LOTR with some beautiful 3D visuals. Peter Jackson has played the nostalgia card to brilliant effect leaving a perfect time gap from the previous trilogy. Some scenes may feel redundant, some characters not very well developed and the overall story so far is neither as complicated nor as involving leaving everything to be done by the acting and presentation departments who deliver the goods.In the Shire, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is getting ready for his birthday (the same day as in LOTR: Fellowship of the ring) while finishing up on his book. He recalls the 60 years earlier adventures in his mind with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) in a fight to reclaim their home. Also recalls his encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and possession of The Ring. Martin Freeman was cast perfectly and he oozes life into Bilbo while Ian McKellen is as solid and charming as ever. It follows the same theme as the first edition of LOTR with dwarfs, Gandalf and Bilbo forming a fellowship on a mission with a stopover at Rivendell, encounter with Orcs and a sight of the destination at the end. But the mission is less involving and even less adventurous so far, the fellowship does not have the variety of characters and Martin Freeman is not the guy who is made out to root for.3D effects and CGI are of top quality especially the following scenes > Introduction to the cause for which the dwarfs are fighting for > Zooming to show the ghost warrior > Birds, insects flying towards and away from us. The final scene with the Eagles. > Scenes with GollumAlso some scenes felt quite unnecessary and forced > Mountain giants fight > The cheesy Orcs king > Unnecessary tension between Thorin and Bilbo does not help to reduce the flatness of screenplayYou haven't seen the actual villain of the story yet, but so far it has been the screenplay. It is flat with no effort to make it intriguing and the climax does not make you to sit up and look forward for the sequel. But it doesn't mean it is not entertaining with one set piece after another and a host of brilliant CGI effects give you more worth than what you paid for. The background score draws a lot of inspiration from the LOTR trilogy and I don't blame any of it except for the song at the end credits. An adventure that felt a little unnecessary but entertaining and spectacular nevertheless",7,2,10,15 December 2012
Before Sunset," Very well written and supported by good performances
","Reviewed November 2011This is more like a romantic version of earlier Kevin Smith's comedies. Very well written and it's quite mandatory that it is as the entire movie is just one conversation. I would've rated it a bit higher had it not dragged a bit somewhere in the middle. Jesse (Ethen Hawke) has a one day encounter with a French girl Celine (Julie Delpy) during his college days and has a wonderful time. They decide to meet again on a set date in the future when Celine doesn't show up. After 9 years, Jessi writes a book on the incident and gets quite famous. On the Paris leg of his book tour he meets Celine again and strikes conversation which is the content for the rest of the movie. For a wafer thin story like this, it requires excellent screenplay and a tremendous chemistry between the leads. The talent behind this movie sure delivers the required goods and a special mention should go to Julie Delpy for her excellent presence and contribution to writing. Only problem is that, it feels a little long to reach what it wants to show. There is a little drag just before they both get on the cab which spoiled my mood though it picks up soon after and ends fantastically. It operates on a shoe string budget and never deviates from the core of what it wants to show. It is extremely enjoyable and a good opportunity to showcase the writer's prowess and they do it with great panache.",8,0,0,8 January 2017
The Princess Bride," Not a Monty Python but definitely entertaining
","It struck me as a combination of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and Rob Reiner's own 'This is Spinal Tap'. While it has moments of laugh-out-loud slapstick humor like the former, also tries to invest a story of its own no matter how clichéd the characters or storyline is (of course it was intentional) as the latter. The exchanges between the kid and his grandfather starts a little disconnected but develops wonderfully as the story moves on. But Cary Elwes was the weak point as he neither has the comic timing nor the persona to pull this off.The bride (Robin Wright) falls in love with her farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes). When Westley heads out to the world to make a living, the news of his death in the hands of a dreaded pirate devastates the bride. An egotistic and scheming Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) betroths her to hatch an evil plot. By staging an abduction and blaming the neighboring kingdom, he plans to woo his citizens to back his war. He uses the help of Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) the brains, Inigo Motoya (Mandy Patinkin) the steel and Fezzik (André the Giant) the muscle. When the dreaded pirate comes thwart his plan, it becomes personal.Rob Reiner knows how to make a slapstick. Just like 'This is Spinal Tap', he doesn't go all out nasty - but picks the essential clichés and use it to his advantage. But the movie is far from perfect due to relatively shortage of gags where it ebbs and tides between lull and hilarity. The thread between the grandfather and kid was so important for this movie to click as they interrupt the fairytale in the exact moments where it starts to become too much or too dull. The trio of the brains, steel and muscle were so perfect together and they produce some real entertainment. Cary Elwes was missing the quality that the rest of the cast had - natural comic timing and comes off as a weakling and makes it difficult to root for him.Not a Monty Python but definitely entertaining",7,0,1,15 November 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Don't believe the hype and watch with a clear mind, there is a chance you might like it.
","Reviewed December 2011Way too much hype undid the movie for me. It didn't have the mean bad guy the other missions had and the stunts are only as good as MI3. But still it is a fantastic ride and a welcome addition to the franchise.It starts with a delivery intercept gone wrong where some top secret information has gone to the wrong hands and a macho prison break of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) from a high security Russian prison aided by his team consisting of computer guy Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton). On accepting a mission to recover secret tapes from inside Kremlin, things go wrong as vested interests uses IMF team as bait to distract and steal the Russian nuclear launch codes. IMF is implicated in the blast and theft and a number of people are looking for them. His team with limited ammunition and support, has to clear their name and save the world. The screenplay is breezy but the script is far from tight. There has never been a mission where Hunt works from inside IMF and this one is no exception. What lives up to the hype surrounding the movie are the couple of fantastic thrills involving Burj Dubai. Tom Cruise gets a special mention for his effortless stunts while exhibiting the charisma. The final showdown ends in a hurry (though not void of some exhilarating stunts) but the conclusion of the movie takes its time. Scenes involving Anil Kapoor and Mumbai are shoddy and extravagant. MI3 is definitely a better movie elevated by Hoffman, but MI4 doesn't do too bad either. Don't believe the hype and watch with a clear mind, there is a chance you might like it.",7,0,0,9 January 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," While its a visual marvel telling a complex and celebrated story, performances left a lot to be desired
","Well it did set 2 records for me - Longest movie by runtime and av featuring no female characters. I didn't realize both these traits until I crossed halfway. What goes right for it is the solid base material, extravagant production design and a start-of-art output from all its technical departments, but a big letdown from the acting front.Follows a brief but an influential episode of British Army personnel T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) based on his exploits during WWI to negotiate and lay a pathway between British and Arab interests. Also takes on his relationship with the feuding tribal leaders Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). His wavering loyalties between British and Arabs and how he becomes a pawn in a bigger political game played by Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) and General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) where they use him to take over Damascus thus dissolving the tricky Arab revolt.Peter O'Toole has the best lines in the movie and he delivers them with the requisite wickedness but his awkward poise and body language makes it hard to digest him as a war hero in the making. Occasionally Omar Sharif and most other small time Arab characters have given a horrendous performance diluting the epic scale production to a B-grade ripoff. The set pieces, number of personnel used combined with equal number of camels and horses would have made it a very complex project to produce but the final product has come out in flying colors. The cinematography and the desert locations were exotic and exquisite while the battle sequences which are neither gory nor inspires awe are saved by sweeping background score that perfectly compliments and elevates the drama. Though adapted from Lawrence's own writing, his fears and dilemma could have been more realistic than dramatic - it looked like what's referred metaphorically were shown literally.While its a visual marvel telling a complex and celebrated story, performances left a lot to be desired",8,0,1,24 November 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A surprise package for skeptical viewers, and I would say seeing is believing
","Reviewed February 2011Unabashedly good fun. It is based on a winning formula that has been tried upon an enormous number of times and only a few have succeeded in execution and this will be right among the best. The thrills, visuals and drama are just breathtaking. Will Rodman (James Franco) is a bio-scientist on the verge of pitching his latest invention, a cure for Alzheimer's disease currently being tested upon apes. All seems to be going well when the ape being tested upon goes berserk before a demo resulting in temporary suspension of the project. Later Will and the team realizes that the ape that was to represent the demo, just had given birth to its child and the earlier reaction was protective than aggressive. Will adopts the baby secretly and names him Caesar. Caesar has inherited the vaccine given to his mother and displays extraordinary analytical skills and emotions. In a freak incident, Caesar attacks a neighbor and gets detained. Spending time with his species for the first time and realizing the conditions of the place he is in and the attitude of humans towards the caged animals, he starts a revolt. Andy Serkis needs no introduction and one should not expect anything less than excellence if he is playing a central character, an ape. He delivers just that. He and the technical team makes you believe in Caesar's emotions, the pain and the urge to hit back. Animation is excellent and screenplay never drags. Has never been a fan of this franchise and this movie is the one to suck many new fans just like me. James Franco delivers a controlled performance and for most part lets Caesar to take center stage. Frieda Pinto is neither effective nor serves as eye candy. Background score mixes with the action and emotions well. A surprise package for skeptical viewers, and I would say seeing is believing.",8,0,0,9 January 2017
JFK," Time flies despite its daunting runtime - An informative and important film
","Reviewed April 2012The movie might have exaggerated, dramatized or manipulated certain real events, but what a stunning presentation featuring one of the best ensemble performances and intense screenplay that holds the audience attention for well over 3 hours. Though it reminds a bit of 'All the presidents men', it doesn't have its subtlety. It all starts after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the conspiracies surrounding the investigation. Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) a DA of New Orleans is convinced that there is a lot more to what the officials are willing to share and after finding a lot of loop holes in the Warren Commissions report, starts an unauthorized investigation with a small team from his office. He starts putting together facts, speculates certain conspiracy theories and the case starts consuming him. The fear, humiliation, object of losing his family doesn't stop him from going further. The amount of information, fact or fiction fed to the audience in extraordinary and since it is a little speculative and involves one of the most popular conspiracy theories, there is a better chance the audience gets sucked into it. Screenplay doesn't allow a single dull moment and every actor gives a one up performance scene after scene. The look of the period and a clever mix of real and shot footage helps too. One problem here is that, it does not just present the important facts and let the viewer decide, it thinks for the viewer too. Thus dumbing down and ending up one dimensional. Knowing the runtime beforehand might be a daunting task for you to attempt to watch this, trust me time flies is an idiom never more appropriate while watching this movie.",9,7,14,9 January 2017
The Bourne Legacy," It made sure there cannot be further extension to the already elongated yarn
","The first 20 minutes screenplay and acting in an attempt to be intriguing turns out to be rather pretentious, boring and cringe worthy. Only similarity I could find with the Bourne trilogy is the generous use of the words 'Jason Bourne', 'Treadstone' and the end credits soundtrack featuring 'Extreme Ways' but features none of the marquee elements such as the frenetic photography and editing, brutal hand-to-hand combat or the nail biting screenplay. The initial moments between Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner starts out to be exciting but ends up being generic and run-of-the-mill eventually.Number 5 (Jeremy Renner) is an asset under training of a secretive superspy development program called 'Outcome' similar to 'Treadstone'. All the agents under training are dependent on physical and mental enhancement genetic cell alteration drugs that keep them together who undergo periodic full evaluation based on their blood samples. Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is a senior doctor in a facility that coordinates and research on the enhancement drugs. When an arbitrary incident triggers a paranoia in the top brass on a possibility of media exposure, Eric (Edward Norton) takes charge to suspend these operations which includes termination of all the agents and people associated with it systematically. Number 5 and Marta are survivors of different incidents and together goes off the grid.Using Bourne as a context might add weight to box office opening but also increases the expectation level which is where this one fails miserably. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are no doubt competent actors, but after an initial burst of an intense scene together they become rather monotonous. Edward Norton as a star definitely adds weight but was missing as an actor. A similar theme has been done in many other movies, some done a lot better and convincingly - so this one hardly has a chance to standout. The bloated runtime, seen it before ending does not help either.It made sure there cannot be further extension to the already elongated yarn",4,0,2,22 December 2012
Amadeus," Just like Mozart's music, this movie is a joy for everyone
","This lengthy biopic of one of the most renowned musician is filled with sad, depressing, exciting and touching moments but not a single dull one. Hell, I neither have a fascination nor knowledge on operas which constitute the majority of runtime. Every aspect of the movie has something exciting about it, be it the point of view, energy levels, actors I had no idea about etc, etc. Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls the life, times and his troubled relationship with a prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) he couldn't compete with and resorted to destroy him. Mozart's passion and pure genius is identified by his father Leopold (Roy Dotrice) at a very young age and prepares him for greatness, but the tremendous expectations, his poor business and social skills leads to gambling and alcohol addiction also taking his supporting wife Constance (Elizabeth Berridge) down with him.The best part about the movie is the point of view that of Salieri who alone saw Mozart's true potential and genius and was the most affected by him. The way Abraham explains to the priest about beauty of Mozart's music, how he was never able to compete and how a God fearing just man like him resorted to low politics and scheming is one of the best performances you could come across. While featuring medleys of Mozart's popular compositions, the background score stays competent enough to make a mark of its own. The screenplay is energetic pushing an incredible number of heartfelt moments perfectly justifying Salieri's actions at the same time making you feel for Mozart. Just like Mozart's music, this movie is a joy for everyone.",9,0,1,9 December 2012
The Game," Did not age well could only be my understanding to its success.
","Have always been a huge fan of Fincher's work (forgiving Alien 3), but this one is definitely not one of it. From the word go, it felt more like a B movie with ridiculous plot twists that are more contriving than intriguing. Going by the number of positive reviews, I think it just did not age well!! Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an investment banker and is a man who has everything. On his birthday, he receives a gift from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) who had a troubled past with addiction and mental imbalance. The gift is actually a life experience game designed specific for each individual based on their past and their thought process. Is it really a game? Is it an elaborate scam? Whether you like it or not, it is a Michael Douglas show from start to finish. It is an interesting concept to discuss it over a drink, but just does not seem feasible considering it is either not science fiction or fantasy. Once that is plotted in your mind, whatever happens on the screen just looked ridiculous for me and it is one of those thrillers where you want to get it over with rather than eager to see what happens at the end. Worst part was trying to getaway with a flat screenplay and editing that does not try to be either abstract or non-linear. At least that would keep the audience puzzled a bit. Sean Penn plays an important role and he does a decent job.Did not age well could only be my understanding to its success.",4,3,5,13 October 2012
X-Men: Apocalypse," Poor antagonist, flat screenplay and lacks overall innovation, but holds its ground rather loosely with likable familiar characters and epic action sequences
","Watching X-Men: Apocalypse got me mired in conflicted thoughts as it keeps blowing hot and cold too frequently. Firstly, when you cast such a charismatic and talented actor like Oscar Isaac - you don't hide him under a thick layer of prosthetics where you neither get to see him nor he can show his acting prowess. Secondly, such an uninteresting character for an antagonist doesn't work if a movie has to rise above the heap of well-written superhero movies. Lastly, one would expect Bryan Singer who is the creator of this universe on the big screen with an experience of creating tense thrillers would come up with such a flat screenplay.This installment goes right to the start with the emergence of the early mutant through a ritual in ancient Egypt. When this procedure was interrupted by a few rebels, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) lies in hibernation for thousands of years and is resurrected by a bunch of modern Egyptians for unknown reasons. Upon waking up, he catches up with the history thus far by inserting his hand inside a television that was playing a news channel - Duh. His modus operandi includes recruiting 4 other mutants and calling them 'The Four Horsemen' - the Biblical reference to bringer of Apocalypse and he goes about recruiting them with neither shortlisting from a potential list of candidates nor verifying their capabilities. They all even gather for a pose with Metallica's 'Four Horsemen' blaring in the background symbolically which was too cheesy.On the other hand, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) seems to have mastered his art and removes all of Moira's (Rose Byrne) memories and conveniently puts it back at the end - that's one hell of a memory management. While the Professor is focussing his energies towards making his school for mutants bigger than it is, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) is hailed as a hero for her efforts in the previous installment in preventing a disaster at the White House and she has a lot of budding mutants looking up to her. Erik (Michael Fassbender) is living a peaceful life and even has a family until an incident provokes him to use his special powers which eventually leads to the death of his family. Apocalypse disturbs this delicate balance of their peaceful co-existence which starts the fight of Good against Evil.It starts promisingly (not in any spectacular way though) on both the fronts - emergence of the early mutant and meet & greet of the existing mutants but loses the plot midway. First with the negatives - there is no edge-of-the-seat screenplay which was a marquee element of the first 2 installments of the prequel series, the visual effects though ambitious - lacks the finishing it requires (where some explosions look like they are straight from the 90s action movies), the spectacular Quicksilver (Evan Peters) show from 'The Days of Future Past' is disintegrated into an insensitive and uninteresting romp. Even after having reality expectations that is apt for a comic book remake, it gets too silly and childish many a times without the cheeky factor. Even the cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is so muddled that I wish it wasn't there. The inexplicable need to destroy infrastructure or killing innocent civilians or police personnel without leading to a conscious consequence never grows into a solid drama.It does have some bright spots though, especially the refreshing character of Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), great character development for Raven, subdued performance by Michael Fassbender, ambitious visual effects and an epic background score. GoT fans get to see a powerful and independent Sansa (as Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner)) who isn't short of attitude as well. It does seem to have reintroduced the origins of most characters which completes the cycle to merge the two trilogies.Poor antagonist, flat screenplay and lacks overall innovation, but holds its ground rather loosely with likable familiar characters and epic action sequences.",6,3,11,23 May 2016
Lincoln," A near perfect adaptation of one of the most celebrated Presidents of the United States set in the backdrop of one of the deadliest civil wars.
","Steven Spielberg is a director who almost always never stays in the present and more so in recent times. Its either a historical drama/adventure, futuristic sci/fi fantasy or a mix and match of both. Even though he has ventured and succeeded immensely in a wide array of genres, he will always be best known for bringing some of the most imaginative creatures to life on the big screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is probably one of the greatest actors in the history of modern cinema whose powerhouse performances brought many interesting characters to life and etched them as a vivid memory for movie lovers across the world. A collaboration of these two in presenting one of the most important, remarkable and bloodiest times of American history is one that isn't to be missed.The American civil war is consuming people by thousands with no end in sight. Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis), the 16th President of the United States has just won a re-election and is positioning himself along with the Republican Party to pass the 13th Amendment which outlaws slavery which is again the primary basis for the raging war. Understanding that there will never be an opportunity to abolish slavery than the current moment - Lincoln, whips from Congress, lobbyists etc. race against time to get the votes while legally bordering on the means.Abraham Lincoln is visually known for his unique features - the beard, the hat, the mole, his height. When you see Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln, in a few minutes you start believing that it is Abraham Lincoln playing himself as the Daniel Day-Lewis we have seen outside the movies is no longer visible. The minimalist performance throughout and saving the histrionics for only when required works perfectly. However the same cannot be said about others, I trust the director Spielberg for this difference as he would have done enough research on their personality traits. Sally Field as Mary Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens are both vocally loud and melodramatic yet impactful. While James Spader plays an interesting and entertaining role as Bilbo and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wasted as Robert Lincoln. Most scenes involve a large cast in the canvas, the experience of Steven Spielberg clearly shows in the details of how the extras and the background characters react to situations.The screenplay may not be innovative as it follows a linear approach but the complexity of letting the audience in on the bits of information which most already know is perfect to keep up the anticipation, interest and pace. Another aspect that standout is the beautiful production design - again minimalistic. While the backdrop is set on the raging civil war, there is no actual war sequence shown except for the aftermath in battlefields. The period settings look very realistic that includes makeup, costumes, buildings and city view - but not something we are seeing for the first time especially from Mr. Spielberg. Even the color tone of the movie looks authentic but one may not feel drawn to the movie just by the appearance. The background score stays in the background and is impactful when required. Kennedy and Lincoln, though celebrated for their time in the highest office - are even more known for their assassinations and conspiracies surrounding them. While this movie doesn't indulge much into the assassination of the protagonist, how they showed it is innovative.A near perfect adaptation of one of the most celebrated Presidents of the United States set in the backdrop of one of the deadliest civil wars.",8,1,1,9 December 2016
Brave," Lesser work from Pixar, but that does not make it a lesser of a movie
","There is a certain likability and pleasantness within the first few minutes of the movie and the same neither elevates nor diminishes for the rest of the runtime. May not be on par with other greater Pixar works but still had enough juice to hold on its own. There are a lot of father-son, father-daughter bonding movies but hardly any mother-daughter ones at least as a central plot which adds to its freshness. Pixar's tried and tested and never out-of-fashion formula is applied to the full extent and it works great too.Merida (voice by Kelly Macdonald) is a first born daughter to the king of a warrior clan who is prepared her entire life by her mother (voice by Emma Thompson) to be a courteous princess. Merida's exposure and incredible skill with archery, adventurous mindset and a lack of heed for the customs and traditions leads her to go against her mother when the time comes to choose her a groom. She approaches a witch to change her mother in turn her fate which results in a serious complication. With time running out, she learns an important lesson that also changes the fate of their kingdom.There are a lot of inspirations drawn from other successful non-Pixar movies like 'How to train your Dragon', 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar' which is unlike Pixar as they have been the trend-setters of animation so far. The sweet Scottish accent used by most characters especially the mother-daughter duo works beautifully. The animation though wonderfully presented, does not have enough innovation. Pixar got its basics right as the movie is consistently funny and touching.Lesser work from Pixar, but that does not make it a lesser of a movie",7,1,2,9 December 2012
Friends with Benefits," JT and MK carries this wagon that lacks fresh ideas and full of clichéd treatment
","Reviewed July 2011Well the movie turned out to be exactly I have pictured it to be. Lots of clichéd romantic stuff. Decent humor occasionally. Lovely Mila Kunis. Surprisingly not so annoying Justin Timberlake. Good chemistry between them. Happily ever after ending. This very same concept has been exploited quite a few times recently with 'Love, Sex and Other Drugs' as well as 'No Strings Attached'. So I am not going to get into the details about the plot baring one, it has different leads. Now that I am done with my neutral and positive points of view, lets get to the critic stuff. There is absolutely no fresh point it deals with that has been dealt 100 times before. No innovative/brilliant screenplay or narration, cinematography/visuals or background score. There is no element of surprise and it doesn't even try to be a tearjerker as it is not packing any of the above other qualities. Just trying to be a money spinner riding on it's likable leads. You don't miss anything by missing it, you don't gain anything by watching it.",6,1,1,6 January 2017
The Graduate," Dealing with content that is bold for its time complemented by excellent acting
","Reviewed August 2011A movie so bold taken in the 60s is an achievement on it's own. A right mixture of awkwardness, drama and entertainment value, Simon & Garfunkel, terrific performances including a first major role for Dustin Hoffman makes this movie special. Benjamin (Hoffman) just got graduated and was awarded a scholarship for his future endeavors. His family throws him a party after presenting him an Alpha Romeo. Mrs. Robinson, wife of his father's partner is at the party and requests Benjamin to give her a lift home to which he agrees even after suspecting her intentions resulting in a secret affair that continues after that night. Out of obligation, he had to take Mrs. Robinson's daughter out against Mrs. Robinson's wishes and falls for her. The initial seduction sequences by Mrs. Robinson sometimes felt a little disconnected but very entertaining nevertheless. Anne Bancroft was terrific in her role for most part except for a wafer thin part in the climax. Hoffman looked comfortable in that uncomfortable character. Katharine Ross fits well as the beautiful and shy teenage girl. Music is by Simon & Garfunkel and most of the movie features two of their best hits. The climax which is a bit dragged brought me mixed feelings which was out of tone compared to the rest of the movie. It's entertaining and bold and was a landmark for the 60s.",8,2,2,6 January 2017
The Artist," This silent movie is a twist to the technology heavy era, but how well they executed this defines the success it has achieved. This movie, is one that should not be missed
","I was blown away. I can't recall the last time I enjoyed this much watching a movie with so much entertainment, originality, freshness and skill. One can safely say now that this little experiment has paid off, but to push forward such an idea and to execute it to the way it had turned out requires a lot of conviction. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar who is on top of the Hollywood tree with his huge fan following and never ending box-office success. His world comes tumbling down with the dawn of the talkies which he doesn't take too seriously. His find Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is a new star overnight and the stock market crash doesn't help his cause either. While his life descends into depression and loss, his pride blinds the love shown by Peppy Miller who is now the hottest property in Hollywood. Can he come out of his shell? Can Peppy Miller express her love? Can they have a future together? Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are two extremely charismatic and talented actors who can switch gears so effortlessly from little subtle expressions to over-the-top requirements of the era. The attention to detail starting from sets to the type of film used to get the right look is done with precision. The same story has been told in many different backdrops before, but the format presented here is quite fresh. Another challenging aspect that is overcome with excellence is the screenplay, as the writers mare not used to tell a story in this format. Best moments to look out for: 1. Introduction of Peppy Miller and when she romances George Valentin's suit. 2. George Valentin's realization of Sound as the future in his dream. 3. The way Peppy Miller blackmails the producer. 4. Expression of Peppy Miller when she races to George Valentin's house before climax. 4. Climax duet dance. This silent movie is a twist to the technology heavy era, but how well they executed this defines the success it has achieved. This movie, is one that should not be missed.",8,6,9,13 November 2012
Snowden," Not sure about its sincerity and authenticity, but I just enjoyed it as a well made thriller full of good performances
","Edward Snowden has had an interesting episode in his life defying the most powerful spy agency and in the process becoming both a hero and a villain depending on our view of his actions. What Oliver Stone got right is his casting and what he got wrong is that he picked a side. Considering this is a contemporary issue with an on-going raging debate about his actions, a popular movie showcasing Edward Snowden as a hero will no doubt influence the public perception whoever doesn't watch it with an open mind.Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a patriotic youngster who joins the army to serve his country. When a training accident leaves him unfit for field duty, his expertise and interest in computers leads him to join the training for the virtual battleground under his mentor Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans). When he meets his liberal girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley), a section of his thought process gets unlocked leading to him questioning the actions of his agency and also himself. On the side, the sequences shown in the documentary where Snowden meets journalists and filmmakers Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo), Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) in a Hong Kong hotel unfolds in a non-linear mode; There is no doubt about the weight of Snowden's revelations. Snooping on the private space of normal citizens across the world including the domestic American citizens is something that cannot be ignored. At the same time, how else does a security agency preempt an attack or a conspiracy without having options to filter between harmless and dangerous? It is a very thin line on which most of the security agencies around the world might walk in.Getting Joseph Gordon-Levitt to play the titular character is job half done for Oliver Stone. Though Levitt looks already all geeky, he's hardly had an opportunity to play one and when he got one, he gives a performance par excellence. Bringing in the veterans like Leo and Wilkinson along with a proved talent like Quinto adds in the necessary depth and seriousness to the recreated documentary sequences. However the dramatization and and fictionalization might have gone a little too far when showing the entire NSA personnel having a very callous attitude towards private data of citizens which could not be true.All the performances were excellent and especially enjoyed a very restrained performance by Nicolas Cage after such a long time. The background score adds to the thrill in some scenes and the screenplay is good in parts. However the runtime might be a little too long for a story which most knows how it ends. The bias is clearly visible when Snowden is shown as a hero and it could evoke some passionate discussions and debates from opinionistic viewers which is good for the movie.Not sure about its sincerity and authenticity, but I just enjoyed it as a well made thriller full of good performances.",7,6,9,27 January 2017
Limitless," Interesting concept but it felt that it could have been a lot more.
","Reviewed July 2011It vaguely reminded me of Groundhog Day at some level. It taps into everybody's dream of being super smart and skipping the lengthy process of learning and having an answer to everything. A lazy unmotivated and just got dumped Eddie comes across a pill that can make him very smart and suddenly his life changes for good. But to sustain it, he needs regular supply of the pills and he is not the only one looking for them and those who are, are willing to go to any lengths to get their hands on them. Bradley Cooper lands a solo star role and does a decent job at it. Robert DeNiro is present only to beef up the openings had Bradley not clicked, anyone could've done DeNiro's role. Seeing Abbie Cornish for the first time, she was terrific especially in the initial breakup scene. The plot as it's title tries to take the premise to explore limitless options but ends up going in circles for a little while. A movie can either be a thriller or a mystery, the one that tries to be both needs exceptional handling or might end up in mediocrity. This one falls a little to the latter. Moving on to positive aspects of the movie, it had exceptional presentation, apt performances but a little confused direction with an end that left a lot to be desired. It is still an entertaining thriller for most part of it, which definitely could've been a lot more.",7,1,1,6 January 2017
Don't Breathe," Simple, intense, gory and well packaged. Best enjoyed with pop-corn in your hand and brains in your pocket.
","What works is its simplistic premise, short run-time coupled with breakneck pacing, unexpected twists and overall intensity. It sure has a recipe for a slick and gory B movie which can be actually enjoyed when watched lazily. But once you start putting a little brain to it, the whole thing crumbles like a pack of cards - a result of gaping holes in its plot, continuity issues, manipulative screenplay and hypocritical character morals.Rocky (Jane Levy) and Money (Daniel Zovato) are a couple who along with Alex (Dylan Minnette) are small time burglars preying on empty rich houses. Money comes across a tip about an old & blind ex-military guy (Stephen Lang) living in an isolated house and sitting on some substantial money that he got as a compensation for his daughter's death in an accident. Their standard modus operandi is to go unarmed, when nobody is at home and just steel valuables and no cash - enforced by Alex considering the legal implications if they get caught. Will the blind guy become too much to handle for these experienced burglars where they have broken all their set rules? It is slickly made, highly focused and maintains necessary intensity throughout. However it over-glorifies a blind man's capabilities even in his turf where 3 relatively intelligent and healthy youngsters couldn't tackle him. A typical thriller movie screenplay is designed to play with the audience's train of thought (remember the climax of 'Silence of the Lambs') and this movie too has many such moments - but overuse of them could feel a little manipulative which is the case here. The self-righteous subplot that occurs in the basement is contrived which is followed by a hypocritical climax where the surviving member of the gang feels dismayed upon knowing that the blind man got away while they themselves opted for much worse choices in their life. So the empathy or sympathy just goes out of the equation leaving you no character to root for - I am fine with it but I think most of the audience looks for one.Coming to the good points, if not in retrospect - one would find this movie to be an excellent thriller which is more than good enough. The objective of a movie is to provide entertainment when being watched - which it does. The actors are competent and there are moments where Stephen Lang brings depth to the blind man's character with very minimal dialogues that makes you more drawn into it. The relentless pacing hardly lets the audience a moment to process before the next twist or a jump-out-of-your-seat thrill pops up. It works mostly for the unexpected surprise in terms of how well it is directed despite its linear, simple but bumpy script.Simple, intense, gory and well packaged. Best enjoyed with pop-corn in your hand and brains in your pocket.",6,0,4,23 December 2016
The Witch," A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller.
","Horror is a genre that has a defined scope which is governed by certain rules based on society's understanding of how ghosts/demons/spirits/'witches' etc function. While believers treat it as a social drama, others do so as a fantasy. So it is very important for the makers to have enough clarity on who their target audience are. In the recent times the makers have mostly catered to the latter audience dealing these stories as fantasies where these unnatural forces have the capability to control the technology (read 'Unfriended' or 'The Ring' series) which is fun to watch sometimes when done good.'The Witch' goes back to the roots of orthodox methodology of film making in horror genre which is thus far so overdone that it is difficult to present in a way that attracts audience attention. Director Robert Eggers does overcome this challenge with a tight script, suitable cast and going to a period (mid 17th century) when witches and witch hunting is still a norm in that part of the world. Right from the first frame, it draws you into that period, into their family, into their beliefs, into their conflicts. Once the connect is established, it plays around with its smart twists, whodunit mystery and creepy background score where you are forced to invest your emotions but not sure where.William (Ralph Ineson) is a righteous believer in spreading the Holy word and that is the purpose of his arrival in America with the pilgrims. He feels cheated and confronts the society when he finds a changed agenda which gets him banished from the village along with his family comprising of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), elder daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), young twins and a toddler. When they settle in a plain near the forest, things go south when their toddler disappears from the hands of Thomasin followed by Caleb's abduction in the forest. When Caleb dies, each family member starts blaming each other and that builds up a certain disgust and mistrust among themselves leading to painful confrontations.It takes a while to settle into and start understanding the period diaglogue, but that adds a little freshness into an otherwise simple story. There is also a huge variation in the character arcs and their performances - for example Kate Dickie plays a depressing character who goes all melodramatic, while Harvey Scrimshaw and Ralph Ineson gives a textbook stage performance. The twins are cute and high-spirited while Anya Taylor-Joy gives a rather subtle contemporary performance. Though the background score gets a little intrusive at the beginning, it settles down well and starts being effective and plays an important role along the way. The whodunit thread may not be a driving factor, but it adds to the mix of things. There could have been more scary thrills to give it a bit more mass appeal and some scenes could have been squeezed a bit more to generate the necessary edginess.A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller.",7,1,4,27 April 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Perfect pacing, attention to detail and a fantastic lead performance.
","For a movie that had so much to tell, pacing has to be right and it was perfect here. Driving this epic story which the entire world has followed so closely through a single human going by a single lead may sound preposterous but may never be far from the truth as well. Another good aspect is that it gets emotional only to an extent to remind the viewer that the characters are indeed human but the entire movie is more about leads, operational details etc. I have closely followed Jessica Chastain's career from the time I have enjoyed her performance in 'The Debt' and she has never disappointed so far. Coming back from a superior directorial performance by Katheryn Bigelow in 'The Hurt Locker' she doesn't hurt her reputation here with her complex yet structured, sensitive yet brutal, emotional yet efficient handling of her movies. Maya (Jessica Chastain) is following up leads on various terror suspects post 9/11 and is assigned with Dan (Jason Clarke). After chasing a few threads she arrives at a pattern that could potentially lead to a courier of Osama Bin Laden. Along the way there were disappointments, dead ends, loses her friends but what keeps her going is her infectious confidence and belief in her lead.There are so many characters in this movie and one cannot go into performances in detail. But to generalize it, not one gives a bad performance. The screenplay could have been a little hastier in the first 20 minutes, but the director and writers might have done this intentionally to communicate to the viewer about the tedious process of getting information and during the later part of the movie this point is brought back to emphasize on the reason that they could not confirm the identity of Osama in his house due to the stricter detention rules and the tedious process. This might also be intentional but the background score or the lack of it did not work for me. May be the creative team might have thought this way it may look more realistic or just could not find the right theme they liked. Again the hierarchy and the working process of CIA is repeated in the most generic way and also plays the underdog card to its advantage. One more aspect I did not expect was the amount of screen time given for the actual raid itself. Based on the trailer I assumed they might just open the door to the compound and rest is history, but they actually go through the entire process of entry and exit which was good. Perfect pacing, attention to detail and a fantastic lead performance.",8,8,21,12 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," Uncomfortable viewing experience but it falls short on achieving its ambition. Watch it for Michael Fassbender!!
","Set in some of the darkest days of American history tells a remarkable story full of horrors, brutality, courage, hope, helpnessness and longing. It is exceptionally cast, beautifully acted, perfectly paced and filled with strong moments. At the risk of contradicting myself, the only weak link seems to be Chiwetel Ejiofor's one dimensional acting that further oversimplifies the one dimensional character he plays.While the movie establishes a powerful connection with its above said strong moments, looking back at it might seem a little exploitative which tries too hard to add a sentimental value around every possible scene. However the movie is elevated with a near perfect performance by Michael Fassbender who epitomizes all the evils associated to slavery with his hellish expressions and some of his actions adding to uncomfortable viewing.Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man in the north who has a bumbling career, a comfortable home, loving wife and kids and respect in the society. His world turns upside down when he gets abducted, shipped away to the south and pushed to slavery without a means to contact his family or friends. He gets crushed into his own shell as his identity, skills and education becomes a threat to his life. His misery gets compounded when an unavoidable circumstance leads him to sadistic and volatile 'Master' Epps (Michael Fassbender) leaving his empathizing current 'Master' Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). He is now called Platt, a cotton farmer and an occasional fiddle player who cries to sleep everyday ruing his fate and missing his family.While the movie succeeds in presenting the horrors and brutality of slavery, the USP of this movie lies in projecting the upliftment of human spirit where I think it failed to an extent especially with Ejiofor's single expression throughout. Another powerful performance of a tormented slave between her master's lust and mistress's jealousy as Patsey by Lupita Nyong'o commands a mention. But the showstopper performance is by Michael Fassbender as he evokes 'Daniel Plainview' from 'There will be blood' filled with ego, unpredictability and violent tendencies. The authenticity factor also take a beating a little bit with some 'A' list actors making a cameo around every corner.Uncomfortable viewing experience but it falls short on achieving its ambition. Watch it for Michael Fassbender!!",7,0,1,21 June 2016
Wedding Crashers," Too long, too overrated, hardly any fun
","While it has its moments of incredible, the entire movie structure, characters and plot twists feels like just another Owen Wilson movie. I believe this was the last successful movie this band of comics have produced where the mantle has been long passed on to Judd Apatow's protégées Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jason Segal and Jonah Hill.John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are buddies who crash into weddings taking advantage of the romantic air and single women. During one of their stints they end up in Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) eldest daughter's wedding and make their move on his two younger daughters Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher). When John starts to have feelings for Claire, they go deeper than they have always trained themselves to be.Vince Vaughn generates most laughs and best lines in the movie with incredible timing while Wilson was on auto-pilot doing his usual stuff. The brand of comedy is nothing you have not seen before and the most jokes have already been told in different phrasings in other movies. All the characters are stereotypes or caricatures of an ethnicity or social background they belong to, screenplay is too convenient and the movie is a good 40 minutes too long. Too long, too overrated, hardly any fun",4,2,3,28 October 2012
There Will Be Blood," If excellent performances drive you nuts, I advice you to watch this right away
","Reviewed October 2011Had put this off for a while now, and the wait was totally worth it. It's plot and screenplay were adjusted to comfortably pave way for the one man show and he didn't disappoint at all. It's story follows the overly rated concept of American dream and one man dead set to achieve it no matter what. Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) hits an oil well independently with his expertise on engineering and determination which rouses the entrepreneur in him. During this encounter, one of his partner falls to death leaving behind his infant son who later goes under the care of Daniel who raises him as his own. He starts acquiring, collaborating or forcibly taking off oil wells across the area with his influence and wealth and so does his name starts getting a reputation. Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) approaches Daniel with information of an undiscovered oil well near his place for a little monetary price. Daniel goes to explore this place along with his son where he encounters Eli Sunday (also played by Paul Dano) who is a local preacher/healer. From here, it is just a step above ploys by both to take control of the people of the area. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a chilling performance of a man obsessed with power and ego. This can well be expected of him. What comes as a surprise package is the performance of Paul Dano as the preacher with equal amount of ego as Daniel but always waiting for an opportunity to bring it out. Apart from the performances, I found nothing amusing in the movie as the plot and screenplay were pretty standard. If excellent performances drive you nuts, I advice you to watch this right away.",8,0,2,6 January 2017
Downfall," Hitler would have been proud roasting in Hell
","May be the best WWII movie I have seen after Saving Private Ryan though both of them deals with completely opposite perspectives and different genres. The screen time allocated to the Bunker and its attention to detail virtually transports you there. Seeing Hitler as a delusional old man with a pompous past and a deserted family now rather than the monster we have seen him as so far is surreal. The director evokes mixed feeling for Hitler making you feel for his precarious state while simultaneously loathe the hatred that engulfed him, not just on Jews but mankind itself.Berlin is surrounded by Allied Forces and Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and his top brass have secluded themselves into a well furnished Bunker. The story is partially seen through the eyes of his young secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara). Hitler is delusional about a non-existent army that can push its way from behind and scatter the enemy. While this places courage in some, places horrendous fear in most. Mostly deals with Hitler's final days, his current views on the war and utter disrespect to life, his relationship with Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) and an ever faithful family, the Goebbels.While the melodrama is in the air, the director takes care not to push it into the face of the viewer. Alexandra has such a pleasing innocent face, she will almost make you believe how Ms. Junge saw through the ordeal without making out much of it. While most of the cast deliver competent performances, Bruno Ganz would have made Hitler proud with his ecstatic emotional outbursts alternating with subtle body language that speaks a thousand words without saying anything. How he missed the Oscar, I am interested to see who beat him to comment on it. After the Russian artillery comes into the range of the Bunker - every dialogue, emotion and action is associated with fear or being skeptical about optimism which is brilliantly shown when Eva Braun forces a party to overcome the impending doom. While most of the action is said and understood, the director didn't shy away from showing a peek on the outside of Berlin which is full of fear, hordes of corpses and strewn away limbs drawing from a strong graphic content and state-of-art pyrotechnics. The background score is mostly non-existent and but delicately used whenever required. Screenplay and editing are slick without a dull moment and builds up enough suspense leading up to one of the most known endings.Hitler would have been proud roasting in Hell",9,1,3,21 November 2012
"Hail, Caesar!"," It seems to have everything going for it but just can't quite place what's missing
","The Coen brothers have been quite successful when switching to different genres by infusing a unique narrative style and their trademark quirky humor. Going by their filmography, the movies that are most likely to succeed in terms of box office performance or connect with the audience are the ones which has either a wow or a shock factor which are sorely missing in Hail! Caeser. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a veteran in studio business who takes his work very seriously. When the star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) goes missing from the sets of 'Hail! Caesar' (which is based on crucifixion of Jesus Christ through the eyes of a Roman soldier Autolycus), Eddie has to think on his feet to fix the situation. Between a lucrative job offer from Lockheed Martin, solving issues between a star and a director, fixing a PR issue of a star actress and dodging the media regarding a certain story, Eddie is pushed to corner to bring things under control. Romancing the yesteryear Hollywood has been the calling for many filmmakers in the past including the Coen Brothers (Barton Fink), probably because one can spin exotic stories based on hot-headed and impossible to handle stars, executives with iron fists, limited exposure to media etc. as the corporate culture, social media and presence of mobile phones could have watered down many potential plots if set in contemporary times. While some have fared well, others have ended in disasters. To give credit to the Coen brothers - the screenplay was well structured with enough entertaining moments. Their influence probably would have played the antagonist here with many writers and directors taking a similar approach of quirky humor which eventually sets the bar higher and pushing them to redefine themselves. The cameos are not worthy, the actors seemed a little disinterested, the plot neither hurries nor sets you up for a climax when featuring a plot about an abduction of a movie story. However the ever dependable Josh Brolin and the newbie Alden Ehrenreich playing Hobie Doyle are a refreshing contrast to the rest of the movie. The period inspired communist conspiracy angles, casting couches, tantrum throwing heroines, gossip column peddlers are all used to good advantage. It seems to have everything going for it but just can't quite place what's missing.",6,0,1,17 August 2016
Lord of War," A standard Sicilian wise guys' narrative packaged in a firearms mafia background and a very superficial attempt at that.
","A standard Sicilian wise guys' narrative packaged in a firearms mafia background and a very superficial attempt at that.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) gets fascinated with gun business (rather unconvincingly) when he witnesses a mafia hit in his neighborhood. Convinced that illegal international gun trade is the way to go after a failed attempt to go legal, he partners with his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) and embarks on a country hopping mission to arm every warlord he could contact with. Along the journey, he marries his high school sweetheart Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), gets his brother addicted to cocaine, gets a righteous ATF officer Jack Valentine (Ethen Hawke) on his tail and keeps fighting his consciousness. Being a smooth operator he greases enough palms to stay ahead of the pursuit and competition, what happens when it gets personal is the rest of the story.While it is an interesting view of how the illegal international gun trade is run, what affects the overall experience is the lack of clarity. The director doesn't seem to make up his mind whether to present it as a biopic, a documentary or as a work of fiction – leaving it inconsistent and underdeveloped. Apart from the presentation, even the core script seems to be confused whether it should be a dark comedy, a satire or an honest serious view of the gun trade. Also there isn't enough research to surprise the viewer with facts that they wouldn't know of already – considering it was attempting the documentary approach for a moment. With its runtime over 2 hours, I remember looking at the clock quite a few times, however the pace picks up in the third act of the movie even though it walks a very familiar path. Nicolas Cage gives a decent performance as the smooth talking bootlegger and the rest of the cast does their best rallying around this weak script. Lack of clarity in terms of presentation, a very weak and superficial script does not do justice to a very sensitive and timely subject.",4,1,2,25 March 2016
Prometheus," A welcome addition to Alien franchise
","What starts as a visual spectacle quickly transforms to an action packed thriller tightly binding the story thread abruptly cut off by the 'Alien' movie and even created a strong central female character in Noomi Rapace similar to Ellen Ripley. Treatment of this edition is actually a hybrid of both his own and Cameron's versions combining slow building suspense with high octane action sequences. Though the theory of alien life influencing/creating human life was used in some earlier movies (most notably 2001: A space odyssey and Contact), this one too doesn't do too bad for itself. An exploration team is assembled by a wealthy but dying old man Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to find the origin of human life after a scientist couple (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) figure out the location of a planet in a different galaxy placed in a solar system similar to ours. This mission is commanded by Weyland's daughter Ms. Vickers (Charlize Theron) with the help of a droid David (Michael Fassbender). Soon after landing, they find the remains of an exterminated race of species similar to humans but much larger in size. While investigating the cause of their death, they encounter the life form which terrified humans in the next supposed four sequels.Thank God Ridley Scott didn't bring back that ridiculous central computer 'Mother' that annoyed me crazy in the Alien franchise. Noomi Rapace delivers an excellent performance that has shades of similarity to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley character (mostly from Alien 2 onwards). While Alien was considered innovative for its time, Prometheus definitely misses that awe element, though there was some promise and content in the first few minutes. Ridley Scott is a veteran of science fiction genre and a pioneer of this franchise, so he exudes confidence in his story and screenplay. Fassbender gives a controlled and apt performance and is definitely the best humanoid so far in this franchise. Background score does not standout, presentation is slick and the dialogs are at times cheesy.What I liked about this movie: 1. A storyline that stays true to the Alien franchise 2. The interior visuals of the Alien ship is matched inch to inch with the original 3. Noomi Rapace's strong performance 4. Climax What could have been better: 1. How the characters Fifield and Milburn die 2. Guy Pearce's make up 3. Closure of a few more threads 4. Shaw's climax motives and motivationIt is neither as poetic nor has that chilling thriller element of 'Alien' but is definitely a welcome addition to the franchise with its spectacular visuals, tight connection with the original storyline and a fast paced screenplay. PS: After seeing most Alien franchise fans being so disappointed about story being in disarray or its too blockbuster type, the main reason is that Alien movie is too hyped up inside our heads and any shortcoming in this is magnified. If we go back and have another look at the Alien movie, I am sure to find so many glitches there too.",8,3,6,20 October 2012
The Iron Giant," Though it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie.
","Reviewed August 2011I had great expectations on this from hearsay but doesn't quite live up to all of them. Since I am watching it quite late, it felt like a combination of 'How to train your dragon' and 'Super 8'. A huge robot descends from the sky and has a rocky landing that makes it forget what it is. It reaches a small sedate village looking for metal to eat when a boy stumbles upon it and saves the giant from getting electrocuted. The giant grows an affection towards the boy and the boy teaches him words and general human stuff. When the government comes to know of it and comes with it's big guns, the giant has to remember what the boy has thought him. The animation and mannerisms of the characters are very Disney like swaying away gaily. The story centers a lot on friendship and righteousness while the robot structure is too corny. It has to eat metal to survive, shows those funny expressions while showing emotions etc. Some action sequences at the end are pretty decent though. Though it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie.",7,0,4,6 January 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," A satisfying finale that does all the right things to stay afloat of the expectations
","In my first viewing, I hated it, rated it poorly and my only conclusion of its success was just mass hysteria. But then I re-watched. Everything transformed. Suddenly there is awe, there is a connect and there is loads of entertainment. I stopped comparing which happened to be the folly the first time around. While Sam Raimi induced emotional depth and a little darkness to the superhero genre, Nolan took it to whole different level by producing an epic trilogy with a satisfying conclusion.Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has secluded himself to his manor after Batman takes the fall for Harvey Dent's death. Gotham with its revised and strict laws has brought organized crime to its knees. Wayne Enterprises is in the verge of bankruptcy hurting even more with Bruce's nonexistence and not taking help from an able backer in Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard). When a cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) steals Bruce's fingerprints, he pursues her back to the real world leading him to the knowledge of an underground army headed by Bane (Tom Hardy), who is trained by none other than Ra's Al Ghul (Liam Neeson).It was meant to be a spectacle from the word go but where it fails is it tries to do the impossible to go one better than its supreme predecessor in every frame instead of carving its own path. While Joker is unpredictable, manipulative and extremely entertaining, Bane is the exact opposite. Anne Hathaway does a fantastic Catwoman being sexy, stylish and smart. No special addition to gadgets except for the Bat on which I had mixed feelings. The background score is full of impact and strong as the rest of the trilogy. Story is good in parts but it spawns too many threads that deviate the overlong climax many a times. Joseph Gordon-Lewitt is a resourceful and a bankable actor on any role he chooses, does no mistake here too as a determined and intense cop. I have been a fan of Nolan long before his Batman ventures and really looking forward to his future work.A satisfying finale that does all the right things to stay afloat of the expectations",8,3,6,18 December 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Chaotic, inconsistent, humorless and packaged with a powerful dose of boredom, deja-vu and an intrusive background score.
","Chaotic, inconsistent, humorless and packaged with a powerful dose of boredom, deja-vu and an intrusive background score.Following the worn out retelling of the story about dangers of uncontrolled power, 'Dawn of Justice' pits in Batman against Superman in an attempt to boot-start the DC comics universe. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) gets offended and affected by Superman's (Henry Cavill) unchecked actions which led to numerous deaths as collateral damage in Gotham city. While Mr. Wayne is busy locating the alleged tyrant, the government and general public too in Metropolis are getting restless for the same reason leading to confrontation. Lex Luther (Jesse Eisenberg) meanwhile has his own sinister plans in developing a weapon based on Kryptonite that can keep Superman in check.While the 3D and special effects are on par with any other super-hero movie that's released in the last 10 years, the same cannot be said about other departments. The uninteresting screenplay, chaotic editing especially in the first hour, non-relevant dream sequences and unrelated character introductions - all played into making a poor movie watching experience. No actions by any character feels convincing leaving nothing to root for the leads. While Ben Affleck was in his auto-pilot mode, Henry Cavill has taken the steel reference too seriously and added it to his performance too. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is in just for an introduction to her spin-off movie, so refraining from commenting. Hans Zimmer is a seasoned composer but this time his background score is so intrusive and epic that actually belittles the on-going action on the screen.Zack Snyder should revisit his spectacular 'Watchmen' and figure out what all could have gone wrong here.",5,3,8,25 March 2016
The Deer Hunter," In the same league as Apocalypse now, Good morning Vietnam, Full Metal Jacket etc - a little patience and if you have liked the above movies, it is a recommendation for you
","It prances leisurely and graciously to an obvious end, but the journey is marked by many similar great movies of the period with a splendid soundtrack. The movie starts with an elaborate wedding sequence all the while introducing us to the characters, their relationships and expectations. Michael, Steven, Nick and Stan are buddies who went to school, work etc together. The name of the movie is drawn from Michael's expertise and passion for deer hunting and does not mean anything further. When 3 of them enlist and pack off for Vietnam war, they see and face things that will change them forever. With the kind of talent available here, there is only a very little I can say that has not been said about the performances. Meryl Streep looks gorgeous and plays a significant role in the way the protagonists react. Soundtrack is amazing and the war in itself subtle, sporadic and effective. More than the war itself, it is the mindset of people involved before and after the process. A major flaw in the movie is its runtime against the content. In the same league as Apocalypse now, Good morning Vietnam, Full Metal Jacket etc - a little patience and if you have liked the above movies, it is a recommendation for you.",8,0,2,13 November 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," A superbly supported Wes Anderson show
","Wes Anderson made moments of weird and awkward look sweet and warm. The photography, dialogues and artwork reminded me of a regional director who took a similar style way back. A similar theme of emotional, calm and thoughtful adolescents vs. knee-jerk, crazy adults has been dealt with by many different filmmakers but this one stands out as a better finished product than most.Sam (Jared Gilman) is an unpopular boy scout absconds from the camp run by strict and kind Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). A search party involving Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) is dispatched. At the same time they hear that a sad and depressed young girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) goes missing from a nearby town. Soon they realize that they both conspired to escape. Rest is how they spend time, get close and explore each other and what happens when the adults catchup with them.The focus is on the new leads who give a superbly apt performance in the backdrop of lush vistas, creative and unconventional photography and artwork, melodious and blending soundtrack packed with some of the heaviest weights of Hollywood in Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton. The opening scene photography and background score introducing the Bishops sets the tone for the oncoming brilliance. Wes Anderson deftly balances the innocence and maturity of the leads especially resonating in a delicate scene which could have easily become vulgar turns out to be warm and comic. The remaining big stars are given enough space to develop their characters written carefully not to overlap each other and they do give their money's worth.A superbly supported Wes Anderson show",8,1,4,8 November 2012
The Producers," Outdated, loud, silly, putting off lousy acting with an occasionally funny script
","Too loud and silly for my liking compounded with grown men touching and groping at each other every other scene has put me off which otherwise had quite a funny premise and a very potential slapstick plot. I have always enjoyed Mel Brooks movies, but this made my cringe mostly. The Swedish secretary and the actual show were an oasis in the middle of this huge man-made desert.Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a yesteryear successful producer now running on fumes entertaining old ladies for scrapes. When an IRS man Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) while going through his accounts makes a remark on how a producer can make money out of a sure flop, Bialystock gets interested and talks Leo into executing it. In the process they pick up the worst show ever written 'Springtime for Hitler' showing Hitler, his intentions and accomplishments in a bad taste. After they select equally superlative bad choices for director, actors etc.. they were just waiting for the show to get burned the first day and spend the money made out of it. Does their plan work towards their intentions forms the rest of the story.Though intentional this is by far the worst acting job by the entire unit and the most putting off presentation I have ever come across. The actors were too loud, too silly and their hugging and kissing and groping made me proud about my patience to finish the movie. Considering it is a successful movie does not lack in its merits with a well written script for a slapstick and occasional moments of humor and a breezy screenplay. Short runtime and a happy ending doesn't hurt either.Outdated, loud, silly, putting off lousy acting with an occasionally funny script.",4,2,6,27 October 2012
Flight," Denzel Washington show in a compelling character study with Zemeckis sensibilities
","Disturbing character portrayed in a drawing performance as a stubborn alcoholic immersed in false pride and ego was so absorbing, involving, connecting and could not take my eye off for a second in what I thought was a too lengthy movie when I saw the runtime. Denzel Washington gives the best performance of whatever I have seen of him and carries the entire movie on his broad shoulders. The special effects in the initial flight crash is on par but not to the extent of the hype surrounding it. The supporting cast deliver apt performances to keep the quality of the movie consistent throughout.For long I have been a sucker for Zemeckis sensibilities as a director. Having watched most of his movies, Zemeckis was involved in a wide array of genres be it science fiction, fantasy, children, drama, horror, thriller etc., some more successful than others, none showed his lack of ability (maybe horror to an extent).Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is an experienced airline pilot and an alcoholic. On a stormy day, he comes to duty high on alcohol and cocaine but skillfully guides the plane through turbulence. A little later the flight encounters a mechanical malfunction and goes for a nose dive. With an instinctive mind, he inverts the flight to control the decent and miraculously crash lands it in a field. What could have been a total disaster with more than 100 passengers on board is averted and leads to only 6 causalities. Then the investigation starts.Denzel Washington was so natural as the stubborn drunk who is always difficult to deal with. His mumbles when drunk were nothing short of legendary. So are the scenes when he tries to meet his family, initial scenes at the hospital etc. Kelly Reilly was excellent in 'Eden Lake' and she is nothing short here too. She has a unique voice diction and I love it. John Goodman is quirky and lightens some intense moments while Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle give apt performances.During the initial part of the movie, there is a little sequence in the hospital between Washington, Reilly and another cancer patient. That was the instant I got drawn in until which it was mostly the terrific flight crash sequence. The movie tend to go spiritual at times but only lingers as long as you can stand it. With only Washington's difficult character to focus on, the screenplay does a tremendous job in holding the viewer's attention when the protagonist stumbles from one depressing scenario to another. The epiphany and the climax is a tad predictable and could have done well without. No faults to find in editing and background score is apt and elevates in some scenes. It is not everyones cup of tea but once you sink in with some patience, I don't see anyone regretting it.Denzel Washington show in a compelling character study with Zemeckis sensibilities.",9,3,7,14 January 2013
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Silly good fun
","Reviewed August 2011Whoa!! Dudes!! The current number system may not be sufficient if you count how many times Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) utter this through the movie. My rating has nothing to do with the film making prowess or narration or acting. Just the entertainment value. Bill and Ted are teenagers on the verge of failing their history class if they don't come up with a presentation. They are also budding musicians yet to learn how to play an instrument. They come across a Time Machine to gather 'Historical Figures' of the past for their presentation.This was my first introduction to the concept of time travel and the fun that can be had fantasizing it. One of those movies that is so silly with really bad dialog and ridiculous acting, you'll start enjoying it. The concept of time travel is utilized to the full extent without a bother about neither the logic nor consequences which is good. Both leads play ball as morons with goofy mannerisms. A movie such as this has a thin line between working alright and being a disaster. This one just crosses the line.Silly good fun.",8,1,1,6 January 2017
Looper," Manages to stay afloat even after treading on prohibited territory abandoning the most desirable path.
","I have strong mixed feelings about this movie. Lets have a quick look at what those mixed reactions areWhats Good? Great fusion of genres - mutations, time travel, generic sci-fi and superhero. Popular casting of actors who the audience love to see. Screenplay that holds your attention for most of the runtime. Interesting concept bringing back memories of the Terminator. A terrific performance by Pierce Gagnon as an emotionally volatile kid with a powerful ability. Most of all, it has some powerful moments that touch your heart.Whats Bad? Introduction with a flat storyline that doesn't raise a pulse until the young kid shows up who is the heart and soul of the movie. The gimmick to make Levitt look like Bruce Willis was a farce beyond repair. And Bruce Willis looked so out of place with both his mannerisms and lines until he was given a gun and allowed to go bombastic. It suffers the same fate as most other time travel based stories do - impossible flawed conclusion. Future self meeting the current man can lead to very interesting conversation, this moment was ruined with just more bang bang.Concept: In the future when bodies are impossible to dispose off, criminal gangs make use of the already invented time travel technology to send people back 30 years who they want to get rid off. A 'Looper' waits for the person to arrive, kills them and dispose off the body. A Looper gets well paid but there is a catch. At some point a future self of the Looper will be sent back who is to be killed the same way as any other but comes with a big payday and a retirement. Letting a kill get away is a death warrant. Story: Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper. When his future self (Bruce Willis) comes back, a moment's hesitation allows older Joe to get the best of him. After a few tussles, tracking down etc., older Joe tells the story about a man calling himself The Rainmaker who spells deadly terror in the future taking down all the criminal syndicates and closing down all the loops. He has narrowed down on the Rainmaker's identity who will now be just a kid (Pierce Gagnon) son of Sara (Emily Blunt) and wants to take him down.Movies involving time travel should have some basic elements right for them to work since the concept by itself is flawed anyway. Either the plot has to be extremely complex to take the viewer's mind of the general logics that surrounds it, or overcome it with downright entertainment. Looper falls short on both directions. Levitt's makeup to look like Bruce Willis makes him incapable of conveying the right expressions. No great innovation or awe in the special effects department either. Bruce Willis first few dialogues with Levitt are laughable and can be mistaken for The Expendables. But with some smart screenplay, charismatic Emily Blunt and a performance by Pierce Gagnon that could blow you away. Manages to stay afloat even after treading on prohibited territory abandoning the most desirable path.",7,1,3,28 December 2012
50_50," It is a see-saw ride with moments of emotional introspect mixed with crude insensitive humor. Watch it for Lewitt and Kendrick
","Filled with a good sense of tumor!! That was bad, too corny. But thankfully the movie isn't. I've always felt a great sense of connection with Joseph Gordon-Lewitt's character in 500 Days of Summer and it extends to this movie too. A little disappointment is Seth Rogen's character that intrudes and demands attention but has nothing entertaining to say.Adam (Lewitt) is highly health conscious and practical. He is in a deteriorating relationship on denial mode. But a bigger jolt tumbles his world when he realizes he has a rare form of cancer and his chances are 50/50. This affects his practical nature too paving way for irrationality. Shuns his worried mother, dumps his caring girlfriend Rachel (Dallas Howard) who was intending to breakup just before he got sick but sticks around when she finds out, suspects his insensitive buddy Kyle (Rogen) of being selfish when he is trying to cheer him up. Finally he finds solace from his shrink Katie (Kendrick) who just started practicing - starting from him. He can't accept his fate but puts a brave face.After showering enough praise on Lewitt, another star of the show is Anna Kendrick. I was a little skeptical when she was awarded an academy nomination for 'Up in the Air' but realized her potential for little nuances only here. There are few characters and they are realistic and well developed except for Seth Rogen's, where he is Seth Rogen. Screenplay never lags - all packaged in a noteworthy soundtrack. The only misfire is its incapability to leverage on the suspense factor highlighted by the movie title.It is a see-saw ride with moments of emotional introspect mixed with crude insensitive humor. Watch it for Lewitt and Kendrick.",8,0,0,13 November 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Not your average horror movie
","In a nutshell, it is a story about a cabin in the woods and it is not a horror movie. Though I expected something similar to happen, it just took it to another level by the end. It is a tongue in cheek response to the horror genre.A part of the storyline is already understood by the title. The other part I cannot say without revealing the big secret and I am going to leave it at that.When I knew Joss Whedon was behind the movie, I had to watch it. There are satisfying amounts of blood, gore, graphic violence, nudity and sexiness but not enough horror and it is intentional. With its entertaining slapstick comedy on both cabin and the other parallel track and a crisp screenplay and runtime ensures there is plenty of entertainment to be had throughout. Features top special effects towards the end and the way the main plot twist is revealed in small parts from the beginning and how all the pieces fall together towards the end is intelligent but not mind blowing. It was also surprisingly acted well too.Not your average horror movie.",8,1,4,22 September 2012
The Nice Guys," Being more slick in execution, quick in runtime could have made it superior - but nevertheless an entertaining romp which is sure to get better with repeat watches
","This is a movie you would want to like even before you watched it. Actually what's not to like - a great teaser trailer showing excellent chemistry between its likable stars, quirky comedy set in the America's favorite period - the 70s, also includes some action, adventure and crime. All they need is just an average script which doesn't completely ruin the setup they have done so far and they manage to do just that - nothing less, nothing more. Mr. Healy (Russell Crowe) has an unconventional job of being a hit-man for women in distress - no questions asked. Mr. March (Ryan Gosling) is a PI always willing to bend the rules. When they both collide literally when working on things loosely related to each other, they realize that its much bigger than anticipated and have to work together. They are effectively supported by Mr. March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) who actually cracks open the case.Even though it takes a while for the lead actors chemistry to work, it gets magical after you give it some time and patience. The movie suffers from a poor start where the first 15 minutes of its runtime, it just ponders around in a disconnected manner. Once Crowe and Gosling's characters come together and after a brief period of time, the actual plot kicks in. It definitely has an unconventional but a plot with potential, has budget to execute it to scale, able actors to convincingly portray the characters necessary. Instead of using the slick technology and movie making methods to show the action of the 70s period, the movie resorts to the movie making techniques of the actual period which is a shame. It definitely is not an issue with the potential considering Shane Black has helmed the Director's seat for Iron Man 3 and his much older Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is much more tighter (also following similar plot pattern related to homicide in Hollywood).Angourie Rice playing Holly has a meaty role and she delivers it with aplomb. The overall runtime is a tad too lengthy and easily could have edited out at least 20 minutes or so. Once the overall plot is understood, the runtime looks redundant with unnecessary chases and shootouts where we surely know nothing's gonna happen to the 'Nice Guys'. Being more slick in execution, quick in runtime could have made it superior - but nevertheless an entertaining romp which is sure to get better with repeat watches.",7,1,3,11 September 2016
Contact," Would have worked more as a TV series since it had a lot to tell even with the bloated runtime
","An interesting but uneven psychological science fiction that deals with different perspectives on existence of life outside Earth as well as what will be the reaction if a contact actually happens. Only problem is that it takes itself too seriously and tries too long to present a justification for everything that happens in the movie.Eleanor (Jodie Foster) has been fascinated about long distance communication and life outside earth from a very young age partly influenced by her father (David Morse). She focuses her studies and career towards this and chances on a communication from an unknown source. This communication after a lot of research is understood to be a design for building a spaceship to reach them.Jodie Foster as usual gives her best, but what sets the tone in the movie is Jena Malone's innocent passion which makes us understand what the older Eleanor does what she does. The intermittent politics, romance, science fiction - all take up a lot of runtime leaving too many things to conclude hastily. It could have worked a lot better as a mini-series like Taken or Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I have admired a lot of Robert Zemeckis films where most of them has a naughty child-like passion and an intelligent main plot to them. Climax draws comparisons with the superior 2001: A Space Odyssey but still Contact does enough to hold its ground.Would have worked more as a TV series since it had a lot to tell even with the bloated runtime",7,0,2,13 October 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," If not for the visual effects grandeur, its rating would have been on the negative
","Too many questions than answers. Does he write his screenplay on the set? With the set pieces and the thought process that has to go into the action sequences (which covers most of the movie) seems impossible for that.. Is he that genius where he shoots what he feels like and covers it up with VFX later? Does Chuck Norris writer cringe hearing this movies dialogues? What is the gorgeous girl doing outside of a calendar or a ramp? Watching the graphics expertise makes me feel like a crazy amount of money, talent, time and effort is being drained down in the wrong hole. The VFX work is sophisticated, complex and involves heavy planning, thinking and execution effort and in my opinion Michael Bay would go a long way and win many hearts if he can try just being a visual effects supervisor. Really the work here is much better than Avatar or Avengers.Synopsis: Fox is replaced by another hottie. Characters from the previous editions reprise same roles and dialogues. Nobody know what Decepticons are fighting for and Autobots are like overstayed guests.With a long list of mechanical characters, Bay tried to bring in the entire Hollywood to elevate the missing aesthetic value like Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, John Turturo etc. Instead of utilizing their special talents to arrive at a fresh flavor, all these talented actors succumb to buffoonery along with the rest of the cast. The robots behave more human than the actual actors themselves which is another thing that makes me cringe. There is actually a weird scene where a division captain instructs his team to hold fire until he commands, while actually all of them are shooting.If not for the visual effects grandeur, its rating would have been on the negative.",4,2,8,1 November 2012
Sully," A crackling performance by Tom Hanks dealing a powerful incident with operational efficiency
","It is difficult to forget the positivity and heartwarming end to some powerful events that we come across in our daily life or through the media and 'Sully' covers one such event which consoled the world that not every bad incident would end in a tragedy. While the incident is still powerfully etched in our minds due to its coverage, this movie tries to cover the human aspect and behind-the-scenes events from the perspective of the man who made this possible - Captain Chesley Sullenberger.On 15th January, 2009 US Airways Flight 1549 (Airbus 320-214) took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport with the experienced and sure-handed Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) at the helm along with his First Officer Jeffrey B. Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). Three minutes into take-off, the flight was hit by a flock of Canada geese leading to the shutdown of its engines and flight losing its thrust. Using all his experience as a flight safety expert, glider pilot as well as his instincts, Sully landed the plane on the River Hudson without any casualties despite instructions to return to the source airport or the other nearby options. An inquiry was ordered by NTSB whose initial evaluation through flight simulators suggested that it would have been possible for the flight to have made it back to LaGuardia airport. With evidence mounting against him, can Sully come out of this serious accusation of endangering lives of all the passengers and crew aboard the flight.It is impossible to not draw comparisons with a similarly themed Robert Zemeckis's movie 'Flight' which also deals with a freak and impossible crash landing followed by an investigation. The major difference apart from one being fiction is the melodrama quotient. 'Sully' deals the entire episode with operational efficiency without bringing in emotion where it was not necessary. The surprising and overwhelming nature of the situation that doesn't have a precedence is well countered by the experience, maturity and confidence of the Captain who is a veteran of thousands of flight hours and air-crash investigations - aptly portrayed by Tom Hanks. The way Sully is shown to conduct himself in this extraordinary situation makes you respect the real man even more. While the focus is mostly on Sully, Aaron Eckhart shows his quality by making his presence felt without actually having to force it in. One more interesting segment is how Sully deals with the situation on the personal front with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) while speculating possible outcomes from the impending investigation.Apart from the leads, Anna Gunn (Breaking Bad fame) also gives a nuanced performance as Elizabeth Davis, an NTSB panel member who was heading the investigation. Rest of the cast gives an apt performance despite just being in the background. Coming to the technical departments - the visual effects of the crash looks natural, the screenplay makes the events more interesting by non-linear flip-flopping between the incident and the investigation. However the final hearing of the investigation is hurried to bring the revelations hastily in a day which in reality would have taken weeks to conclude. Despite its short runtime, it sometimes felt repetitive and dragging occasionally.
