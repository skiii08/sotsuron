Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas sells out Star Wars fans for maximum dollar extraction
","I am 26 and grew up with the holy trilogy, i loved the imagery and diversity of the star wars universe and couldn't wait for TPM. Having seen it, i can only wish Lucas had let a real Star Wars fan see this film and listened to his comments before letting TPM be released. We would have been spared the incredibly annoying Jar Jar Binks, the criminal under use of Darth Maul the coolest character in the film, the feeble plot ending (as if the battle droid UPS or whatever it was would be in the main hanger of the control ship) most of snot-nosed Anakin's dialogue ( YIPPEE!? )the use of stereotypes to identify characters ( Jar Jar, Watto, the Viceroy etc )and all the other merchandise pushing, dollar extracting mass appeal crap that he pumped into this film. George Lucas had 17 years and an unlimited budget to put this thing together, it should have been the ultimate evolution of the series but instead turned into a over-blown episode of the muppet show in space. I can only hope that Lucas wakes up tomorrow and realizes he can't direct to save his life. He then steps aside and hands the reins to a proper director for the next in the series to stop the rot and restore the real fans faith in the star wars universe.",Null,0,1,17 February 2000
