Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Surprisingly under-rated
","I have to say that if people think that they know more about Star Wars than George Lucas himself, not to mention LucasArts, they should just go and try to make their own Star Wars movie which they feel would better this one. I was extremely satisfied with everything this movie delivered from start to finish and could not find anything as bad as people like to spout. Yes, I am a Star Wars fan and I follow it a bit but to put this movie down based upon so many idiotic nitpicks is truly disgraceful. The only major flaw I can think of was Jar Jar Binks which was extremely embarrassing to watch in a film like this. But even so, this movie gives everything a fan could ask for and those naysayers should simply shut it.",10,0,1,18 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An unbiased view of this movie
","I can't believe that I canceled an entire outing to watch the full 3.5 hrs of this movie which turned out to be extremely disappointing and downright boring at times. I followed the hype, the rating and thought that this movie must really be one of the best in the world and it certainly is not. It is actually one of the poorer movie efforts I've seen. The story is very weak and the happy ending is expected. The pile of CGI ie the Golem was rendered completely pointless by his portrayal in this film and the series could have actually gone on without it. There is even less of a villain in this movie than there was in the first and second movies. The movie is divided into two parts, namely Frodo's boring and mostly event-less journey and a banal war which the good guys obviously win. Avoid this movie despite all the hype. It has nothing new.",2,1,6,18 August 2006
