Changeling," Well done, but disturbing film.
","While this movie was a very beautiful film to watch, and Jolie's acting was surprisingly quite great, the second half of this movie proved to be quite disturbing. I don't want to give anything away, but there are scenes in the movie that partially show the killing of and killing by children. I was sick to my stomach the the final 1/3 of the movie and had to leave at one point. There is also a scene that disturbingly shows a woman being given shock treatment at a psych ward.I sadly cannot recommend this movie because of the few very disturbing scenes that ruined it for me. Otherwise, this movie would be highly recommended.",3,8,34,3 November 2008
