Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 - Visually Stunning and Philosophically Engaging.
","'Blade Runner 2049' was visually stunning at times, through scenes flooded in light and shadows...the perfect visuals depicting good and evil, the contrast in characters and theme of the story. A story that moves throughout the movie, expanding the depth of the original movie while creating pathways to the continuation of the overall story in series or sequels.Like the original 1982 Blade Runner movie, 'Blade Runner 2049' requires more than one viewing to capture the deeply philosophical questions embedded throughout the film and the endless possibilities of what's to come. The special effects were also excellent and at times quite mesmerizing. ~ Stewart Brennan",10,2,16,19 December 2018
