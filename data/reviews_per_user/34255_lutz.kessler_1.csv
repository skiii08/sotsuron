The Blair Witch Project," A lot of attitude, but no movie.
","Long after the hype I watched this film. There was only one thing in this film to make it look like a documentary: the ever unsteady, shaky or wobbly camera (but not in those moments it should have been unsteady - there it was perfectly balanced).And here the whole thing fails: Since you know it's just a movie and no documentary the unsteady camera is only a style - one style only is not enough to create a good movie.And now the whole card house falls: Everything is sheer attitude.Even if the actors were only improvising their lines - they knew what they were doing.The characters were more stupid than Hans and Gretel (Jack and Jill in English, I believe), they never left a trail of bread crumbs.When they were lost they went south one day, east the other day - they never followed that brook. They always lit their spotlights when they needed night vision of their own eyes. They always shouted when they should have been listening.They never had any problems with batteries or accumulators - Heather kept filming and filming over days - it was cold and damp - I never had that luck with my video camera.And for the ending: I didn't expect a monster - the whole film said it'll be like that. Simple - no surprise.If you want a REALLY scary movie watch 'Spoorloos' by George Sluizer (but avoid the Hollywood remake, it's rubbish).",4,0,2,29 September 2000
