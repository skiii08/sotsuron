Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Film, But Not As Good As The Original
","I was one of the thousand fans that got to see it at 12:01 am on the 19th. I enjoyed the film very much, but knew that it wouldn't live up to the hype (Would it be as good as the first one?); that would be impossible. Anyway, after the first 10 to 20 minutes I was very worried.  The pace was too fast and there was no plot development, too many of Lucas' famous wipes, fades, dissolves, etc.  However, once our Jedi buddies Qui and Obi Wan met Anakin, things slowed down and the movie got on the right track.  It wasn't as action packed as Star Wars or Jedi, but it kept my interest enough to keep me from leaving my seat.  I'll probably go see it a few more time to take it in more and see if i missed anything.   Overall, a great film.  I can't wait to see the next one.  How long before lines start for that one?  When somebody starts the official countdown, let me know.",8,0,1,19 May 1999
