Minority Report," I wasn't expecting this.
","I wasn't expecting much of this movie, so when I sat down with my friends to see it, I was positively surprised to see that this movie had something more going than just a lot of futuristic action with no content.Of course, like all futuristic movies, it has glitches (lots and lots) and you shouldn't try to disassemble the movie, but it's hard not to. Remember the Back To The Future trilogy ? Remember Blade Runner ? Remember AI ? Remember Mission: Impossible ? This Spielberg. This is homage to Philip K Dick (who's novel the movie's based upon). This is homage to Stanley Kubrick (for whom Spielberg finished the directing of AI). This is Tom cruise. This is a movie filled with references, you won't catch them all the first time, but it sure does a lot for your viewing pleasure. This is science-fiction at it's best (at least this year). So, if you don't go too deep into the logic and consistency of the movie, you'll find that this is quite an enjoyable adventure into the Spielberg movie-magic. I give this movie a rating of ****/***** - Tom Cruise is excellent (as always, ok, I'm a fan, sorry) and the movie's a blast.",7,0,0,30 August 2002
As Good as It Gets," This truly IS As Good As it Gets
","The first time I saw this movie, I thought: 'Jack Nicholson is the greatest'. The second time I saw this movie, I thought: 'Greg Kinnear is really something'. I saw it a third time and thought: 'Wow, that Helen Hunt sure is amazing'. The fourth time I was in awe of Cuba Gooding Jr. Last time I saw it (must've been the 41st time), I wasn't thinking anymore, I was being part of the movie.I can't explain the charm and wit of this movie, but it's a movie you can't ignore with a good conscience. (Is that con-science?).
Melvin is an interesting character with interesting flaws, he's interested in Carol the waitress and mostly uninterested in everything else. He has his own interesting views on absolutely everything, and he's easy to dislike - at first. But then you succumb and you fall in love with Melvin Udall, the writer of fiction for women (with no sense or accountability).
This movie goes from A to Z. It opens and it ends. No overdoing here, just simple movie-magic.*****/*****",9,1,1,15 August 2002
Good Will Hunting," In the end, the book would've been better.
","I remember seeing this movie with my dad at the movies back in '97. I remember how it hit my stomach and made me shiver, and how I returned to the cinema the very next day to watch it again.The moment I got it on video, I watched it every day after school. It was a great movie and I loved it. I cried. I laughed. It was a movie about life.But now, after having seen the movie too many times, every line is like a quote and I'm thinking, this should be a book. I'd rather read the script over and over again than watching the movie another time. Don't get me wrong though, the movie's great, but I think the book would've been better.This is the movie about Will Hunting, an intelligent kid with a disturbing childhood. Because of his childhood he has psychological issues and does not function well, but thanks to a job he got through his parole officer, he gets in touch with a math professor who takes him under his wings, but what will this mean and how will Will handle it all?It's clearly a brilliant movie about troubled minds, growing up, and how we're all different in similar ways. Watch this movie once or twice, but refrain from watching it too many times.***/*****",10,0,2,15 August 2002
Donnie Darko," You will never forget it
","Not watching this movie, is the 8th deadly sin. In other words, this is a must see. You cannot be told about this movie, you have to see it for yourself. In short: rent it - no, buy it! - now!His name is Donnie Darko. A weird guy at first sight. But wait 'til you see the inside. Dark. Darker. Darko.Enough said. I enjoyed this very much, and I usually say: If Good Will Hunting is a disease (which it is not), this is the antidote.",Null,0,0,22 February 2004
