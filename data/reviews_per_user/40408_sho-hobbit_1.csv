Sucker Punch," Visually adorable, Good concept movie. Totally enjoyable.
","I loved it. People are going on and on about the story, who gives a S***. This movie never intended to be a Mind ride,( although it can be, if you want it to be ) its just an entertaining movie, with stunning visuals. All of the geek fantasies put into one. Adorable cast and characters, the acting is meh, not so perfect. The direction so so. gets Slow paced from time to time, The story has a good concept but fails to execute everything perfectly. But here is a question, when you go to see a movie on the big screen, and you're out for a fun time. Nothing special, you don't wanna come out of the theater and contemplate about Life and all its ups and downs, but instead you wanna come out refreshed, excited and a bit horny :P. What do you do? I suggest Sucker Punch :) There is a lot of mindless puke on theaters yes but this is not one of them! This is an enjoyable Movie. and it has AN EXTREMELY GOOD SOUNDTRACK! Kinda makes up for a lot of stupidity. Bottom line, I loved it, I gave it a 10 although my taste in movies ain't exactly perfect but I do like my action. I gave it a 10 because I got my moneys worth. I went in feeling depressed after reading all the comments about this, came out feeling happy and at peace.Give it a shot, with an open mind, and try and not take all the comments about it into account. You should have your own feeling about it and you will.Peace",10,2,7,17 June 2011
