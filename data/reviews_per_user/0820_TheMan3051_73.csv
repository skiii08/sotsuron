The Mask," Awesome!
",This is easily Jim Carrey's greatest picture! Not only that but in my opinion this was one of the funniest films of the `90s. This is such a fun movie that you can see it 10 times and it's still as fun as the first time. The film stars Jim Carrey in another amazing performance and the BEAUTIFUL Cameron Diaz in her debut. Also this is kind of like the Rocky Horror Picture Show of my generation. I remember Halloween 1995 when my friends and I dressed up as the characters from this movie and did the Cuban Beat! :)4(****)out of 4(****)starsAn ENTERTAINING MASTERPIECE!!!!,10,122,152,11 November 2002

Requiem for a Dream," An Optimum Film!
","What upsets me about 6th grade Science classes and 10th grade Health classes is that they're to PG when showing movies dealing with drugs. I believe if you want to make an impression on someone on the effects of drugs then you need to make a scrupulous presentation. Sure they may show you people who have suffered from the excessive use of Cigarettes or marijuana but they only show you one side of the story. While there's nothing wrong with that many people aren't convinced by learning one side of the story. And while Health class tends to take a more PG-13 route, the 6th grade class maintains PG and the next thing you know you have a bunch of 6th graders either smoking or doing drugs. So I believe if you want to stop people from using drugs then get a bunch of 6th graders together and show them this brilliant movie by Darren Aronofsky which is truly a scrupulous presentation. This MASTERPIECE shows possibly all sides of what may happen if you use drugs and it doesn't show it to us PG but NC-17!!!! I'm sure anyone who sees this film will not dare to do any drugs. I must admit that Aronofsky did his homework in this film cause this was really an IMPRESSIVE picture. You'll never see nothing on film more shocking then the last 30 minutes of this movie. Those last 30 minutes is what every 6th grader SHOULD see!
SPOILER AHEAD: The old lady losing her mind, the main characters arm, Marlon Wayne's character going to prison I believe, and the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly going through the humiliation of masturbating in front of a crowd just to get some drugs. That is some impressive and shocking material. SPOILER END4(****)OUT OF 4(****)STARS10/10A MASTERPIECE!!!!",10,0,1,11 November 2002

","If Harvey Dent would have been in this movie as planned perhaps Batman Forever might have been the 2nd best. Still this is a great movie. Also due to the fact that Batman is the lead character in this movie, unlike in the original, Michael Keaton's performance is way better than in the original.

Taxi Driver," Martin Scorsese's Batman Movie (WILL contain spoilers)
","Are you talkin' to me? Are YOU talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here. --Travis Bickle in 'Taxi Driver'Directed by Martin ScoresesWritten by Paul SchraderStarring Robert De NiroTaxi Driver starts out with Travis, an ex-Vietnam soldier who gets a job as a Taxi Driver and as the movie continues and he is more exposed to the streets. He becomes crazier and crazier! Crazy enough to write a letter to his parents saying he's a secret service agent. He then befriends a young prostitute played by Jodie Foster and he goes on a killing spree and kills all the pimps! And instead of getting arrested he is seen as a HERO! It's like Batman or something! And even more shocking is that in the beginning of the movie he has a regular `70s haircut and after having a conversation with Peter Boyle's character in the cafeteria, in the next scene he appears with a mohawk(Mr.T). And after the killing spree he appears once more in front of the cafeteria and with his regular `70s haircut. So I wonder if the killing spree really happened or was it just in his head?!3(***)out of 4(****)starsI would have given the movie 4 stars but I did not like the pacing.

That`s where Marty comes in. He turns the film into a full screen music video.Those scenes where nothing is happening he turns it into something amazing. The music is practically speaking for the actors. Not only that, he also doesn`t just show people shooting pool, he combaines it with both music and balls coming right at you. Still the actors (Paul Newman, Tom Cruise, and Mary) gave some great performances which helped the picture a lot by making you actually care about the characters.(5/10)",5,0,4,22 December 2001

Edward Scissorhands," A Creative Masterpiece
","Batman is still by far Tim Burton's greatest picture but this film is by far his most creative. In what many have called 'the re-telling of Frankenstein' Burton creates a world like no other. There is a scene where Kim (Winona Ryder) is dancing to the 'snow' to Danny Elfman's beautiful score and that has to be one of the most beautiful scenes ever captured on film. The film stars Johnny Depp in what is perhaps his greatest performance and he portrays Edward in such a superb way that it is impossible to imagine someone else playing that character. Now with Burton, Depp, and Danny Elfman, in what once again should have been an Oscar-Winning score, mix the right elements to achieve the status of this wonderful picture.",10,0,0,29 June 2002

Saving Private Ryan," Saving Ryan's Privates
","Since today is Veteran's Day I decided to review Saving Private Ryan.Directed by Steven Spielberg this masterpiece War film contains perhaps the most realistic battle scenes captured on film. You see anyone can do an accurate war film but not many have the courage or patience to create an accurate war scene battle. Now while most war films, especially WWII movies tend to focus on the political side of the war this one focuses on the people who fought the war. Which is why this movie is so great. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with doing a war movie centering on the political side but when you focus on the people it gives the movie more of an impact. Which is perhaps why Vietnam movies make some much have an impact on the audience. My theory is that WWII was such an accomplishment to the United States that Producers tend to focus on the political accomplishment.

Now not only is Oskar Schindler an interesting man but Spielberg compares the character/man to an evil Nazi who is also a greedy business man like Schindler. Still what's great about this movie is that Spielberg gets to the interesting stuff--unlike other bio-pics.

Driven," Go and see Sylvester Stallone's career being DRIVEN towards the toilet!
","I have this theory about Sly Stallone's career. If you have made close observation about his career then you'll notice that back in the late `70s Stallone wrote a couple of interesting and decent dramatic pictures. Then the `80s arrived and he transformed himself into an action star and did a couple of good action films in the `80s and early `90s. Then the mid-90s arrived and Stallone already approaching 50+ years became to old to be accepted for any action roles. So since that time he has become a struggling actor, whose career is being driven towards the toilet.
Now I believe if throughout the `80s and early `90s Stallone would have balanced action films with dramatic ones he would right now not be in the situation he is at! Now his movie Driven is an improvement from his last couple of efforts but it still doesn't live up to be a decent picture. The women, especially Estella Warren are beautiful and the film contains SOME impressive racing sequences. Still at the end it's not a good movie.1 1/2(*1/2)out of 4(****)stars",7,0,0,18 November 2002

Mission: Impossible II," R:I-2
","Review: Like my buddy Roger Ebert stated'The first 'Mission: Impossible' (1996), directed by Brian De Palma, had a plot no one understood. 'M:I2' has a plot you don't need to understand. It's been cobbled together by the expert Hollywood script doctor Robert Towne out of elements of other movies, notably Hitchcock's 'Notorious' (1946), from which he takes the idea that the hero first falls in love with the heroine, then heartlessly assigns her to resume an old affair with an ex-lover to spy on his devious plans.'M:I-2 is way better then the original.

Once Upon a Time in America," Underrated masterpiece
","Un*der*rate (verb transitive)First appeared in 1650: to rate too low : Undervalue Underrated is the proper word to describe this film that was the last of a great filmmaker. Many filmmakers last picture are nothing more than a tired picture directed by an old and tired director but Sergio Leone delivered us a masterpiece. Still what else can we say about this man `s career? Only directing seven pictures Sergio Leone was a unique director, who only received respect from moviegoers and fellow actors. But was given unfairness from the Hollywood community, not even receiving an Academy Award nomination, only the Golden Globes were fair and gave him a nomination for this brilliant film. 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a masterpiece of art work, one which has two versions. The four hour version which is the true masterpiece and a two hour version which is a jigsaw puzzle. The film is about four friends who meet as youngsters and start doing street crime but then an incident occurs when one of the members gets killed and the other gets arrested but once he`s released from jail during his manhood he and his friends perform great deal of organized crime mostly with  help of political connections. The characters name is Noodles and is performed by Robert De Niro in what should have been an Oscar nominated performance. I won`t get much into the plot so I won`t ruin the film. Now I won`t say this is the greatest gangster flick ever because it`s not. The Godfather movies beat it by great miles but this is definitely one of the top ten. Sad as it can be it was underrated and still is. How? it`s a mystery to me. Maybe it`s because of the two different versions I think. Probably more people have seen the two hour version. Still it`s a great movie which features:*Great acting-both by De Niro and Woods*Great score*And great directionAnd just like the other great Sergio Leone masterpiece 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' this film delivers the goods!!!!4 stars ****10/10",10,0,4,8 December 2001

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Pot Head and the Sorcerer is Stoned!
",Tagline: Let the Pot Smoking Begin!All jokes aside this was actually a pretty decent picture. I honestly haven't read any of the books but from what I've heard it's a faithful adaption. Now the film itself contains some nice special effects and some of the performances were pretty good. Including that of the late Richard Harris. The young actors assigned to play the role did a decent job and Emma Watson who plays Hermoine Granger is a cute kid and might be a future sex symbol. And Rupert Grint is possibly the worlds next Ralph Mouth! Daniel Radcliffe who plays Harry Potter better do some smart decision once the series is over cause if not he'll find himself type cast as Harry forever!3(***)out of 4(****)stars,8,0,0,17 November 2002
The Untouchables," Nothing beats Entertainment!
",This could have been the average gangster film and feature a lot of realism and graphic violence. It could have been an accurate bio-pic of the Untouchables but they decided to do it other wise. Both David Mamet and Brian de Palma made the right decision to just make a fun movie. I love those realistic and violent gangster movies but change is GOOD! And it's nice to see something different.The actors are great especially Connery and De Niro. Sean Connery (in an Oscar-winning performance) does a great job as Malone and this is perhaps his best character next to James Bond and Professor Henry Jones. Robert De Niro in the other hand is hilarious as Al Capone and that scene where he hits one of his henchmen with a baseball bat is one of the greatest and most spoofed scene in recent years. To top it all there is a fantastic score by Ennio Morricone.****out of****stars,10,0,0,12 July 2002
The Godfather: Part III," A letdown
",This movie has some powerful scenes especially at the end but overall it was a letdown. I think the reason it was a letdown was because it was too predictable. After what happened at the end of 'Godfather II' everyone knew what was going to happen to Michael. So since the focus was mostly on Michael it was pretty predictable at times. It would have been a better movie if they would have combined the Michael scenes with Sonny's early days. **1/2 out of **** Stars,7,1,3,7 July 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a Wonderful Movie
","Frank Capra's masterpiece picture 'It's a Wonderful Life' is an amazing film which deals with such an important value in life. Life itself of course! It's amazing how George (played wonderfully by Jimmy Stewart)has affected so many lives. And his life is as simple as all of ours. So this is a movie that not only can you relate with but makes you think about how valuable life really is.4(****)out of 4(****)starsA MASTERPIECE!!!!

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," My Harry Potter Misfortune
","The craziest s--t happened when I went to see Harry Potter!After an hour or so of enjoying the movie the power went out in the entire theater. We were left in complete darkness! Well, EVERYONE in the entire theater obviously went to get their refund. So the lines were huge and it took me 40 minutes to get my refund and after I got my money back I went to McDonalds and with the same money I had to pay for the movie I used it on the McDonalds. So in conclusion with the same 20 dollar bill I not only saw 1 hour of the Harry Potter movie but I bought McDonalds as well!
Crazy I tell ya! And I'm sure that Doody is behind all this!Anyway, from my one hour observation I must say Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a lot better then the original because unlike the original it doesn't spend too much time explaining stuff and it gets right to the adventure.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002

Gangs of New York," (WILL contain spoilers)
","I was quite disappointed in this movie! The first and second act were terrific filled with outstanding direction from Scorsese and nice performances. Then the climax arrives and kills the whole picture! When the Leo Di Caprio character and Bill the Butcher go into battle the American army comes in and attacks the mobs but sure even if the explosions are getting in the way. It doesn't mean they should get in the way of Leo and Danny. In conclusion Leo never really avenged his fathers death and he found respect for Bill! So the only satisfying thing about this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis's performance which will surely win an Oscar.
A little side note:Since this is sort of an epic I believe the Academy will take it upon them to give Martin Scorsese a long over due Oscar. But what they SHOULD do is take away Kevin Costner's Oscar and give it to Marty. Which is the one he truly deserves. 2 1/2(**1/2)out of 4(****)starsIf this movie was done in `78 like originally planned it might have been a better movie because I'm sure Robert De Niro would have given Bill the Butcher a good beating.
