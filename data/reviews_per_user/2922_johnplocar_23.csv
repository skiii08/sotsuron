Blade Runner 2049," Denis Villeneuve is a mastermind behind the camera...
","I needed a few days to let this movie settle with me. Not that I thought that any part of this film was bad, actually I believe it to be a great film. Even at the very moment the ending credits hit the screen I just felt that I had seen something truly great. I loved 'Blade Runner 2049' and I hope that this gets just as much love and attention as its predecessor has gotten over the years since its 1982 theatrical release. Everything about this movie I thought was executed so insanely well; from its haunting visuals to the meticulously thought out story, the editing, the acting, the direction, character development, all of it was handled with such an obsessive amount of care that I couldn't believe what I was witnessing half the time. The only reason why I hesitate to give this film a 10 out of 10 is because I'm still debating in my head whether I dreamt this up or not, because I swear there are times I felt hypnotized by Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece here. The premise about an investigation being run by a Blade Runner named 'K' (played by Ryan Gosling), who is trying to figure out and cover up certain events that were perpetrated by a small group of replicants (machines made to appear human, but serve humans in their day to day activities) which may have also included involvement of the Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). From there, I can't say too much more without risking any involuntary reveals. For anyone expecting an action film then I am sorry to say, but you are heavily mistaken. This is a detective noir with a slow burn mystery, very much so like the first 'Blade Runner'; only add about 45 more minutes to the run time. This is no joke of a film, it is a long movie and it takes its time to unfold its plot while simultaneously building upon the world of 'Blade Runner' and the individuals that inhabit it. There are moments of action and suspense of course, running in the same vein as Ridley Scott's original, however they are just as sparsely placed as well; but it works. It all somehow works because there was not a single solitary second of this film's run time that I felt bored or had my mind wander off mid-scene. I was fully engaged in its plot and its characters and I wanted to know exactly where it was going. Sometimes the script is cryptic and vague about what is really going on and other times it is completely concrete; the filmmakers knew exactly how and when to be one or the other. Supplying enough solid answers to keep the viewer satisfied, but also leaving plenty of room to let people interpret specific aspects any way they may see fit. Which is much more difficult than it may seem to achieve.'Blade Runner 2049' isn't afraid to ask questions that are similar to its predecessor, but severely expands on those themes to all new heights. What does it mean to be human? At what point do we as a society finally see machines as close to being human without being human? When the line is so blurred, how would we be able to tell the difference between man and replicant? Could we get to a point with technology that it surpasses even us in how human someone can be, while humanity could become as cold as machinery is? Is it love that defines having a soul or is there something more to it? The film flawlessly brings these themes up without ever feeling forced or out of place, even once. Characters that go through their own personal arcs can also be interpreted as being one thing, but after some time to ponder could be perceived in a whole new light. The entirety of this film is carried solely on the back of Ryan Gosling and he knocks it out of the park. He has given performances that are definitely reminiscent of his role here, which there have been times in the past where it was problematic for him. Whether not supplying enough charisma or intrigue in order to reel the viewer in, luckily that isn't the case here. Yes, he gives a stoic and deadpan performance but I always felt like there was something to him. He wasn't brooding for the sake of brooding or what have you, he gives a layered performance here that is equal parts cool, funny and intense at times. He did a terrific job and I'm glad to see him, along with the rest of the cast, at the top of their game. Especially Harrison Ford, who gives his reprisal of the role as Deckard all that he's got. There are so many more things I wish I could talk about, but I think I've said more than enough. 'Blade Runner 2049' is a great sequel. It is a great film. I sadly feel that it may suffer the same fate as the original did with not being accepted right away by the mainstream audience and not doing all that fantastic financially either. Which is a shame because we don't get many great movies or sequels like this, yet when we do they bomb at the box office. We hear all the time how people want more than just another Michael Bay explosion fest, but when we are finally given a true science fiction epic with originality to spare...no one goes to see it. Hopefully in the years to come, this will be appreciated and studied alongside the first 'Blade Runner' by many who see it. Preferably sooner rather than later so I'm not 55 when another long awaited sequel is released.",10,3,15,9 October 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," A solid thriller that had me hooked all the way through...
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' may or may not be a sequel to 2008's 'Cloverfield' or even possibly in the same continuity, that is never made clear but is unnecessary because this is a stand-alone film that is tense from the start. There may be Easter-eggs scattered throughout that connects the two, I have no clue, but it really doesn't matter to me because this movie doesn't need to be a part of the same universe as 'Cloverfield'. I am 100% satisfied with this secluded thriller that I watched last night all on its own. The film opens with a young woman, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, driving out to the country side while all is seemingly right with the world around her. After her car is hit and knocked off the road she wakes up to a man, John Goodman, claiming that there has been some sort of nuclear attack on the country; if it is being made by some foreign terrorist or someone else is unclear. He states that she can't leave because the air is toxic and won't be clean enough to survive outside of the fallout shelter they are taking refuge in for at least a year. Along with Goodman is another young man, John Gallagher Jr., who tries to help Winstead through trying to come to terms on being in the shelter. From there the viewer is never sure what is actually happening behind Goodman's curtain; whether he's telling the truth, and if he is, does it mean she's actually safe with these two men?The rest of the film is something I refuse to spoil because it is one hell of a ride. This is a very tense, thrilling and gripping story about three people locked down in a fallout shelter together just trying to get by. For the most part anyhow. The performances and chemistry between the actors are great. John Goodman gives a performance that is simultaneously chilling and likable. For the most part, he comes across as a guy that only wants to help, but there is always something about him that comes across as 'not right'. But it's played so well and written so perfectly that you don't know if there's legitimately something wrong with this character that could be life threatening or because he's just a socially awkward, conspiracy theorist with a sad past. You never truly know...well, until you know and then things are pretty clear. The film plays with you a little because you never feel like there is a trustworthy character. At any time, while yes they seem normal mostly but you don't know enough about them to be totally sure if they aren't up to something as well. All three characters are easily likable, even with Goodman being as intense and scary as he can be he also feels human and has moments of levity.Once the ending happens, things feel crazy and I never knew where it was going once the third act hits. It is a fantastic watch and I highly recommend checking it out. If you like a thriller that will hold you in your seat while you need to use the restroom so bad, but you can't get up because of the need to see what happens next...here you go.",8,2,4,12 March 2016
A Star Is Born," I'm a man...I don't cry...okay, I cried.
","There are some directorial debuts that are just fine and there are others that are complete train wrecks. Bradley Cooper knocked his debut right out of the park because this film is one of the best I've seen all year. I loved this movie and it even pulled some legitimate tears from my eyes, which is saying a lot because I've also seen the 1976 adaptation of 'A Star Is Born' starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand; a film I also love.If you haven't seen any of the previous iterations of 'A Star is Born' or don't know the plot then here is a synopsis; Jackson Maine is a drug addicted alcoholic musician with his career going on a steady decline, one night runs into a girl named Ally in a bar who is an unknown singer with the potential to really do something with her talents. From there a love starts to bloom as Jackson helps Ally start off her career while he battles his own demons of depression, regret and addiction. I have to say that this film is an emotional powerhouse. There is some real impactful human drama here that is made all the more poignant by the actors who do an incredible job.With a film like this, pretty much everything can fall apart if the romance isn't believable. Luckily with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in the lead roles, the chemistry is amazing between the two and one hundred percent believable in every scene. From the start of the movie it is apparent that these two people are somewhat of a mess, but in completely different ways; Cooper's character is a hardcore alcoholic that is squandering his music career away while Gaga's character lacks motivation and confidence to do anything more with her singing. However, when they find each other it's clear that they supply a lot of positivity to one another, such as Jackson finding a rekindled love for creating music and Ally finds the confidence to put herself out there. However, with those positives also comes consequences. These two actors, without a doubt, convey a truly authentic feeling love that can be seen clearly throughout the film; because of that it is easy to be charmed by their romance and route for them when things hit a down swing.Every conversation in the film feels real, I don't just mean the ones between the two romantic leads, but the entire cast. There's just something about the dialog that comes across as discussions I could picture myself or anyone having, rather than something cleaned up and manipulated to fit the Hollywood world. When Jackson and Ally are talking about music or just getting to know each other, it feels heartwarming but never cynically 'cute'. Or if two characters are fighting, it could have come across as melodramatic, but here it feels legitimate and relatable. Speaking of characters in conflict, Sam Elliot also plays a supporting character in the film as Jackson's older brother and Elliot is brilliant in the role. There are scenes where Elliot doesn't even have to say a word, but the performance that he gives just in his face alone says everything you need to know and it hits hard; especially in one scene in particular between Elliot and Cooper that really tugged at the heart strings, I don't want to say too much as to what is said but there is a moment of silence for Sam Elliot after Cooper leaves the scene that was really emotionally difficult to watch because of his performance. And I mean that in the best way possible.That reminds me, there's another silent moment in the film involving solely Bradley Cooper that really delivered such a strong emotional response for me. It was towards the end of the film, again, I won't say exactly what is happening but the whole scene starts with a somber tone that ramps up with suspense in anticipation as to what this character is going to do. Then with one look on Cooper's face, you understand everything that is going on in this guy's head and I couldn't help but get choked up. It was terribly difficult not to simply cry through whole scenes because of the tragedy going on in these people's lives. That's one of the great things about this movie, I forget that these are even characters, I feel like I am getting a peek into real peoples' lives. The movie really hit me right in the gut with one of its final shots involving Jackson Maine and Ally. When it got to that moment, I'm not going to lie, I shed a lot of tears...I mean...I'm a manly man, I don't feel feelings. Feelings are stupid...I need another tissue.One brilliant thing that I would like to touch on is the cinematography; as a whole it is terrific, but there is something specific that this film does that I absolutely love. Throughout the entire romance there are these really specific moments that happens between these two characters that are made to feel even more significant because when they happen it switches to Jackson's point of view. Such as when they look directly at each other for the first time, the camera switches to Jackson's point of view staring right at Ally's face. When it is their wedding day, Jackson and Ally are standing at the alter and say 'I do', the camera briefly looks right at Ally's face. And then at the end it does it again, but in a slightly different way that I won't say. For me, this was a genius way to help the audience fall for this girl and understand exactly what is going on with these characters internally. Another technique the cinematography takes is how it films Jackson when he's intoxicated or high; a lot of the time it takes a while for the camera to give a full look at Jackson's face and everything feels just slightly off kilter. I thought that was a cool way to make certain scenes feel kind of odd and even on edge, much like how it is when you're in a room alone with someone who's completely drunk and you're sober. There's just a different vibe in the room, I think anyone who's been there knows what I'm talking about.The music of this movie blew me away. I was in awe of how much character and story could be fleshed out in just a single song. But again, the actors pull it off perfectly. Whenever they have to perform on stage or they're just simply playing along together in a private setting, it is made wildly clear how these people feel and what is going through their heads. When Lady Gaga's character is somewhat coerced into singing live on stage with Jackson for the very first time, you get everything going on with her in that moment. The terror of failure, the excitement of singing to a crowd full of thousands of people, the joy in finally letting go, back to fear, back to excitement. It's a flawless performance honestly that's made even better with the use of very long takes. Instead of constantly cutting, the editing is very minimal while you get a full look at everything going on with her. Lady Gaga really was a bright spot in this already great film, I loved her in this movie and cannot wait to see what she does next.A funny little tidbit about this movie is that it has a lot of supporting cast members who are comedians; Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chappelle, Alec Baldwin, and Eddie Griffin to name the ones that I noticed. Andrew Dice Clay plays Ally's father and he's surprisingly really solid. I've never seen him outside of comedic roles before and I've certainly liked him in those, but never in a dramatic role like this and I think that he nailed it. Dave Chappelle, while briefly in the movie, also does a fantastic job and I actually kind of wanted to see him more in the film interacting with Jackson.Overall, I think this is one of the best remakes that I have ever seen. A bold statement, I know, but this is a bold movie. It doesn't pull punches or ever feel manipulative, it's raw and heartbreaking and beautiful. I said it before, I'll say it again, I love this movie. The acting is perfect, the editing and cinematography is outstanding, and the story solid; possibly more so than any of the other adaptations quite honestly. If you're emotionally stable enough to make it through a heavy romantic tragedy then this is well worth your time. Check it out as soon as you can, if nothing but to feel something great.",9,7,13,21 November 2018
The Hateful Eight," I like Tarantino's style and this movie oozes that style, so it was easy for me to like...
","'The Hateful Eight': At this point if you go into a Tarantino movie and aren't sure what to expect then you've probably never seen a Tarantino movie. You should usually expect a good time with some fun characters, a lot of vulgar language with some racial slurs and even a few big buckets of blood. That is exactly what I received with this only in gorgeous 70mm Cinema Scope. Seriously, the cinematography was great in this film. And yes, I saw it in the Road Show with my amazing girlfriend who was more than willing to drive me about an hour away to see it on the BIG screen. This was a really good movie, out of the Quentin Tarantino film roster; I wouldn't say that this was my favorite of his because I do have a couple of issues with some of the editing choices and odd narration inserts planted a couple times in the movie. I still was more than thrilled that I got the chance to see the movie. I love Tarantino as a director and writer; he's made some of my favorite films of all time, such as 'Jackie Brown', 'Pulp Fiction', and 'Reservoir Dogs'. He's a talented guy that has done another amazing job on a movie here.The film is about a group of men and one woman locked up in a cabin together over a night, one of the men is bounty hunter holding a prisoner to be hung by the neck. He believes that one of the other men isn't who they say they are and there is a lot of mistrust between them, of course. Twists and turns and a hell of a lot of cool dialogue between the characters, we have our movie. I'm not going to get too much into the movie because I believe it is worth seeing in the theater, especially if you love Quentin Tarantino. Between his two westerns, I would put 'Django Unchained' above this movie, but I still really dug this one. So if you have the chance, I strongly say go see this where it is playing the Road Show version of it because you get some extra footage not seen in the other version, the full scope of the environment with its fantastic cinematography, an opening overture, an intermission, and a cool little booklet that talks about the making of the film. That's my two cents on the subject anyhow, if you see this in a regular old theater I don't believe you'll feel disappointed by any means, I just believe that you'd be missing out on a really cool experience is all. Either way, go check it out!",8,5,16,9 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," 'Goodfellas' meets the ice skating world and it's awesome!
","Going right into another sports movie; this is if someone were to make a 'Goodfellas' styled film about a professional ice skater, but snorted a little extra cocaine. It is insane and amazingly edited. Hilarious, surprising that this is an actual true story, and in the end I won't lie that I held back some tears just from Margot Robbie's performance alone. If I had a small gripe, it would be some of the CGI used; while not necessarily bad, it was noticeable at times. Other than that, I loved this movie from beginning to end.",9,9,18,3 January 2018
The Lost City of Z," One of the greatest films I've personally ever seen.
","Film is subjective, this I certainly understand, but I believe this to be the best and definitely the most underrated film of 2017; probably even one of the most underrated films I've ever seen. There isn't a single, solitary scene that doesn't have its place. Every single aspect about this movie is executed with perfection. The story of this explorer who becomes obsessed with finding proof of a lost civilization that predates what his peers and elders believe to be true is pulled off with true tenacity in its writing, direction, cinematography, editing, tone, pacing, and performances. Charlie Hunnam takes a hold of the entire screen and commands every line he projects. In the years to come I do hope that this film is remembered fondly as being one of the greats of all time because I sincerely believe that this film is one of the greats. This is an epic in the same vein as something that would have been made back in the New Hollywod Era of the 1970s and early 1980s such as Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, Papillon, Heaven's Gate, and even The Mission. If this film isn't studied in film schools at some point down the line just like how Citizen Kane is, then there is something wrong with this world. Lost City of Z explores a man's obsession to find something greater than himself, what a man's legacy means and if the acts of a person should be what he's remembered in history for or who he really was as a man. Is a man's legacy what makes the man or is the man what makes the legacy? I loved this film and I hope that it finds way more love in the future.",10,1,2,4 January 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," The story of the legendarily praised band Queen and its lead singer Freddy Mercury... which seems to be relatively generic.
","I just want to make things clear before I get into my review that I like the band Queen, I like Freddie Mercury's work, and I thought that this movie was fine. But that's just it, it's just fine and doesn't go any further than just being 'okay'. The reason I am saying this from the start is because I'm probably going to be speaking about mostly the negatives. I don't believe that this is necessarily a bad film, I just think it has a lot of squandered potential.Now onto the bashing...just a joke...sort of.Bohemian Rhapsody is the story about Freddie Mercury and his band Queen. Starting out at the when the band gets together through Freddie Mercury's sexual exploration and drug years, to the bitter end of the legend Mercury himself. And that is basically it, which is kind of my problem with the film. It is pretty much a 'bullet point' biopic. What I mean by that is that the story seems to be nothing more than making sure to hit on all of the major historical points for this band and Freddie's life. That's it. There's no overarching story line really, nor much focus on character depth or chemistry.The plot is simply -Step 1: Band meets and gets together.Step 2: Band writes first hit .Step 3: Band records first album.Step 4: Freddie gets married.Step 5: Queen music tour montage.Step 6: Freddie starts figuring out he's gay.Step 7: Queen music tour montage.Step 8: Queen fights and writes a new hit song.Step 9: Queen music tour montage.Step 10: Queen fights and writes Bohemian Rhapsody.Step 11: Queen music tour montage.Step 12: Freddie realizes he's gay and he breaks up with his wife.Step 13: Queen music tour montage.Step 14: Queen breaks up.Step 15: Freddie becomes self-destructive with sex and drugs.Step 16: Queen gets back together.Step 17: Queen performs on stage for the last 20 minutes of screen time.The End.Now this is decent material to work with in a script, but without enough character development or a story that feels like it truly links everything together it just comes across as 'things just happening'. Now, I want to emphasize again that I don't think that this is bad, but it does make the film feel generic. However, in my opinion, the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen should really be anything except generic.To get into character, there's no specific character that's technically bad but I feel like I don't really get good enough insight into who these people really are. Freddie Mercury is eccentric, gay, and is good at performing...that's all I got out of a nearly two and a half hour movie. His wife was...definitely a woman. The band mates of Queen...could have been doctors and engineers. Paul is...evil. Yeah, I'm trying and I'm drawing a blank for everyone. Which is probably one of the biggest sins that a biopic can commit, not giving your audience enough understanding of your characters who actually exist.Anyways, if I want to watch a recent biopic about a band that also dealt with a character that contracts AIDs, I would rather go with 'Straight Outta Compton'. Or another biopic that handled the character arc of discovering one's sexuality in the 1970s and 1980s, 'Battle of the Sexes' was also another film that did a better job with those themes. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' kind of fumbles where those other two found a good balance of story, character and hitting all of the bullet points too.To get into the positives though, this is a very stylish film. The cinematography and editing is really solid, I mean it. It is superbly gorgeous, through and through. Probably one of the best looking films I've seen all year. The acting on everyone's part was also all very good, especially from Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury who did a fantastic job. He was honestly a major reason that the movie held my interest for as long as it did. Running at about two hours and fifteen minutes, without Malek's performance, I would have been more irritated by the film and its faults. Towards the beginning of the film, I will admit that I did find the fake teeth that they put in his mouth to be distracting and somewhat silly. I know that Mercury's teeth were also very prominent, but they at least seem more natural with his face while with Malek it looks like his mouth is just fighting against the prosthetic rather than working with it. After a while though I got used to it, plus it looked slightly more natural once it got to Freddie's mustache years. And my final positive would be the final act, it's probably the best part of the film. I think the reason for that is because it finally feels like it has focus and the music segments are more emotionally ramped up.Overall, I'd say that the film is okay even with all its problems. I'd say that if you catch this on television or Netflix then this will be perfectly fine where you can occasionally pause to take a break or have parts play in the background. Especially since I think that fifteen minutes or so probably could have been cut from the movie to make it a bit tighter, so if the movie loses your attention for a few minutes here and there I don't think it'll be so bad at home. It's a beautifully shot film, edited well, acted at the best of everyone's capabilities; it just lacks in story and character.",7,1,4,7 November 2018
The Revenant," Hold on, I'm having a heart attack from the intensity here...
","'The Revenant': Do you want to encompass that feeling of surviving some of the most intense circumstances that could happen to a human being? Well then, I give you 'The Revenant'! I just saw two films about survival; one was legitimately great and the other wasn't, this here is hands down is the great one. Set back in the 1820s when a man, Hugh Glass, is left for dead in the wilderness to fend off against wildlife, ravaging natives and pillagers on his journey to seek vengeance against John Fitzgerald; the person responsible for the wrongs that were dealt to him. This was an obvious passion project for director Alejandro Inarritu, the cinematography is some of the best that I've seen this year or even in the last few years. I would even say that the camera work done in this movie puts some parts of his last film, 'Birdman', to shame. This was really something to admire for the effort put into the technical aspects alone. There were moments where I couldn't believe they captured what they did on location with using all natural lighting instead of studio enhancement, which was a giant risk that completely paid off. And any times there was CGI implemented was flawless; all the effects in this film were done with a lot of perfectionism because I could never tell I was watching a film, I saw a man struggling for dear life to make it out alive in a series of awful situations. So many times I kept trying to figure out how they did what they did on the screen, but immediately dropped it because I just wanted this guy to stop getting attacked before I had a stroke from the stress.Leonardo DiCaprioman, if you don't finally get an Oscar for the grueling process that you must have gone through for this then something is clearly wrong going on there! He did a crazy good job in this film, I won't say this is my favorite role of his, but out of all his performances this is probably the hardest work he's done and it definitely shows on screen. The whole time I was biting my nails hoping that he lives, each and every time something goes south. I could have probably used a bit more comradery between his character Glass and his son, but as it is I thought it worked well for his character to not be so easy to relax. Tom Hardy also does a good job as Fitzgerald; at this point, I'm not fully sure as to where he is even from anymore. Within the same year I've heard him have an Australian accent, two separate British accents, and now a southern/Texas accent. He's always a joy to watch and from the start, you just know that this dude is a bit messed up in the head. When he goes into detail as to whyyou get it. It's always interesting to see what Hardy does next and how adaptable of an actor he can be with 5 different roles in a single year to come out, all totally different going from one to the next. He can be the perfect hero, or in this, the perfect villain. And the climax between DiCaprio and Hardy is at least a heart attack and a half. There is no choreography going on here, it is two men getting down and dirty to kill the other. It is brutal to watch and I couldn't look away for a second, just kept yelling out 'OUCH'!Now if I have any gripes or criticisms about the film, I'd say that it does drag slightly during the second act and probably could have been cut down a tad. There were some gratuitous shots of trees a number of times as well as some voice overs that could have probably been left out. As it is though, this was still quite the ride. It will end up probably in my top ten of the year, but there are still a number of others that I still have to see first. If this plays near you then I recommend seeing this if what I've said sounds like your cup of tea, it's without a doubt worth the sit.",9,12,23,9 January 2016
It Follows," This was a damn good horror film...
","In a time where that is so depressingly rare to say 'I just saw a great horror movie', I am so glad that I finally got a chance to see it. I will go into the plot, but I must press that it is on the ridiculous side in terms of the concept of what this film is about. If you like horror movies like 'Christine' or 'The Entity' that have a ridiculous concept, but it is done so well in its writing and direction then this is a movie for you. The movie is about a girl who is haunted by a ghost after having sex. Yes. That's right. Now before you stop reading, I know that it sounds like it is a ridiculously stupid concept for a movie that only exists so that there can be more of a reason why there's nudity in a horror movie. Not the case at all. There is some nudity in the flick but honestly not a whole lot, the majority of any nudity to be found is usually by the ghost itself and it's not even close to being sexy, it's seriously creepy and disturbing. Like I said before, this is a movie that if written or directed by anyone else this would have been pretty bad. Like with 'Christine' being about a killer car or 'The Entity' being about a sexually assaulting ghost, those could have been done so horribly wrong if done by anyone else; in capable hands however they became something really eerie and haunting. In the movie the girl is tricked into having sex with a guy and so he ties her up and explains to her what the ghost does and how it works as far as he knows. The ghost goes after one person; if that person has sex with another then it moves onto them until the ghost kills them. Then the ghost goes back to the person prior and then the one before them and so on and so forth. The ghost can only be seen by the people who have sexually interacted with the 'infected', the ghost only walks but it never stops. It keeps going and going until it reaches their target and practically massacres them. It can change into anyone; whether it is a stranger or someone they love just to get closer. There is no explanation as to why the ghost is doing this, how it all started, who started it, and it is completely unneeded to enjoy this movie. The pacing, the mood, the direction, the cinematography, the characters, the scares, the ghost all work so well and so disturbing that receiving some sort of explanation only would have impeded on the enjoyment to be had. It is creepy just watching this poor girl try to figure out how to get away from this thing. The girl, played by Maika Monroe, does so well in this role. If played wrong this could have been some annoying blonde ditz that I'm begging to get axed off but instead I am immediately stricken with such sympathy for her and this awful thing that she is forced to go through...all because she liked a boy. It's actually kind of heart breaking and even sadder as I think more about it actually. But anyways, in a lesser written film too she could have been an irredeemable character and just went straight to trying to pass it on to someone else but instead she tries to run or kill it or anything really before she thinks about doing something like that. There isn't a bad character in this whole movie, they are all pretty likable and I definitely like that even the skeptic in this movie (that can be found in most horror movies) still is sympathetic and is actually trying to help instead of mess things up or do something stupid like most usually do. And I cannot get over the awesome cinematography in this film, it is so well shot and I was blown away. Anyone else who sees this film will probably say, 'What makes the cinematography so good?' Please just pay attention to the lighting at the very least. In any other horror movie, even ones that I've liked over the past few years, would be so darkly lit that it is anyone's guess as so what is going on. This movie does not care about realism in that regard, if it is going to put a spot light over a car that makes absolute, zero sense to have any light shining over the car then dammit that is what's going to happen. Also the framing of some of the wide, isolated shots were reminding me of something out of 'The Shining' and the camera work screamed Wes Craven more than once. Seriously this is a real good horror film, see it if you can. Do you know how rare that is now? Guess how many good horror films I saw last year...like freaking three. So far we're already halfway through this year and I've only seen one legitimately good horror film. Just this one. I want more like this!",9,2,6,16 February 2016
Legend," Tom Hardy establishes that he is still one of the best actors of today...the rest of the movie I only wish was as great.
","'Legend': There is a difference when I say I didn't like a movie and when I'm disappointed in a movie. Sometimes they can go hand in hand, in terms of this film though I can't say that I didn't like it but I am disappointed. I expected more coming from this after seeing the trailers, knowing the talents behind the director and the lead actor as well. I've liked past scripts by Brian Helgeland such as 'L.A. Confidential', 'Payback', and 'Mystic River'. And Tom Hardy, I love Hardy. He's become one of my favorite actors from the last several years now. Even in films that I don't much care for, he still turns a great performance. As he certainly does here, carrying this film almost entirely by himself in two very diverse roles. Everyone does a good job and there are even a couple of other standouts in the crowd here, but my problem with this movie is that it has no concrete focus. Yes it does consistently follow the Kray twins, both played by Hardy, but it has no focus or structure for me to hang on to for the whole two hour runtime. I like these characters; for the most part anyhow, they are colorful and fun to watch. But for two hours there's no main story going on, only a number of side plots among the twins doing gangster stuff. Not much more to it, not to say that makes it a bad film, but after a while I didn't know what the real point of the movie was. If someone were to ask me what this movie was about, I'd say 'It's about the Kray twins who were gangsters in London during the 1960s'. Okay, what happens in it? 'Do you have two hours to spare?' Things are constantly happening, never staying on a single subject for long. It starts with Reggie (the sane twin) getting his brother, Ronnie (the insane twin), out of a mental institute. Then it moves on to them taking out one competing mob. At the same time, Reggie is goes on to date a girl named Frances (Emily Browning). The twins take over a new club and start an alliance with an American mob that doesn't ever come into play. Then Reggie gets put into jail and then comes out to marry Frances, after proposing to her he comes back to his club to discover that Ronnie has driven it into the ground whilst away. They briefly have a disagreement that results in a fist fight and Frances walking away, not for long since in a quick cut they're back together. Then it goes on from there, an hour in, with several mini-plots about the twins doing gangster things, fighting between each other, a court case that's quickly dismissed, Ronnie being a lunatic and running the empire into the ground, Frances and Reggie growing apart, there's a few deaths, a funeral, a wedding, the whole shebang. There was one point towards the end of the film though where the easiest character to route for, Reggie, becomes a lot harder to sympathize with. If you see it then I think you'll understand what I mean, but I'm not going to spoil it here. Will I say that this was a really good movie? No, it is very flawed but as something to entertain with a couple of great performances by one actor alone this definitely gets the job done. Tom Hardy was terrific in the film and without him this wouldn't have been nearly as watchable as it was. Watchability isn't my problem though; I believe that the writing does a disservice to his performances though. I know that this was based on a true story, but if this film had focused on one singular story then I think this could have been one of the better films of this year. As it is, it's fine. It annoys me when something has a lot of potential just to turn out to be a lesser product is all. If you want a truly great gangster movie with a solid performance from this year, see 'Black Mass'. Johnny Depp will stare daggers into your soul as he strangles out a hooker and it is fantastic. But if you love Tom Hardy then this won't be bad either.",6,1,2,21 December 2015
Get Out," Hilarious and Suspenseful. A great directorial debut by Jordan Peele.
","Like everyone else who saw this movie, I was really surprised by Jordan Peele's directorial debut. It had the perfect balance of tension and comedy that I haven't seen in a while. Turning the premise of 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' into an absolute nightmare. Unpredictable, intense and hilarious with a terrific character arc performed fantastically by Daniel Kaluuya. If you're the one person who hasn't seen this yet, go check it out, it's good!",9,20,40,3 January 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Same old crap, another 'Pirates' sequel.
","Wow that was so...umm...honestly, I forgot what I just saw. It was so forgettable. It blends in with everything I've already seen so many times in the last four movies. Look, I liked the first film from 2003; I find it to be a very fun and entertaining flick. Even the second movie I enjoyed, not as much as the first but I still thought it was fun enough. Then every installment since the third has been more or less the same crap now. Taking what was cool and exciting in the first two movies and recycling the hell out of them with an over abundance of characters, convoluted plot lines and a convenient series of events that lead the action sequences along. By the fifth time of seeing it all yet again, I'm just done. These movies have completely stopped giving me a reason to care at this point. Not even Johnny Depp seems to care anymore, yet he's basically supposed to be the driving force with these movies. But you can just tell that his heart is not in it anymore. The look in his eyes screams, 'Alright, I'll do it but if that check doesn't clear I swear to God...'.These later sequels, including this one, I can't say are terrible or even all that bad by any means. However, they are wildly unambitious being comprised of everything we have seen several times before in the previous installments of the franchise. The series has simply run out of steam. Why the studios insist on pursuing more sequels now is unbeknownst to me. Aside from simply being unnecessary and forgettable, there are some legitimate issues I have with the film. Such as, like I had mentioned before, too many characters. Pointless characters at that. There are whole character arcs and subplots that are introduced only to be dropped right smack dab in the middle of the film, making it a total waste of my time since there was no satisfying conclusion or payoff in any way. The acting, for the most part, is fine. Although no one stands out or even seems to be giving this movie much effort at all, especially Depp as I had said earlier. Javier Bardem does seem to be having a bit of fun as the baddie, but that's far from coming close to carrying this movie at all. There is a replacement type character that is basically a stand-in for Orlando Bloom, Brenton Thwaites, who plays Will Turner's son. And Thwaites is...awful. This is the second movie I've seen try to force him into being an action lead and it does not work at all. He has zero chemistry with everyone on screen, including what time he shares with his 'love interest'. I mean, seriously, I believe a block of wood holds more charisma than this guy. He seems to be typecast as the pretty boy bad ass, but he's not bad ass and his character is so incompetent and honestly relatively pointless to have been included in the story in the grand scheme of things. I am not joking, if he was cut from this script, the story would almost be no different. A few easy rewrites and he could be entirely vanished from this movie without a single trace.Another thing that bothered me was that characters seemed to just be able to get exactly where they need to be without any explanation whatsoever in order for the plot to continue. We'll get entire pointless character introductions to characters that will only cease to be in the film by the halfway mark, but God forbid we get an actual explanation as to how the villains somehow always seem to navigate as to where the protagonists are; among other slight nagging plot holes and anachronisms.If I have any positives to say about this movie...85% of the effects are solid. There is a bit of awkward green screening and Javier Bardem's hair...yeah, why did that need to be CGI? Whatever. Umm...let's see, what else can I say is decent about the movie? It wasn't nearly three hours long. I will give this movie a little bit of an edge over the last couple of sequels because this sticks closer to only being about two hours long rather than pushing the screen time to suck up as many hours out of the day as possible. In that regard, this is probably the best sequel since the second film...maybe. Other than that, this movie is stale. It's a series that is trying so hard to keep on trucking, but this bitch is long dead.I suppose if you're a big fan of all the other movies and you're curious then I guess this movie is fine to check out on Netflix or a cheap rental. Like I said, it's technically not a bad movie, it will be something you can watch and pay little mind to I guess if you want to try to pass the time. But at the same time, there are so many better options if you're in that sort of situation so I really don't see this movie being all that necessary. Just watch the first movie again if you want to watch a Pirates adventure; that's a hundred times better than putting this on. Granted, I doubt you'll be mad or hate having spent five bucks to rent this if you chose to, but what would be the point when you have four other movies that do the exact same thing as this movie. Two of which do those things in an actual lively and energized way. So in my opinion, you can probably skip this one and be just fine.",5,0,3,24 September 2017
Coco," My personal favorite PIXAR movie since 'Wall-E'
","I'm starting to notice a trend with PIXAR over the last few years; good, bad, mediocre. What I mean by that is that they make a good movie, then a bad one, then one somewhere in the middle since 2011. Cars 2, bad. Brave, good. Monsters University, mediocre. Good Dinosaur, bad. Inside Out, good. Finding Dory, mediocre. Cars 3, bad. Coco, frikkin great! I genuinely loved this movie. Full of heart and visual creativity, it has a fun adventure that even has good morals for kids to learn.",9,0,2,3 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's good, very good...not great.
","I liked it, but I didn't love it. I feel like saying that is just asking for someone to point a sniper rifle at my head, but I won't lie that I have problems with this movie. Not sure why I'm discussing my opinion on the movie now since most of America has probably already seen this movie twice. However, I have things to say so why not?The story picks up immediately where 'The Force Awakens' leaves off; what remains of the Resistance, led by Leia Organa, is on the run from the First Order while Rey has gone off in hopes to retrieve Luke Skywalker since he may be their last hope to defeat Supreme Leader Snoke and his army. Finn wakes up as the attack is persists on the Resistance and has to come up with a plan with Poe Dameron and a new character named Rose Tico to create an escape for what remains of Organa's army.From the start, this is a very entertaining movie for sure. The characters are all likable and interesting to watch. The action is actually some of the best the entire series has ever had to offer. The effects are spot on, along with the cinematography which is absolutely terrific. I was totally engaged in the dynamic between Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). I was hooked onto the internal struggle that continues on with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). And I was actually pleasantly surprised by the character arc that Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) goes through. Also expect a few heart string pulling scenes with Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). There is some astonishingly great moments in this film that I really did love.So if I love so much about it then why do I only like it as a whole? Because the story, while not bad, is very familiar much like how 'The Force Awakens' was very familiar. 'The Force Awakens' is known to be extremely reminiscent of 'A New Hope' with elements of 'Empire Strikes Back'. 'The Last Jedi' I would say also has a very similar issue being similar to 'Empire' and 'Return of the Jedi'. I wouldn't say that makes it a bad movie by any means, I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching it. However, I was hoping for something a little more original and for something in this movie to shock me. May I feel that way because of how much 'The Last Jedi' parallels itself to 'Empire Strikes Back' which is a highly original and surprising sequel for its time and even today continues to shock first time viewers of it. 'The Last Jedi' follows a lot of the same beats of 'Empire' and 'Return' that it's hard not to compare; a somewhat naive youth travels to a remote planet in order to be trained by an old, quirky Jedi master. While that goes on the youth's friends are being chased across the galaxy by a dark shadowy figure along with his army of Storm Troopers to the point where they have to take refuge on another planet. Rey learns about the force, what makes up the light and dark side of the force, experiences surreal visions, and has a revelation about her heritage much like Luke Skywalker went through in 'Empire'. There is a whole third act revolving around whether Rey will join the dark side, Kylo Ren attempting to convince her to join him like Darth Vader tried with Luke in 'Return'. Snoke acting in place of the Emperor in 'Return of the Jedi' when he brings the young Jedi to his throne room on a giant space station to enable this big confrontation as he reveals the chaos ensuing on her friends in the distance.It is near impossible not to see the similarities and that is a huge reason why I can't say I loved this movie. I already have 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi', I don't particularly need a repackaged version of those films. But there is enough differences and slightly unique turns that the story does take that I still found myself enjoying the movie. I am trying my best not to spoil as much as I can, everything I've said can be easily speculated from seeing the trailers so I don't believe I've said anything that's really all that hidden. Speaking of those unique aspects of the story, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is one of the best qualities of the film. He is equal parts funny, intimidating, cool, and even kinda scary in parts. Hamill absolutely owns this role, hell I think he fights to own this whole movie. He is giving his 'A' game to this performance here in 'The Last Jedi' and is a huge factor in separating this movie from being 'just a rehash'. Rey is easily one of my favorite heroes of the entire franchise, largely because Daisy Ridley is so expressive in every emotion she performs that I can't help but sympathize with her character and want to know what will happen next with her. That and I just love her energy that she gives in every line she reads.Now Kylo Ren...my god, he is so good in this. I really loved Adam Driver's performance in 'The Force Awakens' and was one of my favorite parts of that installment; in 'The Last Jedi' he has become one of my favorite villains of any movie in recent memory and certainly rivals being one of the great villains in all of Star Wars history. The struggle and torment of this character is so interesting to watch that I am constantly wondering what he's going to do next. His relationship between him and Rey is nail biting at times as it develops. Starting out severely rocky of course with how the events of the last movie panned out, but then slowly progresses into an oddly believable bond that they share. Both of them trying to find their place in the world, or galaxy in this case, and maybe even finding it together. Again, another element that helps differentiate itself from being 'Empire Strikes Back...Again'.John Boyega's character, Finn, returns in this movie and tags along with a new character named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Personally, I didn't have any real problem with their subplot together as it seems like many critics and fans do. I thought that it was fine. I didn't love their story line, but I thought that it worked well enough, didn't take up that much screen time, and it concluded in a satisfying way. Could it have been cut? Sure. Could it have been better? Most certainly. But I can't see much else that Finn could have been up to in this rather simple story. I won't spoil exactly what Finn and Rose do, but they have to embark on a mission in order to help the Resistance escape certain death.Poe Dameron is also a part of this plan that results in a lot of conflict between him and Leia as well as Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) who takes over the lead for escaping the New Order when Leia becomes preoccupied. Even though I did like Poe Dameron's arc in learning how not to always go on the offense and has to know when not to be so aggressive in his plans, I didn't much care for his dynamic with Laura Dern's character, Holdo. I found her relatively unlikable and even idiotic when it is revealed what her plan is. But it wasn't necessarily a deal breaker from my enjoyment, just a small irritance honestly.Aside from that, I don't really have any other criticisms on the film except for one that's actually a spoiler so I won't get into it. But even with that spoiler I have a problem with, I actually do kind of like what will result from it and opens the doors wide as to where things can go in the next sequel. If you've seen the movie then you might know what I'm talking about. Overall I did really like this movie and I do recommend it as a highly entertaining space adventure epic. The characters are great, the visuals are breathtaking, and the story is still solid even if it does feel a bit derivative. It's just far from being perfect is all and I wish that it would have taken a few more risks that would shock the audience. If you liked 'The Force Awakens' then you will like 'The Last Jedi'. If you had a problem with 'Force Awakens' being so similar to 'A New Hope' then 'Last Jedi' won't be much of an improvement to you.",8,0,0,17 December 2017
Logan," Logan is simply great.
","I'm pretty sure that everything that could be said about this movie has already been said several times over. It is Hugh Jackman's swan song to the character of Wolverine. The action is bloody greatness, the characters all have spot-on chemistry together, the tone is a cool blend of a classic western and a sci-fi action. And somehow it's even better in black and white. Easily the best comic book flick I've seen this year.",9,0,2,3 January 2018
Beauty and the Beast," It's the original animated movie...just higher definition of the same thing again.
","The magical 1991 animated tale is being told again, only this time in 'live-action'. The movie stars Emma Watson as Belle who finds herself imprisoned by a beastly creature in a cursed castle (Dan Stevens). The two obviously at first start out at odds, but over time learn to look past their differences and become fond of one another to the point where they may have achieved a love that could break the spell over the castle and everyone who inhabits it.I didn't like it... I think the movie itself is fine. There really isn't that much wrong with the actual picture; it's well made, well directed, looks pretty, acted fine, songs (for the most part) are the same and decent, it has a few good laughs, the CGI is mostly done alright. My real gripes about this movie is that, aside from approximately 15 minutes worth of material, it is exactly the same as the 1991 animated movie of the same name. It is as close as a movie can get to being a 'shot-for-shot' remake without reaching quite to the extent of Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho'. There isn't any real originality to this movie, it rips off every single scene, all the songs and lines of dialog from the original and makes it 'live- action', which even then it's not really live-action since the majority of the film is done with CGI. Granted, a lot of the CGI looks fine, but some of it looked a little...creepy. Anyways, I can't say that it's a bad film but that is only because it follows the original so closely so of course it isn't bad. But if I want to watch the exact same movie again then I'll pop in the 1991 movie that feels way more genuine than this remake. I was able to feel way more of the enchantment and charm of the cartoon than I was with this movie. With this movie, all I was able to feel was the cynical attitude of the producers basically saying 'Well, if we make the exact same movie again then we don't have to think up anything new and the audiences will be happy because they're seeing the same movie all over again that they could easily watch at home but this time they have to give us money for it...Genius!' That's what this movie feels like, it's lazy on the part of the writers and producers to make this movie because they already had the movie made for them once before, all they had to do was copy and paste. Yeah, there is a few different scenes and songs scattered around but they either stick out like a sore thumb or don't make any difference to the overall story anyways so it became pointless. This whole remake's existence is pointless because it's already been done before and done way better. It's a manufactured, lifeless product rather than an endearing and magical love story like before.I love the original, I really do. And I can see why people would like this movie; like I said before, it's not a bad film, I just have a problem with studios being so lazy that they don't even bother taking the time to come up with a new or different adaptation of the material. They'd rather ride the success of the original movie by doing the same thing again, and it worked. And I understand that this is completely subjective, so if that doesn't bother you then fine. Personally, I'm under the opinion that if a remake isn't doing something in order to justify its reasons for existing then it's pointless. If a remake is only going to do exactly what the original movie did then I'll just watch the original instead. Now if this movie tried putting a different spin on things, or expanded much more on the characters, maybe taking a unique direction, changing things up in the story that possibly could play on expectations; then I would see a reason for this movie being made, however as it is, it's a lesser and longer version of a classic Disney masterpiece. I know that I've been extremely harsh on the movie, but the movie itself really is fine. Technically speaking, there isn't that much about it that's necessarily bad. Emma Watson does fine in the role of Belle, although I don't think she has a particularly strong singing voice. Dan Stevens I already just naturally like, he has a good on screen presence in about everything I've seen him in and he does well as the Beast. Kevin Kline I always love to see in movies, besides 'Bob's Burgers' I don't get to see him in much so I'm glad that he played Maurice since he can balance kooky and lovable so easily. Luke Evans and Josh Gad as Gaston and LeFou were pretty great actually. They were a big reason why I laughed as much as I did while watching the movie. Moving on. The songs from the original are still catchy and charming, the new songs I honestly can't remember what they sounded like; I remember where they pop up in the story, but not so much their melodies or lyrics...so I guess they're...fine? Maybe? The movie looks very pretty; the set designs and costumes are visually interesting, the special effects are mainly done well, and there are some decently shot sequences. So I say if you end up watching this, you'll probably have a good time with it and it's fine to show to your kids for sure. If and when I have kids though, the remake won't be the first thing I show them. It will be the animated film and the remake will probably never make it into my movie collection so...woops...I guess they won't get the privilege of seeing that one...oh no",5,1,4,17 May 2017
Sicario," One of the most chilling films of the year...
","'Sicario': This wasn't even a horror movie and I know that I'm probably going to have nightmares from this for the rest of my life. 'Sicario' is the story about an FBI agent who joins a small group in attempts to put an end to a drug lord in Mexico. The intensity from its bleak tone is spine tingling, unafraid in going into the sheer depths of what true evil humanity is capable of. There are scenes in this movie where it is almost a descent into hell. That is how it is shot and how the score is playing over the select sum of scenes where that's the mood it is presenting. I feel sick to my stomach because this was a truly great film that dragged me into a pit of corpses. The opening scene deals with an entire house filled with dead bodies stored inside the walls, rotting away. At any moment someone could get shot in the back of the head like it was any normal daily routine, at least that is the mood that is set here. To the point where I wondered if I was going to get shot because of this movie. This is as dark as it gets; this isn't a straight up action film or thriller, but it is a blend of the two while bringing in a mystery to it as well that is actually compelling which is something that has become very rare nowadays, in my opinion. Everything about this movie worked; the direction was bleak and moody, the cinematography was gorgeous, the soundtrack was haunting I'm not kidding when I say that my heart was on the verge of a panic attack because of the musical score alone. The acting was great; Benicio Del Toro was full on intimidating in this, but while at the same time not being a two dimensional character. Del Toro's character is shady and mysterious at first, which is what drew me in and the movie could have not said another word about his back story and I still would have felt threatened by him. But when it doesmy goodnessthis is some real darkness going on. Emily Blunt's character, Kate, is easy enough to route for, but at times I wondered exactly what her purpose was to the plot for a small portion of the film. However, it did explain a few things making a lot more sense as to why she is there. Josh Brolin his also having some fun as this equal parts laid back hard a-- agent. Every character in this feels three dimensional, even when not much is learned about someone they still feel real. But this movie does take the time out to even show a minor character's living situation; we see the ins and outs of his daily life. In any other film he'd probably only be in one scene, but this movie has him and his family come in and out through the whole movie. This was a great piece of film making that scared me half to death. I thought that it was amazing and if you haven't seen it, see it. I'm gonna go take a breath or two",9,1,3,21 December 2015
Mother!," Extremely subjective. Obviously controversial. I dug it.
","Going from the most accepted horror film of the year to one of the most controversial. I completely understand why people wouldn't like this film, me personally however I immensely enjoyed this bit of chaos on screen. Simultaneously being a throwback to the early days of psychological horror like with works of Roman Polanski while also being an allegory to multiple biblical stories, all wrapped inside a plot about a woman suffering from anxiety while countless numbers of strangers enter her home. Mother! goes from zero to oblivion and it is awesome. Give it a shot if this interests you at all.",9,0,2,3 January 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A jumbled mess that had so much potential...you know? Like most Zack Snyder films!
","The film starts off with a recap of Batman's origin story as an opening credit sequence, which was fine to be honest. Well until it gets surreal having childhood Bruce Wayne being lifted up by hundreds of bats...thanks Snyder for the first of many dream sequences in this movie. After that it immediately cuts to the events that occurred at the end of 'Man of Steel' with Metropolis being destroyed, only from Bruce Wayne's perspective. Nothing connecting the dots between him being a child and the attack, it just assumes that everyone knows who Batman. So anyone unfamiliar will probably think that Superman is the reason Batman probably exists...which wouldn't be too far-fetched, but still. After the pretty explosions, it cuts again a year and a half later to Lois Lane getting captured in the desert and saved by Supes...he kills a man...yeah, remember that that little thing that 'Man of Steel' sprung up at the last minute with Superman being so upset that he took a life? Well now he just doesn't care. First thing he does in this movie is charges into a man at full speed and busts him through several cement walls. He's dead. From there the story gets convoluted. There's a plot line with Lois Lane that really has no effect on the overall story, could have been cut. Lex Luthor has it out for Superman, so he gets his hands on a big rock of Kryptonite and is trying to get the approval of the government to weaponize it. That's a thing for about ten minutes until he decides to blow up congress and frame Supes for it. Batman is trying to get his hands on the Kryptonite so he can weaponize it himself because he doesn't trust Superman. While that's going on, Superman is busy with explosions and floods throughout the entire world that it just now dawned on me...how does he have any time off? Does he just ignore or the death and mayhem so that he can pretend to be a journalist? And when he's a journalist he's clearly not a very good one since his boss is constantly telling him that he's in the sports section, yet Clark keeps writing his articles about Batman in Gotham City, for no other reason than because the title is 'Batman v. Superman'.I have to touch on something that will probably enrage the hardcore comic book fans of Batman...Batman kills people, and I don't mind in the slightest. And I don't mean that he does it by accident; no, I mean he straight up murders the baddies.In the third act Superman gets his mother kidnapped by Lex Luthor. So instead of looking for her, he bows down to Luthor's orders to kill the Bat. Revealing that Luthor was behind all the letters that Wayne was getting that influence him to hate Superman more. So I guess Luthor knows who Batman is? So Superman goes to Batman for help, but of course it's a Zack Snyder film so there's not going to be any characters having a real conversation here. So they fight, for about five minutes and then they're the best of friends because their moms have the same name...yep. So they team up, fight a CGI monster and cause so much property damage with the help of Wonder Woman. Oh yeah, that was another subplot that the script was juggling so they could shoehorn in some Easter eggs for the Justice League. So they fight. And fight. Things blow up. The 'epic music' is blaring. More explosions. Superman sacrifices himself in order to stop all the CGI from consuming the screen. And I have no emotional attachment to his death whatsoever. I really couldn't care less and that is probably the biggest insult this film gives. This is a guy I have watched two whole films now and I don't even know him. There is nothing more to him other than he's Superman. No personality lies beneath the suit, no life to him. Just a body to hold up fists. And we all know that he's not really dead. At the very end after giving even more crammed in exposition about forming the Justice League, it's seen that there's proof that he still lives. Pointless.This was a huge disappointment; other than showing some potential for a solo Batman film with Ben Affleck, this was awful. I had my concerns going in, but I was still optimistic about there being a really fun and cool Superman/Batman movie again. Many people say that it's best to set your expectations and standards low so that a film may have an easier time surpassing them and the viewer may come out having a better time with the film. I don't believe in that, I feel that a person should go into a film expecting to have a good time, we should be entertained or even be made to think afterward. A movie should never get a free pass in being given a low bar to reach in order to be considered a 'good' movie. A film should be good on its own merits and nothing more. This was not a good movie and I won't set my standards lower so it can be called good. This was a train wreck in almost every way that 'Man of Steel' was, if not more so. I'm sure that no matter what though, everyone will go to see it and it will collect its fan base just as 'Man of Steel' did. So if you walk out of this film loving it, I don't blame you and I probably get why. But for me, I need a lot more substance than style in order to have a good time.",4,21,36,30 March 2016
Deadpool," A great way to spend Valentine's Day!
","Going into this film, while excited I was also honestly a little hesitant. Largely because of the marketing giving the impression that the 'Deadpool' movie was to right the wrongs that 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' had done to the character. Any time I hear a film attempting to 'correct the wrongs' of a predecessor we receive movies like 'Exorcist II: The Heretic' or 'Batman & Robin'. What I'm saying is that it usually doesn't work out very well. I was worried that the fourth wall humor would get stale or annoying. Or maybe the story would be too standard to be entertaining. The moment the opening credits hit the screen, all my doubts were put to rest.After thinking hard about it now, I can confidently say that I love the hell out of this movie. So much so that it possibly rivals what has been my favorite Marvel movie for the last couple years, 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. The comedy is gold, from the hilarious opening credit sequence to the ending credit sequence I was pretty consistently laughing. The action is pretty fun and creative and gorges itself in the hard 'R' rating. The references and cameos were fantastic. The fourth wall breaking actually worked extremely well and was one of the highlights of the whole movie. Ryan Reynolds loves every second he is playing this character; you can just tell that he is giving this role all of his energy and love. Last year he was in a movie called 'The Voices', also a very good movie but is not the same as this; much darker but still very funny as well as intense. After I saw that movie I was saying how I hope that Reynolds will finally get his comeback movie and not keep getting handed bomb after bomb, it took a year but I believe that it finally happened. He's in a great movie that is actually going over very well with the audience it seems. I'm not really going to delve too deep into the story, not because I think it's going to be chalk full of surprises for anyone who sees it. I think that most can probably guess what's going to happen because it's a simple story. That isn't an insult to the film at all, actually it's a compliment. It's nice seeing a Marvel movie breaking down to a basic revenge film instead of having to save the world in some grand and epic way. While I'm not saying that it's necessarily a bad thing when an 'X-Men' or 'Avengers' film does that, I'm only saying that it's nice to see one of the comic movies break away from that formula is all.The film is about Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) who meets a girl (Morena Baccarin), falls in love and after a while he finds out he has cancer. Attempting to spare his fiancé any problems, he runs off without a word and joins this secret experiment that is promised to rid him of the cancer and even give him additional abilities. Things don't quite go as planned, causing Wade to take on the title 'Deadpool' after being hideously deformed by the mad scientists involved, so he may exact his revenge and save his fiancé. Basic origin story, doesn't need a 'world destruction and must stop it from happening' plot line. There's no 'fish out of water' thing going on. There is one smart ass of a character that just wants revenge and to be with his fiancé again while not looking like hamburger meat. Everything in this movie works. The relationship between Wade and his fiancé was a lot of fun and I actually felt invested in them. Even the villain, who was played by the man that took on the last 'Transporter' installment for its lead, Ed Skrein. I thought he was terrible and extremely bland in that movie, but in this he actually was some fun to watch and posed an actual threat to the hero without be too 'stock'. For some reason these characters easily grew on me and it didn't take me out or detach any emotional investment whenever the fourth wall was broken. Which can be a very hard and tricky thing to do, but this film does it flawlessly in my eyes.I thought that this was a blast and I would love if I could see it again. I say bring the whole family! But that's because I grew up on 'RoboCop' and 'Friday the 13th' as a kid, although there wasn't a pegging scene in any of those movies...well anyways, if you like hard 'R' action, Ryan Reynolds and 'Wham!' on the soundtrack then you'll probably get a kick out of this movie.",9,2,11,13 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Do you like action and absurd spy films? Well than this is perfect for you! It was for me.
","'Kingsman: The Secret Service': To describe this movie in one word, the word would undoubtedly have to be 'cool'. This movie drools cool from its characters to its violence to its style to its camera work, this was bloody and awesome! I've been a pretty big fan of this director since 2011 when I first saw a film of his, which was 'X- Men: First Class'. I dug the hell out of that flick, I thought that it was a real fun time in the theater and is still possibly my favorite X-Men flick to date. Then I finally got around to checking out his movie 'Kick-Ass', which in my opinion is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time, right next to Tim Burton's 'Batman', Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight', and the Richard Donner 'Superman' films. This movie deserves a place as one of the great spy films to go alongside something like the James Bond franchise. It shows a real love for those movies, particularly in the Roger Moore era, but does its own thing with the genre, plus being creative in how brutal and violent one single frame can get. It is amazing to watch every action sequence happen in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson had me laughing my ass off with him as the villain while simultaneously being fairly unique and intense in his character's own right. For a brief time in the movie I didn't quite understand what his motivation was for his ultimate plans, but once it got to the explanation I was right on board. Not that I ever got off board necessarily, it was just something that popped in my mind occasionally is all. All the characters in the film are a blast to watch in their own ways; Colin Firth commands every scene that he is in with his suave attitude and great talent for taking out an entire room of bad guys all on his own. The lead character 'Eggsy', played by Taron Egerton, a young guy who seems to be pretty early in his career really does an outstanding job in his role here. He remains likable and completely believable in his action sequences, never once faltering where the character could easily fallen into being relatively annoying if played by a lesser actor. But he keeps the character feel real, someone I can route for and interesting to watch. I like the quirky touches that Matthew Vaughn brings to his films, they don't ever seem quite conventional yet they don't come across as too out of the realm of comprehension either. His films know how to have fun and can also hold a real sense of danger too. 'First Class' had fun playing with its time and setting, but still dealt with themes of prejudice and nuclear war. 'Kick Ass' had fun with its comic book style with bringing that over-the-top world into a somehow extremely grounded and extremely gritty reality. And now 'Kingsman' with the mystery, highly stylized silly action and spy gadgets while also threats of mass genocide from the villain. One of the best spy and action films I've seen in a while; if you are a fan of the spy genre and action in general then this may be right up your ally.",9,2,7,9 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Best action film I've seen in oh so long...oh so good!
","'Mad Max: Fury Road': This was my absolute, most anticipated film for the entire year. And to just get this immediately out of the way, this film did not in any single way whatsoever disappoint me. It has been days since I've seen the film and I'm still pumped about it. 'Fury Road' is a masterpiece. That is exactly what it is and there is not another word that describes it any better. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word in terms of action, concept, writing, character, style, effects, acting, sheer filmmaking. I grew up knowing of the 'Mad Max' franchise but I didn't really grow up with it other than the glimpses I had gotten and the few scenes I caught on television as a kid. Not until I got into my late teens that I caught the first Mad Max movie on TV one night and I liked it, but it wasn't until the second viewing a few years later that I fell in love with it. It was something that for some reason or another went over my head the first go around, but when it finally clicked I went straight into watching the second film 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior'. At the time I was determined to not let the second film one go over my head like its predecessor, and I fell for 'Road Warrior' right away. To me, the first two movies are some of the greatest action films of all time; although that is pretty commonly said about 'Road Warrior', the original I think is pretty underrated. Now, 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome' I honestly don't like much at all. There's really no hate that I have for 'Thunderdome', but there not a whole lot for me to enjoy about it either. Mel Gibson is still good in the role and that's about it. Then when I came across the rumor of 'Fury Road', at first I was a little skeptical but once I saw a trailer and some still images, any skepticism I previously had completely subsided and was replaced with excitement. If this film ended up being bad, you have no idea how depressed I would be. The fact that this actually somehow exceeded my expectations is beyond comprehension. 'Thunderdome' wishes it could have been this. For a film being in production hell for 30 years, this was an unbelievable achievement in film history. Probably because it had a genius like George Miller behind it; creating the entire story solely out of storyboards alone. Which makes this film such a rich experience; it's as if I was watching a silent film at times. Every shot was completely stunning. Any time the movie took a breath, it was still so beautifully constructed that I could put the film on mute and still get an emotional response. Although I will say that the musical score was just as beautifully composed and added even more to the performances on screen. There is not a boring moment throughout any of the running time. There is not a dull character that comes into play. There is not a bad stunt or special effect thrown in during any of the action. It is as close to flawless as humanly possible. I will say that it was slightly sad not seeing Mel Gibson in the role anymore, but Tom Hardy nails everything about Max Rockatansky. That is the most negative comment I could say about the whole thing, and I don't even think that even comes close to counting as a knock against the movie, actually in a way is a compliment to a talented actor. He felt like the same character, but has naturally progressed into more of a primal being than before. For the first half of the film he doesn't even really speak, he grunts. This was awesome just to watch him sort of mumble and grunt to himself and some of the other characters. But I loved that the film still remembers the first 'Mad Max', being haunted by the death of his family. It went into that territory just enough that it supplied me the character development for Max that felt satisfactory and justified the movie to remain as action packed without feeling as though there were no one worth routing. As much as this is Max's movie, it is equally Furiosa's too, played by Charlize Theron. Oh god she did fantastic in this; embodying exactly what Miller said to be, the 'Female Road Warrior'. In anyone else's hands, could have gone horribly wrong, but it doesn't. She is fierce while also heartbreaking. Furiosa deserves as much credit for making this film work as Max does, if not more so in some aspects. Lastly, I just want to go over the villain real quick. Entering the frame, it was as if seeing the next Darth Vader pop on screen. Immortan Joe holds such a presence that I thought I was gonna s**t my pants! So now that I have gone on and on about this movie, this is a must see for the summer. For the year. For the decade. A straight up 'must see', period. I loved this movie. It's pretty obvious that most everyone who has seen this film loves it. I do not want this to be the next 'Dredd' film. Or 'Edge of Tomorrow' where it is an absolute great film that gets screwed in the box office and never gets another chance to expand its universe with a sequel. This is one of the greatest action films of all time right next to the first two Mad Max films in cinema history. Please go out and watch this. I am begging you, if I don't get a sequel to this then I am going to go on a killing rampage...I mean, I will be very sad. Seriously though, was fantastic and I hope to see more of Max's, and even Furiosa's, story in the future.",10,4,10,9 January 2016
The Martian," Like everyone else has already said...it's Scott's best in a few years now.
","'The Martian': This was one I wanted to see in the theater because I'm a pretty big Ridley Scott fan, unfortunately never got the opportunity; like most people who got into sci-fi, I can thank Scott for that since he's contributed so much to the genre. I won't claim that this movie is his next big contribution to the sci-fi genre that will change things forever like his past films 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner', but this is pretty good. I thought that this was a good time, I don't know if it needed to be two and a half hours long; when it comes to the length of a movie I would kind of prefer that if a science fiction flick has a runtime over two hours long that it be a little more innovative or provocative than something like this, but it was consistently entertaining so I can totally give it a pass for that.I don't really want to get much into the story because the plot is pretty simple, rather not spoil what happens. If you have seen the trailers then it's pretty easy to gather what the movie is about; Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stranded on Mars with very limited amounts of food and somehow has to find ways to survive alone with all these extreme scenarios happening to him until a rescue team hopefully makes it to him in time. This isn't Scott's typical dark sci-fi film though; I mean yes, you can tell he's in the director's chair but this is a bit brighter and a lot more of an optimistic film in comparison to the rest of his filmography. I say more optimistic because the lead character that is stuck on Mars, Mark Watney, stays completely positive for most of the obstacles that come. He does have his occasional moments of despair and even anger, but he keeps his chin up so he can solve the problem and move on so he can survive. It would be so easy to make this character such a downer; not doing much except brooding, which is understandable for the awful situation dealt to this character, but they don't do that and it makes this character a bit of a stand out and more interesting. Makes me like the character easier than if the writing had gone the other route to darken up his character instead because of how his whole being stranded situation starts almost from the very beginning. If he wasn't as likable as he was, then this movie could have been a long drag to watch someone to brood instead of being proactive like he ended up being. Not much else to say really; the acting was really good, the writing was solid, the direction and cinematography were of course great and I was entertained and invested the whole time. I liked it. I don't know if I would say 'best of the year' like it seems some of the nominations from the various award ceremonies this year are announcing, but I still think it was a really good movie. This was a movie about hope, keeping a positive attitude in harsh times and being as proactive as humanly possiblethis was the anti-'War Room' movie. If you've seen 'War Room' then you might know what I'm talking about here, just think about it for a second. 'War Room' when things get tough it tells you to sit in a closet, don't do anything productive except submit to your verbally abusive husband and pray about him because God will step in to take all of your problems away. Here, he doesn't just sit and wait for something hopefully good to happen or for NASA to rectify the situation. He does what he can, almost right away, to survive and improve on his bad situation. I know they are completely different scenarios, but the message is still the same. Do something yourself if you want things to change for the better, don't expect others to always do it for you. So go see this movie, it is pretty friggin' good!",8,4,7,9 January 2016
