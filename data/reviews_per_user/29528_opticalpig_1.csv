First Man," Really?!?
","Well....I would start by saying I'm not a fan of shaky cam movies. Not sure why that's supposed to feel 'more real'?!? To me it just feels like bad cinematography. But I apparently won't win that critique...
Next... boring boring boring.
I fail to believe that Neil Armstrong was that emotionless and depressed acting. If he was... then don't make a movie about him.
Third.... I go to the 'movies' to be entertained. If I wanted a documentary I'd go see a documentary. This was an attempt to make a film that seemed so realistic to real life that it was as boring as real life. Movies SHOULD embellish real life a bit so I laugh, cry, tense up, and walk out feeling entertained. This didn't do that at all.
And that music.... it should be illegal as it could drive someone who is suicidal over the edge. The ending... well it will definitely rank right up there in the top ten worst.
I guess I'll give the actors some credit for good performances... but even that is negligible considering no one actually did anything except stare and mumble. Oh yeah... and the mumbling.. half the movie I couldn't understand what someone just said.
And I have to mention this... was this Hollywood's way of belittling something that, although it was a massive taxpayer expenditure, they truly minimized how the people of the United States felt at that moment. I was 12. I don't believe there has been a moment in this country's history when I remember us feeling so united in one single peaceful accomplishment. We ALL remember right where we were at that moment. Contrary to this 'movie's' depiction of it... we were proud and touched by the courage of the astronauts.
So....
Pretty please.... don't make another movie like this!!!???
If I'd have paid to see this at the theater...i just might have asked for my money back.",2,3,5,14 February 2019
