The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great movie
","I loved this movie. It is clearly for intelligent people and not for those who can only get something out of mindless action movies. The book is wonderful as well. Redford did a great job. J. Michael Moncrief who played Hardy Greaves was incredible. He will most certainly be a star. This was his first movie role and he is from a small town near Savannah. If you are an intelligent person, you will like this movie. If you are mindless, you won't.",10,0,1,21 November 2000
