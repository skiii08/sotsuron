50 First Dates," breath of fresh air... in a weird way
","50 First Dates is a very entertaining movie. I was surprised that it actually had a storyline! I thought it was going to be some fun gag movie by Sandler but obviously, it proved wrong.What I like about this film is the way comedy was infused with more 'serious' issues like brain damage and commitment. Bottom line, it was a great movie. The Sandler-Barrymore team-up works, and Schneider, as always, is a fantastic addition to this film. And ahem, Sean Astin. Last movie I saw with him parading his muscles was in Memphis Belle. Funny cast. Great music/soundtrack.Although the storyline has a fairy-tale-like approach, it makes you believe in something you don't see everyday... Feel good film, all in all I give it a 8/10.",9,0,0,18 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Better the second time around.
","When I first saw this, it was boring and long. But Johnny Depp rules. The second time I watched Pirates of the Caribbean, it was better. And Johnny Depp rocks.The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been  more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story.All in all, wonderful effects, brilliant dialogue... good movie. It is Disney. What a change.",10,1,3,26 December 2003
Beauty and the Beast," fascinating
","Beauty & The Beast is one of the most memorable Disney films of all time. the wonderful songs that makes you want to sing along is enthralling. a truly magical movie for everyone, young and old. the romantic tale of two people learning to love each other no matter how they look like. simply wonderful.",10,0,0,1 May 2000
Lost in Translation," nice little indie film
","But believe me, NOTHING SPECIAL. Bill Murray plays his most decent role yet although I found him funnier in his Ghostbusters days.Sofia Coppola is 'i want to be like daddy so i want to have a camera' kind of person. But one way or another, she excels in it. But not that much. I've seen movies with so much more substance than this film. Bravo because it's an independent film and it can stand on its own. Boo because critics praise this little movie too much. It's boring often times, the story is good enough but all these praises? Too bloody much.I hope Return of the King wins. I'm so sick of top award shows giving awards to these kinds of films. Hopefully they'll do something 'dramatic' like last years winner, Chicago.",1,1,4,31 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," yes... it's back!!!
","what can i say, Episode 2 Attack of the Clones is well worth it. the amazing special effects can really take you away. and a bit of love story never hurts. although the love story is somewhat cheesy and overly old fashioned and an absolute 'aww', you can really feel the chemistry and the emotion that young Anakin Skywalker is feeling... which leads him to the dark side!!the actors simply shine in this film, especially Hayden Christensen. but the best of all is Yoda. he is simply amazing, you're just going to laugh along the audience when he does his moves. truly, not something to be missed. makes me want to buy a light saber of my own.i cannot wait for episode 3. episode 2 fulfilled everything die hard fans of Star Wars wanted. George Lucas is a hero!",8,1,2,23 May 2002
Cold Mountain," cold film
","Someone wants her Oscar badly. The film itself is horrible. Ok, I may be biased because I hate these kinds of films. Drama. Lukewarm romance. Annoying actresses. What else is new?What's amazing in this film is Jude Law. Nothing more. Oh yes, and how they were able to get Renee Zellweger to do this movie. And well... the story is great. Several notable moments but all in all, this is a dull film. Thank god I just saw this at my friend's house. Paying for the movie ticket would be a crime.",1,16,32,31 December 2003
The Shining," one hell of a movie
","The Shining is one scary movie. But you will be more surprised and 'suspensed' if you see it, haven't read the book, and if you do not know a THING about the story/movie. It happened to me, anyway! There I was, at the edge of my seat anticipating and expecting every move they're making will be freaky.The great thing about this movie is that it makes you imagine all sorts of things and makes you expect 'scary stuff'. Anyway, Jack Nicholson one scary actor in this movie. He fits in his role like a glove, complete with his haunting eyebrows. Shelley Duvall, I must say is a great surprise. From watching too many Fairy Tale Theater, I didn't know she could look really scared! Stanley Kubrick is a scary genius. And that's from only one view point since I have yet seen his other movies. We can never tell what goes on his mind... The Shining is a great movie, take you friends and family to watch this Classic and make sure to dim the lights.",9,0,0,10 May 2002
American Beauty," a disturbing comedy
","American Beauty deserves pretty much all the awards it garnered, especially the award for Kevin Spacey!The film itself, for me, is disturbing yet in a weird way comical. Dark comedy, if you must. The cinematography is also terrific. It depicts the mood of the characters so well. All in all, this is a very good movie. With lessons learned too, to live life at the fullest, because the only time you might realize how important life is is when it's too late.But the ending got me depressed. Sad, indeed. 8.5/10. 1 point deducted for the absolutely depressing ending...",9,0,0,26 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," finally, a Harry Potter film with sense!
","I am a Harry Potter book fan. And I also loved the first two movies. But the problem with the first two movies was that it was too detailed. I don't mind scriptwriters butchering a novel just as long as its justified. And this Harry Potter is a perfect example.It's a longer book, but Alfonso Cuaron has managed to cut it in 2 hours (and something minutes) with such beauty. While watching the film, I thought I was viewing a 'computer-graphics-infused art film'. Cinematography was brilliant. I wouldn't say Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a masterpiece, but it has shed it's child-like 'commercialized' coating found on the first movie. Definitely a great improvement. It's darker, has more sense than the first two movies and definitely a feast for the eyes. And you have to admit, it's funnier!!!!The only problem is will the next director succeed in Mr. Cuaron's version of Harry Potter? Hopefully, it would meet the fans (especially MY) expectations :D (spoiler) One negative note is that there's too much chopping of scenes in the last part. I was extremely disappointed that they also left out the Quidditch championship. But in all, it was a good entertaining movie.Characters: They are such beautiful people. Great casting. This is what makes Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stand out. The cast. Daniel Radcliffe has shown much growth in his acting. Compare his acting from Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone, and you'll see what I mean. Maggie Smith's role was minimal. More on Snape, Lupin and Sirius.",9,0,0,11 June 2004
The Princess Bride," a movie to cherish forever
","this is one movie that i will cherish forever. it has every little bit of everything. a few 'action' and some 'suspense' filled scenes that makes your heart go wild. and of course, a truly romantic scene no one will forget.this is one movie you just can't ignore. a fairy tale-like film with very modern and tasteful ideas. and as they said, it is absolutely inconceivable not to watch it.",10,0,0,25 April 2000
Moulin Rouge!," absolutely one of the best films of 2001!
","Moulin Rouge! is breath-taking and a wonderful film. It's been a long time since I saw any good musicals in the films (the last one was Evita).
It's a stylish piece of art, and a movie that you will treasure. The witty medley of famous songs of all time and the brilliant costumes, choreography, settings... EVERYTHING about it! truly a gem of a film.",10,0,1,30 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," it's the actors that stand out!
","first of all, a warm of applause for Christ Columbus for trying his very best to be faithful as possible to the book.Now for the comments: I understood that it is obvious that some scenes might be cut or added on the movie if it's a book. There were several characters, scenes and minor whatsits not included in the film. For example is the Potions scene where Hermione amazingly answer the logic riddle. Peeves, an important character to take part of the mischief of Harry Potter. and who knows what else. I've only seen it once, but I'm pretty sure there are more scenes missing.But the best part of this film is the actors. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are brilliant and perfect to fit their parts. They are all adorable and they hold their characters with pride! Same goes with the other characters of the film, (I'm getting tired of typing their names, so sorry!) they are all wonderful!All in all, I'd still give this movie a 9.5/10. yes, there were slight 'imperfections' and others but I enjoyed the movie. seeing it FINALLY on the big screen (after months and months of anticipation), having full view of the Quidditch scene (yeah!), and experiencing the real magic. Although my imagination as I read books will never fade, it's nice to see a close-enough adaptation of a wonderful book. Cheers!!",10,0,0,2 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," BRILLIANT.
","The Return of the King is a magnificent movie, all on its own. Peter Jackson is a brilliant director. How he managed to put all of Tolkien's words into the screen is wonderful. I actually finished the Lord of the Rings books (including the Hobbit) 3 years ago. It was painstakingly difficult to read through intricate descriptions and words but all in all, it was a good (though some parts were snoozeville) read.And the movie is even better than the books. Great movie with great actors... truly a film to be remembered. Way cool.",10,1,1,26 December 2003
The Truman Show," jim carrey at his best!
","this is not the usual jim carrey that you expect. by watching this movie, you can really tell that he is a great actor. from being disgustingly funny to kinda serious.i honestly don't like the idea that you are being watched 24 hours by people you don't know. and realizing that the world you know is actually the largest soundstage. or so the story tells! this is like EdTv but much and positively better.jim carrey deserves an Oscar nomination, although knowing how snobs the Oscars could be. definitely a 10 for the cast and the movie.",8,0,0,11 November 2000
The Matrix," there is no spoon
","the amazing special effects and the wonderful acting of the cast was unbelievable. truly, this is one of the movies that i will never forget. such remarkable scenes, not to mention the clear story line and dialogue.there were so many things unexplainable, but like in the movie, being the one is like being in love. you don't know it, but you feel it. i don't know how to describe such an amazing movie, but i feel the impact it has affected me.what is reality? what is the dream world? work with your mind. you will soon find it.",10,0,0,1 May 2000
The Breakfast Club," definitely number 1
","this movie is probably the best of the 80s. it had so many memorable scenes by the brat packers. judd nelson did a wonderful immitation of what goes on at anthony michael hall's family. there were lots  of scenes that opened my eyes. some made me cry, some made me fall over laughing.
molly ringwald, emilio estevez and ally sheedy shone once more in this cult 80s classic. definitely a movie not the be missed by anyone.",10,1,3,2 June 2000
The Wedding Singer," the most normal Adam Sandler movie
","i found this movie incredibly entertaining! this is probably the best Adam Sandler film i've ever watched. but huge fans of Sandler would probably be disappointed because there is no gross or wild comedy in here. clean fun!and 10 brownie points for the music. eighties music never looked so good! this is a very good movie with sweet comedic scenes. and yes, Adam Sandler singing his lungs out. i absolutely recommend watching it for a good time!",9,1,1,18 July 2002
The Godfather," a classic!
","I am a teenager, and i never thought of finding The Godfather so interesting! It shows a vivid and perfect example of the words Classic and Timeless in a movie. The Godfather takes you to different heights with each scene, directed of course, by Francis Ford Coppola.Marlon Brando plays one of his funniest (for me, anyway) and greatest role. Al Pacino is another worth mentioning, the acting and the presentation of both actors are some of the key success of the Godfather. Having seen the movie, makes me want to pick up the book! If you need a break from all the recent 'typical movies', then watch The Godfather.",1,8,49,10 May 2002
